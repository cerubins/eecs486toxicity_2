 I still wonder as to why Enzo Fernandez decided moving to Chelsea was a good idea. It absolutely befuddles me.  Just look at his career. After being a wonder boy at River Plate, he has the possibility to go to Europe, and makes the good decision to move to Benfica. With some European clubs in for him, he chooses the right club that will give him lots of playing time and help foster his development into Europe.  He wastes no time and does amazing, helping Benfica push for the title and qualify first in their CL group, ahead of PSG and Juventus. His decision to go to Benfica was a great one, as his playing time and ability to seamlessly enter their squad helps the decision to bring him to the World Cup.  The World Cup comes around, and he absolutely smashes it when given the chance to play. He deservedly wins the Young Player of the Tournament and ends up winning the most prized competition. At this point, he certainly has a bright future ahead in club football.  Coming back to Benfica, where the club is doing well, has an easy RO16 opponent, and where he has been for 6 months. And he decides that the very first club that is willing to buy him, Chelsea, is where he wants to go. He feels the need to leave ASAP, to where it almost seems like he dislikes Benfica. Even when Benfica have an option to sign for Chelsea in the summer with the exact same 8 year contract to set him up for life, he still somehow thinks he needs to go to Chelsea right there. Chelsea were in a rough battle for a European spot, let alone a CL place. Enzo also was all but guaranteed to go to any club he‚Äôd like in the summer, as his quality was obvious, and Benfica are literally always willing to sell their young talents. And now, Benfica are still doing well as favorites for the title, and a genuinely possible chance to make the CL final. Chelsea‚Äôs manager is already gone and even making any European competition looks very tough.  Throughout all this, I really cannot believe why Enzo didn‚Äôt wait. Money? He‚Äôs basically guaranteed to get big contracts and a big career in the future. He also could have signed the deal with Chelsea and yet still just finish the season, or wait until the summer. Did he think Chelsea were guaranteed to qualify for CL and felt they would have a better season than Benfica? Did he just hate living in Lisbon?   Of course, there is still a lot of time for him to have success at Chelsea, but if not, he‚Äôll of course try and push his way out like he did at Benfica. Plus there‚Äôs the fact that his move may end up hampering his ability if he doesn‚Äôt get a functional team in place. Ultimately though, I‚Äôd just love to know what Enzo was actually thinking when he made that move, and what he‚Äôs thinking now.

Saying this again.   Bellingham to Madrid was just a fan fiction created by some journos and then fans started riding on it.

Because of third party ownership it was a really weird transfer that I still don't quite understand. From what I do understand Tevez was under joint ownership from West Ham and MSI (Media Sport investment.)  MSI were a third party ownership group who wanted the transfer from West Ham to United to go through but West Ham didn't think the fee was high enough until West Ham and MSI reached an agreement. I've seen Wikipedia list it as a loan from West Ham although it felt more like a loan from MSI.

Football history probably has something to do with it. With England vs Scotland being the first ever FIFA recognised international game in 1872.

We're not regions of a country, we're countries in a union.  But anyway, England & Scotland were the countries to play international football so it predates UEFA/FIFA.

Knowing how several players have done it in the past, I wouldn't be shocked if Chelsea paying the full 120M clause played a role. That made him River's biggest ever sale by FAR with the 25% fee, and he's a River lad through and through. Not enough to make the choice by itself, but surely played a role, especially with how he left in a sour note (leaving because of an elimination in which he played poorly)   Gonzalo Martinez also went to a worse team because they paid River more, players like Juli√°n and Montiel renewed just so the club would get fees, Borr√© negotiated extra signing fees and donated it all to River as "payment" for leaving on a Bosman... It's happened a lot before

The reason why many Brazilian footballers come from poverty is because football is their only option. They have to make it work for themselves and for their families.

I think the point of people saying that is that a player is never more important than the club. In that a decision/action that benefits the club more should always be made over a decision/action that benefits a player, regardless of how good he is.

Obviously there are some players that are more famous and successful than some clubs

Honestly I'm pretty happy with him so far. River Plate is currently 1st in the league and we not only didn't lose but we didn't even concede a single goal for the entirety of March, which was great.  We lost the opening game of the Copa Libertadores group stage the other day 1- 3, which is not great, but it was in La Paz (Bolivia) in a stadium that sits at 3500 meters above sea level, which makes it extremely hard for a lot of players because the air is incredibly thin. Our starting CF said after the game he felt dizzy the whole time. In fact we haven't won a game there since like 1970, so shitting on him for that would be exaggerated in my opinion.  He is clearly very serious and professional which I like and goes along very well with the club philosophy. His next challenges right now are the upcoming Copa Libertadores games, we should realistically win both games against Sporting Cristal (Peru), the home game against The Strongest (the Bolivian team against which we lost the away game in La Paz), and the home game against Fluminense (Brazil). The away game against Fluminense would be excellent and I think it's doable, but certainly hard.  Apart from that, he's going to be getting a ton of pressure from fans and the press to make Claudio Echeverri debut for the first team. He's a 17 year old kid from the academy who's currently putting an otherwordly performance at the u17 South American Championship, arguably the biggest promise in years. They were planning on his debut to be in the second half of the year, but after this we have to accept he's probably not going to last long at all at the club so he should make his professional debut ASAP. If he leaves without having played a single minute of professional football at River Plate it would be unacceptable.

The wealth argument doesn‚Äôt make much sense to me because Benfica president Rui Costa said he could have signed for literally the same offer and still just finish the season with Benfica.

Oh yeah that‚Äôs not in question, Flick was a big reason why Bayern won the sextuple, and Chelsea might as well not have had a manager when they won their CL. I am curious as to how his career will go if he ends up failing at the Euros again. At that point it would be a huge embarrassment

So when Great Britain is the figure in said sport, who would Northern Irish people be allowed to represent? Do they join GB or Ireland? I dont know much ab this topic

I‚Äôm not sure who owns his image rights tbh. Plenty of players are happy enough to sign over their image rights to their clubs but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he has kept a percentage (or all) of his looking at how favourable other terms of his contract seems to be.
 Non-Toxic
From Google   >Officially, the team is the "Great Britain and Northern Ireland Olympic Team", although athletes from Northern Ireland may opt to compete under the auspices of the Olympic Federation of Ireland instead.  So I'm not sure why we aren't just called United Kingdom for the Olympics if it's Great Britain and Northern Ireland?  I've confused myself now  Looks like the Olympic committee classifies Northern Ireland as Great Britain (even though that isn't true)  Someone from Northern Ireland can compete for Great Britain or Ireland
 Non-Toxic

Frank Lampard and how to fail upwards in your managerial career. He should follow Southgate after this stint with chelsea.

At least the plane ticket isn't going to waste :D... but no seriously, being back in the commentary box was a humiliating reflection of the trajectory of my managerial career and I'm immensely relieved to be able to get out of it :|

How high can he raise his eyebrows? That will definitely determine the match.

Shame really, I'd have liked to hear him on commentary. He'd make a better partner for Fletcher than Steve Mcmanaman

I can imagine the face lol he goes 0-100 so quickly.

I just wish that tiny percent chance of Chelsea winning against real Madrid because could you imagine a team being 11th in the prem and being in the semi final of the champions league .
 Non-Toxic
I love shitting on the English as much as anyone, however, Southgate "inherited" a team which was an absolute laughing stock. He may not be a "champion" (TM) coach, but he sure as hell did a great job in taking them from point a (spoiled, pampered, divas) to the competitive position you are in now.  Irrespective of the results, he's turned the programme around from it's "hollywood"/absolute banter era.

To be fair, Nate will win fuck all too!

The problem is that Chelsea is not like a Palace, that is to say a perennial middle of the table team, they‚Äôve obviously massively underperformed, and they are a true nightmare to face in the champions.   This is why I don‚Äôt like them, whenever they are massively underperforming like this and you don‚Äôt know where to put them, they‚Äôre incredibly dangerous. Truly a bizarre team that always in a ‚Äòrebuilding‚Äô phase. I don‚Äôt trust them lmao

You make Chelsea sound like it will be a walk over. I reckon it will be very close. With Potter it was already over but now they have a fighting chance.
 Non-Toxic
Uhm he also then was gifted one of the better generations of English players in a while no?
 Non-Toxic
I was only joking, yeah he signed an extension and isn't really going anywhere until the next big tournament at least that is the Euros, he has to win that I feel otherwise what's the point.   English Fa does have a thing of getting only English managers in for the job so I wouldn't be surprised post Southgate one of Gerrard or Lampard get the job, most likely will be Potter depending upon if he is in a club by then.  Edit - lol why the downvotes just stating some facts here, English FA is not going to hire a manager outside of England.
 Non-Toxic
This explains the lack of control in the teams he coaches. If he could control one eyebrow at a time that would make him a tactical mastermind.

Lol true. The transition is too quick.

And real got absolutely hammered by Ajax in 2019.. Everything is possible and Kante is back.

Villarreal was playing excellent football though, just missing finishing their chances and having a mental block at the end of games, conceding late goals or equalisers.  Is that the same at Chelsea? Sometimes the results can hide the nuances.

I'm not celebrating Burnley but I'm celebrating Burnley that doesn't break your players legs half the time.
 Non-Toxic
They're getting relegated after one season in the Prem anyway
 Non-Toxic
It‚Äôs possible that all 3 promoted teams survive relegation this season and Burnley just clinched promotion with 7(?) matches left. Not sure how you can jump to that conclusion.
 Non-Toxic
How did they already get promoted if they have 6 matches left to play?
 Non-Toxic
It's going to be easy if there are as many shit teams in the Prem as there are this season
 Non-Toxic
Fair-play to him for becoming a PL manager so quickly
 Non-Toxic
Don't see why they'd go for Kompany when they've already got a City legend
 Non-Toxic
Complete myth btw.  Burnley didn't cause any more injuries than the average PL team across our 8 years in the prem (and actually came in the top half in the fair play league in 6/8 of those seasons).  Keep believing it if you want to though üëç
 Non-Toxic
ü§°
 Non-Toxic
Look at points
 Non-Toxic
I think it's a bit of a myth that there are so many bad teams this season tbh. Part of the reason Burnley have set the record for earliest promotion is because the top half of the championship is poor this season. It's why clubs that have players that yourself and Leicester have are in genuine trouble this season and it's why there isn't a Huddersfield/Cardiff/Sheffield United types of club that are cut adrift at the bottom of the premier league.
 Non-Toxic
Bare in mind we committed almost half the fouls and got half the cards of Arsenal about six seasons in a row.
 Non-Toxic
and much less violent than Stoke during same period
 Non-Toxic
It‚Äôs probably also that the top 1/4 or 1/3 or so is so damn good, too. The rest of the Prem just didn‚Äôt look like it‚Äôs on the same level even if it‚Äôs still very good football.

His record against **Braga**: **8W, 4D & 5L in 17 games**, meaning that Braga has beaten S√©rgio Concei√ß√£o's Porto more times than Benfica and Sporting combined.  He actually won his first 5 games against Braga, but it seems that they have become a lot harder to beat.

It's hard to really state how much of an icon Ashley Barnes is.  Half a million paid back and then some for a guy who showed up in big matches. And despite having an abysmal turn of form in 2022, just came out and became a regular starter again out of the blue in a system that was so different to what we expect of Barnes. It came as a pleasant surprise.  Bare in mind he's out of contract and most likely not getting an extension. So chances are he'll be gone due to age and limited play time as Kompany will be looking towards Lyle Foster (potentially Jay Rodriguez, Michael Obafemi or worst case scenario Wout Weghorst) in the future

> will be looking towards Lyle Foster (potentially Jay Rodriguez, Michael Obafemi or worst case scenario Wout Weghorst) in the future  No offense to that group, but would not be surprised at all to you see buy another proper starting striker in the summer with the PL money.

Probably because seeing the carcass of Jimenez at the World Cup permanently scarred them.  They‚Äôre afraid of seeing a repeat of someone who overextended their stay. Whether that‚Äôs justified or not, is an entirely different question but you can‚Äôt hardly blame them for feeling that way.

I used to watch Ochoa when he played in the Mexican league in 2006. He was amazing back then, it's kind of crazy to see him still doing it.

Pickford has been Everton‚Äôs best player for two years now. I know that‚Äôs not saying much, but he hasn‚Äôt had a proper clanger for a while.
 Non-Toxic
He's been amazing for Salernitana  Best GK in Serie A since the restart
 Non-Toxic
He hasn't been average at all for Salernitana. He's stopping everything
 Non-Toxic
He wasn‚Äôt average at America and Ajaccio.
 Non-Toxic
Pickford is a strange choice. The obvious answer is Richarlison
 Non-Toxic
Anyone who says Ochoa is only good for country, and not club is someone who doesn't know anything about his career. He was world class when I used to watch him play for club America in 2006. He has aged, so he isn't as good as he once was.
 Non-Toxic

~~South~~ Latin Americans don‚Äôt mess around when it comes to their NTs
 Non-Toxic
Pickford's not as good for England as you're making it seem though. He performs decently but he's far from unbeatable with the NT either. Their great defensive record is way more related to their defensive setup than him as a goalkeeper.
 Non-Toxic
That wasn't a wc though
 Non-Toxic
Well he didn‚Äôt start playing regularly until last month. But missing sitters has been a semi regular thing since. Missed one I probably could‚Äôve finished against Fiorentina, and I haven‚Äôt played a game of footy in years.
 Non-Toxic
Ya its common but he is starting over Lautaro and Dzeko because he creates more chances for the team. He holds up ball quite well. Lautaro finising been as bad as Lukaku post wc and he was bad there too.
 Non-Toxic
I agree but if he was good as he was for country he wouldn‚Äôt be playing at Everton.
 Non-Toxic
When did he go back to Europe? I thought he in America
 Non-Toxic
Well Ochoa ain't south American
 Non-Toxic
Again I think he has been. Spurs are one club that have been interested, and if Everton go down he‚Äôs probably the first to leave.

Since the restart. Left America after the WC.

I think it depends on the club. Liverpool during their 30 year drought probably wouldve wanted league success more than European success. However man city man United and maybe arsenal fans(not sure about them) would probably prefer European success.

Including Sevillas red card today La Liga has seen 108 red cards. Premier League has seen 28 this season, Ligue 1 with 84,  Serie A has seen 50, and Bundesliga 33.

Prem refs are far too reluctant to give red cards, seen Romero drag Cucurella down by his hair, seen players go in for leg breakers and get away with it.
 Non-Toxic
I‚Äôm curious what the numbers are for injuries that have occurred for both leagues this season.
 Non-Toxic
Casemiro would like to know how he is getting a La Liga treatment he perpetually avoided while he was there.  But the problem isn't La Liga. It's the EPL. Always been entirely too physical a league. Refs say, "We don't want to decide a game." But not carding blatantly cynical and reckless challenges decides games too.
 Non-Toxic
Mateu Lahoz exists
 Non-Toxic
Worst refereed season in PL history is what's going on. Refs do so little and there's no consistency in the little they do.
 Non-Toxic
There should've been way more reds than 28 this season. All kinds of bullshit doesn't get called. They've instituted new rules this season to ensure that the game flows better, but it's resulted in a lot of blatant bullshit not being called.
 Non-Toxic
Most of the red cards justified based on the rules. Nobody wants to see their team getting red cards and everyone prefers to win against 11 but 10, but if it's a yellow/red card then the ref must sanction it accordingly rather than think about overall red card stats
 Non-Toxic
Refs outside the Prem book more and give more reds fs but at the same time LaLiga is the league with the most kicks and such

Only like 97 of those are Savic heh

Yes you're playing in a league with refs on a power trip.

La liga is refereed for midgets who dive. Premier league refs realize contact is part of football and reds should only be given as a last resort. Makes for better watching too.

How many of the 108 cards come from lahoz?
 Non-Toxic
It's true. La Liga refs blow their whistle far too often whereas PL refs seemingly refuse to give out cards unless they absolutely have to. Doesn't help that when the feeling of referees are hurt they'll just card you because why not.
 Non-Toxic
I would need to look at the stats but I feel like a lot of PL players have had their careers shortened through sheer attrition because refs are scared to pull out the cards. Guys seem to retire quite early there

Premier league let‚Äôs players get away with murder. Cynical challenges, overly physical ones, VAR overturns basically nothing.

From the PL games I have seen this season, there should be absolutely more than those 28. In Bundesliga games I haven't seen a missed send off. Bundesliga also has the leadt games from all big leagues and not many butcher teams. La Liga and Ligue 1 seem very extreme in this matter.
 Non-Toxic
Here's an example of a "challenge" that wasn't even given a yellow card or reviewed by var:  https://youtu.be/KuBnNfITGCY   Consistency is terrible.  On top of that, refs in the PL are reluctant to give out cards early on in games for bad fouls which ends up influencing games far more than they would let on.
 Non-Toxic
I often hear Dutch fans saying that the refs are quite good. How many red cards do they have this season? I'd say 50-84 seems reasonable
 Non-Toxic
And with so many red cards, there is still a huge discrepancy on how many reds each team gets. I'm not claiming anything by it, but people have claimed wrong doing in the past based on cards or penalties, why not this time?  https://www.fotmob.com/leagues/87/stats/season/17852/teams/total_red_card_team/laliga-teams
 Non-Toxic
And half of those red cards in the PL were from the Fulham - Man United match
 Non-Toxic
this is so true, it baffles me how PL refs barely ever give out reds in comparison to other leagues. sometimes i find it crazy that they hesitate before giving out yellows too?? i've seen romero get away with so much this season. so many players actually. fabinho, the andy carroll & eriksen incident, and a few others.

Yellows too. If they were stricter with yellows the players would quit that shit and stop the red card offense bullshit cause they'd know the limit.

It might be badly refereed from your perspective but having the whistle blown less makes for a far more entertaining product and those who actually follow the premier league religiously would tell you that the game is much better now than it was a few years ago

I feel like the prem is very lenient on second yellows. If you are already on a yellow, you have to commit more than a yellow card offence to get a second one which defeats the whole purpose.

It is when officiated very inconsistently like it is in the prem.
 Non-Toxic
Hmm maybe as a neutral lol
 Non-Toxic
Yeah La Liga refs are at the other end of the scale compared to England, way too happy to blow their whistle. And when it comes to VAR, it feels like they are overly technical and don't use common sense much of the time  But then at the same time they will randomly let players get away with persistent fouling whilst already on a yellow or let leg breaking tackles go despite having VAR. La Liga refs are both too lenient and too soft at the same time somehow  And even though many of them have big egos a desire to be in the spotlight, they don't realise that teams are playing them every week. You can get in their heads and everyone knows it, so it's only logical that teams will look to bully the referee

La Liga fans always say they want less refs going on power trips and more flow to game. In la liga it‚Äôs too easy right now to keep fouling to stop the flow of the game. It‚Äôs rewarded too much as a form of defending
 Non-Toxic
I am living in Spain and besides el cl√°sico I can‚Äôt watch the games because it feels like the game is constantly stopped. Feels like the American football sometimes
 Non-Toxic
La Liga fans aren't pissed about refeering? It's just odd to me how La Liga fans moan about referees who are too involved like every week, until a La Liga player says the same thing, and suddenly there's La Liga fans popping out of the woodwork about how actually they prefer La Liga referees.
 Non-Toxic
what is this tired bodies you speak of?
 Non-Toxic
Well true but I would argue both of these aren't Red card worthy compared to the shit ref lets go in other matches
 Non-Toxic
I agree with you. Refereeing in Spain is really poor
 Non-Toxic
How's it rewarded when you have 100+ red cards? Isn't that the opposite of the point everyone is making?
 Non-Toxic
No one ever says they prefer Spanish refers
 Non-Toxic
What exactly are your post, and the others in the chain, doing then if not implying that other leagues are too lax about fouls  in comparison to La Liga? It certainly reads as at least somewhat of a defense of La Liga ref.  Also this is just straight up a defense, so you're just factually wrong that no one is defending them. https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/12f1ehw/marca_sevillas_fernando_laliga_is_one_of_the_best/jfdq4l4?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button

Didn't mention that they preferred Spanish refs though.

Makes sense, considering he is nothing short of amazing. Happy to witness the beginnings of his legacy, it will be a valuable memory in the future.

If they're so happy with him then why do they keep selling him for cheap to me on Fifa?   ^/s

Boehly-esq contract please

He's been good, people acting like he's been the second coming of Christ confuse me a bit. Hopefully we get to see him in midfield and not as makeshift solution for other spots.
 Non-Toxic
I mean why wouldn‚Äôt they be happy with him.  He‚Äôs a quality LB who can deputise in midfield
 Non-Toxic
He‚Äôs my favorite player to watch right now. Just has massive impact on the field.

You know what? Make that 2 billion. With Todd Boehly, you don't know what that yank will do

Thats a terrible idea lol
 Non-Toxic
Called it a while ago, getting him for 30m is going to be the best midfielder signing in recent memory
 Non-Toxic
He was very important in the CL knockouts, changed a lot of games as a sub.  But he‚Äôs become much more consistent.
 Non-Toxic
Both are world class, very jealous of the RM pull lol
 Non-Toxic
He is really good, it pisses me off how good he is. He annoys me more than any other madrid player

Well he might as well be the second coming of Jes√∫s christ. He's been insane after the world cup. Carrying the midfield at times.

Worst case scenario: Man gets injured. Club pays him forever.  Best case scenario: man is crucial in winning a decades worth of trophies. Real Madrid's paying his descendants in the year 5154235342.
 Non-Toxic
He won Ligue 1 player of the month at 16  We saw Gavi and Pedri only a few years later who were also insane at that age, but when I saw Camavinga at 16 he was the first midfielder in a long long while I saw THAT good at his age, possibly the best
 Non-Toxic
I wonder how much of that is a rumor spread by an agent or whether Camavinga was like Tchouameni and actually preferred Real Madrid.  30m seemed like a steal even for PSG at the time. I just can't believe PSG wasn't willing to at least match it.  I guess I can't complain since that transfer window was still a pretty good one for us, especially with the gap in transition from Leonardo to Campos. Though, whoever made the decision to become a retirement home and take on salaries of aging Messi, Ramos, and Gini over prioritizing a promising young player who was terrorizing us since he was 16 should definitely lose their job.
 Non-Toxic
They‚Äôre Frances midfield. Isn‚Äôt that what world class means?
 Non-Toxic
I think it just comes from different definitions of world class. I view it as meaning you‚Äôd start/be in the squad of a world 11 (so best 1 or two players in your position), but a lot of people on here are happy to throw it out there for any Real Madrid player or CL winner.   Given that it‚Äôs the highest praise you can give beyond just calling someone the best in the world, I do think it should be used more sparingly. You should be struggling to come up with players who are better in someone‚Äôs position for them to be called world class (and I think there are many players you‚Äôd name before Camavinga or Tchouameni)
 Non-Toxic
Another jealous plastic fan. Can't wait for Benzema to pull a last minute hat trick against you in the semi finals.

He was class enough to turn around a tie after he was subbed against you lot. He played a role in both goals after 90.

I hate vincius for being an annoying whining cunt, not for his footballing ability. I hate Camavinga for his footballing ability and how god damn elegant he looks with his hair flapping around every time he moves

Fabregas was much better at that age but still

It always seemed very obvious (and there were media articles supporting it) that those two really only wanted Real and IF not they might consider other teams.  Real‚Äôs pull is simply unmatched. And no I‚Äôm not a Real fan.

No? Starting for your national team doesn't mean you're world class.

Thank you.. this is all I‚Äôm saying.
 Non-Toxic
Jealous for what..?   I said they‚Äôre great players with potential to be WC.. how on earth can you argue Tchoumeni is WC when the guy doesn‚Äôt even get into Madrid‚Äôs XI consistently is beyond me. Cavaminga looks fantastic and if he keeps it up for multiple years, he‚Äôll absolutely be WC.
 Non-Toxic
They ain't getting pass Bayern lol
 Non-Toxic
I don't know. I love having him in my team. If Barcelona had it he would take you to a way higher level. He's top 3 in the world imo. I see how you might hate having him against you for being too good. Hell I hated neymar because he was great
 Non-Toxic
And thats what you don't want. Look at Rooney. Demigod at 18, almost washed up approaching 30   Edit: Guys, I didn't mean it that way. So much injuries destroyed his body, he could have achieved much more, and the other examples provided are way better. I just wanted to give an example. Thats all!
 Non-Toxic
What about starting for the team that literally got 2nd in the world cup only a few months ago?
 Non-Toxic
Ye but starting for France does have some weight
 Non-Toxic
By that metric, every player who starts for them is world class.  I don't think anyone saw Arbeloa as world class even if he started for the most dominant Spain side in history.
 Non-Toxic
more to do with prem fatigue. tired of hearing eulogies of foden's touch and how world class martinelli's pass is, but the moment non prem league talents are mentioned 'um lets not jump the gun here..' "is he premier league proven tho?" "how long has he been playing?" Not necessarily you, but its how we see it
 Non-Toxic
I disagree I think hes a very good player but very overrated. Not even top 3 in Madrid IMO. I rate Benzema modric and Camavinga more than him. Courtouis as well but hes a keeper so its hard to compare
 Non-Toxic
Rooney had a great career. Playing at a high level for over a decade is better than most can say. No idea why you would choose him an example over someone like Michael Owen, Hargreaves, Pato, or even Falcao
 Non-Toxic
Yea who wouldn‚Äôt want a player like Rooney on their team‚Ä¶
 Non-Toxic
Ahh yess, it would be an utter shame to keep somebody with the career of Rooney for the cost of $30M, you won this one.
 Non-Toxic
Yeah but right back and midfielder are two different things
 Non-Toxic
Last season he was the 3rd best after benzema and courtois. This season he's been the best. After him, militao and camavinga. I don't think he's overrated. We're not 1st in the league because teams were putting 3 defenders on him and benzema was awful. And fede is not that much of a threat as a winger.
 Non-Toxic
Falcao is a poor example, he wasn‚Äôt overplayed, he just had freak back to back ACL injuries in his prime.    Still had a decent career too.
 Non-Toxic
I mean in the world cup he was pretty average, he got handled in most of the other barca games this season. He obviously did very well in some other games this season like against liverpool but he seems to get completely shut down in a good amount of games which is why I dont think he‚Äôs currently one of the best
 Non-Toxic
Messi in his best years was average in the world cup. So was cr7. It's not smart to make an opinion based on 7 games tops. I watch every real madrid game. He got neutralized by barca in 3 clasicos because ancelotti didn't have a good plan. He started a physically weak midfield and we had 3 shots on target tops. Even in the last game, I don't think it would have worked so well if de jong and pedri played. Vinicius like every player needs at least another attacker to help carrying the attacking load. Benzema has done it only in the past 2 games. Rodrygo too. They have been pretty average or bad this season. Vini has carried us this season offensively. With this benzema Barcelona wouldn't have won 3 in a row against real madrid, because this way vinicius find more space to perform.
 Non-Toxic
You raise some good points, maybe it isnt fair to judge him based on the world cup. However Brazil arguably had the best team in the world cup stacked from top to bottom and he struggled to make an impact and Messi and Ronaldos teams were never as good as Brazils current team(at least on paper)  Idk if its fair to say barca wouldnt have won 3 in a row considering madrid beat barca pretty comfortably because Barcas 4 most important players were injured and we had to play a disgustingly bad midfield containing busquets and roberto with alonso in CB. And even then the first half barca was arguably the better team, second half was a different story though

Exactly, he is already financially dependent for life and for generations after him. And it's not like moving back to Barca wouldn't be lucrative for him, the commercial possibilities are immense and he could be given a higher percentage of his image rights and probably some highly paid ambassador role after he retires aswell  The guy has completed football, go back to Barca and focus on the best life for his family instead

That's only if you're re-signing a player and I think that has to do with general Spanish law (can only reduce salary by so much).

The man responsible for that is Bartomeu, of course players are going to accept those obscene contracts when offered. There are things that were far more damaging than Messi's salary, like offering Sergi Roberto and other squad players insanely high salaries

Who knows about the finances better, a player or the president?  Messi asked for a higher contract and Bartomeu agreed. So who to blame here? Messi?  You expect a player to be more aware about the financial situation than the president?

This has legit been my theory since all of the players started speaking out at once: this would be a steal of a deal for Bar√ßa, economically and probably sportingly. No way that they get a comparable player helping to fix the attack at a similar price without the nostalgia discount, let alone one who brings such commercial benefit.
 Non-Toxic
> Barca can‚Äôt afford him without those cheap tricks  He was going to play for next to nothing when the club was in a mess financially because of COVID, he wasn't allowed to. No club in the world can offer him anything close to what Qatar / Saudi / UAE clubs can offer.

No I think the thing was that their finances were so fucked he couldn't even if he wanted to.
 Non-Toxic
Actually no, Messi said no one asked him to cut his salary and he would have if they had asked. At least that's what I remember.  That being said, there will be 30 replies saying you can't cut a salary by more than 50% in Spain and then there will be 27 replies saying that's only a rule for something else.

He couldn't play for free. Laws didn't allow it. You can't have your salary reduced by more than 50 percent
 Non-Toxic
and if he reaches the 2026 world cup it‚Äôs only 2 years from the 2028 copa america and if he plays that surely he‚Äôll just wait out 2 more short years to play the 2030 world cup in Argentina

I mean we're not exactly being discreet about it lmao. The only thing we can offer Messi that other clubs can't is the chance to play with his buddies again infront of fans who worship him so we're playing that angle.  But on top of it it's not just Barca fans/personnel, everyone wants Messi to come back so he's kinda getting pressured by the entire world.
 Non-Toxic
They started speaking out because your fans started boo-ing him.....
 Non-Toxic
> He was going to play for next to nothing when the club was in a mess financially because of COVID  what is the source to that? I know La Liga didnt allow him to stay, but i have never heard of Messi accepting such a deal.
 Non-Toxic
They couldn't because there is rule in LaLiga that you can't have much cheaper contract that you had previously/currently, as minimum wage he could get was based on his previous/current contract. Rule that is trying to prevent exactly those shenanigans.
 Non-Toxic
Actually, no such law exists. It was made up by a Barca fan account. People went through the entire rulebook and didn't find anything like that.
 Non-Toxic
Average lifespan of a human is around 70-80 years, messi is 35 years old so he can play 11 more worlds cups atleast

Maybe not lol  But I can definitely imagine him ending his career at the 2026 WC no matter the result

2 hatricks against you guys and tore you apart in the semi finals of the champions league. Those are ages ago and maybe his recent performances were not as good as the previous ones, but when Messi is on the pitch he‚Äôs always the most threatening player

 Non-Toxic
Oh yes, because PSG were stacking CL titles before Messi arrived
 Non-Toxic
Clickbait aside, those "requests" are entirely reasonable TBH.   He basically asked for a 3-year deal on the same net wages as before, a private box at Camp Nou for his and Suarez's family, repayment of the deferred wages (same thing Frenkie has asked for), a 10M signing bonus (which is cheap compared to the "loyalty bonuses" Barto used to give to Neymar), and a reduced release clause (to allow Messi to leave since Barto broke the hand-shake agreement when Messi wanted to leave the previous season).
 Non-Toxic
Those are demands made by his agent(his brother if I'm not mistaken) and there's nothing wrong with that, at the end of the day as much as Messi might love Barcelona the club is a institution ran by people and he's a employe he should ask for what he wants
 Non-Toxic
In any business, decisions made decades ago will have lasting implications. It certainly doesn‚Äôt stop once a CEO/president leaves.   Also, a player/employee should never be privy to the overall health of the company or club that employs them. Unless it is a part of their job description, they will not have access to metrics, p&l, revenue streams etc. If the club signs off an deals they cannot honor, thats on them.

I won't argue with that, and I think the boos were misplaced, but it also felt like Bar√ßa saw their chance and pounced, which they wouldn't have done unless they'd calculated that there were some tangible benefits beyond the emotional.

No I know there‚Äôs other reasons I was just clarifying what that person had misremembered. People had said that theoretically they couldn‚Äôt even keep him for free. Not that they asked him to play for free.

That would seem pretty strange to me‚Ä¶ if the player is willing to accept a significantly lower wage to help the club, I don‚Äôt see why that shouldn‚Äôt be allowed.

Apparently La Liga had a salary cap at 70% of the revenue, and even if he'd have played for free the rest of the salaries amounted to 95% of the revenue, so there still was no way to renew the contract.

And you put that on Messi's shoulders? lol  In 2016, they lost to a legendary Atl√©tico team. In 2017 they lost to a great Juventus side, and then there were the collapses against Roma and Liverpool which was more on the coaching staff and defence really. If 2 humiliating exits is "routinely" for you then that is an interesting interpretation of the word  The guy almost carried them singlehandedly to a treble in 2019, and in the one moment where he needed his teammates to step up they bottled it. I still remember him creating so many good chances at Anfield but the others kept missing. If they had just scored from one of those it would have been game over with the away goals rule
 Non-Toxic
And how many times have we made the knockout stage since he left? He carried this team and its deadwood for so many years

> There‚Äôs no need to quote boyhood lol he was raised a cule.   Because he wasn't. Messi's boyhood club was Newell's Old Boys.  Messi moved to Barcelona when he was 13 because they were the club willing to pay for his medical treatment (when Newell's as well as River/Boca were unwilling to do so), not because he was "raised a Cule" (he wasn't‚Äîhe became one after moving there).

The Milan sub Is full of #Pioliout.  I Guess they Watch the game on Transfermarket and miss Just how Ibra, Rebic Origi and CDK are useless.  They Just miss or lose the ball.

Not calling for pioliout but it was his decision to bench our entire attack, and for what? He ended up throwing all our starters by minute 70th so they didn't even rest.  >Just how Ibra, Rebic Origi and CDK are useless.  Yes they are, then i have to ask you, what did you expected when you saw a lineup consisting of Rebic and Origi upfront? He could have benched 1 or 2 players at best, he decided to bench Leao, Giroud and Brahim.  Not a single one of our starters rested and Theo and Tonali will be tired AF for the Napoli game.

Honestly, I really don't think how is that possible. Today during the game I thought I'd rather have Matri on the field than him, I really don't remember anything useful from him all game.  Not movement without the ball, build up, finishing, passing, whatever. Every component of his game is just dogshit and his attitude is like he is just in Milano on vacation.

Ho sentito anche le voci, stavano gi√† avviando trattative con l'Empoli per Fazzini. √à sicuramente uno che √® stato richiesto da Sarri
 Non-Toxic
Lazio are at home so hopefully we can make it 14 points with nine games. At that point theres no chance, so arguably Lazio have more to play for. Also they didnt play midweek or have Europe on their mind for the next one so it's a good chance for them to really secure CL football.
 Non-Toxic
Which is exactly Roma's attacking plan, but with set pieces.

You don't need world class players to gain a bit of consistency against small and medium sides.  We have 6 defeats and 6 draws in 2023, relegation level.

Empoli were not poor offensively, they just went into the game with 0 intention of going forward. They spent the entire game literally in their own penalty box.

Roma probably even play worse than us. But they are growing. We won the league and After that the motivation were faded for lot of guys. I think has no more to give for the team
 Non-Toxic
Osimhen came from the Belgian league too recently... Sure, we haven't had a De Bruyne or Courtois coming out for a while but we're not that bad in terms of quality.
 Non-Toxic
If we count 2023 league results alone, then Milan would be sitting at 10th. That's midtable, not relegation level. It's bad, but let's not exaggerate.  This team does have a hard time breaking down small teams who park the bus though. That's a con to Pioli's approach. However this also has a lot to do with the material. In 2020 the team was breaking these teams down with ease because Bennacer, Zlatan, Rebic, Ha*an and Theo were great at combining.  The 2022-2023 Milan is a lot more soloist, because key players like Leao and Diaz are soloists. Rebic and Zlatan are finished. Tonali is a workhorse, but his technical qualities are overrated. Giroud's hold up play and targetman ability is nowhere near Zlatan's.  Factor in the rotation, which lead to clowns like Origi starting and lack of chemistry, and you get performances like the one against Empoli.
 Non-Toxic
It's hard to play counter attacking football with Caputo, he's 35 and as mobile as a tree.   Milan took the piss with their team selection, Empoli were always going to defend deep and force you to break them down. And it worked, they got a result at the San Siro, no small thing for a club like them.
 Non-Toxic
I don't dislike them like that. I actually appreciate them

It happens, the players gave everything and rode a wave of momentum. It can be hard to stay at that level, it requires constant fresh blood. Look at Liverpool

Still not where I'd want to be spending 35m on a young talent and hoping he can adapt to Italy. But your right, the next generational talent could come through any time, you cant write off every player based on where they come from.
 Non-Toxic
Why?
 Non-Toxic
Idk they look pretty functional in the end. They play not very good but actually Allegri has a team full of problems (Pogba, Chiesa, Di Maria injuries. 15 point deduction, old people) and managed to have a positive season. He also is in the position to win Europa League.
 Non-Toxic
Theres a lot of grit and maturity in the team. No one can defend a 1-0 lead comfortably like Juventus. They have some really good young players too. But something doesnt seem to be clicking for them in the final third. Hopefully that continues tomorrow

What a second half. That Acu√±a goal was incredible.   I‚Äôve never really liked Sevilla, but seeing them struggle has made me realize how important they are to the league. I hope they come back strong next season.
 Non-Toxic
Gutted. We put in such a great effort with 10 men, limited an inform Celta side to few clear chances until the last part of the match. For 75 minutes or so it was our best defensive performance of the season but then it was all undone in a few moments  Whilst it is clear that there are still things to work on(mainly the discipline of the team, we are collecting yellow and red cards like candy this season) there has clearly been progress in the first two matches under Mendillibar. Putting players in the right positions, not taking so many stupid risks in build up play, defending much better as a collective. I hope that the boys don't let the ending destroy their confidence because they put in a good performance overall  Going into the match, Celta were the shared(with Barcelona and Girona) 2nd highest scorers in La Liga since the start of February. They are a really good team and a few weeks ago they would have probably ripped our defence apart. It was good practice parking the bus before going to Old Trafford on Thursday, hopefully we can repeat these concentration levels and cut out the small mistakes!
 Non-Toxic
Could end up being a big fuckup for Sevilla because they have several tough fixtures remaining: Valencia, Villarreal, Betis, Athletic, Real Madrid, Real Sociedad, Girona. Getting the 3 points today was so important.  They might get lucky because the teams below them are in abysmal form. Plus they have improved. But really big tests coming for them that will determine whether they avoid relegation or not.

2-0 the most dangerous lead lol , it's not Madrid tho

Atmosphere at Ramon Sanchez was crazy tonight, loved the match and the drama. Sure Sevilla bottled it but Celta capitalized off an otherwise perfect defense.

It hurts a lot, but we were playing with 10 men for 70+ minutes against one of the most in form attacking teams in the league. For most of the match Sevilla defended really well and kept Celta at arms length  Mendillibar has simplified things, playing a bit more direct and putting players in their correct positions. I think we'll be fine if we continue along these lines
 Non-Toxic
Acu√±a was quality today, also that filthy first touch from Dmitrovic's long ball leading to the corner which En Nesyri scored from. But of course he had to go and get sent off at the end and now he will miss the match at Mestalla next week -.-
 Non-Toxic
I was at the game and even though I wished for Celta to take all three points I would say it's a fair result but Lucky for us since our conversion was lacking.
 Non-Toxic
Sevilla only have themselves to blame, obviously we don't know what Acu√±a said for the second red, but hard to say that the first one wasn't a reasonable decision over the two fouls.
 Non-Toxic
I think you are almost safe. Mendillibar is a fantastic coach IMO who sadly has experience in a relegation battle.
 Non-Toxic
I hope so, I'm getting a good impression of Mendillibar so far. Since the whole club from players to directors were completely unprepared for a relegation battle, it could be valuable to have a coach with experience of it who won't panic  I still have a bit of a soft spot for Sampaoli lol, but his temperament was definitely not made for a relegation fight. The team reflected his bipolar mood swings on the pitch

It will be very exciting to see how he does in the Premier League next season, I'm so excited!  I wonder how many Belgian managers there have been in the Premier League, if any?

If anything, this just proves how fucked my club, Anderlecht, is. Kompany does so well in the Championship, which is one of the most competitive and difficult leagues to win. Even taking some players with him like Cullen and Harwood-Bellis.

Sorry for doubting you at the start Vincent, I fucking love you. In other news, I'm gonna be skint (once again) next season but who cares eh.
 Non-Toxic
Funny looking back on the threads when Kompany was first appointed because the reception was mixed to say the very least. Lot of people were (justifiably) judging him by his stint at Anderlecht but that club were also a mess at the time.   Full credit to Vinny and Burnley. It should not be understated what an unbelieveable job he has done. He and his coaching staff have not only got the team play some really good but also clearly very effective brand of football. To come in and replace such an iconic charachter in Sean Dyche and change lot of the culture and way of doing things at the club so fast is not easy to do at all. I also think the that it's been a blessing to play the Cup draws against Premier League opposition and Burnley can gather some data and learn from those games where they can still improve and how they match up to competition when next season comes around.   I'm trying my hardest to be very careful not to praise him too much because of how spectacularly Steven Gerrard has failed after his time at Rangers but Kompany truly deserves his roses. I never even saw him going into coaching back when he was still playing and always more or less assumed he would take a backroom role at City after he retires but guess Pep really made him want to pursue managerial career. Lot can change between now and when we move on from Guardiola but lately it feels like it's not a question if but what rather when.

Very excited to see how they and Kompany perform in the Prem.
 Non-Toxic
Good to see them go up.  Imo they did a good job in the prem for years and spent their money wisely on their academy and improvements to the club rather than lots of transfers. Their net spend was like 60-70 million over that time. It's quite deserved imo
 Non-Toxic
UP THE CLARETS!!!
 Non-Toxic
Honestly crazy. Everyone thinks they're crazy for firing Dyche but then Kompany comes in and turns them into a machine. An entertaining Burnley would be much more fun in the PL than what they were before.

huge props to the burnley management to trust Kompany and give him the tools to turn it around. Even when we played them in the cup, I couldn't believe that the team we were playing was burnley. A decisive decision made at a decisive time

Kind of curious to see what Kompany plans for next year.  Norwich highlighted how playing great football in the Championship doesn‚Äôt translate seamlessly to the Premier League.   A more pragmatic style can be hard if you don‚Äôt genuinely believe in it and it can be hard to shift the dial in such a short space of time. There were moments tonight where the playing out the back seemed to suffer when the speed increased.

Parachute payments literally saved my club villa from spending 10 years in the 2nd tier and helped us bounce back to where we're now fighting for Europe but objectively and fundamentally, I disagree with parachute payments as a concept and I think it's ruining the Championship  Burnley and Sheffield United have walked an easy path to automatic promotion mostly because of their superior finance simply by being in the Prem recently even though neither of them are in the top 10 biggest clubs in the championship    >inb4 Burnley and Sheffield United are relatively big clubs and you can't name 10 championship clubs bigger than them    They are both respectable traditional clubs but neither of them are in the top 20 biggest clubs in the country that make up the ideal top tier    And yes I can name 10 current championship clubs bigger than them both (in no particular order of biggest, simply bigger than Burnley and Sheff Utd):    1.Middlesbrough 2. Blackburn 3. Norwich 4. Preston 5. WBA 6. Sunderland 7. Watford 8. Stoke 9. Birmingham City 10. Take your pick from Cardiff, Swansea or Hull City

I imagine there would be a lot of great entertainment to be found in the threads about them sacking Dyche and getting relegated, from people who were convinced Burnley were completely fucked, would be stuck in the Football League for years, and only Dyche could have kept them up and brought them straight back up.  No-one would have expected Kompany to do this, but it does prove that sometimes change is a good thing.
 Non-Toxic
GET IN
 Non-Toxic
This is the earliest one in the championship. Leicester did it in 40 games in 13-14 as did  Reading in 05-06
 Non-Toxic
This is the earliest one with 39 games. Next one is 40 and was Leicester iirc
 Non-Toxic
[Apparently yes](https://twitter.com/CoachesVoice/status/1644444030082641925)
 Non-Toxic
Yes, the previous record was Leicester in 13-14
 Non-Toxic
Burnley still has a chance (I think they need to get 3 from all their remaining games) to break the points record in one season set by Reading
 Non-Toxic
In terns of date, it was the 25th March, by Reading's 05/06 squad which did it on Game 40, but Burnley have done it a game earlier. They are also still able to better the 106 points record if they win every remaining game, and equal it by winning 6 and drawing 1.   They could also become champions on Game 41 matching Reading's earliest ever record, if they win their next 2 and Sheffield United lose theirs. Given it's Reading v Burnley next week, it's a guaranteed 3 points for Burnley there at least...   In both seasons, Sheffield United were miles ahead of third.
 Non-Toxic
15th for sure
 Non-Toxic
Looking at Leeds, west ham, wolves, Chelsea...I think you could be up near mid table
 Non-Toxic
Nah you'll get off to a good start and be 4th after 5 games, everyone on Sky will start wanking Kompany off, and then you'll finish 14th and every time you lose a game Gary Neville will be there looking like a disappointed dad on MNF.
 Non-Toxic
This is the way.   Will be interesting to see how it goes and if he can adapt to all the other teams being at a higher level. It sucks how often teams that are flying in the Championship come up and try to play the same way without adapting and just go straight back down again as a result
 Non-Toxic
With the current state of the table... 15th easily
 Non-Toxic
When we loan you Sambi Lokonga Kompany better turn him into the prime that he promised!
 Non-Toxic
and in the 2024/2025 season, you will rehearse the foxes script and break the bookmakers for a second time ;)

The real question is are they going to play more conservative in the premier league? We‚Äôve seen norwich and leeds with biesla try to play expansive football and translate what they have done in the championship and it has not worked
 Non-Toxic
I‚Äôd be surprised if Kompany stays at Burnley next season.
 Non-Toxic
Earliest Championship promotion since the rebrand (2004)
 Non-Toxic
They‚Äôve been dominant, even when they haven‚Äôt played well they‚Äôve found a way to end up with a win, they could turn heads next season if they keep recruiting right
 Non-Toxic
Well they are on 87 points, second place is on 76, and third on 68.  So I thinks it‚Äôs safe to say they‚Äôve had a pretty good season so far.
 Non-Toxic
I've heard Kompany loves West Street Live on a Sunday night
 Non-Toxic
I‚Äôm sure if they didn‚Äôt turn up to work on Monday you‚Äôd be happy
 Non-Toxic
We owe you one to be fair, after the 5-2. Hungover or not.
 Non-Toxic
Just make sure you play our lads, yeah?
 Non-Toxic
Leeds went on a piss up after getting promotion, half the team was rotated out because they were hungover (including, I'm pretty sure, Klich's first game not starting under Bielsa) and we played some of the most free-flowing football I've seen because we didn't really care, hah.
 Non-Toxic
The Prem is becoming to Pep Guardiola what Serie A is to Gasperini.  Arteta, Kompany, even De Zerbi has said Guardiola is his model.   I unironically believe that stuff matters in terms of legacy, maybe not as much as trophies or achievements, but when you change the way the game is thought of, your greatness is immortal, and Pep Guardiola is the best manager in history hands down.
 Non-Toxic
he might be the baldest of them all..have you seen the size of that head??
 Non-Toxic
Not well if their FA cup tie against Man City is anything to go by. Then again, that shouldn‚Äôt really be the litmus test
 Non-Toxic
I do worry for them tbh. They are better than our 18/19 squad was but even we showed so much promise just to get pummeled. Hope Burnley do better than we did.
 Non-Toxic
They'll get stomped but there's always a couple surprises at the bottom.

Last seasons Fulham were the best attacking Championship team I've ever seen but this seasons Burnley are more balanced

Do they play good football now? My issue with Burnley was always the absolute dog shit brexitball they used to play under Dyche.
 Non-Toxic
seeing sean dyche with everton against burnley will feel so wrong  assuming they stay up and he‚Äôs still there of course lol
 Non-Toxic
I can't root for them with how dirty they did Dyche but I'm excited they found attacking football. Always room for more of it in the prem.
 Non-Toxic
Pretty sure he would be the first, I can't find any other in my research
 Non-Toxic
Crazy isn't. Even Al Dakhil from Sint Truiden lmao. Glad for them tho.
 Non-Toxic
Maddest thing is that he's genuinely been one of our better players this year. Really come alive after a couple of months
 Non-Toxic
Was he not good in the Belgian league? Just curious.  He has been pretty spectacular for us this year
 Non-Toxic
More importantly we didn't beat Blackpool in either fixture
 Non-Toxic
Watford is respectable, Blackpool on the other hand...
 Non-Toxic
Only 1 league defeat since mid-August.  In 15/16 we went 23 unbeaten which was a big achievement & the crowning jewel of that season. If we avoid defeat on Monday, looking at our remaining fixtures, it is very possible we'll out-do that as well.
 Non-Toxic
We haven‚Äôt won it just yet. We‚Äôre only promoted. But we‚Äôre definitely on track to win it.   As for your club, OOF yeah not good
 Non-Toxic
The Belgian league really is on a huge upswing as well and its simply getting harder and harder to do well in it.  Think Kompany happened to take over at Anderlecht right about when this upswing started to manifest itself.  Not to say Anderlecht didnt fuck him over in some ways, but well, Club Brugge currently are  experiencing the same problems with, on paper, the strongest team in the league.. which no one expected either.
 Non-Toxic
You don't rate him? He's been doing really well and is basically a lock for cb at 22
 Non-Toxic
Been great for us, sort of a utility man as he's played RB, LB, LM, RM and somewhere in CM a couple of times I think. Technically a very good player and has chipped in with goals and assists.  For a million euros he's been a bargain
 Non-Toxic
Absolute quality. When you need someone to perform he's always the one to step up and has been a vital utility player. Well loved by the fans also
 Non-Toxic
If you watched the City v Burnley game for the first 30 minutes of the game we did a very solid defensive game and controlled the game shutting down City. We unfortunately conceded two goals in five minutes after that and at that point we went for it to try and get back into it and that opened up the game. I think had we played our first choice keeper we'd wouldn't have conceded the first two goals. But the point is, I'm confident this style of football can work in the prem. We also destroyed Bournemouth with the same style
 Non-Toxic
Weghorst won't play for us again
 Non-Toxic
wet horse is surely a manu starter but i doubt he would play for burnley. hes not burnley quality for sure
 Non-Toxic
They are always so hard for us, and this team is even better.
 Non-Toxic
They 100% play vetter football than spurs do nowadays
 Non-Toxic
Need not worry, this is an entirely different Burnley than we've ever seen. Very pleasing to watch when they play, Kompany has changed that team up for the better.
 Non-Toxic
His best mate Obafemi is on a permanent now so I think he'll stick in the prem

He'll have to wait in line I think, scouts everywhere probably are salivating over union s-g /genk/ some gent players

Sean Dyche's Burnley was the last example of a mostly British premier league team, the last reminement of a soulful no fucks given English club from the 90s and 2000s. The premier league has been heavy commercialised and globalised for a long time now but Sean Dyche's Burnley were like a team from a past era placed into the modern era.    When Dyche's Burnley were relegated, a piece of English football was laid to rest for good. The premier league is now forever a league full of foreign mercenaries playing for a pay check with no care for the club or local fanbase they play for and aimed at a plastic international customer that has never been to England that thinks Bournemouth are a top tier football club and would have his brain melted at the concept that Sheffield Wednesday's ground is over 3x the capacity of Bournemouth even though they're in the 3rd tier.

Once they've won the league, which could be after Game 41. They will likely have it presented at their final home game.

 Non-Toxic
I think you're overestimating the impact of parachute payments - it took Villa three bites at the cherry to come back up.  If Bruce had clung on for another couple of weeks you would've need a fourth go.  Look at the clubs you listed - with the exception of Preston they all went down in the past 10 years and had extended stints in the Championship - Blackburn and the Mackems even spent time in League One.  Do they help? You betchya - but they aren't some cheat code that leads to an automatic bounce back, and as Sunderland showed if you don't spend them wisely it can go south verrrrrrry quickly.

Such a quality player thanks for sending him! He's actually the player I rate most in our team. The way he takes the ball forward on runs from the back has been key to initiating a lot of our attacks. He basically becomes a midfielder at times and draws in players to offload to the wings.

I mean, the honor for that should go to Cruyff then, since Pep and all his acolytes are just following his principles.

Ten Hag too. They worked together at Bayern.

It leaves a lasting impact on the game.   It‚Äôs why, in my opinion, Cruyff is such a legend. Not only because of his play on the field, but because the legacy he left and influencing so many like Pep.

Bielsa is also very prolific when it comes to those he mentored and/or those who studied him

Could you elaborate on that Gasperini part? Genuinely interested

As much as I like Pep more, Ferguson is yet to be beaten for GOAT manager status.   That guy reinvented teams, took teams that shouldn't have been able to compete to titles, took on a challenger in Wenger that arguably did more to change English football than anyone in the modern era, took on the pre-FFP Chelsea and broke their dominance.

>Pep Guardiola is the best manager in history hands down.  As good as he is, that is ridiculous when he has never overperformed with a team even once and has coached Barcelona, Bayern and Man City. No way does he have the best coaching performance of all time, but his tactical legacy is legendary  Leaving behind a legacy is not the same as being the best coach either, especially when you only coach ultra rich and dominant clubs
 Non-Toxic
I‚Äôll bet on Vieira getting a second shot in the PL too
 Non-Toxic

 Non-Toxic
Think Kompany said it best.  The aggregate score between Burnley and City was something like 46-2 in the previous 10 games.  Even if it didn't work, it was worth trying something different.
 Non-Toxic
Well in the same vein we put 4 past Bournemouth in the cup and were very competitive in a 2-0 loss to Man Utd
 Non-Toxic
I'm hoping we will be like Bielsa's Leeds. They got absolutely taken apart a few times but were good enough to take points from the lower part of the prem.
 Non-Toxic
Yea we get battered by City either way. City put 5 past us under Dyche plenty of times.
 Non-Toxic
Playing Devil's Advocate here but we didn't field a full strength side. Man City did.
 Non-Toxic
They were well in the game in the first half but they are Championship team and in the end our quality made the difference.
 Non-Toxic
I mean, obviously Man City are way better than Burnley are currently still.
 Non-Toxic
Also worth mentioning you had Pukki as a proven goalscorer, Burnley don't have that which will make it hard for them in the Prem. I don't see Ashley Barnes or Jayrod having a Prem resurgence or Lyle Foster lighting up the level. And I don't think Tella will step up quite this much (not to mention they don't even own him and Maatsen, arguably their two best players).
 Non-Toxic
Fulham also lost 10 games last year.  Burnley have lost 2...
 Non-Toxic
Is that the general consensus? I didn't wanna make an opinion with us just being promoted in what seemed like a very strong season.
 Non-Toxic
Dumb question: why do some people say "like" at the end of their sentence?
 Non-Toxic

Burnley made ~¬£40m profit this season and lost all their better players and what had been the core of their side for years? Lol.  Teams who go down and get picked apart like that never usually bounce straight back.

That's not true though is it?  Sheffield United, Boro, Norwich, Watford?  Teams that Burnley are miles ahead of in the league

 What defines how 'big' a club is? There are many factors, usually a combination of three main factors I think 1. Size of fanbase/ground capacity 2. Historical success/trophies in the cabinet 3. Recent league performances   Preston, Burnley and Sheff Utd all have similar sized fanbases, I would say Preston are overlooked because they have never been in the Premier League since 1992 but they are by far the biggest team that has never been in the Prem, looking at the current Championship 19/24 teams have been in the prem since 1992, it's only Preston, Luton, Millwall, Bristol City and Rotherham that haven't (I hope Luton or Millwall win the playoffs)     The main thing for me is that Preston North End in the 1800s were the only other top flight team apart from 03/04 Arsenal to have an invincible season.

Fergurson's biggest part in him being a better manager than Pep overall though is him doing it with a non-top tier team though. I genuinely want to see what Pep can do with a team that's not got major financial backing or expected to walk the league

true, they all look like bald manatees
 Non-Toxic
Hughes, Bruce, Queiroz, Kidd, McClaren, Rooney, Carrick, Ole, Strachan are all hardly shit.
 Non-Toxic
Well Pep combines the absolute domination sustained over an entire era of football with the forward thinking innovativeness that makes his ideas endure forever. Like, he was a disciple of Cruyff like Cruyff of Michels and so on, but it's his way that became the "meta" and won him everything there is to win.
 Non-Toxic
Yeah but they‚Äôre all just from the Bill Walsh coaching tree
 Non-Toxic
I completely agree with Cruyff being the defining factor in Pep‚Äôs philosophy.   Having total faith in his teams ability to play as he has instructed no matter who they play is probably what defines Pep. A true perfectionist without seeming like it phases him.
 Non-Toxic
Juric, Palladino, Bocchetti at Verona(technically only an assistant due to patent shit but he was given the job at first), Sottil, all consider themselves disciples of Gasperini and play very similarly, the high line, back three, playing off pressing the opposition to retrieve the ball high, quick transitions, many players joining the attack...  It also helps that the model was used to turn a yo-yo team into at the very least a team that regularly fights for European places, and so obviously other midtable clubs want to follow in the footsteps.
 Non-Toxic
Yep, fair point. Albeit a Bournemouth side that at the time were bottom of the league
 Non-Toxic
Yeah but then you‚Äôll have to deal with all the casual fans telling you when you get beat that ‚Äúyou got found out‚Äù or going wow such amazing football lost 5-1 lololol   Ignoring the fact any newly promoted team is gonna be the underdog regardless of how they play

Well two of the relegated teams have absolutely shat the bed so that definitely plays a factor. If you rule out two then the third should really be massive favourites. I didn't expect Burnley to be that third at the start of the season though so fair play

 Non-Toxic
Yeah, probably. Don't want to take anything away from Burnley here but it's been a bit of a mess this season up the top. Sheffield Utd can barely keep the electricity on and they'll be coming up soon, Boro and Luton look like the only other promotion-worthy teams but somehow I'm sure fucking Preston or someone will get promoted instead  Norwich and Watford are still in the hunt and both have been pretty grim by their recent standards. I feel like Millwall usually the championship standard and it looks like they're going to crawl their way into the play-offs fairly easily

it's becoming more normal for the same teams to yoyo due to parachute payments

[Here's the list.](https://www.transfermarkt.com/championship/startseite/wettbewerb/GB2)  Burnley's total market value is ‚Ç¨132m. Watford are close 2nd with ‚Ç¨130m, but Sheffield and Norwich are at ‚Ç¨105m already and then it's ‚Ç¨82m for Boro and all others are ‚Ç¨70m and below.  So yeah, Burnley and Watford are clearly the most valuable teams in the Championship.

I still think Dyche could have kept you up, and you really shouldn't have got relegated. Regardless, impressive what Kompany has done and how your club has rebuilt - didn't expect to see you back up so quickly. Fans must be chuffed.

Dyche can only play one style of football and maybe it's enough to get you the occasional top half finish but that's about it. Kompany is already a better manager so it was obviously the correct decision.

 Non-Toxic
First.... *Knock on wood*   I could absolutely see some of our problems continuing into next year and I don't think we're just going to bounce back into top 4, but I don't really see it getting worse. Part of our problem this year was actually that we had too many players competing for the first team and rotation made it hard to find a stable starting XI. Selling a few players, even if one or two are big names will help in that sense.
 Non-Toxic

We came 10th in 15/16 and bounced back to win the prem in 16/17, yes man city were in a rebuilding period between 14-17 but we could definitely bounce back to 4th next season which I think all fans would accept after this season.

 Non-Toxic
Looked very lightweight and didn't seem to have the physicality for the championship and was a bit of a spectator. Got dropped and took him a while to work his way back into the team. For me I'd rather have him do that than be decent/average consistently all season - probably the first time in his career he hasn't been good enough for the level he's playing at and he's shown the mentality to improve rather than giving it the Billy big bollocks that we see so often from loanees from PL sides when they struggle in the lower leagues.  He's got good close control and decent awareness, intelligence and decision making in the final 3rd. He's a natural finisher as well and is surprisingly quick in a foot race. I'm still on the fence on whether he'll go on to be a top top player as he's still got a long way to go, but he's on a trajectory to be a similar style of player to David Silva.  Him playing with Ndaiye has done him a lot of good. Ndaiye has got that confidence, quality, and inventiveness that rubs off on everyone around him.  As for Doyle, he's crap and you should definitely sell him to us for a bag of crisps in the summer (assuming our embargo is lifted or if crisp-based transfer fees get around it).
 Non-Toxic
He's fantastic and he's still only out second best City loanee. Doyle has been even better
 Non-Toxic
I'm not holding my breath but I'd hope Rooney making it big too someday.

Could end up doing a Roy Keane who was class with Sunderland and turns out he's a piece of shit manager

Hard to replicate the success when you don't have the good 'ol Fergie Time
 Non-Toxic
Exactly - and to be honest given his failure to win the CL with City, you could argue that Pep's underachieved at City. Like... of course they win the league half the time with the most expensive squad in history, but it's Champions Leagues that set you apart.   Plus, achievements are relative to the money you spend vs the competition. If you spend 100 times the rest of the league put together and win 9 titles in 10, the best manager is the one that won the 10th.
 Non-Toxic
Or Pep is just a better teacher.
 Non-Toxic
i do think some of the difference is that part of SAF's success was his sheer force of will
 Non-Toxic
except none of them have shown the ability to Pep's playstyle. It just indicates Pep likes more tactically adept players.
 Non-Toxic
Pep is a tactic coach easier to copy that. Than whatever SAF was cooking.
 Non-Toxic
Gaslighting lol. Pep just is a better mentor and his pupils are proof.
 Non-Toxic
SAF left the coaching and tactics to his team and namely Carlos Quiroz for most of the 00s whilst he focused on management. United regressed really fast interns of style of play as soon as Quiroz left - with the gap no more apparent in the CL.   When SAF replaced Quiroz with Phelan and went back to classic English old school football with rigid wide players like Valencia they continuously floundered in Europe, tactically they were just poor.   It's probably because SAFs style is about the environment and team and people he put together to manage diff components and got the best out of them - the philosophy was dictated by his deputy who influenced the style of play far more than SAF (see the almost overnight difference in style of play from Quiroz to Phelan). Peps is lent far more into football philosophy.
 Non-Toxic

*"Absolute domination over an entire era of football"* despite only reaching 3 Champions League finals and not winning the trophy since 2011, or with his most expensively assembled team.

 Non-Toxic

Absolutely! It will be a tough tough season next year. But there is reason to believe and I will have the faith in Kompany!

What was that at the start of the season?  Using our market value after we've pissed the league is a bit stupid, no? Half our squad has doubled in value since August. Cause vs effect... think about it
 Non-Toxic
surely the team's value is at least somewhat a product of burnley's runaway success this season. in that sense its somewhat of a tautology to say the most successful team is the most valuable, because i mean yeah, obviously they are
 Non-Toxic
Ah yeah value estimates from Transfermarkt that literally increase because the players are playing well.
 Non-Toxic
Fair point, but also our team was gutted... I believe we had 6ish first team players from the previous season still on our books at the start of the transfer window? An average player cost of ¬£3m across 10 players to fill those squad gaps doesn't seem like a ridiculous over-spend.
 Non-Toxic
Idk, I've described teams that my Sunday league team have played as brilliant. Especially ones that have pissed our league.  If someone responded to that with "brilliant if you dont include Premier League teams. They'd be bottom 5 at least", they'd sound like a complete idiot.

It really speaks to the modern state of the Premier League that we all find that so remarkable, like sure it was to some extent and there are certainly other factors that make their particular season impressive, but also the top 3 of the table being exclusively big six clubs didnt happen until the late 90s. There used to be variation at the top, and now the idea of any of the other 14 clubs winning a title is literally the stuff dreams are made of. Kinda bleak.

I really appreciate the write up. Not surprised that the physicality of the league was a bit of a shock to him. He‚Äôs not a tiny kid, but that first time you get punched in the mouth it‚Äôs always a bit of a shock, but it does seem like since the new year he‚Äôs really been doing bits for the side.   Great to see so many Blades singing Doyle‚Äôs praises too. I never really thought he was good enough to stick at City, which is a bit sad given his grandfathers (Mike Doyle and Glen Pardoe) both played for City. Would‚Äôve been a great story for him and the club for him to kick on and stick here.
 Non-Toxic
Doyle has been well regarded in the past too, and got some first team minutes back when he was like 18/19, but I think that despite the fact he‚Äôs City through and through, he wasn‚Äôt good enough for the side.

 Non-Toxic
I'm not for a minute discrediting the value and solid recruitment for a large net profit. But that Burnley squad is still more than likely the most expensive in the league. Indeed [transfermarkt](https://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/championship/startseite/wettbewerb/GB2) has us and Watford far and away from the others in terms of estimated squad value.  Still great business by the club though, and interested to see how they handle the Premier league. If we can do to the bottom half teams like we dealt with Bournemouth in the cup then it could be a decent season.
 Non-Toxic
Patient and calculated possession is the future of football. The fact that he has a Championship side playing Pep ball is very impressive. But not only that, the players he brought in were identified to play that type of football well, like Ian Maatsen. Tells me he can successfully implement his style of football as well and identify players that will excel under his system.  I think it's hard to learn and adapt to the new, and to implement complex tactics especially with championship level players. I'm not saying Dyche is necessarily a bad manager, it's just easier to implement cross and inshallah, brexit ball, hard nose defending style of football than be able to explain and coach more complicated tactics.   Wtf do I know though, I'm just a commenter on reddit.

It's not just the Premier League, it happens in most European leagues and some others around the world tbh, and it's sometimes worse. Spain was dominated by Real/Bar√ßa for more than a decade, Juventus won 9 consecutive leagues, France was absolutely dominated by PSG, Netherlands is mostly Ajax vs PSV
 Non-Toxic
>and there are certainly other factors that make their particular season impressive  The fact they looked like they were going down until they won 3 of their last 5 games the season prior to finish 6 points above the drop is one.   You'd have to be a newly promoted team and win it to top them imo.   >also the top 3 of the table being exclusively big six clubs didnt happen until the late 90s  It didn't, but Man United were every bit as dominant in the league as Man City have been recently, it was basically Man United competing with one other club every season for 2 decades. They won something like 13 of the first 20 PL titles.  I feel like the PL title picture has always been pretty bleak tbh.

 Non-Toxic
I'm in no way an expert so could be wrong but from what I've seen this season arteta is just a little bit more direct on attack then pep has been. Pep loves to cycle the ball and have another go and while arteta does this too I feel that he always has the goal a little higher up his priority list. I think that peps caution prioritizes possession overall while arteta is pushing for chances. It's a nuanced difference but I think that peps absolute focus on possession comes from vast experience. He wants to avoid the painful games where the team dominates but ends up losing on the counter or through individual brilliance of an opposing player. As a result though he gets some games where play is cycled too much and no significant progress is made in the final third. I think that artetas system promotes beautiful and formidable football, but I wonder if it can withstand long-term pressure from the rest of the prem. I'm excited to find out
 Non-Toxic
Sick reference bro
 Non-Toxic
Yes they did but this is one of those ones where you need to have watched the football rather than pull out the stat from wikipedia. There was a clear gulf between United and the rest of the European giants in play style and everyone at the time knew it.  2011 especially, United had one of the easiest runs to the final anyone's ever had in terms of opponents, and Ancelotti inexplicably started an already shot and unfit Torres instead of Drogba in the semi which killed the tie for Chelsea in the only testy opposition they faced.   United reaching two more finals with the type of football they were playing is incredibly flattering compared to the actual gulf in quality.  United were dominated in both finals and I remember the mood and punditry before the matches, no one even considered they had 1% of a chance in the 2011 final.

Context is also a thing that exists...  > Would you say Bendtner was brilliant?  If I was talking about Danish strikers, maybe  > Would you say Stirling Albion are brilliant?  If I was talking about the Scottish League 2, yeah.  If I'm talking about Championship teams over the past 20 years, then yes, Burnley are brilliant  And my niece's painting may not be brilliant compared to classical artists, but she's 9 and it is brilliant. Don't view things as absolute descriptions, context is also important.

Jesus I hope a child never brings you a drawing
 Non-Toxic
Okay. Played some very good football. What are you basing your preconceptions on?
 Non-Toxic
The point is that you‚Äôre willfully missing the importance of context.   Just because someone says something is brilliant doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs brilliant compared to the most brilliant thing ever. It‚Äôs brilliant within context.   Just like your comment where you said Foden is ‚Äúamazing‚Äù. By your logic, you‚Äôre wrong for that because compared to the top players he isn‚Äôt amazing.   You‚Äôre being pedantic but can‚Äôt even follow the rules of your own pedantry. Weak.

Apart from it isn‚Äôt a ‚Äústat from Wikipedia‚Äù, is it? It‚Äôs a well known fact which makes you‚Äôre initial claim a load of nonsense.  You‚Äôre talking about United post-2008 like they were a Tony Pulis team or something‚Ä¶  Also, United beat Barca 1-0 over two-legs in 2008 getting men behind the ball and playing the way you‚Äôre criticising them for in 2009-2011.
 Non-Toxic
What SAF did for football and for united, will never be replicated ever again. Hopefully I'm wrong. Pep Is a phenom, a excelente coach and one of the modern marvels of the game, but my man has only ever coached a CL caliber teams w/ huge budgets! And that honestly works against his legacy.
 Non-Toxic
True. Although Burnley did buy some players and were 4th after the transfer window closed. Come December, they were 3rd. And they stayed there until April 1st. Burnley's market value was ‚Ç¨97m on March 15 and then ‚Ç¨132m on April 1st. That's an increase of 36%.  Nathan Tella increased from 4.5m to 12m. Brownhill from 9m to 15m. Beyer from 4m to 10m.   So in conclusion: Yes, their market value did increase due to their stellar performance. They were always a team fighting for promotion, but it's still a great achievement, no doubt about that.
 Non-Toxic
I don't have the time to rewatch every single Burnley game this season so I can come up with my own transfer values for them and the watch all the other games as well, so I can compare them. That's why I provide the list from a very well known and respected site. Is it perfect and 100% accurate? Is it better than anything me or you could come up with? Almost certainly.
 Non-Toxic

Oh, so he keeps scoring. Just one thing to say:  Siri, play Thuderstruck by AC/DC Bas Dost Version

I mean, you lost to a team that lost to Spakenb-  Oh.
 Non-Toxic
Yes. In fact, my local club is in USL League One so I try to go up to DC every now and then to watch MLS. I had no idea he transferred to DC United and got treated to this [dogshit penalty](https://youtu.be/tdtwlg7HPco?t=237) and had my PTSD of his time with Liverpool triggered all over again
 Non-Toxic
That‚Äôs a lie and a half. He was a regular starter and had a semi-public feud with Marsch while he was here. Would be flying under Gracia
 Non-Toxic
>You‚Äôre talking about United post-2008 like they were a Tony Pulis team  Well yeah compared to the First Pep Barcelona side, a Pulis side might have had a better shot in the 2009 final - United and SAF were shell shocked by just how good Guardiolas team was and it was like watching men against boys. United were basically spectators for 90% of the match and might as well have not turned up.   There's a difference between parking the bus in 2008 vs a less disciplined Rijkaard side and getting trounced off the pitch because your Manager misjudged the opposition and assuming the same tactic might work. SAF didn't come to play football in 2009 and he left Tevez out in naivety hoping Park and his engine could make up for the critical loss of Scholes.
 Non-Toxic
Pep promoted Barca B in his first season as a manager. Pep then won a treble in his second season ever with the first team. Since then he has been in such high regard that he's one of the few who would be completely trusted at any of the top clubs. Him not ever managing a lowly club says nothing of his legacy.  His legacy is that he's been a huge success from day 1.
 Non-Toxic

It is pedantic, because what they‚Äôve achieved this season is brilliant for the championship, regardless of their standing across England.   Pretending that because someone called Burnley‚Äôs achievement brilliant they‚Äôre saying they‚Äôre brilliant compared to City is asinine.   I agree with you that Foden is amazing. But by your logic, Foden *isn‚Äôt* amazing. You continuing to say that Foden is amazing is continuing to undo your shitty point.

Cercle is a stable of Belgian football with long history, could say the same about USG in Brussels, but in Li√®ge, there's no other historical club in the whole region that could rival Standard, RFC Li√®ge is historical but has become irrelevant and is mostly a second team for some after Standard and Seraing is just a bad and irrelevant club that managed to play two seasons in the top flight and will go back to obscurity again, not hard to understand the lack of fans
 Non-Toxic
theres only 2 games left in the regular season for the Belgian league, so it's not even early really

There's a ridiculous amount of football every single year, and things just blend together or are outright unremarkable - but that's one of the few games I very distinctly remember. Absolutely incredible ending.
 Non-Toxic
In 2013, Malaga FC almost reached the semi-finals of the Champions League, had it not been for BVB. The steep rise was followed by a deep fall. An investor was responsible for both.  **Lightning struck near Malaga in April 2013, first three times. Then twice.**  In the first case, it can even be taken literally. The Andalusians had scored a rather fortunate 0-0 against Dortmund in the quarter-final first leg of the Champions League and travelled to San Sebastian before the second leg in Westphalia. The plane was struck by lightning three times and had to make an emergency landing in Bilbao. They continued their journey by bus, losing the league match 2:4. As if the bad omens were not enough, coach Manuel Pellegrini learned of the death of his father before this match. The Chilean travelled home for the funeral.  And then, yes then, lightning struck Dortmund at Malaga. Marco Reus and Felipe Santana's late goals in the second leg made it the craziest comeback in the top flight since Barcelona. 2:3 after 2:1, Andalusian impotence in perfection. Or simply a "historic cruelty", as the Marca wrote. A caesura in the club history of the "Boquerones", the anchovies, as the club is called because of the regional speciality.  Yet the future around the "Rosaleda" had looked so rosy. In the stadium with the illustrious name "Rosengarten", illustrious players' names suddenly started to appear. Whereas at the start of the 2010/11 season the regulars were still called Jesus Gamez, Kris Stadsgaard, Apono or Seba Fernandez, a few months later they were Martin Demichelis, Julio Baptista (winter 2010/11 additions), Ruud van Nistelrooy, Santi Cazorla, Jeremy Toulalan or Joaquin (summer 2011). Later, Javier Saviola and Roque Santa Cruz also found their way to the Costa del Sol. They were joined by a teenager whose extraordinary skills sent the entire Spanish football world into raptures: Francisco Roman Alarcon Suarez, or Isco for short.  Malaga had wrapped itself in new chic robes, only the appropriate catwalk was still missing. But he was getting closer and closer: still 17th in 2010, already eleventh in 2011, then fourth in 2012 - Champions League!  But how did it happen that a club without a single major trophy in its cabinet suddenly found itself competing for the biggest one of all? And then crashed as brutally as someone slipping on an anchovy on the steep, breakneck stairs at the Rosaleda?  **Buying frenzy and empty promises**   It is once again the story of the rich investor who buys a new toy, eventually loses interest in it and then lets it rot in the corner. In May 2010, Abdullah Nasser Al-Thani, a member of the Qatari royal family, bought Malaga for 25 million euros, taking over the liabilities of 70 million euros at the same time. What followed was the aforementioned shopping spree, and Spain's largest youth academy with ten pitches and a new arena with up to 70,000 spectators was to be built on the picturesque Costa del Sol. The new name, however, would not have sounded quite as flowery as Rosaleda. It would have been "Qatar Stadium".  The "full-bodied announcement", as "Malaga Hoy" wrote in December 2010, was soon followed by no action. The desert money ran out, Malaga suddenly could no longer pay the salaries. Santi Cazorla fled to Arsenal FC in 2012, but with a transfer fee of 19 million euros he once again brought money into the coffers. Successful manager Fernando Hierro apparently also suspected bad things - the Real legend resigned in August 2012. In December of the same year, Malaga received mail from UEFA. The Andalusians were banned from the 2013/14 European Cup season for breaches of Financial Fair Play.  **G√ºndogan on cloud nine, Al-Thani accuses racism**  So if the Blue and Whites had actually won the Cup in 2013, they wouldn't even have been able to defend it. Or would UEFA have caved in after all, had the underdogs managed the big coup?  But the facts speak a different language anyway. For Ilkay G√ºndogan, the match was one of the "most beautiful moments in my life". For Malaga, a goal in which four Dortmund players, including the scorer Santana, were offside, was the final nail in the coffin. Al-Thani was furious after the match, even calling the incident "racist". They simply did not want to see his team in the semi-finals, he tweeted. However, he preferred not to mention that Malaga's goal to make it 2-1 had also come from an offside position.  The downfall now took its course. In the summer of 2013, successful coach Pellegrini left the club for Manchester City, and many stars did the same. Crowd favourite Isco moved to Real Madrid, also in 2013.  Al-Thani experienced all this from afar. The aloof sheik showed his face in Malaga maybe once a year - he gave his first official press conference in June 2016. By then, the club had long since sunk back into mediocrity. Then, in 2018, the time had come - it was off to League Two for Malaga. "Al-Thani, get lost quick," chanted the fans in the stadium. But he wasn't even there - as he always is.  **How low can Malaga go?**  Malaga is still in the 2nd division. Emphasis on "still". With eight matchdays to go, the Andalusians are eight points behind a non-relegation place. Three coaches have been worn out this season, compared to ten in the past five years. Since February 2020, the Boquerones have been led by Jos√© Maria Munoz, a court-appointed administrator. Al-Thani and his three sons Nasser, Nayef and Rakan, who are on the board, were deprived of their power by an injunction because of ongoing proceedings for abuse of office and money laundering. According to an audit, the family owes the club seven million euros.  However, they and their lawyers did not even appear at the trial. The judge announced that she would try to find the sheikh from Qatar through international administrative assistance. Another hearing in the "Al-Thani case" is scheduled for 21 April.  It is grist to the mill of all those who follow the entry of investors with a shake of the head. They will finally clap their hands over their skulls when they hear that recently the head of Qatar Sports Investments and PSG boss Nasser Al-Khelaifi deposited his interest in buying Malaga.  Incidentally, in 2021, exactly eight years after the Dortmund game, Al-Thani felt called upon once again to tweet about the match in obituary style. "9 April 2013, the day football was dragged through the mud by an institution called UEFA."  But on the Costa del Sol they have a different opinion about who really damaged football in Malaga.

Incandescent comes from Latin, originally meaning to glow white, as in to be white-hot. You know it from incandescent lamps - the old incredibly inefficient type of bulbs which are just glass with a tungsten wire, and it emits light by heating up the tungsten wire until it glows from the heat.
 Non-Toxic
you might be thinking of iridescent
 Non-Toxic
I think it basically means lively or stong emotional. I'm not sure I have ever used it before but it just felt right.
 Non-Toxic
The balls on this man
 Non-Toxic
You've probably been using it wrong... It means something is glowing hot (hence old style light bulbs with a filament being called incandescent lighting). Its really only commonly used to describe anger or outrage, I wouldn't refer to someone who was experiencing strong emotions of sadness or happiness as incandescent for example.
 Non-Toxic
It‚Äôs more like ‚Äúaflame‚Äù than lively. Angry to the point of explosion or bursting into flames.

Not been good enough in the final third in the first half, don't get me wrong from the get go I don't/didn't expect to win this game. I also don't want to lose the game because of the linesman's incompetence

Boro have pressed us really well in that first half, hopefully Kompany can sort out our playing at the back. Other than that I can't complain, let's score a few more though.

Muric man.  He has great moments, but it might be best to not have him around just for the sake of the cardiac condition of Burnley fans.  The man gives out too many heart attack moments

Burnley should be 3 up with chances they‚Äôve missed here but they‚Äôre making some little defensive slip ups too.

He got what he deserved. If he can't take it then dohe shouldn't run up the touchline antagonising the fans.
 Non-Toxic
In my head you guys will pass him back to us as we go past you down to the Championship and he will carry us next season.   Realistically he will sign for you and go on to be a success in the Premier League with Kompany at the helm.  I've always resented how little game time he got at Saints, watching him in the U21 was always exiting with his play style and tenacity.
 Non-Toxic
Fancy swapping them for the last couple games of the season?
 Non-Toxic
Just wish he'd be as commanding as his size suggests
 Non-Toxic
>Man  It's difficult on the Tella one, he was being fouled but also managed to shrug off the man, I'm sure he backed himself more to score there and to make it 2-0 than to get Boro down to 10 men.
 Non-Toxic
Man it was just too good of a chance to go down. He had to shoot it
 Non-Toxic
Tactical foul m9
 Non-Toxic
Our CB spot alongside Beyer is being shared by 3 other cb's the last 3 games. Benson once back at full fitness is on a par or better than Tella or Zaroury. Jay Rod arguably better than Barnes but been injured since the start of the year. Jack Cork is a good option when we need 2 holding cm's.
 Non-Toxic
Dont worry Lampard free in the summer.
 Non-Toxic
What? Gudmonson?   It was Roberts that was celebrating the goal and shushing you no?  Also, come on now. There is no excuse for throwing shit on the pitch
 Non-Toxic
We can do it like Jay Rod.  Jay started with us, had his most successful period with you then came home. A nice little reverse seems fair but that means we need a few seasons of Tella I'm afraid
 Non-Toxic
Atleast he looks good at claiming crosses.
 Non-Toxic
That's impressive then as I wouldn't rate this squad very highly necessarily, unless, a lot of those players have improved significantly from last season.  I don't feel like it's as good as Fulham last year or even our squad from 3 years ago but I might be wrong.
 Non-Toxic
Wash your mouth out please!!
 Non-Toxic
Whoever it was. Thought it was CR. Collateral damage so blame him.
 Non-Toxic
Barnes is definitely having a twighlight same with an injury free Gudmundson, where as Roberts and Brownhill have benefitted to playing more to their style.

Everyone is focusing on his left foot, which indeed cleanly takes away the ball. However his right foot is planted on the foot/ankle of his opponent. Second yellow might feel harsh, bit I think it's correct.

am I blind or why was that a foul? he doesnt even touch him... and where is fkn VAR?

Lmao
 Non-Toxic
Two soft yellows. RFEF is a joke
 Non-Toxic
So he obviously doesn‚Äôt step on his foot on purpose. Man, I don‚Äôt know. If I were a ref, I‚Äôd have a hard time giving a second yellow for that.
 Non-Toxic
Thanks for pointing that out, I watched that 5 times and didn't see him standing on his ankle till you pointed it out. Great catch by the referee too.
 Non-Toxic
Yeah it's not a scandalous decision at all. At first I was sure it was going to be overturned since he got the ball, but then I saw the stamp on the Celta players' foot  You can say that either of the yellow were slightly harsh so early into the match, but not wrong
 Non-Toxic
Broken for me too on most posts

Stands on his foot. Clear in the final replay.

Had to be him.  If this is the goal to take us up...then it just had to be him

The moment you want VAR in the championship, was nowhere near a goal in my books. Barnes shoulder was offside
 Non-Toxic
So if Burnley win here they go up, right ?
 Non-Toxic
Looked offside to me, but if we're going to get shafted by decisions let it be in this fairly pointless match.

It would be poetic for barnes to be the one to send us to the premier league as a final send off almost

he heard you talking shit
 Non-Toxic
I'm the first one to shit on the officiating in England but that would be a complete guess to the human eye
 Non-Toxic
Theres been massive doubts about his ability to play at this level most of the season, so he deserves this if it takes us up. He‚Äôs already a Burnley legend anyway and this would cement it even more   Expecting Boro to score though so it‚Äôll take more than this
 Non-Toxic
Agree tbh. Shouldn‚Äôt have stood. But by the same, Burnley should‚Äôve had a pen not long after.
 Non-Toxic
correct
 Non-Toxic
Yeah mathematically promoted, but honestly even if they lose all remaining games they're going up still lol
 Non-Toxic
Think it was offside, but we also had a nailed on pen waved away 2 minutes later.  Swings and roundabouts
 Non-Toxic
If/when you do go up do you think you'll be looking to get a new first choice striker or would you be happy with Foster/Obafemi/J-Rod?
 Non-Toxic
That wasn't a pen tbh. Brownhill goes down way too easy for me there.
 Non-Toxic
Nice one. Happy for Kompany too.
 Non-Toxic
Football doesn't work like that really, but I get the point.  Goal doesn't get scored, pen chance doesn't happen etc.  It's like when everyone brings up the Lampard goal v Germany and says "Well, Germany battered you 4-1 anyway".  Well yes, but that's because Lampards goal didn't count and changed the way we played.  Same thing with the offside goal here.   However yeah, it does tend to "even itself out".  Just wish Champ refs/linos weren't so shit.

Fucking pathetic. Porto deserved to win. Nothing more to say
 Non-Toxic
Porto totally deserved it. Embarassing game, especially the first half. Hope we can learn from this and bounce back against Inter. Losing against our rivals, at home and with such poorvexhibition is frustrating.
 Non-Toxic
well deserved win although it is impossible to win the league in my opinion.
 Non-Toxic
The typical story of renewing with a coach that's doing great and then suddenly turn into shit.   Hopefully this was just a one off and we bounce back against Inter.   Grimaldo looks like he's already thinking about his new club and we need to stop playing Aursnes as a winger. He does the job when we don't have other options, but when we literally have Rafa + Neres available it's dumb to bench one of them.
 Non-Toxic
Braga really fumbled the bag by not beating Porto. That chance wasted by Pizzi is gonna fuck them in the race for 2nd place. Now they are forced to beat Benfica in Lisbon in order to stay 2 points behind Porto and far away enough from Sporting (assuming that they win every other game). At the same time, a Braga win is gonna leave Benfica only 4 points ahead of Porto, and they also still have to play Sporting away. That combined with the UCL is gonna put an insane pressure on Benfica's team.
 Non-Toxic
Deserved win. We have to turn up against Inter now.
 Non-Toxic
Parab√©ns ao Porto, fez mais por isso.

So there's a chance

Porto could've won with an even bigger margin. They had a big chance in the second half. Had a 3 on 1 counter attack which they couldn't finish.

 Non-Toxic
I don't think it's that, I feel like this one is more the typical Benfica after a international break this season, super uninspired, even against Rio Ave we played like shit. Hopefully we can turn things around next game against Inter. Even so, I believe both Benfica and Porto will lose points until the end of the season, Benfica still has some tough games ahead and Porto has been playing worse against smaller teams this season. In my opinion we will still win the league, but it would be better if we didn't have to fight so hard in the last few games.
 Non-Toxic
The odds were not weird. We are playing shit and benfica wins every game. We have so bad wings that the discussion for where to put the airport should have ended long time ago.  I was not even watching the game because i already put in my mind that we would lose by 2 or 3.
 Non-Toxic
If only they played like this every time
 Non-Toxic
Super uninspired play by Benfica who scored first in the first opportunity they had. Porto always with more pressure and wanting to win. After Benfica was down we barely did anything to change the result, so fair result in the end.

I can see a breakdown happening here. The manager was nonexistent and we had no passion. I can't see us winning against Sporting tbh. The Classic is one of the biggest games we have every season and the mentality just isn't there. We had a little scare against Rio Ave that should've been enough to put us on alert for this game. But nope. We got the classic Benfica against Porto at home
 Non-Toxic
I made bank as soon as the referee was confirmed, everyone knew it was gonna be him anyway. The odds kept rising for some reason but they didn't account for the Proen√ßa factor

2-1.

Taremi went absolutely braindead for a second
 Non-Toxic
Worst counter I‚Äôve seen
 Non-Toxic
Someone switched Taremi during the World Cup and sent someone else.
 Non-Toxic
Think he has played a lot of minutes over the past few seasons. This with all the issues before and during the World Cup has had an effect. Even then, he scored you the winner today and has (I think) 24 goals and 12 assists so far this season across all competitions. On track to go over the 40 mark combined again. Tremendous.
 Non-Toxic
Yeah, he got amazing numbers in the first half of season, but since January he only has 5 goals and 3 assists, and has a lot of wasted opportunities like this, he's collapsed incredibly this last few months
 Non-Toxic
I think the team as a whole has collapsed slightly. Was always going to be hard with the players you have lost to maintain the top form that you had. I think this loss of form also coincides with Evanilson‚Äôs injury issues, they really did build a good connection with each other.  The chance tonight, he definitely should do better with, not arguing with that but strikers tend to blow hot and cold. Hopefully he picks up his form with what is left of the season.

HELL OF A GAME, as in Dante should be narrating it.  Lecce playing out of their minds, we look utterly gassed, Hjulmand needs to be bought yesterday, Simeone got injured, Anguissa looks ready to retire, that own goal was something out of Milan last season in terms of luck, I have no idea how we can even dream of walking out of the pitch alive Wednesday.   #But it doesn't matter because it's -4. The four days of Naples.   DiLo complaining because the ref whistled before Politano could score is the attitude we need. Every point, every goal, every metric must be ground down.
 Non-Toxic
An entire season of perfection and we end up playing like shit in the most important month of our history. I want to die
 Non-Toxic
It is going to be interesting to see how Napoli play in the Champions League.  They do not look like what we have been used to this season.
 Non-Toxic
It's so weird that Spalletti chooses to take off Lozano earlier than Kvicha. Chucky gets rest here and there alternating with Politano, but Kvicha barely gets any. Lozano was also performing solidly defensively, though everyone underperformed in general by a mile. They all looked so gassed, maybe apart from Di Lorenzo but he never tires.  Zambo and Lobotka, too. They looked jaded.
 Non-Toxic
It‚Äôs funny how Lozano and Politano are never in form at the same time.
 Non-Toxic
Pioli's luck is immense: first Osimhen and now Simeone, our man of destiny.  Congrats on the CL win Milan.   Also let Politano score FFS, fuck you ref.    Bombel√® played decent I guess

If Napoli doesn't recover Milan would finish it in the first leg
 Non-Toxic
Not cool move by the ref at the end.

well congrats to Milan I guess, if we play like this it's over by first leg
 Non-Toxic
Lecce has been a tough place to play for every top team this season. Getting a win is a solid result, especially without Osimhen and Zielinski.
 Non-Toxic
Not like I am super aware of the the depth terms of Napoli's squad, but seeing the comments about the team being gassed reminds me of how surprised I was before the Milan game, given that they kept playing the starters non stop.

Do we have a replay of the final whistle? I had to stop watching and want to see what happened.
 Non-Toxic
Napoli is done physically. They have walked on the pitch.  There is no way this team in this status without Oshimen nor Simeone can even came close to Milan in the first leg.  They are going out easily but I think they will win the scudetto no problem.

Think they‚Äôre pretty safe to drop off a little in the league. Only need like another win or two to seal it. As long as they can turn up in CL
 Non-Toxic
I think it's 4, assuming Lazio wins every game from now on. Napoli needs 12 points to secure it and everytime Lazio loses points, it's as if Napoli gains them. So yeah, it's theirs.
 Non-Toxic
Comentator mentioned 12 points from possible 30 so damn near impossible to bottle this
 Non-Toxic
Four. Three if Juve wins tomorrow.
 Non-Toxic
They need 9 more points I think
 Non-Toxic
Four
 Non-Toxic
four
 Non-Toxic
4 if Lazio wins and my calculations are right
 Non-Toxic
No rest for core players + a lot of matches over winter period.
 Non-Toxic
Napoli‚Äôs winter downfall has been delayed by climate change
 Non-Toxic
Lack of victor,
 Non-Toxic
You can understand the frustration when the ref allowed Lecce to have 2 corners after stoppage time but wouldn‚Äôt let Napoli score on an empty goal.
 Non-Toxic
This so much. Championships aren't decided by the 4-0 blowout victories, they're won by all of the bad matches where you win with a goal difference.
 Non-Toxic
Exactly, you could be us with all the lost points on top of playing like shit.
 Non-Toxic
This. Most title-winning teams in competitive leagues usually end up winning gritty matches by the end of the season. That was the case for Leicester in their miracle year
 Non-Toxic
Don't know
 Non-Toxic
Never underestimate Napoli superpower of bottling stuff at the end of the season lol
 Non-Toxic
This. Spalletti ruined the team by making 0 changes in already won matches.
 Non-Toxic
Sure but in this case, the game was over and in favor of Napoli, why collectively go mad at the ref lol
 Non-Toxic
Will remember our XAV1 ball 1-0s for years to come
 Non-Toxic
Spalletti has a well established track record of being horrible with rotating. However I think Napoli are too far ahead now for it to have any serious negative implications.
 Non-Toxic
that's like the best thing of this match  they showed they at least care and try every minute they are on the field  they still sucked and had a terrible performance, but at least the spirit is there, and it's that spirit that brought Napoli on such big margin so far
 Non-Toxic
Denying goals is never cool, it's in the essence of the game to have as many goals scored as possible. I think it wasn't a good move by the ref, seeing how reluctant he was to whistle while Lecce was pushing. It's not only about the end result.
 Non-Toxic
Because if he isn‚Äôt gonna allow Napoli to score on an open gol he should have blown the whistle 30 seconds earlier
 Non-Toxic
Not in the league but in the ucl
 Non-Toxic
Liverpool fans should be tried at The Hague for selling us on what a good player Origi is.
 Non-Toxic
Why even celebrate and waste time if you know it hit your arm lmao
 Non-Toxic
time to learn chinese origi
 Non-Toxic
If Origi didnt play there would be literally no difference
 Non-Toxic
No sane manager that fights for CL spot would play Origi, but here we are
 Non-Toxic
I feel like a front two of Colombo+Daniel Maldini could do much better than Rebic+Origi
 Non-Toxic
Empoli getting 4 points at San Siro.  Bigger than la Viola in my book
 Non-Toxic
Empoli are so fucking harmless in attack
 Non-Toxic
congrats Pioli, you dit it once again
 Non-Toxic
It‚Äôs crazy how dogshit Inter and Milan can be and then they‚Äôre still both playing in CL
 Non-Toxic
Are they resting Giroud and Le√£o for CL?
 Non-Toxic
How is Origi so slow wtf
 Non-Toxic
whats going on with ibra is he just a fossil on the bench now
 Non-Toxic
Is there anybody who actually likes this Milan kit?
 Non-Toxic
Heeeey we have that chant too. Wait does Milan have a PAOK inspired chant too? Cause ours doesn‚Äôt have any ooooh in it. The chant is 100% a rhyme. Still. It‚Äôs nice
 Non-Toxic
Never a pen
 Non-Toxic
That would have been a crazy decision
 Non-Toxic
[Origi in this thread](https://media.tenor.com/vDnVbNdoCisAAAAC/bow-arrows.gif)
 Non-Toxic
The commentator on BT sounds so fucking exasperated
 Non-Toxic
What a shit game
 Non-Toxic
Come on Milan, you can't possibly win 0-4 away to Napoli and then fuck up against Empoli at home?!
 Non-Toxic
Origi is useless
 Non-Toxic
I would rather see Sulley Muntari or Djamel Mesbah up front.
 Non-Toxic
Wow this game is an absolute eyesore
 Non-Toxic
How long will it take Pioli to sub Origi and Rebic? Its like he doesnt want to win
 Non-Toxic
FFS get Origi off the pitch
 Non-Toxic
He really played Origi and Rebic for 70 minutes.
 Non-Toxic
Giroud has 43 pace and 85 finishing how does he do it  Edit: handball ü§ß
 Non-Toxic
No man of God, despite Giroud being so sexy
 Non-Toxic
Lmao. Life is pain rn for Milan fans. Also how come he didn‚Äôt go to check it and just went with the var. weird.
 Non-Toxic
Timori yellow after game hilarious
 Non-Toxic
I'm 100% confident on an Empoli win
 Non-Toxic
I hope origi won't be with us next season, he is dead weight. I was hopeful for him but no
 Non-Toxic
That was painful to watch
 Non-Toxic
Rebic wont score even if he was the only one on the field
 Non-Toxic
Divock Origi.
 Non-Toxic
This ref lol
 Non-Toxic
What's the point of Onigiri?
 Non-Toxic
That correct VAR intervention absolutlely killed Milan, because since then they have been poor.
 Non-Toxic
Milan-Empoli was wild in the reverse fixture, only fitting this one has a dramatic ending too
 Non-Toxic
Haha Milan just can't
 Non-Toxic
This game should've had had like 20 mins extra time, there's barely been any actual play in the second half
 Non-Toxic
HAHA PURE IL CORAGGIO DI CELEBRARE HAHAHA
 Non-Toxic
Great origi out, now milan can play 20 minutes 11 vs 11 since the donkey is out where he should be
 Non-Toxic
LORD DIVOCK
 Non-Toxic
Does anyone remember the match between Barcelona vs Milan at the 2012 CL?  Do you consider it one of the most entertaining matches within the Champions League history?
 Non-Toxic
Competition between Milan players of who can shoot worse is heating up
 Non-Toxic
From the looks of it Bennacer is the one playing trequartista
 Non-Toxic
How is de ketalarae or what‚Äôs his name for Milan? Did he turn out to be epic gamer or mediocre at best?
 Non-Toxic
It hits his head, no penalty and good use of VAR

Always a boring game when opponents defend with their entire team. ü•±

 Non-Toxic
thank fucking god
 Non-Toxic
I am done lol
 Non-Toxic
What a pointless yellow from Satriano
 Non-Toxic
I remember so many Liverpool fans were sayig Origi could score 20 goals in Serie A and for some reason I was actually lowkey optimistic.   But what a dud this guy's been. I'd unironically take Destro upfront instead of him.
 Non-Toxic
They never saw him play for more than a few rate cameos, where he did pop up with important goals. But god is he shit.
 Non-Toxic
He grew up in an era without VAR.
 Non-Toxic
Worked for Udogie last season who scored with his arm, didn't celebrate as he thought goal would be disallowed but it wasn't
 Non-Toxic
Chinese is the past, he should learn Arabic and start fast because its one of the hardest languages
 Non-Toxic
Might even help Milan
 Non-Toxic
They didn't even try, don't remember the last time there was a team with 0 intention in going forward, literally 11 men in their penalty box
 Non-Toxic
Hopefully not next year
 Non-Toxic
Yes, among others.
 Non-Toxic
They‚Äôll be all playing by 60‚Äô
 Non-Toxic
Terrible strategy when they desperately need Serie A points and their back ups are Serie B level
 Non-Toxic
Yeah, he's done. They announced this week he'll leave at the end of the season.
 Non-Toxic
Took me a minute to even realize it was Milan
 Non-Toxic
I like it tbh
 Non-Toxic
Bought that kit this year in Milano actually. I love it
 Non-Toxic
No.
 Non-Toxic
Why they playing in that kit??? Not red black?
 Non-Toxic
As promised in the Lecce/Napoli thread, you're here.  Are you also doing the Salernitana v Inter, Lecce v Napoli, and Milan v Lecce marathon?
 Non-Toxic
Can you blame him? This match is absolutely dogshit. 0 shots from Empoli and 17 from Milan but they dont even look close to scoring
 Non-Toxic
You expect anything more from that team?
 Non-Toxic
Never let them know your next move
 Non-Toxic
That sounds entirely in character. I mean you started with a dreadful team, this was always likely imo
 Non-Toxic
Muntari had some bangers, tbf.
 Non-Toxic
Describes watching Juve, Milan and Roma all season.
 Non-Toxic
It's like offside, there's nothing to judge from him subjectively. Did he score with his arm? Yes. There's no reason for him to watch it as well
 Non-Toxic
Because you can't score with a handball even if it's accidental, so it's an objective decision that doesn't require an off-field review for the referee to assess.
 Non-Toxic
What does he have to check? Didnt even hit his head lool
 Non-Toxic
Seeing Milan's lineup it's not unlikely.
 Non-Toxic
Good luck selling him. He has a 3 years left on his expensive contract.
 Non-Toxic
They dont deserve to win this game.
 Non-Toxic
ü§åü§å
 Non-Toxic
The last sentence is wildly exaggerated, with the rest I agree
 Non-Toxic
I agree with the general premise, but in this specific situation it's not wild for Giroud to have thought he scored legally with his shoulder. In the heat of the moment your senses don't work all that well.
 Non-Toxic
Not even top 20 for me.
 Non-Toxic
You come from the future?
 Non-Toxic
So far haven't scored a goal. He will eventually get there. He have lots of talent. So for now, mediocre at best.
 Non-Toxic
Huge flop
 Non-Toxic
It is, but we've wasted like 10 mins already in giving and taking away penalties
 Non-Toxic
Sadly, thats half the teams
 Non-Toxic
You were saying?
 Non-Toxic
Meanwhile its been 6 years with VAR
 Non-Toxic
When they tried the play counter attack the Empoli play was always half as fast as the Milan defender
 Non-Toxic
> They announced this week he'll leave at the end of the season.  Where was this announced?
 Non-Toxic
So they can sell this kit
 Non-Toxic
No just the two games. Both are an eyesore hehehe
 Non-Toxic
Not at all. It's been dire.
 Non-Toxic
Yeah I thought the procedure is different. Probably is but they didn‚Äôt do it for the sake of time saving cause added time
 Non-Toxic
I think the procedure is to call him to see it anyway cause he has to have the final call but they skipped the thing to save time.
 Non-Toxic
Yeah but I think the ref needs to check it with his eyes. The var needs to call you to see it not tell you what is and isn‚Äôt. I think that‚Äôs the standard procedure
 Non-Toxic
Maybe he can go to Saudi league lmao
 Non-Toxic
Oops missed the thread
 Non-Toxic
Agreed, we need to be more direct
 Non-Toxic
delete this before you jinx it
 Non-Toxic
Bad habits die hard
 Non-Toxic
Caputo isnt really known for his speed
 Non-Toxic
Are you surprised? Did you think he was getting a new deal? He's 42 in a few months lol
 Non-Toxic
You are not wrong.
 Non-Toxic
Who could have seen that coming
 Non-Toxic
Doesn't have to do anything with that
 Non-Toxic
I dont think he has to have final call if the VAR tells him it's a clear handball
 Non-Toxic
The Saudi's probably arent that stupid, but I'll let you dream üòÑ
 Non-Toxic
hehe I know, but it was funny
 Non-Toxic
You need to be more skillful and creative. You seem to have few ideas other than crosses into the box.
 Non-Toxic
Great start to the weekend for the Roman teams. We can celebrate together for a rare change
 Non-Toxic
I'm just asking to show me the announcement that he'll leave at the end of the season. Should be really easy to do if there is one, right?
 Non-Toxic
You're replying to a different person than the one who made that statement. I don't google things for people who are too lazy to do it for themselves, but I also saw it reported.
 Non-Toxic
I know you're not the same person, but since your comment doesn't add anything to my question or provide any useful info, I might as well ask you as well.  Because who in their right mind calls a rumor the same as an announcement?
 Non-Toxic
Is that the hill you were looking to die on?  Clubs dont make official statements mid season that an expiring players contract wont be renewed. It just doesnt happen. What you're asking for doesnt exist.
 Non-Toxic
> Is that the hill you were looking to die on?  There's no hill here to die on, because there's no ambiguity. It's simply pointing out the false claim.
 Non-Toxic
You're weird, you know that right?  You could have just said 'this isnt an official statement' instead of all this performative question asking

 Non-Toxic
The Sevillanos got tired
 Non-Toxic
The other one was removed now
 Non-Toxic
The first 20 minutes until the red card were very intense and end to end, obviously the red card is going to change the flow. If anything it's impressive that Sevilla can keep a good team like Celta to such few chances with 10 men, considering our defensive woes
 Non-Toxic
I hope you still tuned in for the second half, that was great

As much as constantly being relegated to this league is depressing, it‚Äôs an absolutely barmy party to be a part of.   You cant beat it
 Non-Toxic
Sums up this season for us, moments of brilliance and moments of madness in equal measure. Credit to Hull, they kept fighting and deserved something from the game.   People will make a big fuss about this game being the end of our playoff hopes, but we‚Äôve only won 1 in the last 9, so really those hopes ended a while ago. Still have to be pleased with how well we‚Äôve coped given this is our first season back in the championship.  Also Amad Diallo is absolutely dynamite and I am already sad that he‚Äôll be off at the end of the season.
 Non-Toxic
great, now Boro Burnley is a guaranteed 0-0
 Non-Toxic
The LAST moment of the game, what a silly penalty to give away with the final challenge of the match.  What a match! Most entertaining league in the world

Best match of the championship season imo. End to end with some brilliant play and silly defending.  You can unclench now Sunderland/Hull fans
 Non-Toxic
Gutted for sunderland but that was a nuts game and a tie is probably what was deserved for both sides
 Non-Toxic
Incredible
 Non-Toxic
Definitely penalty. Sunderland games have been very entertaining
 Non-Toxic
Such a dumb challenge in the last seconds of the game
 Non-Toxic
What a game. Lovely end to the game as a totally neutral fan.
 Non-Toxic
Disappointing from our perspective as it could have given us a slim chance of playoffs but probably deserved given the nature of that game. Great watch regardless
 Non-Toxic
I didn't watch the game, but I am rather invested because of Amad Diallo's loan to Sunderland, and I have a question: Did it warrant going to ~8 minutes extra time with only being +4 added originally? I would lose my head if the opposition had a penalty 4 minutes after the game should have ended lol.
 Non-Toxic
Definite penalty. We dominated them. One of those days
 Non-Toxic
I love this game, shagged by injuries, 3 centre forwards injured, youth team striker injured as well. we somehow score 4, up the bloody Tigers.
 Non-Toxic
One of the best games of the season
 Non-Toxic
Games like this are what make the Championship great. Wow, what an 8 goal thriller.
 Non-Toxic
Ooh, that‚Äôs gonna leave a mark
 Non-Toxic
i''ve missed a cracker lads
 Non-Toxic
Going away from goal and a defender is covering....Ekwah dafuck.
 Non-Toxic
Can‚Äôt believe it. What a game
 Non-Toxic
Insane game
 Non-Toxic
Nope
 Non-Toxic
I managed to miss every single goal in this game.
 Non-Toxic
The silver lining as I watch Forest slide towards the relegation zone is that I know the Championship is pound for pound the most entertaining league in world football
 Non-Toxic
I am friends with somebody whose favorite club is a Championship/Ligue 1 yoyo club and has been for years.  I asked him if he hoped one day they'd get promoted to the Premier League and he just said "no, absolutely not I'd rather they go down to League 2"
 Non-Toxic
TBH wouldn't mind our playoff chances being over, we're not going up so if there's no chance we can stop playing the loan players and start developing players like Ba, Lihadji and Bennette who have been on the fringes
 Non-Toxic
Finally Amad looking like the ¬£30m youngster we knew he could be. Thank you to Tony and Sunderland, has been a fantastic loan
 Non-Toxic
Nope
 Non-Toxic
Just basically had to stand there and block the shot. No idea what he was thinking.
 Non-Toxic
I believe it was 5 added minutes, but the penalty was given at 95' and it took about 3 minutes to take after all the commotion.
 Non-Toxic
Dominated is a strange way of looking at it.
 Non-Toxic
Aye, this is the first season in ages where the PL is more entertaining than the Championship. Mostly because Burnley and Sheffield United have had top 2 on lock for ages now. QPR's collaspe has been entertaining though.
 Non-Toxic
Being everyone‚Äôs cup final is no fun tbf
 Non-Toxic
Neither is watching you be picked for the TV game every fucking week
 Non-Toxic
I miss sustained periods of Saturday 3pms so much. Unless it's on a Tuesday night, 7:45 kickoffs are absolute dogshit
 Non-Toxic
Awful for us too, especially if you travel over for matches. Absolute nightmare trying to plan in advance when Sky are changing the fixtures left and right.
 Non-Toxic
I was wondering who they‚Äôd show on TV constantly after us and Villa went up. They don‚Äôt really have a cash cow anymore do they?
 Non-Toxic
What‚Äôs wrong with the Tuesday games, quite good to go to a match after work
 Non-Toxic
it's a lot more balanced this season tbf, Sheff Utd and Boro, Norwich when they're good and Sunderland are probably the faves
 Non-Toxic
Tuesdays are the only good ones - Monday and Friday evening games are absolute shite, as are the later games at the weekend
 Non-Toxic
Monday night is so grim. Always think of this bloody Sunderland game where I had the worst day at work, it pissed down all night, then Defoe scored in the 80 something minute at Selhurst. Got home so wet and miserable.

Really poor play by the defence and gk

Napoli is finished. They have no more steam, they are physically done. There is no way this team even come close to play against Milan. Easy 2wins and Semis for Milan.

When's the earliest Napoli can confirm it?
 Non-Toxic
No x Milan
 Non-Toxic
They get lucky and they don't even need to get lucky at this point lol

Don't think Gallo does much wrong tbh. That ball was easily catchable for the GK. He's the one who fucked up.

Is this an anulo mufa thing or you're serious?

 Non-Toxic
Oh yeah luck.Simeone injured is luck.
 Non-Toxic
I disagree, he shouldn't be playing it to his keeper from such a close distance, especially if he can't get it under control
 Non-Toxic
Absolutely serious. Napoli has been gutted with double injury on the center forward (both Oshimen and Simeone are out) and the National Break has destroyed the team physically.  They got smaked by Milan 4-0 at home and they are walking on the pitch.  I‚Äôm going to bet 1k euros on milan passing the turn tomorrow.
 Non-Toxic
I doubt he tried to pass it to the keeper. Seems like one of those instances where you don't think the ball will make it to you. You have guys jumping in front of you covering your view of the ball and none of them get a touch on it.
 Non-Toxic
I wouldnt be so sure.Champions is a different thing from Serie a,plus Osimhen is supposed to play with milan.
 Non-Toxic
Probably will not be able to or will be just turning back from a muscular injury.  As I said I‚Äôm going to bet a shit ton of money on milan tomorrow

The entire league are pussies and play like rabbits in a trap against all the big teams, apart from a few inspired ones every now and then.

Lmao absolutely not

Porto's ideology is so be against the Lisbon teams, especially Benfica.
 Non-Toxic
Nobody lied; It's well known that most clubs were paid extra to win vs the big portuguese clubs.

Portuguese league summed up

not only in football. sometimes I compare ourselves to the Catalonia vs Spain feud

I think the most comparable rivalry is Ajax vs Feyenoord, Rotterdam never wished to be independent from the main government just like Porto never did.
 Non-Toxic
On a smaller dimension, it is comparable.

Properly watching Amad play today, he definitely has got to be in the squad next season. From the second I saw him I knew the talent was there. To see him now putting in performance after performance is great. Now let‚Äôs see if he can do it in the prem. The right side is there for the taking if he wants it

He's still a bit inconsistent but when he's on it he's unplayable in the Championship.

Should definitely loan him back to you again your manager has handled him brilliantly

That‚Äôs expected from a young player though so I don‚Äôt mind it. Especially from one who is having his proper first season of first team football

We'd fucking love that like but think it's v unlikely. Would imagine hell be in and around your first team next season.

I would be pissed if this was the other way around.

Thats 4cm more offside than Darwin‚Äôs last year

 Non-Toxic
how can VAR judge a "6 cm" offside ?   What a joke
 Non-Toxic
Offside rule change when
 Non-Toxic
It is what it is, I think the rules are bullshit too. But we also had goals disallowed in the same way.
 Non-Toxic
6cm, Jesus
 Non-Toxic
The robbery omg, the players are aligned. If there are a few cms between them, it's the Benfica player that looks slightly in front.
 Non-Toxic
Must be nice having a 6,5cm dick
 Non-Toxic
Must be nice
 Non-Toxic
I mean, we had a goal disallowed for 2cms against Porto just last season.  Also in the 18\19 Allianz Cup, the Rafa play, don't remember how many cms, but same shit.
 Non-Toxic
This man from GolTV asked if his fingernails were too long
 Non-Toxic
Technically not wrong, the top of the arm, from the shoulder to where a short sleeve ends, is still considered fair game and counts for the offside
 Non-Toxic
Still less than aboubakar offside call a few years ago, that's the best offside call I've seen up to this day
 Non-Toxic
Yeah me too, red for Benfica and blue for Porto. I was so confused
 Non-Toxic
It's coping brother
 Non-Toxic
as long as its more than 0cm its offside, 1 over is still over.
 Non-Toxic
Last year Darwin had a goal disallowed for a 2cm offside, so it's still 4cm bigger
 Non-Toxic
Because there are cameras and systems to draw these lines perfectly?   If anything it's one of the few VAR scenarios that really isn't up to debate
 Non-Toxic
now even the VAR tech is against Porto...
 Non-Toxic
It‚Äôs actually 7 but I get what you say
 Non-Toxic
6.001cm dick
 Non-Toxic
I was pissed in those occasions as well!   At least, in this instance, it‚Äôs been consistent.
 Non-Toxic
-2m offside? Yep, still offside
 Non-Toxic
Its fine
 Non-Toxic
ok so the final decision only made on "when the guy in the VAR car press on the pause button" cause in this case if you just look the frame (1 micro second sooner) the guy can be onside   &#x200B;  that's why 6cm offiside is pointless
 Non-Toxic
One frame before the one that they choose and it's not offside. It is what it is, but we can never know for sure if he really is offside or not.
 Non-Toxic
Perfectly? Surely you must be joking.
 Non-Toxic
Can't argue with that logic, fair point.
 Non-Toxic
thanks mate
 Non-Toxic
Pretty sure they choose the latest frame before the ball leaves the foot, which is the correct way to judge it.   One frame before and it's not really the accurate way to judge for an offside.
 Non-Toxic
What's not perfect about it?   In a stadium with multiple cameras that allow for a perfect view of the play, this is literally done via computer where there's no margin of error...

 Non-Toxic
They have lost 10 league games already.
 Non-Toxic
Inters primavera players have been put on loan so long some are approaching their mid twenties.
 Non-Toxic
His contract ends in 2024
 Non-Toxic
What happened? Inter we‚Äôre more ambitious at the time but their owner is in deep trouble.  I know it‚Äôs popular to shot on Calhanoglu but there was no way for him to know this would happen.
 Non-Toxic
When he said ambition he meant an extra 500k a year.
 Non-Toxic
Yes, I meant next year.
 Non-Toxic
After winning the league Inter had already lost Conte, Hakimi, and Lukaku had one foot out the door by the time Hakan arrived. How was there no way for him to know what would happen? The Inter management has been 'broke' for a few years too, the writing was literally on the wall
 Non-Toxic
The only kind of ambition that matters! Get that bag!
 Non-Toxic
1,5. It was 500k for the first year but it rose to 1,5m after that
 Non-Toxic
He might have agreed the deal verbally with Inter before all of that became evident.  It's not like Milan's financial and sporting situation was looking great at the time either
 Non-Toxic
He only signed for Inter like a month after Eriksen collapsed and it became evident he couldn‚Äôt play for Inter again. By then all of the things I mentioned had already happened. He had no agreement with anyone before that   Our financial situation has been great ever since elliott took over. We‚Äôve literally had no problems whatsoever
 Non-Toxic
Signed officially, that's why I said agreed verbally. They could very well have been talking for some 6 months prior to that and agreed verbally at some point, without him knowing how the full picture would look at the time he did sign.       And do correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't Elliott take over Milan like a year afterwards?
 Non-Toxic
That didn‚Äôt happen as Inter were counting on Eriksen. Eriksen had just started playing well (that season) and became an integral player for their system so there was literally no reason for them to go after anyone. Hakan was negotiating with us well into the season until inter came in after the eriksen incident and offered more. Ibra, who at the time was very close to Hakan, said himself in his own book that Hakan would‚Äôve never joined Inter without the eriksen incident   And no, Elliott took us over back in 2018. Redbird bought us from elliott last year, though

 Non-Toxic
> They've been outplayed since the start.  More likely the strategy is to hold back and let Porto have the ball, because they'll be applying a high pressure anyway and we can be quite clinical on the counter (and TBH are better defensively).  Not working as well as they planned (not the first time the season, we haven't been particularly successful any time we try to speculate the game), but despite having more % possession, Porto isn't creating much. "Outplayed" is a bit of an exaggeration.

For some added context, Farrelly originally retired in 2016 after a car accident. What we didn't know at the time was that for years Farrelly had been sexually abused by coach Paul Riley, with that information coming out recently after reporting in the Athletic and later an independent report commissioned by US Soccer as well as an NWSL/NWSLPA joint investigation. This year she got invited to the NY/NJ Gotham's preseason and earned a contract, and she just made her first NWSL appearance since 2015. And now obviously has earned an invite to represent Ireland.
 Non-Toxic
Big Irish head on her. Fit right in.
 Non-Toxic
Also she reportedly rejected a roster spot to be on the USWNT‚Äôs Squad for the 2011 FIFA Women‚Äôs World Cup due to comments that Riley made to her saying that she shouldn‚Äôt be on the national team  unless he was the coach of the USWNT

I suspect it has something to do with the fact that the ball was moving away from the goal line before hitting Diogo's back. But don't quote me on that.

Pretty sure that if the ball isn't going in from the initial strike, it's considered an own goal.

Pode ser a azia que est√° a fluir no meu sistema, mas julgo que o Soares Dias n√£o tem estaleca para manter os cl√°ssicos Benfica vs Porto controlados. Para ambos os lados.

 Non-Toxic
If we loose, there is a some room for Porto to recover 7pts (we have a harder schedule, will play vs Braga at home and Sporting away, and they may capitalize on their momentum).   A win or draw leaves us with a 10pts ahead with 7 games left (and head-to-head advantage, so 11pts in reality), while not certain it's unlikely we don't win the league.
 Non-Toxic
Winning pretty much seals it imo. Losing it, Benfica can still lose their game Vs Braga and the game Vs Sporting and still be 1 point ahead
 Non-Toxic
If we draw I think it's pretty much over.   If we lose then all it takes is a loss to Braga and Sporting (which are both a very realistic result) and it's only a 1 point lead.   Of course this assumes Porto never slips up and wins every game.
 Non-Toxic
13 points ahead with 18 points to go.

I think benfica prepares these matches differently but in a more tactical approach porto does this but they play their guts and hearts out I don‚Äôt have problem admitting that porto and it‚Äôs hatred for Lisbon and benfica which we see it as system and the rival to beat made us grow in the big team we are nowadays ‚Ä¶ if you prepare the match well in terms of studying the opponent his strengths and weaknesses and you are superior in strategy and you joined that with that heaven shaking motivation you win all matches , problem for porto players is that understandably they don‚Äôt bring some of this passion against weaker opposition in the league
