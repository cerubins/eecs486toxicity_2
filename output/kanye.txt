Non-Toxic
ok 👍🏼
Non-Toxic

You’re right. They have bots downvoting comments that mention that and upvoting comments that provide links to the thing.

Both of you created your accounts 12 days ago and were only active on one other sub before this. OP posted comments on r/memes and the commenter above only commented on r/politics.  The photo also looks like bad AI. This is the easiest scam to detect.

It would be cool but it sadly wouldn't get much attention, not worth it in my eyes

Core memory is me and my best friend in like 5th grade planned to perform The Light to our crushes. That song is amazing, can appreciate it at any age. The feelings it evokes and sentiments it holds, I’ve felt that way about a few special people in my life.
Non-Toxic
one of the first rappers from chicago to go big, love him.
Non-Toxic
Really great rapper and person in general. Be is one of the best albums of the 2000s
Non-Toxic
So I had to did what I had to did
Non-Toxic
Just watched him in "Hunter Killer" last night, his acting is pretty meh.
Non-Toxic
his first album is better than most others released in the past 10 years.
Non-Toxic
Truthfully I wanna rhyme like Common Sense   But I did 5 mill' – I ain't been rhyming like Common since
Non-Toxic
Fantastically underrated.
Non-Toxic
 I was at the gym and a nigga said I looked like him l, didn’t find it funny.

Non-Toxic
His name common, his steak rare.
Non-Toxic
Great rapper. Worked very well with Ye. Chi-Town connection.  Has a great discography even outside of Ye as well. He always said he wishes he would've done a third album that was produced by Ye after Finding Forever, and I agree.
Non-Toxic
Nothing
Non-Toxic
great rapper. Glad he rotated to film and got the bag
Non-Toxic
Has a dope flow- real MC.
Toxic
Uncommon these days.
Non-Toxic
Unfortunately hasn’t really put out anything that worthwhile after the 2000’s but his prime was legendary
Non-Toxic
I love his head. Its so shiny.
Non-Toxic
southside is a banger
Non-Toxic
Like a lot...and he was great in Hell on Wheels.

good john wick character

Absolutely. Harder than most think, exceptionally talented. A rapper's rapper.

Non-Toxic
This is what happens when you been taking L's from too many people .....Started with Push...now clowned by Melon .  Shit would really  fuck your brain up.
Toxic
corny ahh nigga
Toxic
Looool kanyes used a similar line before if I recall correct
Non-Toxic
Something along the lines of "Is that a black card?! Oh why yes but I prefer the term African American Express."
Non-Toxic
I found it.   “I ain't tryin' to stress my wealth But sometimes I gotta American Express myself”
Non-Toxic
George Bush doesn't care about black people
Non-Toxic
I actually read the whole hit piece and I lost what little respect I had for the rolling stone.  He spends 10k a week on sushi for these kids and they are trying to frame that as a bad thing.  The school has a dress code and it’s not even a full uniform.  Finally, the article is the definition of a hit piece as it doesn’t give any perspective of his side or even say they reached out to his people.  Even with it being a hit piece and them trying their hardest they can’t make the school seem bad at all.  Big F for the failing stone magazine
Non-Toxic
Ye must be making powerful political moves to be getting hit pieces like this written about him. When did Rolling Stone become hard hitting journalism? YE24
Non-Toxic
I mean I’ll take the sushi
Non-Toxic
That used to be the case...but he's been crushing on Michelle now for many years.
Non-Toxic
Technically according to the department of health and other sources, raw meat must not be offered on children's menus. So I assume this falls in the same category.
Non-Toxic
I think you read it...if you did...with Ye colored glasses.  You picked out the minor things and did so out of context.  The lawsuit is about wrongful dismissal and withholding of pay, not about sushi or uniforms.  Those things are only part of the situation described, which present such allegations as part of an abnormal and unsafe environment for education.  That when concerns were expressed about this the teachers were wrongfully dismissed and threatened not to try and contact Ye.  These are the facts of the suit, and no undue emphasis is made on the "weird" parts by Rolling Stone.    You act like they made the lawsuit themselves to attack Ye.  Nor did they choose to cover this story when no one else did out of some attempt to bully and target him...just about every news outlet, mainstream and otherwise, has prominent coverage.
Non-Toxic
No… Kanye should not be president
Non-Toxic
More like leaving a worthwhile vision in the hands of unqualified and inept administrators.
Non-Toxic
you mean "Gyöngyhajú Lány"?
Non-Toxic
Yes
Non-Toxic
Fair enough, thanks
Non-Toxic
No, that’s my theory as well. Donda seemed to be all of the elements listeners enjoyed of all of his albums. Come to life is runaway. New again is flashing lights. Off the grid is can’t tell me nothing. Ok Ok is Black skinhead…if he makes another album I can’t even comprehend what it would sound like or be about; maybe healing?
Non-Toxic
i understand all of those except how is ok ok similar to black skinhead?
Non-Toxic
damn.

Some honorable suggestions: Facts (Charlie Heat version) Slow Jamz /Diamond in Sierra Leona
Non-Toxic
BASED
Non-Toxic
Valid but I think We Major is pretty overrated. Good but it’s not touching my top 20 at all
Non-Toxic
1. Flashing Lights (Whenever he say some mad shit I put this on) 2. Runaway 3. Hey Mama 4. Two Words 5. Blood on the Leaves 6. Famous 7. All of the Lights 8. Life of the Party 9. 4th Dimension 10. Stronger
Toxic
not enough on sight
Non-Toxic
Why? It’s a great song
Non-Toxic
Why it's an amazing song, I've listened to the rest of the album multiple times and nothing is more replayable than all falls down
Non-Toxic
FR it’s not even too 5 for me
Non-Toxic
Spaceships>>>
Non-Toxic
The funny thing is that TLOP is right below this top 10, I love Waves, 30 Hours, Wolves, Famous, Saint Pablo, etc
Non-Toxic
I like Lost in the World but it's not top 10
Non-Toxic
Lost in the world literally has an audio error in it that song ain’t underrated
Non-Toxic
Def not top 10
Non-Toxic
Yeah I don't really get why Bound 2 isn't more popular in r/Kanye   New Slaves and Black Skinhead are great but I just don't listen to them that often
Non-Toxic
i’m not saying it’s an amazing song, i’m just saying there’s way better songs on the album i prefer over it. also i’ve kinda played it out a bit lol
Non-Toxic
Have you considered the fact that you lack taste?
Non-Toxic
Wait what?
Non-Toxic
that’s not that crazy of a take  we don’t care, never let me down, through the wire, family business, last call  and if last call isn’t enough of a “song” to put in there i can see an argument for jesus walks. personally i’m taking all falls down in my top 5 but there’s definitely an argument to be had.
Non-Toxic
You’ll never be able to unbeat this but at 0:54 it cuts, kinda annoying
Non-Toxic
Ok tbh... This aint a fair discussion bc TCD has like 10 top 5 songs
Non-Toxic
Bro where is spaceship new workout and two words

Yess, adds a lot to the energy
Non-Toxic
💀💀💀the line had me dead when i heard it first
Non-Toxic
It’s only over rated because there are some popular meme type lyrics in it, don’t think I need to really type them out for you to know what I mean lol  My personal favorite on Ye is No Mistakes, instrumental and the energy in Kanye’s rap verse are really good imo
Non-Toxic
i havent listened to ye recently, imma go relisten and give u my thoughts on what really holds up but i love all mine lol
Non-Toxic
It’s very different compared to the other songs on Ye, but don’t you think it’s essential on an album about being bipolar and having mental issues
Non-Toxic
No mistakes is so underrated. Don’t get how it’s the least streamed on ye
Non-Toxic

beggars cant be choosers i guess, very weird thing to say in my opinion.  Don't mean this in a hateful way just feel bluffed
Non-Toxic
Yess i get what you saying. Not trying to say anything about the song, was rather expressing my love for the sample
Non-Toxic
Just now, when he saw your post.
Non-Toxic
he has a sex addiction 100%, that's probably his main hobby
Non-Toxic
Every day. That woman who he is paying to be his fiancé said she is cool with the situation but his tubby, smelly, crazy body will not be sweating all over her. Even Kim had her kids by surrogates because she is so grossed out by him. Can you imagine how bad his breath stinks?
Toxic
In the studio but albe back did it for him
Non-Toxic
I don’t know but I orgasm’d last time I heard devil in a new dress just like always when I hear that song (I will never love a woman as much as I love that song)

Frank
Non-Toxic
The obvious answer is Kendrick but I’d rather see Cole imo. Let Kendrick do Kendrick and see how amazing Cole’s album would be with the Ye feel. Hopefully we get Be exec producer instead of Nasir exec producer
Non-Toxic
Nas… uhm yeah  but fr 3k or frank would be dope: would them make dropping an album :)
Non-Toxic
Ye
Toxic
Probably going to get hate for this but J. Cole.  Coles early mixed tapes he rapped over hella Kanye beats and did very well on them.   I think it’d be pretty cool to hear him rapping over some original beats, but it’ll never happen 🤷‍♂️
Non-Toxic
Justin Timberlake. He collects super producers like Infinity Stones

Eminem  carti Uzi

Drake. I think this would be his way back into the good graces of the world. Team up with someone who is so big and undeniable with music that is unmistakably Kanye as well. It’ll be too good to ignore and have all the air play needed to bring Ye back.
Non-Toxic
bladee
Non-Toxic
Dua Lipa. Ye crushes it at genres where the odds are stacked against him imo. He’d create an album like nothing we’ve ever seen

I’m with this one all the way. Some true Kanye music with 3stacks. Man. I’d go buy an actual fucking CD because “if you’re like me, you’re reading the credits right now”.
Toxic
So good on paper but it would suck in reality.  Just like the Nas album, Kanye consumes too much of the project instead of being a guest producer, it becomes his sound/his album, with a guest rapper.
Non-Toxic
He has his own distinct sound tho idk that’s be a cool duo album tho

I feel like it would end up like “Testing”, which is my favorite asap album.

I genuinely think it would turn out good because Kanye is great at catering beats to almost anyone. A more layed back vibe or even some slightly futuristic stuff like Dua Lipa on the Law of Attraction or On God. Also it would be so crazy to see the reactions to that online and in the media.

She’s worked with kendrick and future before so… 🤷‍♂️

Ye that would high key be fire, also I think McCartney sought out Ye to produce Egypt Station but he was busy so he got some others to do it. But I think if Kanye cleaned himself Macca would definitely be down.

I can only handle so much of Griselda. But the songs I CAN handle are fucking dope. The problem is I love their “lo-fi” (I hate to use such a corny word) beats so idk how well they’d do with Ye.

Reading this comment section has made me realize how much we couldave gotten if kanye had strayed a bit away from the religious expression and the politics and the fashion. Nothing against religion but kanye wouldave been insane if he just went around producing albums for people rather than voice his opinions and sh
Non-Toxic
Which one?
Non-Toxic
Have you heard his latest album “Call me if you get lost”?  If you dont like then no. But i think its some of his best work. Kanye’s touch could honestly make tyler go from an 8 to a 10.
Non-Toxic
Dr. Dre being a perfectionist is also the problem, dude dropped an album in 1999 and then dropped his next one in 2015.  Yes, I know that he was producing for artists like Eminem, The Game, 50 Cent, Kendrick Lamar etc. but Detox needs to come out before I die.

I don’t cole is a better core rapper than Kendrick imo,just not as creative 🤷🏽‍♂️
Non-Toxic
and we literally have kids see ghosts too
Non-Toxic
no, Kanye executive produced the album which is basically just choosing the beats and helping with the creative direction... He didnt make any of the beats for the album tho
Non-Toxic
In fact, in the recent deluxe version of Call me if you get lost there's a song that Kanye produced and it's SO good, plus Kanye also featured on the song "PUPPET" on IGOR
Non-Toxic
I really think Tyler’s the only artist on kanye level, skill wise. His videos, production, lyricism are all insane and league ahead of his peers. I feel like he’s still slept on despite his accomplishments. Plus his performances go insane
Non-Toxic
Dr. Dre produced — Use This Gospel (feat. Kanye West & Eminem) on Dj Khaled’s album & that shit was disappointing. I love Dre & Eminem but it’s just too hard to shine when the subject is Christian worshipping
Non-Toxic
it was a joke
Toxic
He fell off hard after “The Big Day”
Non-Toxic
Ok but then it would basically be a Ye album. Like Cole is creative in his albums in the way he does his own beats and production and everything, but he can't get to Kendrick level in the other terms.

...can't find the source for this particular article, but it looks like Rolling Stone broke the news originally. Might be true. In any case, Rolling Stone loves taking potshots at Ye.  Looks like the lawsuit is filed by two people, surprising considering there could easily be more if the claims are true and unlawful.   Not-using the second floor isn't illegal as far as I know, nor are sushi lunches, or not-providing colouring books. Crossword puzzles are not mandatory teaching materials either. Don't know why that's mentioned except to drive home the point that Ye is 'crazy'.  Sorry to hear that there was bullying, but like... it's a school...  https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/kanye-west-donda-academy-sued-firing-teachers-code-violations-1234710863/

Oprah's school has been open since 2009 and has mostly been criticized for its lavishness.  All of its students are fully supported and most of its alumni have gone on to lead productive lives.  The school itself was a result of conversations with Nelson Mandela.  &#x200B; "Winfrey received much criticism surrounding the "extravagance" of the school, with mention, among other things, about the need for high thread-count sheets for the dormitory beds, a beauty salon, two theatres (one indoor, one outdoor) and a yoga classroom to educate girls in an impoverished region of South Africa"
Non-Toxic
>Rolling Stone loves taking potshots at Ye  Lol, that's what you take out of this?  Man, this story has been reported just about everywhere and the original "source" is the lawsuit itself.  Every major new organization is covering it; here is one from the LA Times:  &#x200B;  *latimes.com Sushi for lunch again: Kanye West sued over Donda Academy conditions - Los Angeles Times Christian Martinez 5–6 minutes*  *At Kanye West’s Donda Academy, the performer’s Christian K-12 school, students were subjected to unsafe, unregulated and unsanitary conditions, two former teachers allege in a lawsuit against West and others filed this week in Los Angeles County Superior Court.*  *Cecilia Hailey and Chekarey Byers, the only two Black female teachers at the school, were fired after they voiced concerns over the conditions to administrators, according to the complaint.*  *The school, named for West’s mother, operated in Simi Valley before moving to its current location in Chatsworth, according to California Department of Education records.*  *The women are suing West for retaliation, wrongful termination, discrimination and withheld wages.*  *West’s attorney, Gregory K. Nelson, declined to comment on the lawsuit, saying he had not seen it as of Thursday afternoon.*  *Hailey, in an interview Thursday with The Times, said she was “very, very disturbed” by what she saw in her time at the school.*  *“We are responsible to make sure that we’re giving children a quality education, and when you don’t, you are really disturbing the life of that child,” Hailey said. “That’s just not right.”*  *According to the complaint, Hailey was hired as a substitute teacher at Donda Academy in the fall, around the time West made a series of antisemitic comments on social media and in televised interviews.*  *In the wake of the comments, West was dropped by his talent agency, CAA, and Adidas ended its partnership with the rapper. The sportswear company stated that it expected to lose nearly $250 million because of the move.*  *Hailey said she had seen interviews West had done prior to her hiring but said, “I didn’t go into the school because it was Kanye West’s school. I went into the school because I was asked to go, and I got there and I saw a need.”*  *Hailey said students were not exposed to anything antisemitic or politically charged in the curriculum but noted that there were restrictions placed on what could be covered in classrooms.*  *“They definitely wanted to suppress a lot of information in reference to history,” Hailey said. “They didn’t want the kids to know really about African American history or Asian American history.”*  *The Holocaust was also omitted from Donda Academy curriculum.*  *On at least three occasions, Hailey said, she voiced concerns to the principal, identified in the complaint as Moira Love, that the school was not complying with health and safety or educational regulations.*  *Hailey also attempted to discuss her concerns with West but “was threatened not to reach out to him.”*  *Byers also complained to Love about the the school’s conditions.*  *Teachers at the school were not required to have first-aid or mandated child-abuse reporter training, and state regulations regarding educational services and individualized learning plans were not being followed, the complaint says.*  *The school did not have janitorial services, with West barring the use of cleaning products with chemicals, or proper trash cans, according to the complaint. Teachers were only allowed to clean with “acid water and microfiber cloths.”*  *The school also lacked a school nurse and medical supplies, and medications were stored improperly.*  *One student’s EpiPen to treat allergic reactions was stowed above a microwave, the plaintiffs allege.*  *The school also allegedly failed to implement protocols related to bullying.*  *“In one incident, a student assaulted an eighth-grade student by slapping her, then attempted to assault another teacher,” the plaintiffs’ attorneys wrote in the complaint.*  *The student “went without discipline.”*  *As for nutrition, Donda Academy students were fed sushi — and only sushi — every school day and were made to eat lunch on the floor, as the school did not have tables, the plaintiffs alleged.*  *“Students were not allowed to bring any outside food or anything other than water,” attorneys wrote in the complaint.*  *Although the plaintiffs described the day-to-day operations of the school as lacking structure, West demanded that certain rules be strictly enforced.*  *He required students to dress entirely in black, and they were restricted to the first floor of the building because, the complaint alleges, West is afraid of stairs.*  *Students were not allowed to use utensils, and neither students nor staff could wear jewelry, according to the complaint.*  *After Hailey and Byers lodged their concerns, no action was taken by school administrators. Love allegedly told Hailey and Byers they were “aggressive.” The pair were also shorted up to $2,700 per paycheck, they allege.*  *Last month, as the two teachers arrived for work, they were met in the parking lot and told that they had been terminated.*  *Hailey said she believes there are others working at the school who are afraid to speak out about the conditions.*  *“They are afraid to speak up because they are afraid of being fired or ostracized” or losing out on money, Hailey said. “But that is not what we get in this business for. We get in this business, if we get into it properly, to educate kids.”*

I think I'm feeling the kids who I guess have to sit on the floor and eat shit they don't like because he likes it. Or I guess go hungry if their parents don't pack them food which according to the article many parents did not and so the kids just didn't eat. Mo money mo problems

It's not illegal i just find it funny that Kanye's scared of stairs

with 100 students and 5 meals in a week, that is $20 per each sushi lunch.

Non-Toxic
Ok. Thanks, I guess?  I'm not sure that Ye is responsible for the mismanagement though. Like, no furniture, wearing all black and no jewelry sounds Ye-ish (and somewhat strange), leaving african/asian american history and holocaust education out of the curriculum is concerning but variations of this aren't unheard of in other schools across the US, and not necessarily Ye's direction. Though it might be.  Witholding payment and lack of first-aid / abuse report training are the only points that seem flat-out illegal (or should be) but I doubt those are the result of Ye's doing. He may have put incompetent people in charge, and he might be liable for that. The court will decide, I'm sure.
Non-Toxic
>The school did not have janitorial services, with West barring the use of cleaning products with chemicals, or proper trash cans, according to the complaint. Teachers were only allowed to clean with “acid water and microfiber cloths.”  >The school also lacked a school nurse and medical supplies, and medications were stored improperly.  So there was no one to clean up the school, they wanted cleaning products with chemicals, and parents were ok with no school nurse? All this while paying a tuition I am sure was high?   Let's just say I'm not entirely convinced lol

It is funny, but I doubt it's true.  Or rather I'm sure the upstairs rooms weren't used, I just doubt that a fear of stairs is the reasoning for it.
Non-Toxic
At the very least, I doubt her school is mismanaged and that its administration is lacking in qualifications.
Non-Toxic
5 - 6 minutes is beyond your capacity....that's the modern generation, lol
Non-Toxic
The lawsuit seems mainly about wrongful dismissal and failure to pay salaries.  The rest of it gives the context.  Many of the things described might not be illegal, but teachers expressing concerns is not illegal either and should not be grounds for firing or withholding pay.  That it was "only" two teachers is specifically addressed.  They were the ones who were fired...others would naturally be fearful for their livelihood.
Non-Toxic
>and parents were ok with no school nurse? All this while paying a tuition I am sure was high?  The tuition was $15,000 per student, though many received financial assistance.  There were about 100 students and the school wasn't open for very long, so perhaps the parents were not yet aware of any sup-par conditions that those who worked there might have experienced.  Private schools and charter schools are very prone to management abuse, they even lack the regulatory oversight that accreditation might provide.  Conservatives like them because they can lessen money spent on education and even divert some of *that* money into corporate coffers (which run many of these schools).  It is entirely credible to me that this school also fell prey to this pattern, though of course I do not believe that it was Ye's intent to do so.  It may even be a case of certain entities or persons exploiting Ye for their own financial profit.
Non-Toxic
Judging by how Kanye has been acting these past times... yeah no I definetely believe that he would be afraid of stairs
Non-Toxic
I don't doubt people being afraid to speak out if their livelihood is on the line, I'm just not sure that it is a result of Ye's action or direction. Seems like he surrounded himself with incompetent buffoons, which is a shame.   I'm not sure the additional context illustrates anything except a picture of general weirdness. Not un-like maybe a potshot...
Non-Toxic
Donda academy has been open for 1 year and this is the first lawsuit filed by SUBSTITUTE teachers, other teachers had no reasonable fear of being fired if problems were running rampant. There are teachers on social media who gush about the school. When Donda's basketball team was taken out of the championship for Ye's remarks everyone was mad and said the kids should play and not be punished. When Donda reopened there was no issue with re-enrollment. There was no known issues with the school prior to this. There were a bunch of videos about what they do.   Was everyone scared of Kanye?
Non-Toxic
Or maybe he would justify by saying he was scared for the kids, that they might trip or something.
Non-Toxic
> I'm just not sure that it is a result of Ye's action or direction.  Isn't that the purview of the court?  And I gather that Ye was not the only respondent.  What purpose would these teachers have to take an unwarranted "potshot"?  And why shouldn't teachers be allowed to express their concerns over conditions under which they teach?  Why should speaking up in such a manner be answered with withholding pay and dismissal?  And if these things were "not the result of Ye's action or direction" surely he has the ability and power to make redress? Seeing as how the teachers likely have no ability to contact Ye directly, wouldn't such a suit be good and proper?
Non-Toxic
>Was everyone scared of Kanye?  That's not my takeaway...even the plaintiffs said they wanted to contact him, but were threatened not to.  Other than this story, I don't know much about the schools...I do have a bias against religious schools in general, as they can indoctrinate and, in my opinion, damage developing minds.  If this particular school was mismanaged, I strongly doubt that it would be Ye's fault, certainly not to the extent of tolerating unsafe conditions or even firing teachers who express concerns.
Non-Toxic
Oh no, not the teachers - they can and should be able to raise concerns about the curriculum, and without fearing for loss of livelihood at that.  ...with that said, I once was a teacher, and my contract was not renewed for the specific reason of being 'overly critical'. It happens.  The potshots are taken by media outlets. The headline is not "Donda teachers' payment witheld", it's "Sushi for lunch, weird dress codes, and Ye's afraid of stairs".
Non-Toxic
Since when should you believe headlines?...and there are plenty media outlets which are much more straightforward.  [https://www.theroot.com/kanye-wests-donda-academy-hit-with-wrongful-termination-1850312409](https://www.theroot.com/kanye-wests-donda-academy-hit-with-wrongful-termination-1850312409)  [https://www.billboard.com/pro/kanye-west-sued-donda-academy-teachers-wrongful-termination/](https://www.billboard.com/pro/kanye-west-sued-donda-academy-teachers-wrongful-termination/)  Even your own citation, Rolling Stone, the headline is fine and mentions nothing about sushi or stairs.  [https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/kanye-west-donda-academy-sued-firing-teachers-code-violations-1234710863/](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/kanye-west-donda-academy-sued-firing-teachers-code-violations-1234710863/)  I copied here so you don't have to scroll up.    Firing teachers.  Code violations.  Isn't that what you wanted?
Non-Toxic
It isn't really about what I want, but ideally, headlines are credible, and indeed some are.   Some (like the Rolling Stone article) lead with the core of the issue, then elaborate into irrelevant details (or potshots). Then there's articles that lead with clickbait and then proceed into irrelevant details, also potshots.  Nobody has to read or believe anything though. It's fine, I just figured it might be important to discuss what's weird v.s. what's actually not legal.
Non-Toxic
ok, we're not going to change the news business, especially in this age.  But I might argue that some or even most of the "weird stuff" is relevant in providing context.  Namely why these teachers expressed concerns in the first place, which allegedly caused their wrongful punishments and dismissals.  The allegations would seem to add up to an unhealthful work and learning environment.  From violations of safety codes, to regulations which might make students uncomfortable.  Add in a seeming rigidity that rejects improvement or criticism.  The stairs issue...closing off entire spaces which might enhance usage of the facilities.  Even regarding the sushi...what about any students who might be vegan?  Or allergic to raw fish?  Again, the context of all this is not irrelevant if it is indication that the educational needs of both students and teachers are not given proper priority.  So its not really weird vs. not legal...but rather weird vs. not relevant.  I reread the Rolling Stone piece...it doesn't really get into what might be deemed "irrelevant details" until near the end.  And the final paragraph is as follows:  ​ *"Hailey claims she complained to Donda Academy’s principal/director, Moira Love, on at least three separate occasions, but “no action was taken to remedy” the issues raised. Instead, the suit claims, Love called Hailey and Byers “aggressive” in front of others, which the plaintiffs believe “facilitates stereotypes about African-American women as being confrontational simply for doing their job and voicing their legitimate concerns in order to provide a safe environment and proper education for their students.” Hailey also tried to raise some issues with West himself, but was allegedly “threatened not to reach out to him.” "*  There seem to be very little, if any, "potshots" in this article.

You could probs argue this for all ye’s albums ☺️
Non-Toxic
It’s my favorite. Its the album in Ye’s discography that feels the most groundbreaking. I was a huge DG fan when it came out and I stupidly ignored it because people said it was biting that sound.   After listening to it dozens of times you can tell it has some industrial hip hop influence but it also stands alone as a singular piece of pop culture.
Non-Toxic
No I don't because I'm a fucking moron

Yeezus tied with TCD yes
Non-Toxic
The way I see it, and this is just my observation, a lot of younger people rate it higher, I’m 30 btw.    I feel like if you got into hip hop in the late 90s/early 00s, it’s a toss up between MBDTF, College Dropout and Late Registration. To me, Yeezus is good but it’s not in my top 3
Non-Toxic
I think it’s his best solo album. I don’t think it’s perfect by any means, but it’s very enjoyable. Like a low 9 imo. KSG is his best project overall.
Non-Toxic
it’s top 3 for me, behind college dropout and graduation.

It’s probably my least favourite Ye album

new slaves is my fav kanye song too! the transition at 2:51 always makes me tear up a little “I’m not dying, and I can’t lose” line really took me aback when I first heard it. i hope they collab again in the future. Ik a lot of ppl coin yeezus as a very wild album (and it is) but the range of emotions expressed from on sight to guilt trip and the diversity/creativity in his choices in yeezus will always make me treasure the album.
Non-Toxic
Did you make this?
Non-Toxic
Nope, just came across this on YouTube.
Non-Toxic
I hope Kanye has a verse in it.
Non-Toxic
He does, but only if you play it in reverse.
Non-Toxic
Hi guys, I'd like you to meet Jonah.
Non-Toxic
Where's KSG 2 ?
Non-Toxic
Hands up bitches, give me all Yo Doge Coin !
Toxic
Kiss and make up already
Non-Toxic
A couple weeks no talking, I seen my baby… I’ve missed you so damn much, hey…
Toxic
Hey Kanye, do you like fish dicks? And if he said yes I would ask If he likes putting fish dicks in his mouth
Non-Toxic
"Guys please just make up and create KIDS SEE GHOSTS 2"
Non-Toxic
"This ghosts you speak of, are they in the room right now?"
Non-Toxic
Why are you in the same room together? I knew it was a fake ass beef
Toxic
I’d shoot the stoner twice
Toxic
Not allowed to say that word here
Non-Toxic
Which Jonah?
Non-Toxic
I was today years old when I learned Kid's see ghosts is Kanye and Cudi. Ironic since I love them both and consider myself a huge fan of their work.
Non-Toxic
What if instead of all their Doge coin they offered to make a song together with you?
Non-Toxic
Did you just assume he identifies as a gay fish?
Toxic
Didn't know they were currently at odds
Non-Toxic
Lolololol wow that's funny. You put the " " quotations simply to indicate that what you would say is between them correct?  So you are quoting yourself and would say  This ghosts you speak of, are they in the room right now?  I feel dumb as hell but I thought it was scripture or possibly something to do with God at first.
Non-Toxic
Cause love always wins.
Non-Toxic
Would they know what you mean by that?
Non-Toxic
What would they say back?
Non-Toxic
Jonah the Great Peacemaker
Non-Toxic
Did you just wake up from a coma?
Non-Toxic
No I was just asking him whether or not he likes fish dicks in his mouth
Toxic
is this a troll post?
Non-Toxic
I'm a living movie so I quote myself.
Non-Toxic
They’d be dead
Toxic
Sorry I tried to Google who that is and couldn't get an answer. Could you enlighten me?
Non-Toxic
Lol well I have had a bad car accident that makes remembering a large period of time very hard. But 2018 is mostly outside that period so it's ironic I missed it.
Non-Toxic
Who is asking?
Non-Toxic
Don't know what that means lol. But that's probably why I was cast as a random on Reddit in your movie lol
Non-Toxic
Jonah, not a mountain, nor swallowed by a whale.
Non-Toxic
Don't tell me u missed the story of adidon
Non-Toxic
Okay so Jonah Hill right?
Non-Toxic
I don't know what that is without googling it lol. What's adidon?
Non-Toxic
Brilliant deduction, Sherlock.
Non-Toxic
Drakes son, Pasha T dissed drake and the song was called the story of adidon
Non-Toxic
Poppty scoopty drake has a son with pornstar yeuuggh
Toxic
this shit so fire it put me to sleep
Toxic
He still mad about Lift yourself
Non-Toxic
The dude is just a corny fuck.  Really? Another song about not wanting to be in the club and hoping the right girl comes and save you?  How many of these same ass songs you gonna make bruh?
Toxic
Not worth of being a single
Non-Toxic
no lie, this shit made me yawn
Toxic
Drake a true 🐀
Non-Toxic
Takes some nuts to diss a man that’s already down. It’s funny how he waited until this moment to diss Ye.
Toxic
Kanye gonna drop a diss track lmao
Non-Toxic
Lyrics sound like chat gpt
Non-Toxic
is he still beefing with ye or is he being petty ion even know it but the songs fire
Toxic
If this a hit on ye nigga is corny asl
Toxic
this song was fire,    a dumpster fire
Non-Toxic
Drake is Jewish, remeber that.
Non-Toxic
Drake is so petty first the x disses now this
Toxic
L, do this when Ye is healthy, not now
Non-Toxic
This song was so bad even compared to Drake's recent work
Non-Toxic
Song is mid
Non-Toxic
drake should really stop. he’s one of the lamest and most annoying artists in the mainstream.
Toxic
This sub is obsessed, it’s like a gossip sub.
Non-Toxic
Lol he always drops disses when people are down. Reminds me of the cudi incident
Non-Toxic
Drake really got the critics on his side back again after Her Loss only to drop a song that's personified midness
Non-Toxic
kanye may be a nazi but that’s just mean idk i feel bad for him
Toxic
When Yeezy season comes around errbody gon shut up watch
Non-Toxic
Y’all actually sleeping on this song, it’s fire on mute.
Non-Toxic
Petty ass Drake. What’s new?
Toxic
This single has to be an AI test. The vocals do not sound like Drake and are robotic as shit lmao
Toxic
every time they make up, he disses him. drake is rl a weirdo
Toxic
Song is mid, beat carries
Non-Toxic
Whats with the mixing of this song, especially his voice lol
Non-Toxic
Kim fuckin with drake now my god
Toxic
NotLikeThis
Non-Toxic
I don’t get the hate this song is great. And I tend to hate everything new this guy puts out  But I know Kanye is mad as can be rn
Non-Toxic
Unpopular opinion the song is good
Non-Toxic
Everyone in this comment section is obsessed with people that will never bat an eye your way. They don’t even know you exist. There’s grown men in here acting like children speculating random shit y’all make up in your head.
Toxic
Why is drake riding bitch?

Shit straight 🔥🔥🔥 Dreidel gang strong fuck a Nazi

Kanye meat eaters are so funny. This song clears any song or feature Kanye has had since Donda🤷‍♂️
Non-Toxic
Drake has officially jumped the shark.
Non-Toxic
BruH so much for the Larry Hoover concert
Non-Toxic
UNPOPULAR OPINION 😱😮🙊:  Kim K is a thot.
Non-Toxic
Straight Akademiks
Non-Toxic
Still can’t believe Ye pooped on Drake’s beat. Finesse of the decade 😂😂
Non-Toxic
Facts
Non-Toxic
Until people stop listening
Non-Toxic
ANOTHER song about Jesus? This guy..
Non-Toxic
Ur corny
Non-Toxic
not worth being a drake song
Non-Toxic
He was up on stage crying next to ye now he’s kicking the man while he’s down 😂😂 a real snake 🐍
Toxic
this is like the fifth time he dissed kanye fym
Non-Toxic
 He was never able to respond to Pusha and probably it still hurts  Also if Ye responds in Instagram or some interview whatever it will be talked about  So it’s just pettiness and Marketing
Non-Toxic
He said he did that shit (hoover concert) for jay prince. Drake does not like Ye and i doubt the nazism helped considering Drake is jewish
Toxic
It would be electric if he has a verse himself on the song.
Non-Toxic
The song is trash
Toxic
Agreed, Ye should clap back.
Non-Toxic
Drake is also an asshole, remember that
Toxic
HOLY
Non-Toxic
Yup that grew in a rough neighborhood and worked for Disney, cause yknow they arent sus
Non-Toxic
it's not like. it literally is a gossip sub. it's the only thing we can do when the artist dont put out shit lmao it's boring but it is what it is
Toxic
I would be surprised if they didn’t. Marketing stunt for both of them. The two biggest stars in pop and gossip. It’s headlines guaranteed „DRAKIM expecting they’re first baby - watch the surrogate mother giving birth live on Instagram“
Non-Toxic
Youre in a sub full of dickriding Ye stans my friend. What did you expect lmao
Toxic
This song is not fucking great 😂
Toxic
Drake is a pedophile.
Non-Toxic
And so is Drake. I wish we'd retire that word.
Non-Toxic
That’s not unpopular at all lol but I will say in recent years I’ve seen so many people who would usually clown her now praise and defend the fck outta her, especially during and after the divorce. As if Ye isn’t the sole reason she’s where she is now, but then again he does all this shxt to himself 🤷🏾‍♂️
Non-Toxic
that beat goes crazy
Toxic
I forgot about that 🤣🤣 was over here talkin and tryin to remember what made Drake so pissed off at Ye for ? BAM !!! POOPITY SCOPP !!! WOOOOP
Toxic
Here’s the difference, kanye only did that for 2 albums and a few songs  Drake has done that nonstop for well over a decade
Non-Toxic
drake dont know you man
Non-Toxic
Whoa burn, your disses are almost as good as drake's
Toxic
Why? it sucks ass like drake songs normally do
Toxic
What did pushat say?
Non-Toxic
I mean he tech did respond to Pusha. If anything his disstrack about Drake having a son was hella weak because Drake had already intended to come clean about it on his album at the time, since the date for the recording of the track was before Pusha released his disstrack. After that their beef kinda fizzled out from what I can tell
Non-Toxic
Funny though cause if you rewatch the runaway performance for the Hoover concert Drake was tearing up to Ye
Non-Toxic
What's this murky relationship that Drake has with Jay Prince anyways? It's so weird
Non-Toxic
Prolly does
Non-Toxic
Why?
Non-Toxic
on what platform
Non-Toxic
how doe
Non-Toxic
He’s the petty king. Music slaps tho
Toxic
What do you mean by that?
Non-Toxic
Weirdo
Toxic
It’s an opinion you dingus 😂
Non-Toxic
Kanye is antisemitic and his children prefer their mother
Toxic
 my favorite sentence i’ve read in a while on reddit has to be “The devil works hard but Kris Kenner works harder” people forget how awful the Kardashians are
Non-Toxic
Ray J more of the reason tbh
Non-Toxic
Was almost “Nice for What” 2
Non-Toxic
🐑
Non-Toxic
Google Story of adidon. I bet there is a YouTube Video explaining everything. Pusha turned his life literally upside down. That cover art in itself could get him a murder sentence if judged in a court.   Drake never recovered and instead started many petty attempts at getting under Ye‘s skin. Then he reconciled publicly, did the concert and started it again. It’s kinda sad. He is the biggest popstar in the world. He doesn’t need this. But still, he can’t stop
Non-Toxic
Bro lives under a rock
Non-Toxic
He is an actor. Literally. Everything is plotted and acted out for maximum effect.
Non-Toxic
I mean obviously someone was just cutting onions or some sweat got in his eye bro frfr 💀
Non-Toxic
I think he got discovered by rapalot first and was introduced to Wayne thru adjacent industry ppl before who saw his true potential.
Non-Toxic
He’s King cornball.
Toxic
Just gonna be blunt cause I don’t beat around the bush dude was Jewish lived in a good neighborhood with connections to Disney (very sus company)
Non-Toxic
Lol
Non-Toxic
her thottery the biggest reason
Non-Toxic
That video is a bigger reason
Non-Toxic
How is it a sheep to dislike what is currently one of the couple most popular artist in the world
Non-Toxic
Nice breakdown. It was fucking crazy seeing it all happen live. Moral of the story: don't mention people's wives on your song
Toxic
How did he not recover but you still call him the biggest popstar? Ya’ll just sayin shit.
Toxic
Nah they probably just assumed Drake wasn’t hung up over the same thing 5 years later
Non-Toxic
Ah, so Jay Prince gets a percentage. Makes sense. I remember Jay Prince being pretty eager to dead the beef
Non-Toxic
I WANNA FUK Ü HARD ON THA SINK ‼️💯🚰🤠
Toxic
Because popularity has nothing to do with whether you lost the battle or not. Jay Z's name is a thousand times more popular than Nas' today even though he himself admitted Nas killed him on Ether. Drake being more popular doesn't mean that that L doesn't still bother him
Non-Toxic
Universal def cut jprince a check but it’s not a big enough bag to stop them from extorting his rap friends.
Non-Toxic
AND AFTER THAT GET YOU SMTH TO DRINK🍷
Non-Toxic
and after that let’s sit down and think, maybe logic’s more important than mink  such a good song. shows his sensitive and rational side
Non-Toxic
Why were you watching call me kat and why’d you upload a minute long clip
Non-Toxic
I migrated over from Big Bang Theory because of its star...the show is so-so and I usually listen to it in the background...it is not even a regular occurrence.  I made that longer clip to give the context of the Kanye mention in the story.
Non-Toxic
Cordae also mentioned Ye on his feature on CAREFUL (which is a banger)
Non-Toxic
His new album looks to be quite good.  This song plus the very fun Motto  [Motto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YKOxtOb44c)
Non-Toxic
Y’all not like him for the music or did sum happen lmao
Non-Toxic
NF is good
Non-Toxic
the love is not mutual
Non-Toxic
I’d rather kill my self than listen to NF. Fucking TRASH 🗑️
Toxic
We do not like NF
Non-Toxic
NF is underrated.
Non-Toxic
new album just dropped and more Ye refs.
Non-Toxic
Y’all gotta stop hating on NF and give this new album a listen, it’s actually something quite different from what he’s put out before
Non-Toxic
Oh no
Non-Toxic
VeryRare NF W
Non-Toxic
Nathaniel Friedman? I'm guessing this was before the "I like Hitler" shit.
Non-Toxic
Wtf are these lyrics? 🤣
Non-Toxic
I don’t like NF’s music but I appreciate his contributions nonetheless. I think he’d be better if he strayed away from the cinematic ass beats, I can’t take them all that seriously.
Non-Toxic
I think there are several Ye mentions on the album...and none of them sarcastic.
Non-Toxic
sounds like something youd hear in a disney channel movie when the character gets a lil mischievous
Non-Toxic
Wasn’t the biggest fan of Motto personally but the album is still pretty good
Non-Toxic
NF basically gets roasted anywhere outside his own sub haha
Non-Toxic
:(
Non-Toxic
Jeez
Non-Toxic
Relax bro its not that serious
Non-Toxic
NF is good, I was gonna make fun of your music taste and then I remembered what sub I’m in. Don’t even need to make fun of it, speaks for itself
Non-Toxic
At least give this album a chance. Songs like CAREFUL and SUFFICE go hard asf
Non-Toxic
At least several!
Non-Toxic
you have your own opinion on reddit?!?!? downvoted
Non-Toxic
Common if you’ve actually listened to enough of his music
Non-Toxic
Wait we can’t like Kanye anymore?
Non-Toxic
Lmao. Honestly it sounds good in the song. Crazy how lyrics can take on different meanings with cadence and flow.
Non-Toxic
Why?
Non-Toxic
It is that serious
Non-Toxic
no, i dont think i will
Non-Toxic
I mean, if you're black or Jewish it's stupid as fuck but to each his/her own  Edit: Or if you're not a racist piece of shit...
Toxic
Cause a lot of people find him to be corny and melodramatic, and people have adopted this consensus without forming their own opinion. That’s Reddit for ya
Non-Toxic
imo i just dont like the cinematic over the top type of songs that he makes lol. i’ve never listened to a full album but most of the songs i’ve heard always sounds like that
Non-Toxic
His website is literally www.nfrealmusic.com lol
Non-Toxic
That’s a shame
Non-Toxic
To be fair he kind  of is.. he falls into the same "problem" as other youtube rappers like hopsin and token and shit
Toxic
I just listened to this album and it was really good. Production wise it’s miles ahead of what a lot of people are putting out.   It’s very “soulful”. Lots of singing compared to his other stuff. I give it a 9/10. Idk why people say he corny. Some of the stuff Kanye has done has been “corny”.   I think it’s a preference thing.
Non-Toxic
 he is corny and goofy though
Non-Toxic
I always thought that was his thing. Like cinematic/chorus type music.
Non-Toxic
He has a lot of songs that aren't cinematic trailers type beats, that's mainly for the songs that present the album, for example, Let You Down, Lie, Thinking, Like This, When I Grow Up, Layers, Prideful, Just Like You, Drifting, I Miss The Days, Options, No Excuses, Nate, Paid My Dues, and many more
Non-Toxic
Ask me if I will listen to the album
Non-Toxic
Mmmm. I always thought NF was more mainstream than these YouTube artist. I’ve heard his music plenty of times at the Gym, Radio, Trampoline Arenas, Etc.
Non-Toxic
How many NF songs have you heard
Non-Toxic
He basically means the “Corny Fast Lyrical Rapper” lane. Eminem, Token, Luke GAWNE, Crypt and them lot.
Non-Toxic
Yea i suppose hes a bit more known, but he still falls into a kind of different category of rap, honestly kind of like Eminems new stuff does
Non-Toxic
more than enough, i ain't listening to a whole album from that corny mf 😭😭💀💀💀(5)
Non-Toxic
Thing is with a lot of those guys, they try to rap fast without any real substance, as where an honestly uncommon moment where NF goes as fast as he can, he has a topic at hand, not just trying to rhyme orange with door hinge or something
Non-Toxic
Shooting a stray at Em, without even knowing that NF would still flip burgers and creep on young girls in the mall if Eminem never picked up a mic.
Toxic
1st off, I meant more recent em, as he is mainly just focusing on the best rhyme and double entendre, and 2nd, what
Non-Toxic
What's old is new again.
Non-Toxic
Apparently it was on March 17 🤷‍♂️ it’s sooooo good tho 🔥

Both great albums.
Non-Toxic
i got both lmao
Non-Toxic
Style is such a banger. 1989 is a good album
Non-Toxic
I think these are both nearly perfect albums for what they’re aiming for. MBDTF is a genius at the top of his game, but 1989 is someone who has cracked the code on how to make a pop song/album.
Non-Toxic
Both albums are amazing
Non-Toxic
Trust me bro I am both!!
Non-Toxic
Yes sir, you got good taste
Non-Toxic
missed opportunity shoulda got “in my zone” too

Nah man, that's the same album

1989 was Taylor's best album though. Legitimate competition.
Non-Toxic

Can I punch you?

I’m a classsic rock and metal guy…but MBDTF is the best album of all time, and by a longshot   Dark side of the moon is not close, but it is second 🍻

yeah i saw that too! the new album is pretty good
Non-Toxic
damn I noticed
Toxic
we can be bipolar together man
Toxic
🤣
Non-Toxic
Honestly there’s a sizable demographic of white women who love both Taylor and Kanye, playing both sides doesn’t hurt your chances.   Also it’s impossible to pretend like You Belong with Me isn’t a bop. Love Story!? Come on. Everything has Changed, All too Well, so many other great songs.
Non-Toxic
That’s a solid album. People be hating
Non-Toxic
Switch 1989 to Red and now we can talk.
Non-Toxic
It was at this moment, OP knew, he fucked up
Non-Toxic
there was another photo where i was holding it correctly but i blinked and my eyes were closed
Non-Toxic
Folklore goes harder
Non-Toxic
please see yourself out
Non-Toxic
That’s silly, it’s because of Kanye west did at the Grammies. Also there music is quite a bit different, saying an artist who created Yeezus isn’t that different from Taylor swift is ridiculous
Non-Toxic
Definitely not a 10
Non-Toxic
😂😂
Non-Toxic
yeah pretty much, her fav is gkmc and i like tpab and damn. although she likes some songs on the college albums
Non-Toxic
😂
Non-Toxic
true!!
Non-Toxic
Both great albums. 1989 is the album that put her on the map as not just a country artist though so I'm going to have to side with her on this one. Nothing but hits. If he was holding College Dropout though I'd have to go the other way.
Non-Toxic
true!!
Non-Toxic
😂😂
Non-Toxic
both are good albums can't lie!
Non-Toxic
the beat drop was fucking lit

i don't idolize him lol i just like his music

bro come on thats a little harsh, 1989 doesnt suck that much ass
Toxic
the beef ended 5 years ago please find an original opinion
Non-Toxic
You. Are. Wild.
Toxic
all the songs other than style is just bland boring pop imo in that record. I heard those a million times from other pop artists. Folklore and evermore is prolly the two decent records she actually has. oh yeah speak now is an ok album as well
Toxic
🤓
Non-Toxic
Just because OP likes his music doesn't mean that he supports his views
Non-Toxic
It is just SILLY to label Ye a Nazi because he is a SON of the SUN.

yep!

I personally think 1000 gecs is the best album of all time so I disagree with you.

Toxic
I’m genuinely looking out for him. Wearing fakes of shoes that cost like >$5000 could end up really bad if someone wants to shit on him irl. I don’t wanna see that happen to him lol
Toxic
Exactly, no expects a teen to wear 10k shoes which is ridiculous for a pair of shoes. As long as he’s happy, who cares
Non-Toxic
They were not $10k RETAIL. We don’t know his uncle or his connects. Y’all are so sad and lame.

I got into her music back in the day because she was cute, now I don't find her cute so I don't listen to her anymore.

Someone tries to start shit with a literal child over fake shoes and the child is the problem? Lmaoooo

i wear reps myself and i dont shame others for wearing reps. honestly reps are better quality and financially make way more sense even if youre not broke.
Non-Toxic
so you’re saying you listened to her because she was cute?
Non-Toxic
He’s actually lucky it’s me over the internet and not the dude in footlocker or in his home room completely dunking on him lol. OP if you’re gonna wear reps stick to like $300 max or you’re gonna get bodied. Just lookin out 🙏🙏

Kanye cant be cancel... Kanye is the culture
Non-Toxic
High school essay or chatGPT.  Lol, Ye was never "cancelled", he only lost some contracts because his image became one that hurt the bottom line...a financial decision, not a moral one.  No one is stopping Ye from doing anything, from making music, to designing sneakers or whatever.  Whether or not people"forgive" him is up to the individual.  He has said very little to make up for all the past errors.  One little post...itself problematic and now removed...is not going to balance out all that has gone before.  But again, he is free to do whatever he wants and people are free to either accept him or not.  Furthermore, that freedom does not entail a corresponding *right* to return to his former glories of fame, wealth, influence and prestige.  If Ye is cancelled, the only one doing the cancelling is himself.

He didn't really lose anything...the devaluation of his net worth is mostly due to those cancelled contracts which had been estimated to yield certain returns.  Kind of like counting your chickens before they are hatched, it was never anything of value he possessed or cash on hand, so there was never any need to liquidate assets or anything of the sort.  Everything remained the same, that extra was all on paper.
Non-Toxic
I think he still cares a lot, but after Donda, I think he became too self-aware, maybe, and started to wear what people 'expected' him to wear instead of what he liked, but I don't know. He's still a unique and stylish ASF.
Non-Toxic
Kanye is worth more than anything he can wear. What's the point?
Non-Toxic
Lol he started dressing in what he likes and not what he thot other people would like him in
Non-Toxic
This is actually a really common cycle for fashion in general in that the wealthy prefer to dress differently from the lower class. Flashy styles were once unattainable to the layman and so that's why celebs were into it - but now that these styles have become more accessible via fast fashion, the wealthy pivoted to wearing "average" clothes again. This is why rich people wearing athleisure and sweats out is a thing. Kim was the same in being the forefront of the early-2000s bejeweled sparkles and preppy frills before Ye switched up her entire style identity to solid, neutral tones which influenced that trend. We're even seeing a slow rise in celebs taking out their plastic surgery implants and fillers because these things have become popular and affordable for common folk, now natural is in.  If you wanna be caught up with fashion, Ye's always at the forefront even if whatever he's wearing looks stupid in the moment.
Non-Toxic
He might be depressed. He just went through a bipolar manic episode.
Non-Toxic
I think this is just the new style, but it's amazing & pure, so there
Non-Toxic
Hes been proving a huge point about how big his name and brand is. He can do anything. So when he starts selling the the Air Yeezys at Shaq levels, the whole world will wear yeezy. This is why he shelved pastel, so he could work his way down from Luxury and flood everything
Non-Toxic
Because he doesn’t need to over do it anymore he can wear big boots and giant black jackets and the culture will shift with him anyway
Non-Toxic
He stop making other people's fashion ideas and brands popular/rich and focused on his own  or atleast only wears things he gets paid to wear
Non-Toxic
He has always looked like someone who would try to wash your windshield at a stoplight.

He just experienced something that he thought was a call from god and then did something because of that. he also just scraps song's if he's not feeling like it, meaning that songs about crying get never released because no one cries for a long time  That's my stupid theory.

He found God apparently. He started remaking the yahndi songs making them Christian but he never released them. Look up new body Christian version and you will see what I mean

Fucking finally.  I’m sorry but who in the world thinks it’s normal for a 9 year old to not only have a 12 step skincare routine, but to have this 9 year old on a very mentally influential app that she technically isn’t even legally allowed to be on? What happened to “go play outside”
Toxic
Probably sexualization of a minor, or she’s just to young for it
Non-Toxic
You have to be 12 I think to register as a user, she’s very famous, it’s easy to find out she’s not old enough to have an account and that her mom is trying to help her get around it.
Non-Toxic
she's under 13 and it being a "shared account" doesn't change the fact that she's not 13

It’s clearly her account and she isn’t old enough to have one.

Thats a thought. I had this wild idea that since Kim is a media personality/brand that one could claim North would be too- and if she's getting paid for it, then it's work; then you stretch that to child labor

Valid but your TF2 pfp implies you might have been around for early YouTube circa 2010-13? Remember YTP? TF2 YTP? Mindless brain cancer has been around since the inception of the internet idk why tiktok is this giant scapegoat
Non-Toxic
the whole signfiicanly shortening attention span argument is baseless- the human attention span isnt some well that tiktok can dry out. it is the ability of one's neurons to recall and retain certain patterns for long periods of time. any anectodal evidence that says tiktok lowers attention spans is just that- anecdotal

I started reading your comment but got bored because of the lack of memes and
Non-Toxic
Basically allows the government access to any and all personal data you have on any electronic device. They could watch you through your webcam, look at all your pictures and videos, read your messages, etc. on top of that, they could lock you in prison for 20 years and fine you $1,000,000 for using a VPN.  The “TikTok ban” term is just marketing to try and get people to back the complete and total destruction of any privacy we still have in the digital age
Non-Toxic
Senate bill 686 will allow the federal government to shut down any online gathering of at least 1 million Americans. And it can be of anything, shopping, a livestream, protests etc.

I’m guessing finding out her mother is a whore and thier trashy, out of touch family is a complete joke to the public will be a lot more traumatic than having a genius father with mental problems.  Kanye couldn’t begin to embarrass himself the way that childs other side of the family will
Toxic
Yup, so if they were building up Kims brand it would be okay- but since North is 9(?) I'm sure Kanye doesn't want her to become some type of brand or ambassador at this age.   And again, this is all speculation and its just some idea i came up with while pooping at work.
Non-Toxic
Okay so like the second sentence said " i had a wild idea". Also, pretty sure the parents have to be okay with their kid doing that, and kanye clearly isn't. As the person above said, it probably has something to do with sexualization of a minor
Non-Toxic
What was it about that cosplay that you found sexy?
Non-Toxic
i dont really mean the content. shit content has been around the internet for ages. the way tiktok allows you to consume content is harming our minds more than some site like youtube (although all social media is addictive, it's just that tiktok is the worst). Not to mention how invasive the app itself is, with how it collects data.   I'm probably just screaming into a wall and maybe i remember things nostalgically, but people have gotten much more addicted to their phones and have become much less talkative since tiktok and i despise it. That's what i mean by brain cancer
Toxic
It's not baseless. The videos lasts a few seconds before you scroll to the next one. The algorithm fits into your entertainment- so you get a constant dose of serotonin in short amount, making your attention span shorter.
Non-Toxic
Most of that they can do already tbh
Non-Toxic
That is crazy wow wtf

The government hit the golden goose this time. Dumbass redditors are all happy for the tiktok ban and blindly support the government

I’m gonna be real, the government can do all of that already. The law is so vague and open to interpretation that everyone is likely breaking several dozen laws a day, it just isn’t worth it to pursue action. But pretty much everything you just listed can already be done through the freedom act
Non-Toxic
This is an uneducated incorrect response .the TikTok ban (restrict bill) targets large internet apps run by foreign adversaries and allows the US to take any measure to ban them.  I'm not sure where you are getting your information
Non-Toxic
damn.
Toxic
Don’t even waste your time bro lmao these people are literally just in a hivemind that tiktok is this big bad wolf. Social media as a whole just builds off of each other and will continue to do it. Boomerangs on IG were based off PHHHOTO, twitter spaces and the Reddit live voice thing is based off discords popularity etc etc mfers will have 100K Karma and spend all their time on Reddit and YouTube but say tiktok is making your brain into mush lmao
Non-Toxic
> I’m guessing finding out her mother is a whore and thier trashy, out of touch family is a complete joke to the public will be a lot more traumatic than having a genius father with mental problems.  So...what does it say about him that he married and started a family with her?
Toxic
it's almost certainly legal but tiktok may well not want it on their platform, as is their choice.
Non-Toxic
Who tf said she was sexy, your being weird🤦‍♂️
Non-Toxic
I get what you mean but it’s a generational thing, yes tiktok reduces your attention span more than maybe YouTube but at the same time this argument was being made for YouTube. I’m 22 and I’m conscious about my attention span getting lower the more time I spent online and I’ve been using the internet wayyy before tiktok. Vine and the original IG format with 15 seconds were the first to start fucking with my brain and now even in college I still sometimes struggle to read a 20 page journal or watch a 30 minute educational video. The issue is that young kids are using these platforms when they shouldn’t be in the first place it’s not like tiktok was the first to create short and infinite bursts of overstimulating content and it won’t be the last. I’m not defending it because even tho I use tiktok (a lot) I can’t spend more than like 30 mins on it without checking myself and making myself close the app but when I was 14 I would spend 4 hours on YouTube and then remember I had to do my hw and then just take the L lmao
Non-Toxic
this is why we need to teach psychology in schools jfc. serotonin doesnt work like that at all-you just name dropped buzzwords that you've heard relate to social media to try and own me. i dont like most social media, but you are wrong about a significant decrease in attention span rates- your levels of sustained attention are not dependent on the short term level of serotonin in your brain.
Non-Toxic
even though you’re right, i don’t remember much of this attention span talk during vine tbh  and dating apps are also incredibly harmful — if not moreso, but i don’t see them getting as much shit
Non-Toxic
Crazy how good the marketing worked on this one. All they had to do is say it’s about TikTok for people people to get on board with government surveillance of citizens.  “We’re trying to stop the Chinese from spying on you” sounds great if you don’t read the part about america being allowed to spy on you
Non-Toxic
It’s probably true that the government is already using the freedom act to do that, but this new bill explicitly allows what was previously a gray area, and the VPN thing is especially evil and completely new
Non-Toxic
Yeah but most of that considered wire tapping and you need a judge to sign off on it. This new bill let's a committee decide behind closed doors and requires no public justification.
Non-Toxic
☠️ TT is the only one that’s affecting younger kids the most , I wasn’t 7 years old scrolling even when Vine was big , you’re so brain dead to the issue . YT shorts and TT is all most kids are using , their attention span definitely has gotten worse .

Youre clearly putting words into his mouth. If you cant see a problem here, then youre the creep smh. The problem is that shes cosplaying as a heavily sexualised person, and thats just so dang innapropiate. No she isnt sexy, but that doesnt change the fact that kids shouldnt be dressing themselves as their idols if their idols are known for showing off almost everything.

Kids shouldn’t have idols that are heavily sexualized? Have you ever heard the music of Kanye West?
