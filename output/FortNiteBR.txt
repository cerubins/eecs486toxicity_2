You have to make sure your pickaxe isn‚Äôt an epic rarity or higher and it will work. I had the same problem and googled it and this worked for me.

i had a epic dmr and legend smg last match and didn't count

Bring him back Epic cmon

But if they are capturing the flag then they have to stay near the flag for 45 sec and the whole poi can hear the flag getting captured. So risk reward

Maybe your school just changes all email addresses into a GUID (random numbers) when you leave... in which case you could ask admin to add your old name back on that email account AS AN ALIAS so you can get your verify code to change it to a new address...    ...Of course, the other reason might be there is a new kid now with the same name. Maybe just try emailing them to see if you can schedule a time to change your account over? ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|shrug)     PS. I don't recommend reaching out to school kids after you have graduated though... so maybe the first option is better.

Try equipping a grey or common pickaxe! I think I saw someone saying that fixed it the other day

I'm not clear on what the issue is. I'm on Xbox one, and I have completed the parkour challenge. I'm not aware of any boost function. Maybe it's talking about sprint? You should be able to rebind that in the settings menu.  When/how are you getting this warning?  Is it not allowing you to enter the parkour challenge?
Non-Toxic
I'm not 95% sure you just need to close and reboot the game.

So, I'm way late to the party. I've been hardcore CoD for a lot of years. With the state of things over in WZ I have quit playing. My kid talked me into playing this finally and I'm having a ton of fun just playing with my kid. I'm obviously a bot but no build is legit fun.
Non-Toxic
I just play for quests and having fun with the toy box of characters . If I get a few kills in a match and am progressively getting better as I play, then awesome.  Had a couple cool player interactions though I play Solos so whenever I try to help them with what they‚Äôre doing or just be goofy it‚Äôs a 1 in a 100 chance of them just going with it vs them just trying to kill me.  It happens but very rarely.

You can play with crossplay off, it jusy won't allow you to play anything but solo.  If you select duo, trio, or squad it won't allow you and forces you to turn crossplay on.    Depending on time of day you can get a match in 5 min or be waiting 30-45 min or even not ever get one.  I've gotten one in less than 5 min on a weekend middle of the day but overnights, which is my normal playtime,  it won't ever get one.   I really only even know this because I could never get one anytime I tried and someone suggested to try mid day and it worked.  Cossplay doesn't really bother me, but it's always handy knowing I could if I wanted to if I actually played during normal hours.
Non-Toxic
Lol why would it ever get better?   I like the game.. but it won‚Äôt ever get more balanced for console players when we‚Äôre forced to play in PC lobbies..
Non-Toxic
I can compete with mouse and keyboard when it comes to aim and straight building, but it's the edits and flicks that keyboard players do that get me every time. Sure I can practice editing on a controller but it sucks that until I get better at it I need to play against people who are levels better than I am.

Relative to the time, it‚Äôs C3S4. The chrome theme just didn‚Äôt hit for me, the chrome castle wasn‚Äôt even the standout map change, it was the POIs being lifted by the balloons. That part was very fun. But the finale absolutely fumbled the entire storyline. Definitely not a terrible season, had its fair share of positives, but it‚Äôs gotta be last place for me.   Now if we‚Äôre not talking relative to the time it came out, then it would have to be C1S1 hands down. It‚Äôs just so bare bones and empty compared to the standards set in Chapter 2 and onwards.   Hope that made sense.
Non-Toxic
C2 S4. I feel like the Marvel collab just completely changed Fortnite into a worse direction
Non-Toxic
I‚Äôm sick of the ch2s6 hate.  The actual worst season was ch3s2 and I have a list whyüò°
Non-Toxic
The Primal Season. Weapons were total garbage.
Toxic
Ch3 s3. Literally the most boring season ever.
Non-Toxic
C3S3 was boring AF in the latter half of it. There was a multiple month period with literally nothing going on until the dbz collab.
Non-Toxic
It‚Äôs gotta be either chapter 2 season 1 or chapter 2 season 2?
Non-Toxic
C4 S1 blew
Non-Toxic
Out of what, I played chapter 1, season 5, but I only played chapter 1, season 5 - chapter 2, season 2 and chapter 4, season 1-2
Non-Toxic
Ch2S5  Was gonna consider this one, but it isn't too horrendous, though I'm tired of Metas where you're forced to carry certain items.   It was tolerable last season, but now, with the Blade, Pulse, and Havoc, it's just starting to get boring.
Non-Toxic
Primal. Poor lootpool, velocraptors, trash secret skin and a massively annoying boss that had to be killed twice over the course of the season.
Toxic
This map prior to this new season with Mega City was one of the most boring updates ever imo
Non-Toxic
C2S3 when the map was flooded.
Non-Toxic
This one. Even the most boring seasons in Chapters 2 and 3 didn't actively make me not want to play like this season has.
Non-Toxic
Chapter 2 season 1, 4 updates and 4 months
Non-Toxic
C2S6 was pretty bland and some of the things like crafting didn‚Äôt stick.  C2S8 wasn‚Äôt that terrible in hindsight but as someone who likes challenges, the system was terrible. It didn‚Äôt help that by the time they made all the quests worth more XP I had completed all of them.   C3S4 It‚Äôs like they took all the cool interesting parts of C2S8 and rehashed them but way worse. Chrome made everything it touch ugly and less fun to play in. I did enjoy all the floating poi‚Äôs but they never amounted to anything.  C2SX I think it was hated a lot when it came out but people like it more now. I personally still hate it with a passion and it is easily the worst to me, other than the event and battle pass which doesn‚Äôt make up for how bad it was.
Non-Toxic
I dont get the hype around season 7-c1. Boring ass season with a mid event. Only good that came from it was the free battlepass for the best season
Toxic
Chapter 3 Season 3, it ruined greasy, mid pass, the theme of the season was vibin in a player vs player shooter game
Non-Toxic
Agreed definitely, I loved chapter 3 out of the 2 total seasons I played, and definitely felt a bit more doable with zb and all... but I felt like they got extremely lazy with it, especially the story  The chrome just completely ruined the map and made everything (including the balloon's everywhere) just look aesthetically unpleasing (not to mention that the chrome literally also invaded all my favorite locations)  I really enjoyed the chapter 3 map a lot and feel really sad that epic fucked up it's story so much + the success of zb on a map that wasn't that accessable to it caused epic to scrap it after not even a year, I really like chapter 4.. but it just doesn't hit the same
Non-Toxic
This, this right here is completely right, I just really hope another Collab season like that never happens
Non-Toxic
Tbh I didn't even know that c3s2 happened  But what I will say rn is that I don't think that s2c6 gets enough hate, that shit was beyond ass
Toxic
Nah, one of my favorite seasons. Great loot pool, awesome maps updates with the war theme, battlebus vs tanks was awesome, introduction of zero build, introduction of sprinting & mantling, an alright battlepass, and a decent live event
Non-Toxic
Aren't you the guy that just REALLY hates the Drum Shotgun? If you take that out of Chapter 3 Season 2, the season was fine.
Non-Toxic
Aka, C2 S6
Non-Toxic
S3C3 is literally what got me back into the game, personally, I liked it... until they brought in the charge smg, I really hate charge weapons
Non-Toxic
Very brave saying ch2 s2
Non-Toxic
I didn‚Äôt even play these but Chapter 2 Season 2 is regarded as one of THE BEST seasons of fortnite with an amazing battlepass and amazing game modes. Someone who actually played it can ejther agree or disagree, I don‚Äôt mind. I just see people talking about how great it was everywhere
Non-Toxic
Damn hot take
Toxic
I can agree.
Non-Toxic
I'll say it right now, the charge shotgun ruined everything
Non-Toxic
C2S1 was alright for what it was..I mean it was supposed to be the "fresh start" the "new beginning" so ig it made sense for it to be a bit laidback to completely contrast the chaos from season X but... JESUS FUCKING CHRIST IT WAS LONG, that's what pissed me off about it, like I'm fine with a laidback season sure... but at least make it a reasonable length
Toxic
I think you might mean C1 SX, and yeah I'd probably agree that it wasn't all too great  Other than the mechs...this was still during the time when Fortnites "sweat problem" was kinda crazy so it was really difficult to play a game if you weren't as good (such as myself)  Also the whole "rift zone" thing was just terrible, to bring back a past location but to alter them, most times for worse i absolutely hated  I think the end event tho with the black hole was definitely the best way to end C1... but the season itself could've been done better  Also for C3S4, I too hated the chrome, it always got my favorite locations too :( was probably the worst chapter ending to date
Non-Toxic
Imma have to disagree, I loved the snow Biome and how it actually had more than 1 location*cough* paradise and the desert biome*couch* but I will agree with you that the live event could've been better and the free battle pass was cool.. but other than that...it wasn't too shabby
Non-Toxic
This is me but with C3S4, I just want tilted to be left alone for once üò≠
Non-Toxic
>Great lootpool  You misspelled ‚Äúworst lootpool ever‚Äù  >battlebus vs tanks was awesome  Annoying vehiclesüôÅ
Non-Toxic
Agreed,  This is what was considered Fortnites second prime, and with it happening during the whole COVID lockdown, I think epic did a good job with that season...minus the length because once again like C2S1 was just way too long
Non-Toxic
chapter 2 season 2 was the greatest season of all time (totally unbiased because that was the season i started)
Non-Toxic
Yeah I did mean C1 SX lol. But yeah I can‚Äôt agree more. Mechs we‚Äôre terrible, and the rift zones were really annoying locations. And yeah, the whole way chapter 3 ended has so many problems. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs my second least favorite season, because it completely mistreated chapter 3 as a whole if that makes sense. I think the best chapter ending season is C2S8, I only put it here cuz of the god awful challenge system. Other than that I don‚Äôt have any huge complaints.
Non-Toxic
L opinion
Non-Toxic
Yeah epic totally fucked over C3 so much, which made me sad because it convinced me to play the game again, even know I'd still prefer to be on C3's than on C4 because it felt more complete, even if it wasn't meant for zb
Toxic
If your taking a bout C3‚Äôs map compared to C4‚Äôs I completely agree. It sucks because there‚Äôs a lot I like about C4s map like how it works better with zero build, the terrain is interesting, and it only started with a few biomes so there was more potential for updates. However, the new season kinda made me think they‚Äôre going to botch that in the long run since the only interesting area of the map to me now is the new Neo-Japan area and everything else (especially the medieval biome) feels really dry.
Non-Toxic
Was thinking that too, the C4S1  map just did not feel right, it almost felt like everything was copied and pasted + the fact that there was no old locations returning really upset me, like sure it keeps the game fresh... but I feel like so does adding a whole new map + locations so in the end, adding old locations is a good way to at least compromise the people who want to go back, and people who want to go forward (if that makes sense)  But yeah..I think imma give epic some time with C4, I'll give them credit that the new season is great + the removal of faulty splits was just one of the best improvements (I can write a whole essay on why I hate that location but I'll just sum it up by saying that it felt lazy as hell)
Non-Toxic
Yeah, I think C4S1 also fell short in that there was only 9 locations and no returning ones. Or sucks because they had the perfect set up to give us an old location from chapter 2 or 3 with the map being made of parts of other realities. Also, I loved faulty, but I think removing it was the best choice. Plus it had a huge flaw in that if you landed at the medieval half of it you basically won any fight because of the high ground and capture point being there.
Non-Toxic
Tbh an old location from C2 could've worked too since all of the major locations from C1 have already been brought over to future seasons, I don't think C3 would have worked however since... chrome
Non-Toxic
Ignore the NPC and shoot the guy who hired it.

I play builds so they‚Äôre not as much of a problem as you can just build cover but I agree they can be really annoying. Definitely need a nerf for zero build, or just br in general.

I honestly think that the gliders with that design are worst  and most boring ones.
Non-Toxic
Ch1 glider got a lot of redskins so I'm not surprised.

Inferior C3 vs Superior C2
Non-Toxic
Idk but ch2 glider solos
Non-Toxic
I genuinely did not realize that the chapter three glider base design was different than the chapter two‚Ä¶  I can‚Äôt be the only one, right?!
Non-Toxic
Well, chapter 2 glider is just the best base glider.
Non-Toxic
This is how skins work
Non-Toxic
Same reason we've still got chapter 3 defaults they rushed to get a new Map done and cut corners.
Non-Toxic
they got to give something in the free pass
Non-Toxic
Imo epic was trying to make c2 too realistic, for a game like fortnite. (A map with almost no biomes, boring gliders, no goofy items, etc)
Non-Toxic
i agree, they almost always suck. I like Thunder‚Äôs sushi one though
Non-Toxic
All the gliders look the same to me anyway with different paint jobs üòÖ
Non-Toxic
There‚Äôs a very subtle difference between both types if gliders when you deploy them
Non-Toxic
Literally introduced Surfing Gliders in Ch2? How are they boring
Non-Toxic
This is literally one of the most wrong things I‚Äôve ever read
Non-Toxic
No Goofy items?! Did you forget the entirety of S7 and S8?
Non-Toxic
Then they overcompensated with c2 s7. Alien nantites, rail guns, aliens on ur head, ufos, ray guns, plasma guns, the list goes on
Non-Toxic
And the wing gliders! (Which are very common now but still)
Non-Toxic
Or like literally every other season past Season 1.
Non-Toxic
Fr I clutched a very hard battle just 2 days ago, and I wanted to hit the griddy. NOPE you have to select 3 crappy augments until you can do itüòÇ
Non-Toxic
Yes worst change they have ever made.
Non-Toxic
That‚Äôs facts bro all I want to do is emote on people before they leave the game. Why does epic hate my toxicity??
Non-Toxic
Change the button for augment select. There's two options in the settings. Mine is now left d pad
Non-Toxic
When the person is shooting then running away then sneaking back and shooting and then katana‚Äôing away repeatly and wont leave you alone but also wont stick around and fight you and you finally get the kill. Yeah I want to emote on them for the stress they caused and finally beating them and I don‚Äôt want to then have it ruined by a damn augment to grind on rails when the only place to grind on rails has been closed off by the circle.
Toxic
Relatable AF. Half the augments are useless anyways this season I‚Äôm about to just unbind them.
Non-Toxic
Its complicated for me to give one answer, but the pulse rifle grants better players an almost guaranteed win, and gives everyone else a very small chance to win. I say nerf it, but don't need it into the ground, because you might as well remove it entirely
Non-Toxic
Just make it so only one spawns no matter what. A duo of ppl with them is entirely too OP

I like the pulse rifle because of the island mechanic. Each game it‚Äôs kind of a gamble, whether to take the big risk for big reward, or play it safe and risk getting beamed by the player who took the risk
Non-Toxic
Me hoi minoy
Non-Toxic
I can't hit the broad side of a barn with it, so I dunno ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  I have much better accuracy with the havoc rifle or even the smg.
Non-Toxic
It‚Äôs very broken, but it‚Äôs balanced by the fact that it completely turns off the brain of the person using it
Non-Toxic
Just a nerf. I‚Äôd keep the damage the same, but up the 1st shot bloom big time, and have the weapon become more accurate as someone holds the trigger.
Non-Toxic
I am absolute dog ass with it so I say buff if
Toxic
There is always going to meta weapons‚Ä¶ if it isn‚Äôt the pulse it would be the orange red dot or the mythic pump/dual mag.  Unless you give each gun the same damage output something will out perform and everyone will use that gun.
Non-Toxic
Yeah playing squads and a team goes to the island, it's pretty easy to track them just follow the rave lazer show
Non-Toxic
>I like the pulse rifle because of the island mechanic.  That's it right there.  It's not that the rifle is OP.  It's that whoever comes down from the island with the rifle has probably earned it.
Non-Toxic
Yeah I've noticed. Play style becomes rifle spam. Leaves them open to a good old snipe.
Non-Toxic
No bloom, insanely fast high rate of fire when you hip fire it. Next time you get your hands on it just blindfiring that bad boy as fast as you can!

That doesn‚Äôt mean you shouldn‚Äôt limit the mega OPness of the best weapon in the game.

Being good at the game is cool.  I'm not good at the game, but I prefer builds because thats the actual game.
Non-Toxic
this sub hates everything.
Toxic
Seems to me that theres more build mode fans talking trash about zero build than the other way around.  Personally, Im glad build mode exists for those who like it. Me, I could never get the hang of building and prefer a more standard shooter.  Not sure why it matters what people choose to enjoy. Its just a game, why you gotta be mad?
Non-Toxic
Classic u/Knight-112 with the same posts every day
Non-Toxic
I like both zero build and builds but in the end builds is just way more satisfying for me. Winning a sweaty game of builds just takes way more skill than zero builds, and because of that it just feels so much better. Also, pooping on someone with piece control and stuff like that is a feeling unparalleled by zero build.

Non-Toxic
Boxing? Like boxing up?   You do realize that‚Äôs not all building is right? And there‚Äôs nothing broken about it. Since ch3 there‚Äôs been tons of OP stuff that has made builds irrelevant.   Sounds like a skill issue
Non-Toxic
Yes!
Non-Toxic
why dis dude getting downvoted
Toxic
Quick, build a bridge and -Get over it!
Non-Toxic
Jesus Christ, relax bro, it was just a joke
Toxic
I j put myself in a box and focus on keeping that box up there is literally no reasonable counter. This is a dudementally broken strategy. The main counter is to break the wall and manage to quick drop a wall. The amount of effort that 1 party must use to counter this is significantly more then the other. Just because fortnite rotates a couple broken items doesn't outweigh this broken start because its been a thing for the entire games lifespan. I'd love for you to tell me how you counter boxing in solos, I'm sure it's just as easy as holding down the build button like the boxer does.
Non-Toxic
Quick, find who -as in who asked!
Non-Toxic
Dramatic much?
Non-Toxic
>tell me how to counter boxing in solos  You take their wall. Piece control them? Ya know, play the game? Heck, even spray the absolutely ridiculously broken MPX?   Boxing up isn‚Äôt broken. It has numerous counters that ARE permanent features. Not to mention that guns bleed through builds and ping is at an all time high  If you seriously think boxing up has ‚Äúno counter‚Äù then that just shows how low your skill level really is.   post on the comp sub and say boxing up ‚Äúhas no counter‚Äù. Let me know how many people say the same thing I just saidüòÇ
Non-Toxic
lmao yes, I am the dramatic one. Definitely me and not the chronically online complaining butthurt OP replying to almost every comment in the thread
Non-Toxic
All you can do is use ad homins because you are unable to actually engage. You literally just repeated what ri said. The amount of effort needed to do that is significantly more then it requires to box umwhixh is why its fundamentally broken. I can hold a box for mins while you spam shoot notifying the whole map of your location. You are unable to provide a as simple permanent strat as holding right click so you resort to insults . Instead of saying "skill issue" demonstrate your skill by giving a start that can counter boxing that is as low risk high reward as boxing.
Non-Toxic

Non-Toxic
I literally gave you like 3 strats that are permanent  and WHY they are effective. What more do you want from me lol  ‚Ä¢Take their wall  ‚Ä¢Spray the wall  ‚Ä¢Piece control   Those are viable tactics that are permanent in the game. Low risk if you do it right, and very viable  I never insulted you. ‚ÄúSkill issue‚Äù isn‚Äôt an insult.  Once again, post your opinion on r/FortniteCompetitive (with the opinion flair) and see the response.
Non-Toxic
Imagine having the level of ignorance to be able to make a post crying about something, then bitching  to people in the comments and then acting like you have some high ground and aren‚Äôt a total loser.
Toxic
Thats all 1 strat. Your not just gonna do 1 of those things because then you'll get nowhere, that all requires significantly more skill than holding down right click in a box.
Non-Toxic
That‚Äôs three. That‚Äôs literally three different ways of dealing with them.   Again, post it in the comp sub as opinion
Non-Toxic
So how do you take their wall without spraying? How does you edit without spray? What do you do when your done spraying? You see how you can only jusfy the next course of action using one of the 3 listed methods? It's almost like you need to do all 3 in order to counter someone holding right click.
Non-Toxic
You can take the wall without spraying by using your pickaxe  You can piece control without taking a single wall by using predictive piecing  You can spray by holding down the shoot button and letting the bullets bleed through until they are forced to move   You can use those all separately (effective) or together (even more effective)   I‚Äôm gonna keep saying it. Post to comp sub
Non-Toxic
Yea, get it girl!

If you're using an epic quality pickaxe, equip a lower quality one. (rare, uncommon or lower.)

Are you playing on 2 platforms by any chance?  I have had this issue if I swapped between Switch and PlayStation. If I went to the other console and finished it there it would clear, though it would give me xp credit again and I would notice when I logged out of the game it would take the XP back.

Weird. I have played on other platforms in the past, but it has been several months since I've played on something other than my Xbox. I played cloud gaming on my macbook over Xmas holiday, that was the last time.     I may try playing on the switch to see if I can clear it there.
Non-Toxic
I am playing on an Xbox Series X. Sorry, I am unsure how to reproduce this as it seems to be working fine on my partners account using the same console.
Non-Toxic
Correct, this did fix it. Also, sorry, I will try to be more specific in my future searches.
Non-Toxic
I meant like I started the quest/challenge on switch and I couldn't clear it on ps. Sounds like it's not that for you.   I hate to say it, but have you tried restarting? On ps5 I have all sorts of issues if I don't close the game each time before I turn the ps5 off. The game resume feature in ps5 causes all sorts of bugs?
Non-Toxic
No worries, just wanted you to be confident that this would work.  Mods should pin these things to make it easier.
Non-Toxic
Thanks for your help! Yeah, you are right, it wasn't for me. I tried just now on cloud gaming and it's still stuck. üòµ It's a really good suggestion, but I do restart the game every time I play because I share the console with someone else and quickstart doesn't work properly when two people are playing the same game. I even tried restarting the xbox.     I am stumped, I may reach out to Epic directly and see if there is something they can do.

CPU could use an upgrade. How much RAM are you running? RAM clock speed is slow, that probably needs an upgrade regardless of how much you have. Turning off Lumen and Nanite should easily get you 165 FPS, but I assume you don't wanna do that considering those are two huge visual features (I don't blame ya)
Non-Toxic
What loads are you getting? Are you maxing out on CPU? Try switching to DLSS
Non-Toxic
Do you have another monitor playing some sort of video or 3d content while you are gaming? Those dips sound like divisors to a refresh rate that isn‚Äôt the same between screens. For instance, if the above is happening on another screen, and that screen doesn‚Äôt have the same refresh rate as your main one the game is on, windows gets confused and can start locking your game to divisors of the refresh rate of the one without the game playing.
Non-Toxic
Oh damn I got the i5-13600k thinking it would be more than enough. The ddr5 i have 32gb. I thought the 5200 speed was good too! Lol
Non-Toxic
Do you really think that the CPU is causing the dips? Lol
Non-Toxic
No, the cpu gets to about 3% utilizations at about 54 degrees and at 5100mhz  Gpu 80-97% utilizations aT about 52 deg  Ram about 50% load
Non-Toxic
My main is the alienware dwf oled at 165fps. The second monitor is 144hz ips. How do i make it not get confused. any settings i can change? The second monitor is really only being used for PC montioring (nzxt Cam) i also set the second montior to 60fps since i dont use it for gaming. It also does not have hdr which my main does
Non-Toxic
The 13600k is alright, but it won't squeeze the most power possible out of your GPU. 32GB of RAM is solid, but the clock speed is rather low. I'd correct the CPU issue first though, personally
Non-Toxic
I don‚Äôt think so with only 3% utilization
Non-Toxic
Any suggestions? Which would you go with in this setup? I misspoke I have 5600 clock on ram
Non-Toxic
I misspoke I have 5600
Non-Toxic
I'd recommend switching to AMD for your CPU (overall better for gaming performance/FPS), in which case, I'd go for a Ryzen 7 7700X, or a Ryzen 9 7900X (depending on what you're willing to spend). Those will squeeze the best performance out of your 4080. DDR5 RAM scales up to 7200mhz, so I'd go for 6000 or 6400 for the best gaming performance.
Non-Toxic
I can‚Äôt switch mobo at this time. Crazy to think that 5600 is low! Lol esp for fortnite
Non-Toxic
That‚Äôs because it‚Äôs an old sound effect?

Robo-cop returns! I'm not a fan of the skin but happy for those who've been waiting!  In the daily, we have Shore Leave, which I like but I do find it odd how it comes back in the daily when it's clearly a summer skin. Mel returns after a mind-bogglingly long *5* days, simply because it can. Blue Bolt... I remember I got this when it returned in December, kinda crazy that it's already been 100+ days, which also reminds me how long I've been commenting on item shop threads already. Completely forgot the Planetary wrap existed but it looks good, I think it'd look good on a wrap skin. UFOs and Aliens is pretty nostalgic, can't believe C2S7 is going to be 2 years old soon.  Turn The Music Up has some more emotes, but like yesterday, it's just standard Turn The Music Up emotes.

I'm a pretty huge Wu fan, but even I only grabbed the emote. Only cosmetic Wu thing I've ever seen in the wild, is the glider. That was one time only.
Non-Toxic
I throw up the W from time to time. Protect ya neck son.

Wu-Tang and Golf skins make me question rotation
Non-Toxic
Love Wu-tang, was happy to pick up the bundle
Non-Toxic
I have the emote and the wrap. I see the emote pretty often. Also the female skin every once in a while.
Non-Toxic
Have seen the female one used regularly, the guy one no.  Have also seen the emote used a little less often

I saw one earlier today. But only one I ever seen

Consider that maybe there are others who jumped in late to the game/took an extended hiatus from it. I personally just came back c3S4 after leaving in c2s5. Jill is a must cop.
Non-Toxic
They will, dw we just have to be patient
Non-Toxic
Yeah Epic just loves bringing back tabs and then not using them they totally do that all the time
Non-Toxic
I lowkey been robocop spamming these threads for weeks! Finally copped me ol Murph man.
Toxic
Tell me you're 12 without telling me you're 12
Non-Toxic
And to make matters worse. There are over a thousand geese in the game. The guy/team who works on the item shops probably don't remember a specific goose that someone is begging for, and when they do bring said goose back, it's because they felt like it, and maybe that they remembered the ID for said goose. Not because some random guy on reddit begged for it everyday, because they most likely don't listen to the people on these shop threads.

You got it for free from watching a Creative concert, wasn‚Äôt exclusive to the event

That's what I thought ain't no way this is real. I was told it's not coming back. Instant purchase. I wanted this so bad
Non-Toxic
I use her but that‚Äôs my name irl so I kinda have to.
Non-Toxic
Lets go fam!!
Non-Toxic
Same here. I use all of the cosmetics, but I don‚Äôt have the skins.
Non-Toxic
That was probably me. I wanted a chill skin with a hoodie and leggings, not something crazy like most skins
Non-Toxic
Honestly I'm just taking a wild guess. But we've been getting more tabs overtime, so it's possible. I ain't complaining though. I've been able to get Icon emotes that I've been wanting to get for some time now.
Non-Toxic
I like your optimism

Seriously? I'm new to Fortnite, so I really don't know haha.
Non-Toxic
You didn't see that meme did you?  Someone posted on Twitter "things we didn't know existed until fortnite collabed with them" and it was 4 images and one was robocop  Then a bunch of parodies were made like ones with marvel and shit
Non-Toxic
I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll ever see Jabba Switchway or Go Mufasa return lol
Non-Toxic
Lol the emote is cool but I forget which skins they are I‚Äôd rather bring back Travis or kratos
Non-Toxic
I was just trolling lmao. They‚Äôll come back eventually. Just give it time.
Non-Toxic
I've seen variations of that like when Elton John did a song with Kanye West lol but yea I get it now
Non-Toxic
But why? Im waiting for pull up.  Edit: i just searched the author on Wikipedia, yeah he did a lot of unpleasant things, but it seems like he did things during the times his emotes were selling normally. Where exactly people drew the line?
Non-Toxic
Dababy said some very, very shitty/gross/dumb/stupid things at a concert. There's more information about that in other sites.  Obviously, it ruined his reputation and killed his career almost immediately.  I'm pretty sure none of his emotes will return.
Toxic
Because he has become too controversial for Epic to work with.
Non-Toxic
I don't know the guy, the emote was good
Non-Toxic
Almost everything is controversial in some way.
Non-Toxic
>I don't know the guy  Ok, I never said you did. I only explained why it won't come back.

After that concert, the emotes only came back once (August 16, 2021).
Non-Toxic
   
Non-Toxic
   As far as I know, shops are prepared far in advance, so they probably forgot to remove it. They never repeated the mistake again.
Non-Toxic
   
Non-Toxic
   If you want more evidence: in December of that year, people found an unused audio and locker icon for another Dababy emote. Nothing happened and those files were removed in a different update.
Non-Toxic
I wish they give psycho bandit cel shading, since the whole reason why borderlands became so popular was because of it unique cel shading art style, hopefully when he return epic update him.
Non-Toxic
Borderlands is not anime tho? Cel shading exists
Non-Toxic
borderlands = anime   lol. The term is 'cel-shaded'.

Yeh im done with anime shit.. The need to be more original and make some more character concepts of their own.

Eren looks awesome!
Non-Toxic
Hard agree. The cel shading filter sucks and they should offer the option to remove it.
Non-Toxic
shit i didn‚Äôt know borderlands was considered ‚Äúanime‚Äù now.

People misunderstood. I'm saying the borderlands works and anime doesn't. I never said borderlands was anime

Some don‚Äôt look that good but I‚Äôd say Eren looks pretty decent

I think it was pretty fun. It had my favorite pois, like dusty depot and moisty mire, the unnamed locations were also really good. I also liked the fact that mountains were actually dangerous, but now you can simply just slide down a near 90 degree slope. Plus some of the coolest skins came from chapter one like black knight and omega.
Non-Toxic

Non-Toxic
I tried playing the recreation of the old map in creative 2.0 and honestly I know this is a troll post but I have to agree. Playing without mantling and sprinting and swimming would be painful now. That being said, I never played chapter one so I never felt the ¬¥vibe‚Äô
Non-Toxic
I think it was really good for the first half, but from the second half onward it was worse than chapter 2, but I still think chapter 1 had the best map
Non-Toxic
Why does chapter 1 suck?
Non-Toxic
The game was fresh and a new experience every match. Now almost every game is a carbon copy every season. Acquire meta weapons, meta mobility item, win. There's little variance in game play compared to how it was back then. The mechanics might be inferior but it was the overall vibe of the game and the way people played it that was far more enjoyable than what we have now.
Non-Toxic
it doesnt suck but it would just feel weird to play
Non-Toxic
I actually agree this this unironically. Chapter 1 was super barebones and, compared to the newer stuff nowadays, is just kinda outdated and shit
Non-Toxic
Just trolling, seeing how many people lose their minds like 5 year olds. So far, so good
Non-Toxic
OP really said ch4 had the best weapons and itemsüíÄ

Yeah, this is just to see the 5 year olds reply. I never got to play much of Chapter 1, but the new guns are really annoying and overpowered, so I'm just trolling here.

>What should I do?  Don't cheat.
Non-Toxic
If you cheat on any game you get banned in all others
Non-Toxic
You deserve to be banned from online gaming in general.
Non-Toxic
Kiddions works via injection as far as I can tell. If it does, that's why you were banned in Fortnite.  EAC scans every single file on your computer, which you agreed to when you run a game with it for the first time. If it detects a program like this - regardless of what game it's for - you run a very high risk of being banned in Fortnite. At that point, there's nothing you can really do.
Non-Toxic
You probably got banned because GTA V and Fortnite both use EAC.

This comment section is so outta touch lol who cares if you "cheat" in a single player game if you can even call it cheating, so bugs and exploits are aswell but it doesn't harm ANYONE, also you're right there's no way you can be banned via GTA in Fortnite read the terms and service and there's nothing about anti cheat overlap.
Non-Toxic
You can admit you cheated, no one‚Äôs going to judge. At least anymore than they already have

Woww thanks for the advice. I really appreciate the advice in helping me recover my accountt.üòÅ

Non-Toxic
your welcome man, we accept everybody here.
Non-Toxic
As another guy Said fortnite and gta have like a connected anti cheat sistem, you cheated in one and got banned in the other
Non-Toxic
they use the same anti cheat, meaning that you can be banned in Fortnite for cheating in gta, even if you are not banned in gta.
Non-Toxic
You clearly have no idea what happened. I have GTA V on STEAM, Fortnite on EPIC GAMES, and they do not use the same ANTICHEAT. PLUS I have NEVER been banned on ANY OTHER game before.
Non-Toxic
But, they DONT USE THEY SAME ANTICHEAT WHY IS EVERYONE SAYING THIS THEY DONT USE THE SAME ANTICHEAT
Non-Toxic
So are you admitting that you cheat but since you didn't cheat in fortnite, you shouldn't be banned?
Non-Toxic
Serves you right cheating prick.
Toxic
yeah they do man
Non-Toxic
ALSO stop trying to get every community with "andrewtate" banned. most of them are just meme communities.

also if everyone is saying the same answer then you are just foolish and want a answer other than the one that is correct.

Non-Toxic
Not at the time, no.
Non-Toxic
Honestly  just throw yourself into fights if you lose see what you did wrong the best way to get better at fights is to have them  And dont go with the mentality that you wont hit them cause mentality is also a factor just fight its a pub if you lose or win the gunfight your getting experience.  What I usually do in solos which I dont play a lot is just get my loadout and go for shots and bounties and go for as many kills as I can. With time you'll learn stuff like try to get high ground as much as you can, abuse of right hand peek, follow the meta but the most important of all to not rage or get sad when ur trying to improve  Do you play with friends? My friends aren't the biggest aimers and hate to play solo but we all have a good time in duos/trios/squads that might help
Non-Toxic
The thing is I‚Äôm a ‚Äúexperienced‚Äù player because I‚Äôm playing since beginning but with little brakes. I know the meta, I know every mechanics of the game etc but only thing I miss is lack of aim so I‚Äôm not confident in fights, close range especially. I like playing coop, but I can‚Äôt stand randoms while have no friends in game :>
Non-Toxic
Btw how does one get that LFG thing you have behind ur name? Kinda new to using reddit
Non-Toxic
Well to be fair I was also scared of close ranged fights when I started playing and I still am (console players) but I just stopped caring if I die or not for the sake of getting better.     I also hate playing games solo not only fortnite so maybe try to go on the lfg fortnite discord channel or if u dont mind im down to play most of the times

Crushing. Is it displaying as having the calculator in the shop?

Did you just rushedly buy the bundle without even looking at contents?
Non-Toxic
CONGRATULATIONS!!! You're the 100th person to make this post. With this. You still get no calculator. :(  But hey. Small Victories!!!
Non-Toxic
Of course not, that was a PS+ Pack exclusive from years ago. It's been know for weeks that they had the wrong image in the files, kinda messed up that Epic had all that time but still didn't fix it before putting the bundle in the shop.  Either way, they know, they say they're sorry for the mix-up, and you can refund the bundle for free without having to use a Refund Ticket.
Non-Toxic
I have seen this post earlier
Non-Toxic
Oh you mean the bundle with the picture of the calculator?
Non-Toxic
Of course not?  How can you say that?  It was in the picture.  I understand it was a mistake, but the picture was there.
Non-Toxic
I have counted 13 of these
Non-Toxic
Yeah, the single picture and not the itemized list you get shown before purchasing.
Non-Toxic
To be clear, I meant because it was an exclusive item that will never be resold in the shop.   It may be on the picture, but when you click into the bundle to buy it, it clearly displays every item in the bundle and that backbling isn't in the list. There are a couple reasons for players to realize it isn't in the bundle before they make a purchase.   However, I do agree that Epic definitely should have just fixed the image before releasing this locker bundle.
Non-Toxic
I'm gonna make it 14 times
Non-Toxic
You mean the picture on every bundle that shows you what‚Äôs in the bundle? Wack I would need to actually check on this one bundle wouldn‚Äôt you think?
Non-Toxic
So every person who bought it was supposed to know it was a playstation exclusive and would never be sold.  
Non-Toxic
   Also, there was a pickaxe recently that they had made a similar mistake with and they honored the pickaxe, it took a couple weeks but the purchaser received the pickaxe.

I mean, do you‚Äôre eyes glaze over when you get to the purchase screen? Do you just instantly hit the purchase button as soon as it pops up? Do you not inspect the items at all before buying
Non-Toxic
Again, you can also clearly see on the purchase page that it isn't actually included in the bundle.  That was different, it wasn't an exclusive pickaxe, just one that wasn't in the bundle at the time. They won't be doing that this time, instead they're offering free refunds for anybody who bought the bundle.
Non-Toxic
yep, I was so excited to get that calculator. I thought epic was adding a easter egg. damn. lol
Non-Toxic
I don‚Äôt need to inspect the items tho, i knew I wanted the calculator and it showed the calculator. So I got it sadly no calculator as there
Non-Toxic
I am one of the people that never look at the purchase page.  Yes the people who bought it and then was disapointed received a free return.  But not everyone who bought it knew it was playstation exclusive and that it wasn't supposed to be sold.
Non-Toxic
But you couldn‚Äôt take like a single second to look at the list of items? You just saw the single picture and just rushed to buy without looking at all. I‚Äôm sorry but this might be a learning experience
Non-Toxic
I know right epic needs to learn to put the correct items in the bundle picture. They made the mistake not the consumers, they clearly showed we get the calculator in the bundle picture. Now it‚Äôs on them to fix THERE mistake
Non-Toxic
It‚Äôs also a good time for you to learn to not impulsively purchase items without at the very least giving them a second glance before purchasing. Yeah, Epic is at fault but don‚Äôt act like the consumer isn‚Äôt also at fault for not giving a second glance at the bundle, especially when it shows on the purchase screen
Non-Toxic
Name me one bundle that doesn‚Äôt show ALL the items in the bundle on the shop page. Once you do that you are correct
Non-Toxic
I would like this since the Anti-Cheat isn't working nearly as well as it should.
Non-Toxic
Exactly. I gotten a player banned 3 times and keeps hacking.. Would be nice with some form of block system
Non-Toxic
I'm also a parent of a similar aged child.  Delayed gratification and managing ones time is a vital life skill that is transferable to many areas.  There are always going to be distractions  Either they learn to manage it now with your help or you ban it and they have to learn to cope as a young adult   Have you tried playing fortnight with your child ?

Discord is pretty safe if he keeps to like private calls with his friends or their own server other than that is just common internet sense like no clicking links and all of that. About fortnite It's normal to a degree I've gotten tunneled for a lot of games in my life (20yrs) and still do but I know not to go overboard. It's good to have limits and probably taking that away from him could also be taking away good time with his friends and it would probably end up with him just wanting to play more
Non-Toxic
In that age, doing what your friends are doing is like it's always been, doing the same stuff and "being popular".   Discord is just another program to use a mic with.   Let him have some fun. I grew up playing games with my brother, age of no mics.. But I had some boundaries from my parents.   Perhaps playing together would be a thing? Otherwise, set some rules as you see fit
Non-Toxic
Yeah you should let him keep playing on weekends with friends. Maybe restrict him to 2 hours per day if you're really concerned about it, but don't completely take away that time with friends.  Maybe even join in with him, or play by yourself for a bit to relate to him.
Non-Toxic
i personally wouldn't take his gaming away. fortnite can be addicting, I've personally experienced that. however, children do need help with learning time management.   discord is perfectly safe to use is mostly used for talking with your friends while you game.
Non-Toxic
I had the same thing with Minecraft years ago at a similar age to your son and was also getting into the rest of the internet.  Don‚Äôt take that time away, since games in general are quite a big part of social circles for young kids especially now, just make sure he does his schoolwork etc. before playing, then he can go and enjoy the time with his friends!
Non-Toxic
You mention sports. I guess a good question is. Did they pretty much live and breathe sports for a while? The reason I ask is because this seems to be a case of hyperfocus. Anything could possibly become addicting in this degree. Not to say the game or sports are an issue. But there have to be boundaries, and at the end of the day, the ability to not need to work on one thing.  Outside of that Discord is fine if its the main BR channel.
Non-Toxic
First of all Discord is as safe as any other social media.. meaning it‚Äôs not very safe at all but if you let them be on Snapchat TikTok etc might as well let them do discord.   It sounds like this is how he and his friends hang out, so of course he‚Äôs going to want to play it everyday.   Unless you were hoping he would be a professional athlete someday, I don‚Äôt see anything wrong with him replacing physical sports with gaming.   There‚Äôs also a possibility that his friends want him to play other times of the week because there are different challenges and events that come out every day especially on Tuesdays  He probably also wants to check out the shop for rare items that you can‚Äôt get any other day.   I would definitely not keep him from playing Fortnite. It sounds like he‚Äôs passionate about it. Maybe it‚Äôs hard to understand for someone outside of the gaming world, but practicing every day to get good at a game you love and play with your friends can be a positive thing, and keeping him away from it can have negative consequences
Non-Toxic
Sports isn‚Äôt everything, I‚Äôd be more concerned if his grades dropped.
Non-Toxic
I play with my 12yo and his friends frequently. When i think it's time to do something else,it's easier if I'm a participant.
Non-Toxic
Yes, sports would usually be all he lives for.. This is a really good point. I just assumed the game was addictive but it is probably him needing to understand/learn limits and boundaries.
Non-Toxic
I had a lot of issues growing up with focusing on one thing. It turned out to be a bit of trouble with hyperfocusing. I either put too many eggs in one basket or not enough in others. I am always an advocate for dreams. But I also dealt with dyslexia. And overcompensated with sports. Gaming. Other hyperfocused but not school work type of hobbies. Etc. And tried to prove my worth in that.

People always say this stuff about bots. I know there are bots but how can you guys always tell? Is there some way to tell?
Non-Toxic
I can never tell which ones are bots, how do you guys always know?
Non-Toxic
Terrible aim none of them tried to find cover or use anything aside from weapons. It‚Äôs unusual to not get hit once while fighting 3 people
Non-Toxic
The first two I get... But a bot in a ghost rider skin just doesn't seem likely to me.
Non-Toxic
Bot skins change all the time although I‚Äôm not sure whether or not collab skins can be bot skins. Take that with a grain of salt though, I‚Äôm not 100% sure
Non-Toxic
The bots all move ruffly the same way, take a few hits turn and run.
Non-Toxic
Like I said. I can see it for the two default skins but the ghost rider skin didn't have any of the hallmarks of a bot except maybe poor aim.
