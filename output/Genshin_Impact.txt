*The* Forbidden Knowledge is not the same as "knowledge that is forbidden," as strange as that sounds. The Forbidden Knowledge is some... *thing* from the abyss. Something so utterly alien, so completely incomprehensible and entirely inimical to life that its mere presence causes the world itself to start breaking down.  What Dottore told Nahida was merely something that Celestia doesn't want people to know (or at least we think that's the case). He gave her knowledge that is forbidden, but not Forbidden Knowledge.

Does make me raise a lot of questions. Is she any less of a being than other puppets like Scara or Chalk-Man? In other words, I’m holding out for her being an playable character. Geo Catalyst baby.   But also, what’s she also doing in Sumeru, the land where robots are forbidden?
Non-Toxic
1. Robots are forbidden? Where was that stated? 2. The majority of people do not know she is a robot installed by Shnezhnaya.
Non-Toxic
robots aren't forbidden, the study of artificial intelligence is. The Akademiya didn't make Katheryne, so she doesn't come under their purview. I'm also not sure if Katheryne counts as artificial intelligence? Or like, each puppet doesn't seem to have a unique consciousness, and it's possible that she's just a robustly programmed & maintained secretary-bot. If whoever's maintaining the Katherynes has enough resources/efficiency (considering there's a good chance it's Sandrone/Fatui this is very possible), it's possible that instead of learning/adapting to her environments she's just getting constant updates.  Albedo is a homunculus as opposed to a puppet, a homunculus is closer to being a magic test tube baby then it is a puppet or robot.
Non-Toxic
> Robots are forbidden? Where was that stated?  Study into the creation of artificial life has been banned at the Academiya. Play Tighnari's story quest for some more details.  It's unclear if Shogun/Wanderer/Katherine style puppets fall under that mandate.

Unfortunately, as of right now, no for Geo, Hydro and Pyro, but Wanderer (anemo) is somewhat similar, but his attacks are still ranged, though he's a limited five star, so if you want to pull for him you'll have to wait for a rerun.

6 months. Back then there were no guides except for Enviosity and not a lot of comps due to less character options. And everyone was still learning the game mechs. ICD was a very fancy term that only smartasses knew about.

I finished it around february with a level 20 yelan lmao, and I've been playing since november?
Non-Toxic
Bro i went through the same thing except i had access to guides but i avoided them- because i refuse help of any type 😃 i don't know why i do this to myself 😃
Non-Toxic
I've been playing since wanderer release but only really got into 3 months ago and cool it took me a lvl 60 diluc and fischl, diona, and sucrose (all lvl 40) and second half is shenhe, chongyun, xingqiu, and someone to break enemy shields (all lvl 60)
Non-Toxic
That's good I think o.o You learnt the mechs on your own and figured out the best way to deal with the chambers using your own preferred units! Keep up that spirit for Abyssal moon cycles. Don't let the community convince you that you need X meta hyperdps or Zhongli to make the abyss easy for you.   Sincerely a Chongyun main.
Non-Toxic
Bro my first half was always diluc, diona, fischl and sucrose it was so hard- especially since diluc was the only one above level 50-  And my second half would always beat it in less than a minute with shenhe, chongyun, xingqiu, and a character to break enemy shields   Sincerely a shenhe main (who always uses chongyun too)
Non-Toxic
Also i don't wanna use zhongli i spent 3 months perfecting my dodging skills i don't wanna lose that 😭
Non-Toxic
Wow you played in harsher conditions than I did. I didn't touch chamber 8 until AR 40. I am pretty sure my characters were around lvl 80 with random berserker and martial artist artifacts.   My side 1 was probably Klee, Fischl, Barbara and probably sucrose. Then my side 2 was Chongyun, Xingqiu, Xiangling and Jean. Got my Bennett during first lantern rite in xiao banner. I was using a variant of national even before it became a thing 🤣  And yeah second side do be like that haha. Before they started adding bosses on alternate side in chamber 12, it was the same for me. Everything dead in one cycle for Chong side, which was usually the other half of the chamber.
Non-Toxic
My personal experience with the abyss was that if one team utterly crushed it while the other team struggled, I needed to bite the bullet and pull one of the more capable people off the good team and put them on the other one.
Non-Toxic
Yeah same. 3 years of no zhongli. I still suck at dodging but I pride in no shielder chamber 12 clears. 36* stars ofc. I do use some meta units, but only coz they are people whom I really like. Been archonless for 3+ years but i think i might need to get a Nahida for buffing my Haitham more.
Non-Toxic
Uh- I'm Ar 35 God I'm in pain and i still haven't done the ascension quest tbh-
Non-Toxic
That's why i used a random character for second half and not diluc
Non-Toxic
I don't even know what's Meta- i just take my two teams and fight the abyss and dear god the abyss 9 looks horrible 😭
Non-Toxic
Oh yeah don't stall on it. You are just scuffing your overworld boss drops and increasing your resin usage. Clear the ascension quests the moment they hit you. Lord I would hate doing extra runs on bathysmal vishaps. I have ascended my shenhe to the last stage and also prefarmed for my future Yae. Never again. Fck those two bitches especially.
Toxic
Meta is using stuff like hyperbloom, or hyperdps like Ganyu/Hutao/Ayaka/National (Bennett + Xiangling + Yelan/Xingqiu + flex) teams.   Don't worry about chamber 9 and onwards. You will be missing a couple of biweekly primos. But if you enjoy the combat then I would suggest taking your time in tackling it. You will have 5 mins limit to get 3* per chamber until floor 10-3. After that the limit changes to 3 mins per chamber.   You can try hard ofc, but I would suggest focusing on investing vertically on your account - leveling your favourite units, their talents, their weapons and getting new artifacts. Focus on permanent upgrades like levels and talents over artifacts.
Non-Toxic
I think I'll be fine i do boss rushes to test my skills everyday and everytime i get to the vishaps i do collect their rewards right now (not including the ones i used on shenhe) is about 37
Non-Toxic
Am kinda lazy and just sorta wanna beat it now even though i don't even have lvl 70 characters
Toxic
Well as long as it doesn't burns you out and makes you hate the whole thing. Chambers 9 and 10 are super easy really. But for your current characters, they might be tanky hp sponges. Us older players don't even remember what happens there. I honestly wish we had a dispatch option for chambers 9 and 10 once we cleared it a previous iteration of the same enemy lineup.

The cup is pretty meh. You probably can get a competitive set feather, and use a dendro cup, from a different set, with better stats. You could manage a bit more atk and EM, but that is hard to pull. I have been trying to get an S-tier sands. The best I got is 10% critic chance and 10% atk.
Non-Toxic
LOL. I don't think I can manage that when the scribe also wants ER and EM in his substat rolls!
Non-Toxic
Would you believe me if I told you all of my Gilded Dreams feathers are bad? LOL. For EM, I pair him with Nahida and I heard it's not worth it going beyond 300-500 EM on Alhaitham. I pair him with full EM Nahida so he ends up having like 800 total EM with her. I feel you on the sands though.

Non-Toxic
Did you play at the very start of Sumeru? or did you uninstall just as it was coming out?  If it's the former, not much has really changed besides Nahida being extremely OP, easily a top 5 character. They also added another 5 star to standard banner (Dehya).  If it's the latter, Dendro is hilariously OP, easily outpacing most older teams in terms of DPS. Every electro character got a big buff from Dendro, besides maybe Electro MC. Kuki Shinobu is a top tier 4 star now as a hyperbloom carry, and Thoma is actually useful as a burgeon carry. Keqing went from zero to hero due to Aggravate. Lisa is decent. Hydro is still omnipresent. Xiao got a great 4* support in Faruzan. Burning still sucks. Scaramouche got released under a different name. ~~Still no Eula rerun.~~

Non-Toxic
Can anyone explain why shenhe needs an er sand?
Non-Toxic
noblesse 4p seems to be better than 2-2 atk ones.
Non-Toxic
You use an ER sand if you are running an ATK weapon primarily for the same reason you run ER% on any character - they don't otherwise fill up their burst fast enough without it in the team they are in.
Non-Toxic
Because her off field aoe damage and resistance shred is more important than getting slightly more damage for the 5/7 quills.
Non-Toxic
In this respect does er increase the burst effective or just reduce its cd?
Non-Toxic
it allows her burst to be ready faster since she is off field more often in combat. with 80 energy burst and being off field it's harder to fill her burst so er sands helps this issue
Non-Toxic
At c0 she needs around 200% to work properly when paired with another cryo character. If you run а double Favonius with high crit rate (40%+) she can have less er (180% or sometimes even 160-170%). Shenhe's c1 reduces her er requirements by \~15%.

Not everyone’s an ultra grinder who reaches endgame state 5 minutes after every update yo. Y’all need to chill fr.

I got to Chasm and Enkanomiya all the time. If you are farming OW they have some good mobs to farm. Enkanomiya is currently the hardest OW by quiet a good margin.

There is underground, But I'm not sure how much is underground.
Non-Toxic
Me too
Non-Toxic
Yes, but after you farm their materials, do you go back? Of course not (unless you haven’t explored it all and would like to).
Non-Toxic
It's not "somebody". If you ask any endgame player, he doesn't go to enkanomiya. Unless he loves that place of course. It's least visited place, you can check the data.
Non-Toxic
It's the game's fault. No commission,no archon quest happens there,no statue of the 7(no heal). Only if you need the boss material you go and explore it if you haven't. Idk what they were thinking when making that place without these basic functions. I remember it when it first came out. Everyone was like,"woo, let's go". But after a month,it became abandoned. The place really nice man, I love it but there's no reason for me to go there 🥲.
Non-Toxic
Because there's no daily quests or domains there? Also most events don't occur in chasm / enkanomiya... That explains why these areas are among the least visited.   I don't mind separate underground areas like Chasm / Enkanomiya... They actually look beautiful. Sumeru undergrounds drove me crazy though, especially when hunting for dendroculus.
Non-Toxic
Ar 60 day 1 player and i still go there from time to time because those places are full of elites that give artifacts and mora and they are the perfect places to go to when you want to play the game but are done with dailies.

Non-Toxic
Oh, yeah domain. You got a good point. Now I am relieved that the new area is not gonna be another enka/chasm. In the release it will have two domains and 1 over world boss. Only these things alone can carry the place. Thank God, I don't have to abandon another beautiful place.  (Note: enka beauty isn't a factor, every area in the game is gorgeous. The point is to make it functional. Otherwise who would go there?) You can't just set a blind eye on hoyo and say,"I want another enka" just bcuz the area is beautiful. Beauty is always the main target, they have to make it beautiful no matter what. The questionable thing is its function.
Non-Toxic
Yeah, one time commission. Then?  Can't you read why I wrote the statue of the 7? Do you know the function of it? It heals when you need it. Can your "electro god statue" heal my character? I would need to go to the surface again, why? Give me some functions  if you like enkanomiya that much(except beauty which every area has). Dude that's just an area,stop being stubborn. I had to force myself to 100% exploration. Why would I go there? Follow the data, players aren't dumb. If most players don't go there,it has some reasons.
Non-Toxic
Aw man. If only there were other ways to heal your characters without the need to go to a specific place or go through a loading screen.
Non-Toxic
an ok theory, but you're only "an idiot" on one part: aether clearly DID go through the entire world like lumine is doing now.   a lot of people in teyvat don't know him not because he didn't make the journey, but mostly because he made the journey 500 fucking years ago, and some actually DO know him even after all that. he implied it himself at the end of the 1st archon quest with dainsleif that he traveled the world, with dainsleif essentially being his paimon. venti was basically just like "ehe idk" and didn't even try to be helpful in that regard. zhongli said that he may've known something about aether, but needed to shut the fuck up as per a contract. both the shogun and nahida weren't the archon at the time aether was going places which might explain them not knowing aether directly. the aranara, though, each and every one of them knows aether (HARD implied) as the first golden nara, and nara varuna. if anything, the sumeru quests contribute even more to the idea that aether did indeed travel the world, not the other way around. not to mention the caribert archon quest which showed that aether and dainsleif took shelter in that same wooden hut just like lumine did (dainsleif even cutely protected him as he slept exactly like paimon did lumine). seriously, following aether's footsteps is lowkey the whole point of lumine's journey, the idea of which only grows stronger and stronger as genshin story progresses.  now, to add a sprinkle of my own personal thoughts: i think the brainwash and installing fake memory thing is kinda cheap writing, I highly doubt hoyo with follow through with something like that. it'd be much cleaner if lumine's cluelessness about the past is purely due to her time-skipping in SOHP's cube, not due to someone hacking her brain and doing whatever they want with what lumine thinks is the past, and consequentially what the players think is the canon lore.

Are you new? Banners expire, wishes and primogems don't expire

Yes, these wishes will stay after the banner ends and transitions to the next one, so you don't need to worry about losing them :)
Non-Toxic
Well i wanna keep them for Nahida, and i was scared that they would disappear cuz it sayd "limited wishing item", so i do keep the wishes right?
Non-Toxic
It's called a "limited wishing item", because it's for use with the "Limited Wish" banner, not because it expires.  Holy shit, do you know how angry people would be if this game just zeroed your bank account every patch? That's stuff you can pay for.
Non-Toxic
Yes, you keep them all. It's called "limited" because the featured 5-star character will change and won't be available again until it reruns.
Non-Toxic
Yes you will keep them
Non-Toxic
Well I'm kinda new at this game so that's a relief
Non-Toxic
They never expire. Save for a character you really want.
Non-Toxic
Yeah, I figured.  This becomes sort of the metagame for free-to-play or low-spenders, is keeping an eyeball on characters you want, and exercising the willpower to hoard your currency for them alone.  As F2P, if you scrounge up every Primogem and Wish reward the game freely gives you, through exploration and events and daily commissions, you can guarantee yourself a character that you want pretty much every other patch.

The RESTRICT Act is a separate law than what you're thinking of, and it is for the general population, very similar to the Patriot Act. You're right that the existing ban is on government devices only.

Why? Question from a non US citizen, I guess it’s about US comments about restrictions to tik tok right?

Oh, it's so much worse then that. If it were just banning TikTok, I wouldn't mind. But it goes way further. If there is ANY foreign influence in ANY medium of entertainment you have: the government will have absolute free license to observe and spy on everything you do, watch and are allowed to see. or if you use a VPN it can result in jail time.

You can contact Hoyoverse customer support and request them to unlink your PSN with the Genshin account that was created back when you first tried it on PS5. **This will delete that Genshin account.**   You can then link your PSN with the Genshin account created on Android. However you should make sure that the region of your PSN account and the Genshin account you want to link match.   You can also create a new PSN account and link your Android Genshin account to that, although this will mean you have to change PSN accounts whenever you want to play Genshin.

My theory is that Aloy IS a Descender, but Hoyo can't either confirm not deny that until they re-negotiate a new contract with Sony and Guerilla Games, which probably won't happen until Horizon 3 comes out...  Which probably won't happen for another 2-3yrs...  Just in time for the Snezhnayan arc of Genshin.  &#x200B;  Therefore when Hoyo are diving deep into the ramifications of Descenders on Teyvat, it will be confirmed that Aloy is indeed one of those Descenders, she'll finally get Constellations, and she'll be a somewhat integral part of the war against Celestia.  In the meantime she's just in the background doing things here and there.

1. What exactly are the twins  I always found it interesting that the twins act very human, despite being able to live hundreds of years and being able to fight gods (with their original power). There was also a line in Venti's story quest, abut the Traveler having an imaginary friend as a kid. Now, I haven't checked if the line is the same in the CN version (EN version sometimes create misunderstandings with their choice of words...). But assuming that's indeed the indented line, than the twins most likely aged normally at some point. I'm guessing they were born as regular humans, but obtained greater powers to protect their home world. The long lifespan came as a side effect. However, that wasn't enough, as their home got destroyed. Another possibility I can think of is that they were some powerful beings from the get-go, but were raised as humans.  2. The roles of the twins  Another thing I find peculiar is how the Sustainer treated the twins. The sibling got caught first in a cube. Said cube was shrunk and she just kept it. While the Traveler was left trapped in the air and eventually lost consciousness. On top of that, their powers were sealed and they found themselves on a beach in Mondstadt 500 years later. While the sibling ended up back in Teyvat, during the Cataclysm or right after (they helped the Aranara deal with the effects of it) and with their powers seemingly intact (in Caribert, when we see the sibling's reflection, they have parts of their outfit glowing white, just like in the opening cutscene). So, why this major difference in treatment? I'm guessing because Celestia wants something from the sibling. In Inversion of Genesis, we find out they came to Teyvat because the heavens responded to the summoning. Not sure what this entitles, but it's clear Celestia has some plans.   It would also explain why the Sustainer stopped the twins from leaving. I mean, that's also a really weird occurrence. Two being from another world can only mean trouble. Not to mention one of them might have had a role in the Cataclysm. So, letting them leave seems more logical. But that's not happened.  As for the Traveler, perhaps the Sustainer wanted to use them as motivation for the sibling. Or, she actually wanted to leave them to die, as they seem unnecessary, but someone rescued them. Perhaps that someone did so out of pity. Or because they don't agree with Celestia's plan and saw the potential in the Traveler to stop it. Or maybe both.  3.  The first Hydro Archon  There is a theory circling around that the current Hydro Archon caused the death of the first one and that's why the Lochfolk hate her, on top of not agreeing with her ideals. I quite like this theory, but I'd like to add a twist: it wasn't intentional. Focalors respected and admired the previous Archon, despite having different perspectives. She wanted to be acknowledged by them. But instead, she caused their death.  I'm also guessing there was something related to Heavenly Principals involved, which might have endangered the population as well. This caused Focalors to strictly follow them and never do something to piss of Celestia.

when u break the barrier separating yours and Nahida’s consciousness the power they use looks like something completely new so maybe it’s what they had left over from their original power
Non-Toxic
Yeah big deal. Kazuha wielded two visions at once too. Apparently they don’t just vanish when you die. Someone could theoretically be a vision collector I guess provided they’re as powerful as Kazuha is.

The best Razor build right now is EM Razor with Nahida/Xingqiu/Bennett.   Artifacts (EM/EM/EM): 4Pc Paradise > 4Pc Gilded > 2+2 EM   Weapon: Fav Greatsword since he need some ER in this team.
Non-Toxic
His primary build is a Physical DPS build which would be:  Artifact sets: 4pc Pale Flame / 2pc Pale Flame + 2pc Bloodstained Chivalry / 2pc PF or BC + 2pc 18% ATK%  Artifact mainstats: Attack/physical dmg bonus/Crit Rate or crit DMG.   Artifact substats: Crit > Atk > ER > EM  Weapons: Snow-Tombed Starsilver  Team: include at least one Cryo for Superconduct reactions.

Bennett needs to be C6 for this team to be optimal btw.

Use kuki or raiden. How will you control who procs the dendro cores?
Non-Toxic
Looks like a hyperbloom reaction team. Ayato + Yaoyao would create the dendro cores in bloom reactions, but Yae Miko doesn’t consistently hit the dendro cores to trigger hyperbloom reactions, so you might want to switch her with Kuki Shinobu or Raiden if you want to do hyperbloom. However, you if you swapped Yaoyao for an electro or hydro healer, that could be decent for an electro-charged team.
Non-Toxic
I would wither drop Yaoyao or Kazuha. Yae is meh for hyper bloom. Kazuha will support shock, but is not good for dendro.
Non-Toxic
I don't get what "proc the dendro core" means
Non-Toxic
I thought you were trying a hyperbloom team
Non-Toxic
I am. But I'm so confused 😭 what do you mean?
Non-Toxic
Kuki and raiden are good at applying electro to dendro cores and causing hyperbloom. Kazuha is fine but only if he swirls electro. Also, yaoyao doesn't apply enough dendro you might need dendro mc with her.

Honestly if this were my account I would prefer to start over. And if I got qiqi again for my first 5* I might start over again.
Non-Toxic
You should be safe to restart. There isn’t anything “god tier” based on the character roster image.
Non-Toxic
List the chars if you could  After looking no you can restart and get nearly all of them except for qiqi.  Best chars are likely fischl, xingqiu but rumor has it fischl may get a rerun in second upcoming banner.  And by qiqi I mean that technically as a 5 star she potentially won't come on the blue standard banner until closer to pity or as a 50/50 loss on the uprank limited char banner.  You may get another standard banner char and not her some players still he haven't been blessed by our beloved zombie goblin.
Non-Toxic
You don’t have anything in there that you’d miss, so if you wanna start fresh go for it! Amost all those characters are either given for free on any account, or available in the starglitter shop. Yunjin and yanfei aren’t, but they’re not particularly meta. Xingqiu and fischl are definitely recommended to get again but even if you’re really unlucky with pulling them, you can get them from the shop

Follow the instructions for a fresh install.  On the first run it will update to the latest version, hopefully you won't have problems at that point.  Good luck.

it's happened to me before too. Only happens if you play on controller obviously. Now I'm always careful to see where the cursor is instead of mashing square.   if you have Kazuha, you can stand some distance from the ley line E and plunge. That will gather all the loot into a ball near you and far enough from the ley line that you won't accidentally loot it.

I switched my buttons around (for combat reasons) and to pick items up I use circle. So when I touch the leylines by accident while picking up items It just cancels it. Might be helpful for you.

Dottore has always been insane (see: >!Eleazar hospital, the notes hidden in the cave by the escapee, and the notes about Sohreh around Sumeru!<). He joined the Fatui because Pierro recruited him specifically because of all the messed up things he was doing that got him expelled in the first place and Pierro was offering him space to do his crazy research without judgment.
Non-Toxic
I'm not sure what you're talking about with divine knowledge, from all we know he just knows about the fake sky, and that wouldn't drive you mad.   My theory is he was basically just a kid with a lot of curiosity and a lack of empathy, which got him driven out of his home village and later expelled from the Akademiya, which lead to Pierro recruiting him (wise doctor's pinion). The Fatui provide him with funding and material for his research, and he provides them with new military technology, but ultimately he'd betray them if there was a better arrangement to be found.
Non-Toxic
Sumeru drops crazy lore especially about our character
Non-Toxic
the sky over Teyvat would be mind blowing for anyone to know initially and would fit the criteria of forbidden knowledge as everyone would know it or most educated people would but not even Nahida knew it.   Enkanomiya shows that there is a lot of things even seemingly trivial that they don’t want humans to know
Non-Toxic
I still don't think it would be enough to take any precaution. Especially because he calls it a rumor himself. iirc even Mona knows about it in unreconciled stars, and it wasn't implied that there's a new forbidden knowledge corruption on the way now that Nahida knows about it.  Imo, what actually drives people mad about forbidden knowledge is not any kind of comprehensible information, but one that is corrupted in itself, like looking at some lovecraftian moster.
Non-Toxic
well I imagine we will see quite lovecraft inspired at the bottom of the abyss which I’m excited for
Non-Toxic
I don't trust hoyo to pull that off right, lol. The thing about lovecraft stuff is, it immediately loses its horror if you actually see it in games. Loads of horror games use it as a base material, but they don't get the subtlety right, and Genshin writings is about as subtle as a brick through a window most of the time.
Non-Toxic
some storyline’s are surprisingly dark and sad especially in Sumeru so I think they could pull off the storyline but design maybe no

I don't think you know how the pieces work... Alhaitham and Lisa should be an unique piece or be replaced by other character (Mona and Cyno most likely) because I assume they are the queen. Also, kings should see each other.  With that said, I guess 1.e4
Non-Toxic
I am disturbed with the arrangement of the chess pieces
Non-Toxic
Ok, one can't decide what to move when the characters don't even make sense as to what role they play. Is Cyno a rook or is Candace a rook, or is she a knight? Alhaitham is a king or queen? If so, why are there two of him? Are Mona and Jean both knights? Is Lisa a double queen situation again?

in coop vs Signora I still see people destroying those things that remove biting cold when you stand near it. People still don't know that you can just stand near it instead of destroying it. It's been 2 years.  Thank god Signora is about to finally be let off the hook from my weeklies now that a new boss is coming.  Another annoying thing is when they pick Raiden to fight Raiden. In human form they look the same so I'm often going after the wrong Raiden.

Non-Toxic
Signora: they know lol. Destroying the thingies just removes all of the bar at once for everyone while standing near it just affects the player doing it. They don't want to disrupt the fight by going back and forth and wait so they brutforce until it affects health, destroy one and go again. If everyone does it that way (concentrate on attacking instead of the bar and 1 player goes to remove the bar for all) she dies quicker typically.   It's just a different way of approaching the fight, in a perfect coop world the group would agree beforehand which way to do it.
Non-Toxic
As someone who primarily bring Yae Miko or Yaoyao in Signora's domain, I feel like I'm obligated to apologize to everyone who experienced this. Especially for those who played with Yaoyao, her E's projectiles are actually AOE on hit. So if you stand too close to those things while being healed by Yaoyao, it will also get damaged or even destroyed,

My strategy is always use Bennett in coop with Signora because when I don't all of my teammates never stay alive. 🤣 But this way people can just focus on attacking. They'll never die since he heals so fast and the pyro application helps break her shield.

Any healer with Clam standing next to them will slowly destroy them as well.

At least she can heal herself. She's just not ideal in co-op, because she either loses out on damage or everyone else has to adjust to not healing her.

Uhh, asking people from all over the world what PC they have (which often wasn't upgraded for years and there are better options available) is probably not the best idea. I mean I could list you my configuration but it's way overkill for video games in general, let alone something as not demanding as Genshin Impact.  Go to /r/buildapcforme and present your budget (and your location cuz prices in USA vs Netherlands vs Mexico are going to differ quite a lot from each other).  If all you are interested in playing is Genshin you certainly don't need a great PC. By that I mean - you probably could fit within like $600 budget with all parts brand new (and if one also looked for used stuff then you could still hit max settings at like $400-450 but that would involve some 1-2 generation old parts). It's not exactly a demanding game.

200 for a brand new PC that can play games is **not** going to happen. It is feasible if you are going to:  * build it yourself * look for deals on ebay * can either secure a PC case from some dump/reuse older one/use a cardboard for now  But since this actually sounds like an interesting building challenge, here's what I would try (ebay deals, half of this is no longer obtainable new or not worth it anyway):  * Ryzen 5 1600 ($45-50 on ebay) * Any B450 motherboard (I see some deals for as low as $45 on ebay) * Cheapest half a TB SSD you can find (eg. i see [Teampgroup MP33](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/Brvqqs/team-mp33-512-gb-m2-2280-nvme-solid-state-drive-tm8fp6512g0c101) for $29 new and it's actually a totally okay drive) * 8GB DDR4 ($19 for one with [okay specs](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/xQytt6/patriot-viper-elite-ii-8-gb-1-x-8-gb-ddr4-3200-cl18-memory-pve248g320c8) and you could upgrade it to 16GB in the future)  With that we are at $140 and you still need a power supply and a video card. Power supplies are one thing you can't really save money on cuz that's an actual fire hazard if you do. Cheapest new one I can see that is safe on pcpartpicker would [be this one](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/ntxRsY/bitfenix-formula-bronze-600-w-80-bronze-certified-atx-power-supply-bp-fb600ulcb-7r) at $45. That puts you at $183 and there's still most important part - a video card. Absolute **lowest** new that can run any games is [GT1030](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/Q4648d/asus-geforce-gt-1030-2gb-video-card-gt1030-2g-csm) for $90. However it represents a horrible value for the money and if you once more look into ebay deals - $45 does buy you a GTX 1050Ti. So $228 + shipping is the lowest I can imagine, half of the parts from ebay. It should perform okay at Genshin, give or take 40-50 fps at medium settings.   If it was new only - no way to build anything with gaming potential below like $400. And if it was said $400 - well, you could get the [following experience](https://youtu.be/PKmJJb_k_fk).

Lol ty
Non-Toxic
There's no "hackers" when it comes to PC parts. But don't expect to just buy one complete desktop off the shelf, used or not. You will have to build it yourself if you hope to run the games cuz combo deals are generally not going to get you far.   Well, I did give you a starting point to look for parts. It would work okay at Genshin and offer some decent upgrade potential if you wanted to play more demanding games in the future.  Overall your budget is probably too low for any sort of "gaming" PC by normal definition of that word. This is the kind of money I would normally use for a used office class machine. And Genshin while not ultra demanding is also far more than that. I mean, this is half of a base iPad price.
Non-Toxic
As long as it has a decent GPU it should be fine. NVIDIA or AMD.   I play on my laptop that has a gtx 1060 and I can run it at 1080 max everything.   If you pick a desktop it's be even better.   You can check on YouTube how to build a computer (linus tech tips should have a video on it) and then pick the parts that are within your budget.
Non-Toxic
Dang ok thanks for the advice I'll look into it

I saw some of your other comments and honestly you should save... $200 is nothing when building a computer.   Get yourself something nice, there's no need to rush unless you REALLY need a new computer. A $200 dollar computer will give you a terrible experience.    If you only want something to play games on, then ps5 is the best and fastest to play Genshin, but you'll probably also want a good 4k tv to actually use it's hardware.
Non-Toxic
If you've unlocked all the free primos sources (did you do coop achievements and Teapot?), then you just have to wait for the next patch like everyone else or buy them. Characters help for the Spiral Abyss but mostly it's an artifact grind to get the perfect ones for your build.

Swipe your credit card  Alternatively, dailies/events and slowly accrue them over time  There's no real way to "farm" primogems once you're done with one-time sources
Non-Toxic
Play the game and come up with your own achievements like leveling all of your characters to 90 including the ones you don't play. Level every one of their talents to 9. Max out all of your weapons. Farm Ley Lines for Mora until you have 1bil. Speedrun Spiral Abyss or fight World Bosses and test your DPS with food and potions. Create 2000 Mushroom Pizzas with Jean. Go roll a high quality artifact 5/5 times into Crit DMG or whatever. Then do it for every set.
Non-Toxic
There are hidden achievements, and daily commissions give primogems. I believe it's ten for each commission and either ten or twenty for completing all four for the day.
Non-Toxic
Theres set amount of primos world gives, that's why you should use them wisely.
Non-Toxic
Dailies and $5 welkin make a pretty good bundle of primo offerings as well as the events every patch
Non-Toxic
La unica manera de ganar primogemas cuando ya terminaste todo el contenido disponible en el juego es hacer el abismo y los eventos temporales de cada parche. Tambien podes completar sets especificos en la tetera que combinados con ciertos personajes dan algunas primos.
Non-Toxic
open new account and get free primogem again from 0% map.

You get Primo's from doing your daily commissions every single day and by doing the special events that drop every few weeks.

Non-Toxic
Rituals aren't something people think is coded into the game, it's just some vague superstition like wearing the same shirt you used when your team won the last time to watch a game, why would you even need to ask this?  The video you watched is likely meant to be humorous, you don't need to take everything you see in the internet as if it was in earnest
Non-Toxic
I dont think anyone doing rituales actually believe in them
Non-Toxic
My wishing ritual is to swipe until I get the character I want.    So far, I have a 100% success rate.
Non-Toxic
Uh, no, it's obviously not just you.  Any "wishing ritual" is usually just for the giggles. Nobody sensible would actually believe it, and if they do, it's either entirely placebo or purely delusional.
Non-Toxic
Of course, wishing rituals are completely absurd.

Best wishing ritual is "Uninstall the game".   Gives u all all the characters. Trust me.
Non-Toxic
They are absolutely bullshit, yes.  Strictly in theory there **could** be something that affects the odds in video games. RNG manipulation is a thing - eg. in at least one deckbuilder game I know you can make statement like "if you pick a specific drop in chamber 2 then chamber 4 has a 70% chance of having a rare enemy".  This is because computers don't actually do "random". Instead they generate a sequence of numbers based on a specific seed (any value you want - often chosen one is current time but it could also be anything else you want) that serves as a "starting point" to your number generator. And if you have two sequences using same seed but one was already in, say, step 4 then you could predict steps 1 to 3 in the other sequence as they would be identical number wise.  However when it comes to wishing in Genshin I heavily doubt it's connected to ANY in game event or action and it's strictly controlled on the server side. If I were to guess - Genshin's wish RNG is most likely tied to current time down to a milisecond) and your wish count. Aka enough to guarantee that it's impossible for two players to get the exact same wishes and that it's not possible to do "trial" runs on one account (eg. freshly made one using 10 free wishes you get) to reproduce the same results on your main one. Well, there can be some interesting stuff going down deep in the codebase like potentially raising the odds of getting drops under certain conditions (I know some gachas like manipulating RNG a fair bit to increase retention rate) but I REALLY doubt whether fighting any given boss is going to be a factor lol.  So why do some actually believe their wishing rituals to work at all? Because we are humans. We see patterns in places when there really aren't any. This has been researched multiple times - if you make a truly random event with two outcomes then animals actually learn to deal with it 50% of the time. Humans however start looking for patterns.
Toxic
Yea it's complete BS, but from what I've observed, ppl just treat it like another game. If they lose then they feel bad and blame luck/shrug it off, but if they win, then they feel more rewarded and celebrate more.  I guess it's just a way for them to increase expectations and earn more dopamine if they get what they want, so yea- similar to a game if anything.  Well- that's the only logical explanation I could think of on why ppl follow these trends...
Non-Toxic
are you serious?
Non-Toxic
Obviously it’s all fake it just makes people feel better to have a ritual before they play along. It’s like when you pull on a  controller when you’re doing a fishing game or you lean forward when you’re racing to go faster. Of course it doesn’t change the mechanics of the game, it’s just for fun.  RNG is RNG no matter what you do, it’s just for gamer’s enjoyment haha
Non-Toxic
My friend wanted scara.  I got him to beat the boy first, then we got to him with nahida, traveler and... I don't remember now. Cyno, nilou?  We stood at the doors to the lab where we entered to go after him, so my friend could bring him out with his Nahida. He got scara.  This is just one example, and it works most times.  I won my first 50 50 in more than a year by wishing in mid air after jumping from the adeptus abode. Got Rosaria on the angels share. Got Nilou dancing in the theater. Dehya in Aaru village. Koko c1 in the old shrine in Sangonomya. And some more i rather not disclose, not listing more that helped my friend (he doesn't really believe it but he asks me where and how to pull because it worked some times lmao).  It works.  Do you believe in... Magic?  😂😂😂
Non-Toxic
Secret sauce to make sure Diluc appears on your 50/50 is to do a lap around dawn winery and set fire to yourself as you do the 10 pull  >!/j!<
Non-Toxic
Are you really that superstitious?
Non-Toxic
or course it doesn't actually work. It's just superstition and confirmation bias. But some people do it because there's nothing to lose other than a bit of time. I like to do it at meaningful places to the character on screen. If there's no luck there, I try a different spot.
Non-Toxic
Nah this gatta be a bait post, does anyone actually believe rituals work ??? I sometimes do them fot fun but it doesn't change the outcome in anyway shape or form
Non-Toxic
It's fun. It's fun to stand on top of the mountains of Liyue and wish for Shenhe. Or to sit in the cupped hands of the anemo Archon and pull for Venti. It's a GAME. For FUN.  Go play! ❤️
Non-Toxic
i just do it for fun 😭
Non-Toxic
this is satire right? op, you can't seriously believe that wishing rituals are true right?
Non-Toxic
Ofcourse it's bullshit. But I do it to feel good. And honestly personal rituals gave me good pulls. Eg. Good fortune on the fortune slip gave me miko(won the 50/50) and her weapon(40pulls i think), standing on the bridge between the funeral parlor and teahouse gave me a jade spear and yelans bow in 10 pulls the  went for homa. Letting my sister pull on Ayaka banner(first one) got me my first Jean and an Ayaka in a ten pull. Winning the 50/50 on hutao second banner while standing on top of her house. And so many more...that I have forgotten
Toxic
No one actually thinks that these rituals work, they're just fun. And more than that, I think a lot of pulling videos and streams from Genshin content creators can get a little repetitive, especially if they're pulling for others and doing dozens of pulls in a single video. Adding in rituals can add something more to the video/stream for people to watch.
Non-Toxic
No one believes in them but it makes wishing a bit more fun
Non-Toxic
This almost reads like a fluff post. Almost.
Non-Toxic
No, people don't actually believe those, or at least no one I've seen. People think they're fun, and they're often a way for streamers and other Genshin content creators to spice up a pulling stream or video. Otherwise, they'd all just sort of be the same thing.

I’d like a Honkai SR crossover- give us bailu or himeko damnit
Non-Toxic
They most likely don't need to do crossovers at this point, but I would like to see the Dragalia Lost characters again somewhere, now that the game's dead (and never made it into Fire Emblem Heroes at all, despite the reverse).
Non-Toxic
The Persona series just because I saw this limited time event with Fischl facing her other self. Reminds me of P4 and how they awaken their Personas.
Non-Toxic
I feel like Cloud could work really well. Anemo Claymore. Cross Slash for Skill when grounded, Climhazzard if used while jumping. Burst on tap would apply Limit Break to the next action, Normal Attacks would become Omnislash or holding it would unleash Finishing Touch. When Burst is up, the fully charged Limit Break sound dings. Charge animation while idle. Energy restored on hit or taking damage as one of his ascension skills.
Non-Toxic
I’d love a persona crossover because the characters kind of lend themselves well to a game like this (they did a crossover with Another Eden and integrated well).
Non-Toxic
a few silly ones off the top of my head  Zero from Drakengard 3 for Jean  Rorona (or one of the Atelier series girls) for Sucrose  Uni for Keqing  Metallia for Fischl and the Hundred Knight for Oz

Pyro archon is called Murata so we're guaranteed to get a genshin version of Himeko

Kate was the player character during early versions of the game, she was eventually scrapped for Lumine/Aether when they toned down the relations between genshin and honkai a bit
Non-Toxic
Kate Kaslana was main character during very early of development and later changed to current twin MC just how Venti originally was a female.   That said many believed that Kate was later redesigned to Noelle.

That name sounds really similar to Kiana Kaslana, the main character of Honkai Impact.

Pretty sure I'm not alone using solar pearl on Heizou for drip, though it is also a decent pick for him.
Non-Toxic
But... the weapon you have Wanderer using is very meta for him? If I recall it's literally his best weapon pick aside from Tullaytallah's Remembrance  also: Skyward Blade on Layla looks so pretty imo. It's also not bad on her but it's unfortunately far better on other characters

I'm gonna have to politely disagree on that em sword on xingqiu, it bothers me that the blues on the sword are more teal-y than blue     I'd say my picks are probably bell/dehya (they look surprisingly good together), umbrella/shinobu (this is technically meta in some senses but I'd argue umbrella looks better than iron sting), windblume ode/venti, vortex vanquisher/zhongli (I hate that it's his technical 5\* weapon match and it literally isn't good on him for shieldbot), and wandering evenstar/outfit lisa (I leveled it for Nahida on release before getting her weapon, and it looks surprisingly solid on lisa's scholar outfit.. would not pair it with purple mommy version-)
Non-Toxic
For the longest time, I tried to avoid switching to Crescent Pike from the Dragonspine Spear for Rosaria, because the Dragonspine Spear is so pretty on her despite the overall numbers being worse.  This doesn't quite count, but while Dodoco Tales is actually a decent pick for Wanderer, I originally got it and leveled it up with the intention of using it on Scaramouche during the fake leaks saying he'd be playable around 2.3. Unfortunately, it doesn't look nearly as nice on his current skin, but I'm keeping it on him out of stubbornness, and also because I bet he'd be offended by me putting a children's book as his weapon lol.  I'm also grinding for the fish bow in Sumeru, specifically so I can use it as Childe's bow. Does that count as aesthetic over meta? I feel like it does.

alhaitham with the isshin sword. with both that sword and his other sword he uses in attacks glowing, it basically makes his two swords look like opposites, which is cool.  plus, EM swords were a bit overkill for open world content, so I kindoff wanted to nerf myself with him. although when I start going further into the spiral abyss, I might have to finally start using iron sting on him.
Non-Toxic
Candace with kitan spear is my choice

Lost Prayer do be good on Wanderer though.

Sayu with the large inazuma katana. It just looks too goofy and the er feels amazing due to her high er reqs.

1. Sacrificial Bow on Faruzan  2. Umbrella on Kuki  3. Amenoma Kageuchi on Ayato  4. The Flute on Kaeya  5.

Sac Frags on Kokomi
Non-Toxic
Lost Prayers on Scaramouche not for meta, but for S P E E D
Non-Toxic
Bell is perfectly acceptable on Dori. I don’t get why people insist it’s bad for her because she can’t take advantage of the passive when there’s mfs out here using Black Tassel  Them slimes are really quaking in their figurative boots  Also, while the Compound Bow is mid asf for Faruzan, the Windblume Ode uses the same model and has better stats for her. Though it’s now unavailable

lost prayer wanderer and alley flash keqing are pretty strong actually
Non-Toxic
love all of these but think rust fits gorou better

I have PJC and use it on Keqing in base outfit and Haran for Opulent Splendor even tho the passive is not the best on her  Cinnabar spindle looks great on opulent splendor too.

I use the bell on Dori too since it's HP% and looks good on her.  I also use the youkai umbrella sword for Kuki since it somewhat matches her aesthetic
Non-Toxic
Honestly would love a feature similar to an MMORPG I've played, where there's an "Appearance synthesis" feature where you can synthesise two weapons (or armor), in which you can choose the stats of one weapon, and the appearance of the other. Which basically means you can use the appearance of another weapon while retaining the stats of the one you want. It's pretty good to make a character that's not only aesthetically pleasing. But also functional and efficient.

jade cutter on Xingqiu and fading twilight on Sara. while not their first weapon choice, i think they still look the best on them and the stats are still really good for them, so i win either way :]

Yelan with Fav Warbow, 100% fit with her with fur coat  Dehya with Fav Greatsword, gold trimmings, glowing crystal.   Xingchiu with Fav Sword make him look like an aristocratic young master he is.  Basically Fav Weapons with any character that have gold trimmings in their outfit.
Non-Toxic
I use Dehya with The Bell.   She actually really helps me a lot because she prevents me from getting stunned all the time (I am bad at dodging). The Bell gives her extra HP which is also nice. It's just a beautiful weapon. She works quite well with Kokomi, Kazuha and Yae Miko. I can clear the domain for the dendro artifacts in like 40 seconds, which is very fast for me. I just don't do Abyss, because I suck and don't have the time.

Amenoma kageuchi ayato... i'm seriously obsessed about how cool it is
Non-Toxic
This is why we need display Options!!! We should be able to display a different weapon aesthetically then the weapon in current use.  It's not like Hoyo doesn't have a possible insensitive, I'd for one would be much more inclined to pull niche weapons if I could then also utilize the weapons design on characters that wouldn't otherwise appreciate the weapons Stats and Passive.   Perfect example is Kazuha's weapons, we literally got a perfectly designed weapon for him from his story quest, but we can't utilize it well since it doesn't synergize as well with Kazuha as his other options. Kazuha's other options are mostly unappealing aesthetically as well. I should be able to display his weapon aesthetically while utilizing the weapons he's actually good with.
Non-Toxic
Why can’t we have weapon glamour Mihoyo! This would be so fun be able to customize our looks with.

Fischl's Immernschtreich skin with Aqua Simulacra is truly an elite drip combo. Not that it's a bad bow for her by any means, but it looks far better than her technical BIS.  Kazuha with Jade Cutter is also outstanding, it looks so good with his Burst effect.

I want that bow
Non-Toxic
Im using Harran on Ayaka, Blackcliff on Dehya and Rosaria, Dodoco tales on Klee, Viri.Hunt on Collei, Kings Squire on Tighnari and Compount bow on Immernachts Fischl.  But those are not really bad options for then, so I dont know if that counts.

I don't have Dehya, but with her cat-like hair intakes she would be a great combo with Luxurious Sea-Lord.  Not a weapon, but a team comp, I'm not big into checking builds, so I'm not sure how good in reality that team is (personally I really like it). Neollle (healing, mining, mascot of the team), Raiden (for Transcendence: Baleful Omen), Yae Miko (for leaving Yakans on the field), and most importantly Yoimiya, who with all the electro on the field can juggle enemies in the air with her Niwabi Fire-Dance.  edit: now when to think of it, in every game I end up with build that can be summarised as Michael Bay build - EXPLOSIONS!

I mean, the crit rate just means you use crit dmg hat and look for more crit dmg subs than rate subs. Aside from Layla and Diona, you don’t really run cryo with him anyways since you’re most likely going to be running something like Faruzan, Bennett, & Yun Jin/Yelan/Xingqiu/etc. with him.   Don’t forget that the passive effect also gives him straight elemental dmg bonus which if you don’t know, is in the same spot in the dmg formula as all the other dmg bonuses. This isn’t even mentioning that Lost Prayer also buff his burst as well whereas Remembrance is only buffing his normals which granted, has a larger bonus and it allows him to do more normals thanks to the atk spd.    That being said tho, on most rankings(on KQM and the [Genshin helper team spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gNxZ2xab1J6o1TuNVWMeLOZ7TPOqrsf3SshP5DLvKzI/htmlview?pru=AAABd232040*jwqsRrb3U3F-veQDGRtQ6A#)) it is his 2nd best weapon in most cases
Non-Toxic
This take is so bad and uninformed that its almost hilarious. Lost Prayer is best in slot for charged attack Wanderer, which was his best rotation for the last two abysses (3.4 and 3.5)
Non-Toxic
I think you're vastly exaggerating how much of a negative either of those negatives are. It certainly does not "really suck" and it isn't worse than "any other 5☆" when the only 5☆ catalysts that even give crit dmg are Tullaytallah's Remembrance, which I acknowledged was better, and Kagura's Verity, which almost nobody would ever waste the wishes trying to get for Wanderer.  Also the vast majority of players who play Wanderer literally do so for exploration purposes. Movement speed on him is great.
Non-Toxic
My lost prayer wanderer has a ratio of 80 to 220...and i hardly use him with cryo characters
Non-Toxic
This is the worst take I have ever seen in this sub lmao. You can literally swap his circlet for a crit. dmg circlet if he gets too much crit rate to balance the stats out. And besides, you don't HAVE to run cryo with him for the crit boost if you already have enough crit. Just pair him up with a pyro character like bennett and get a large atk boost instead. Also, how the hell is the passive a disaster for him? He literally gets a boosted elemental dmg bonus, which is good for *any* catalyst user. This catalyst weapon is great for CA Wanderer.   Way to be r/confidentlyincorrect.
Non-Toxic
Lol this is hilariously wrong. He is on field so the passive isnt wasted on him. Elem damage buff his q unlike tr, it’s not crap. Other 5* weapon like mod is pretty meh on his hypercarry team and the rest are stat sticks. High crit rate is also hardly negative unless you build him for damage per screenshot.    Exploration wise, movement speed is actually pretty good.
Non-Toxic
no its like his 2nd bis overall and bis in overworld. love to see someone so confidently incorrect. and just use a crit dmg circlet lol
Non-Toxic
•most people farmed emblem and shim for a very long time so there is a high probability that players that give a shit about meta already have good cdmg circlet anyways •the passive is NOT a disaster idk what you are on about, by the time you press e if you wait a bit you can time all the buffs well and start with 1 stack and burst with 3 stacks but maybe that is something you can't do or just don't know •wanderer's best teams are usually paired with faruzan and bennet and with either thoma or zhongli, cryo is mostly irrelevant.  •sure it's not that big of a gap with other weapons and actually competitive with dodoco tales, but you exaggerating that it's only for drip and it sucks is literally the worst take ever.
Non-Toxic
Xiao’s best 4 star weapon is the deathmatch and he also ascends with crit rate.  I used a crit dmg hat and he still has 89.7CR
Non-Toxic
I've used Lost Winds on wanderer and was able to get 75/200 crit so idk what you're on about with the no dmg part
Non-Toxic
I prefer 1000 times to seek crit dmg in substats rolls over crit rate. CR weapon + ascension stat is a win for every player. Also, he's one of the very few catalyst users who can actually make use of LP's passive to certain degree.  And spd mov + wanderer for overworld is peak meta btw.
Non-Toxic
What 5 star weapon other than his signature would be better for him? I and I think most Wanderer mains run him with Bennett, so Skyward and MoD are worse. Kagura's passive does virtually nothing for him. And Thousand Floating Dreams has an EM substat which he doesn't want. So yeah Lost Prayer is easily his second best 5 star weapon most of the time since I'm pretty sure he's usually run with Bennett and not with cryo characters
Non-Toxic
let me tell you why you are wrong with 3 points  1. He's on field and at max at base 100 you will be able to have him glide for 10 seconds so you will be able to hit a 2 stack which is at R1 16% elemental damage along with the movement speed passive which gives wanderer a slight edge in mobility, not major but enough that you can dodge some hits or reposition yourself nicely without dashing 2. more crit rate along with his level up passive means you can spec on crit damage far more while maintaining good damage consistency 3. a thousand floating dreams, kaguya everity, and everlasting moonglow is totally better than the lost prayer.
Non-Toxic
Downvote!!!!!
Non-Toxic
Except many don't (Ayaka, Yoimiya, Nilou, Venti). And some signatures aren't all that great (Zhong leading the pack, but other sigs could definitely be a better jump over other options). On the contrary I'd argue it could convince people that don't like the look of a weapon but want the performance to pull that dont simply for cosmetic reasons. While also convincing people to pull for looks even if they have better options. I for one would pull for Vortex Vanquisher if I could transmog it over a Homa, but I can't, so fuck Vortex.
Non-Toxic
At c0 yea  With higher cons though, you can comfortably run higher base atk bows. Fav bow naturally has a low base atk, so she has lower quality buffs.   Just spam ER artifacts on her. Artifact sets don’t really matter.
Non-Toxic
Same here. Just annoying that i hafta make sure that Shenhe triggers an elemental reaction before switching her out. Really hate that Mistsplitter freakin spooked me
Toxic
Probably Redhorn, her split scaling deflates the value of attack and inflates the value of crit damage on her, plus Bennett is basically mandatory for her which even further devalues other attack buffs.
Non-Toxic
As far as I know it’s the best 4-star for Sara. It also matches her look *perfectly*.

I'm not sure how to navigate that spreadsheet to find what you mentioned, could you please explain more about damage bonuses? Or at least point me where the explanation is in that sheet  Sometimes I have trouble deciding if I want to use a weapon with elemental damage bonus or one with crit damage bonus, is crit damage ultimately the same as NA /CA / elemental damage bonus on weapons or do they fill different spots in the formula
Non-Toxic
in other words, its literally as meta as one can get LOL
Non-Toxic
you also wind up playing double anemo with wanderer because furuzan is a really strong support for anemo. so for exploration that's 20% movement speed, and if you wanna be funny slap dehya and rosaria for a global 30% movement speed buff on overworld.  the definition of fast as fuck.
Toxic
Did you just say that *Everlasting Moonglow*, the goddamn Donut, is better for Wanderer than Lost Prayer?  What are you smoking bro
Toxic
The part of her buffs that scale with base attack is her A4, only at 32% rate, and it's a flat damage buff. The difference between Fav and a 674 bow is a whopping +62 damage. It also has a rate limit of 0.8 sec. so it doesn't even work in AoE. You're talking about literally like a 2-300 damage per crit buff when the characters she supports are doing 5 digit damage normal/plunge attacks.  Unless you're gonna put in the effort and investment to run her with a full on DPS build, Fav is better than any 5 star on her except Elegy, and it's really, really not worth all that investment when you could just run her with 4p TotM for more team damage instead.
Non-Toxic
Their 'arguments' against it were -   1 - Wanderer doesn't need the crit rate because he ascends into it, so if you use this you won't have any crit damage  2 - The passive is no good for Wanderer
Non-Toxic

1. Kazuha is pretty much always going to be better in Freeze. Sucrose's baseline kit buffs are EM-oriented, which is useless for Freeze.     2. Sucrose's baseline buffs tend to be slightly weaker than Kazuha at a similar amount of investment and she has less personal damage. however, she's a Catalyst, which means she can hold TTDS and Hakushin Ring. her baseline buffs + either of those weapons can let buffing be equal to, or pull ahead of Kazuha in teams like Xingqiu National and Aggravate (the latter typically in Single Target, as Kazuha's personal damage in multi-target is more significant. personally I still really enjoy SacFrags, though).   a notable niche over Kazuha is being able to perform Guoba Swirls with Xiangling. Guoba Swirling means using your E right before Guoba attacks (when you see "!" pop up over his head), as he is self infusing with Pyro. this allows you to swirl Pyro off Guoba and onto the enemy, giving easy double VV setups on XL teams. this makes her irreplaceable in something like Sukomomon.  being an Anemo Catalyst means very reliable and frequent Anemo application, making her an excellent Taser drive. she causes a high amount of Electro-Charged alongside XQ and Beidou procs. in a similar vein, Sucrose is highly preferred over Kazuha in Anemo Hyperbloom teams. Anemo Hyperbloom teams Swirl Electro off enemies and onto nearby Bloom seeds, thereby causing Hyperbloom. this allows your Electro unit to build normally, focusing around their personal damage, and using your units that are already stacking EM for HB. a fairly accessible and common example of this is Xingqiu / Fischl / Dendro MC / Sucrose. Kazuha can't really slot in as well as Sucrose here, as he's not proccing many Hyperblooms or driving XQ as well.  Kazuha will typically be better than Sucrose in situations where one of these happens:  - his personal is significant despite similar buffing (ie Quicken teams in multi-target) - his better grouping is more useful (this coincides with significant personal usually) - Sucrose EM buffs aren't useful (Freeze, mono Element teams like mono Pyro or mono Cryo) - International and teams like International that have about equal damage distribution between multiple characters (TTDS can't buff both XL and Childe at once, Kazuha's buffing pulls ahead)  there can be more nuance, as Genshin team building and damage optimization tends to have, however I think these basics cover large enough ground. TL;DR in most situations they're likely to be about as good as each other outside of those teams that don't care about EM, but either will pull ahead depending on the rest of the team and the Chamber the team is being used in.
Non-Toxic
Kazuha has better movesets imo. Sucrose takes some learning curve. I have her c6 and him c0 and have tried using her in lower abyss floors as a backup kazuha in my other team and she just feels wrong/doesn’t pull in the enemies as well
Non-Toxic
I've been enjoying Sucrose for Raiden aggravate. She groups in front of her which is perfect for landing Sara and Raiden bursts.   I think that's one understated form of synergy: how characters' skills are targeted/positioned should line up.
Non-Toxic
In freeze or monoelement team, kazuha definitely is better than sucrose since he gives damage bonus. There is no competition.  In amplifying reaction teams such as childe international and melt ganyu, things become slightly complicated. Theoretically, sucrose can outdo kazuha damage wise due to her em buff and ttds, especially when you don't double swirl. But practically speaking (from someone who had to stick with sucrose for one whole year because kazuha rerun took forever), kazuha's cc is a whole lot reliable than sucrose, especially for characters like childe where his damage increases quadratically when you hit multiple enemies. Sucrose's cc is burst reliant, and very clunky. Also it's way easier to infuse kazuha's burst with the element we want as compared to sucrose. Double swirling is also a lot easier with kazuha, especially if you are on mobile with high ping. Also kazuha obviously have higher ceiling with his c2, completely outperforming sucrose by then.   In taser comps, sucrose takes the cake for being able to reduce vv res continuously on field, doesn't miss her attacks, and constant em buff for the whole team (which is huge because of how ec works and we don't know who exactly triggers the reaction), allowing all characters in the team to be built with other offensive stats.
Non-Toxic
1) in a freeze team: Never. EM doesn't affect freeze, and kazuhas damage% is super invaluable. Kazuha also has better grouping and more reliable element application in his ult if you care about that.  2) in general: I'll split it into 3 cases:  a) Not every hit is a reaction (e.g. raiden hypercarry, hu tao hydro, etc.) Kazuha wins out because the em buff doesn't affect every hit while the damage% buff does.   b) Reaction team where every hit reacts (e.g. standard national) They are about the same, sometimes sucrose wins out, but usually kazuhas grouping makes him more valuable. Sucrose probably wins against single targets though (depends on specific weapons / artifacts)  c) Dendro team (e.g. haitham + miko) Sucrose wins since dendro can't be swirled but the em buff affects the entire team
Non-Toxic
Kazuha buffs elemental damage, and Sucrose buffs Elemental Mastery. If you're doing a reaction team, where Elemental Mastery matters and elemental damage does not, then Sucrose might be more useful.  All else being equal, the five-star is probably going to out-perform the four-star within the same niche.
Non-Toxic
In Excel Impact they can be about the same in certain teams, one better than the other in specific cases.  &#x200B;  In practice, Kazuha feels way better than Sucrose since his kit is more straightforward and optimized which makes him the go-to option for Anemo support in general. The other team can be a Dendro team that doesn't run Anemo, a Venti Impact situation or it has Zhong Li which has his rainbow-shred or something like that.  &#x200B;  It's possible for Sucrose to be more valuable in certain account situations or preferences.
Non-Toxic
She is not better than Kazuha but she is a sidegrade to a non C2 Kazuha on teams who utilise EM based reactions  Now that dendro and EM sharing are more popular, her value diminishes overall  Honestly it all comes down to her being clunky to play and Kazuha being more fun with his E
Non-Toxic
Sucrose has certain benefits over Kazuha, such as she is catalyst users, so she can also use ttds, pamber, which further increase her utility, on top she give EM buff, which can be more important than kazuha dmg bonus. But the biggest problem is her move set, she simply way fragile, because kazuha can evade enemy attack during his E, while she can be interrupted during her E, on top her CC is simply worse, and dmg bonus is technically easier to use than EM buff.
Non-Toxic
It’s a hard pill to swallow for a lot of people in this sub, especially those who do not care about TC. No, he is not always better than sucrose lol. Sometimes, he is just flat out worse.  There are cases where he is strictly better mainly in mono team and freeze team.  In some other scenarios, the results end up pretty similar if you learn how to play sucrose.  In the rest, sucrose with ttds is just flat out better such as taser team, national with sucrose driver, or any team that want to do guoba swirl.  Someone say that kazuha feel better to play which is true for most casual players. However, there are times when using kazuha will just lead to death in the abyss because he forces you to get really close to mobs or burn yourself.  Also, sucrose can carry prototype amber so she could be played as a healer in a lot of newbie id that want to 36 stars without building up real healer.  She is one of the busted 1.0 characters for good reasons lol. Unfortunately, not all players build her and so those would say that kazuha is always better. It’s just they dont wanna upgrade or learn how to play her.  If you wanna learn more about kazuha vs sucrose vs venti comparison from TC’s point of view, zajef has a nice section of his video about that.
Non-Toxic
Kazuha is fast,  sucrose is slower,  what they do is the same,  but speed is important for a support/utility unit.  Also he does more damage
Non-Toxic
In Freeze it's obviously Kazuha, no clue who'd ever tell you something else.   For reaction heavy comps Sucrose C6 is usually the better choice.   With access to weapons like Hakushin and TTDS she easily matches his Buffs.      Although Kazu pulls enemys closer together, meaning comps with limited AoE like HuTao are probably still better of with him.
Non-Toxic
in a freeze team she is not better.  In a vape team she can give around 150+ EM if built for EM, and this will would boost HT's damage more than kazuha swirling hydro would. Or she can use TTDS. If Kazuha is able to swirl pyro, he would be better than sucrose in the same team. But that requires double pyro.   In a taser team, she is more useful because her NAs will swirl EC. She can also use Proto amber to heal, or TTDS.
Non-Toxic
Without cons they have different role. Sucrose buffs team's EM and Kazuha buffs elemental damage. C6 Sucrose can also buff elemental damage, but only for the element her burst absorbs and only for the duration of it. C2 Kazuha can give +200 EM but only to the active character. So C2 Kazuha will be a lot better, but if he's C1 or C0, then Sucrose can be better
Non-Toxic
Simple way to explain is both are good at buff, Kazuha is better because of short cool down time.
Non-Toxic
Yes
Non-Toxic
Damn this is very well put, very informative!  Personally I'm a Sucrose haver (Kazuha wanter), I'm an Ayaka main so I use Sucrose in Freeze and I just find Kazuha would be so much better with his easier grouping than Sucrose.   I don't use EM teams like Taser, or at least yet, so I don't have to worry about that, good to know, thank you :)
Non-Toxic
As for your international statement I just wanted to add that many casual players dont care about the double swirl and in That cases sucrose pulls ahead again
Non-Toxic
Yeah that's EXACTLY how I feel. I have Sucrose, (will be getting Kazuha) and I'm getting very annoyed at her grouping, sometimes not being the way I want her to group. Whereas Kazuha can group extremely well with just his E!
Non-Toxic
Very very nicely put.  I, too am in a similar situation, I've been using Sucrose since started playing and Kazuha hasn't re ran for me yet. Watching videos of Kazuha and how much easier his kit is and less "clunky" makes me really dislike Sucrose and her weaknesses; excluding her usage in Taser comps which I don't use.
Non-Toxic

Having kazuha makes you very spoiled imo. I rely on him a lot for my team compositions. It pretty much becomes kazuha +3 others. Granted now I’ve maxed alhaithum and I’m working on triple crowning him and maxing out his weapon, but kazuha is still probably the first name on my teamsheet

Uhhh. I'd wait for the download to finish and see if that sorts things out.   Is the Genshin server you play on the same as the region of your PSN account? The Genshin server your PS5 connects to is based on the region of your PSN account and can't be changed, so those need to match or else it starts a save on a different server. In that case, you would have to contact hoyoverse to unlink and then create a new PSN account in the correct region to link to.
Non-Toxic
Something seems to have gone wrong if you're getting the starting cutscene.  There's several possibilities: You linked your Hoyo account properly but your PSN region does not match the server you started on. Check your UID on the PS5 to know which server it's connected to and see if it matches the server with your existing data (first digit will be 6=America, 7=Europa/Africa, 8=Asia/Australia, 9=Taiwan/Hong Kong). You can have different game data on different servers, each server it considered its own separate account even if you're using the same login data. So if your Playstation is connecting to a different server than you played on before, it's setting up a new account for you on that server giving you the opening cutscene.  If it's connecting to the wrong server, you'll have to contact CS to unlink your PSN account and set up a different PSN account for a region that matches your server. You cannot switch servers on Playstation, it's always determined by the region you set it to when creating the PSN account.  If it's connecting to the right server, something went wrong with the linking process and you didn't actually link your existing data to your PSN account. It'll start a new game then a play the opening cutscene. The UID displayed will be different from the one you played on before because it's a different account.  You'll again have to contact CS to unlink your PSN. It has to be unlinked first since that's the only way for the linking pop up to show up again where you can input your Hoyo account data to link it up properly. It's crucial to NOT accidentally skip this pop up since you only get this one chance at linking otherwise it starts a new account for you.  It's a finicky process, good luck!

AFAIK any payment information is usually retained and very difficult to scrub (this is not unique to GI).  Might be a better idea to just buy the blessing from [Codashop](https://www.codashop.com/en-us/genshin-impact) (just be very careful about specifying the server and UID, double check before proceeding) which [Hoyoverse is OK with](https://www.hoyolab.com/article/173911/).

When I buy welkin for my kid, I login to their account on my phone and buy it from there. That way there's no payment saved on their device.

If all you care about is welkin then going thru razer wallet is also an option.  It can be loaded with gift cards so your credit card/bank data is never directly attached.  You can even get the razer gift codes off amazon if local stores don't carry them.

Don't you have to explicitly mark a checkbox for the cc info to be saved?

You have a Daughter, May I suggest a far better option than coda shop that's more flexible for online payments? I suggest using a virtual card generator like [Privacy.com](https://Privacy.com) , it allows you to generate a one-time use virtual card for situations like this where you don't want payment info stored or easily accessible by a child or anyone. you can also set spending limits and generate monthly allowance cards, it's something I suggest anyone with children use because you don't have to use your real card info and can easily control and prevent child spending.
Non-Toxic
Interesting. May have to try that

That may be a choice! I was thinking maybe a prepaid gift card or something should work just fine too.

This game can feel frustrating at times, But you don't need a 5 star to clear anything.   Where are you stuck?  Some common tips to clear content: Focus on a main dps Make sure to level the weapon of your main dps, as high as you can Level their talents as high as you xan Learn your elemental reactions as they can greatly increase your damage

Some of the best teams are composed of 4☆.

There is nothing in the game that requires you to have a five star character. It's just this early in the game you don't know what you're doing. Look up guides on YouTube if you want to not remain stuck
Non-Toxic
There’s a quest that hits newer players harder! But otherwise it’s just knowledge that you lacks, this game can be completed without even wishing.

From what I’ve seen you need way more ER otherwise solid build(you also need EM depending on the team)
Non-Toxic
Depends on team, don't know what set either. ER looks low and I'd personally want abit more crit rate, must be lacking with a rate weapon.  8/10
Non-Toxic
if you want to burst on cd you'll need around 15% more ER  could use a bit more crit rate too imo, but very nice build

Ayato was my first 5star. I've lived used and worked with ayato and didn't get another 5 star until itto got a rerun. I've used shim, hod and even glad on ayato. I've seen bigger numbers with shim ayato without using the burst than with hod ayato with good er to burst every cycle.
Non-Toxic
Get nahida in the next patch. She was a game changer for me. Kuki just needs em. You can even mix and match sets to get good em.

Well atleast you know what to improve. Atleast try and get rate upto 70 and even with like 2 fav holders and double hydro, ER pretty low.

I mean Mihoyo themselves already have said that they **Took Heavy Inspiration** from BoTW when developing the game, meaning some things from one game are bound to be copied to another.  Not sure what you're getting riled up for considering that every game, doesn't matter if they're made in China, US or even Japan takes inspiration or copies some things from one or more games.
Non-Toxic
>they didn’t copy a singular thing  Bro, you can argue they changed it up enough to not matter without saying something as objectively untrue as “they didn’t copy a singular thing.”  MiHoYo themselves admitted to using ideas from BoTW. Thats not a BAD THING if they improve upon it or change it up enough, which they have.
Non-Toxic
2020 already passed bro.

It doesn't really matter, just enjoy the game. I think Minecraft is absolutely dog water, yet it remains an incredibly popular game. Let people have their opinions and don't bother with them. Most of the time they just want a reaction

You could just not....and move on with your life.

Who cares if others think that, just enjoy the game bro lmao
Non-Toxic
Botw or Loz in general didn't invent those things (open world, goblin enemy tribes, collectables, forest/plant spirits, flying/gliding), but it's definitely part of the inspired for Genshin, like about 100 other games. That's Genshin's identity, an Amalgamation of casual games in an open world RPG
Non-Toxic
I am going to argue every single game in existences copy from Doom 1993
Non-Toxic
There is a difference between "copying" and "inspired by"
Non-Toxic
Tbh any game as open world as BOTW, intentional or not you could say were inspired, not so "copied".  There have been overworld games before BOTW of course, but BOTW brought it to a new level, executed very well. Nothing wrong with games taking inspiration from it.
Non-Toxic
Why defend it? Their slogan is "tech otakus rule the world" and their entire schtick is to pay homage to anime and game tropes.  A lot of stuff in Honkai are references to Jojo and Evangelion. The latest valkyrie Herrscher of Origin's ultimate is just the blade mode from Metal Gear Revengeance. Their latest animation has in-universe movies posters that reference Elden Ring.  A lot of stuff in Genshin are references to Breath of the Wild. The very intro sequence where the traveler and Paimon walk up the cliff with Mondstadt in view followed by the title fade-in is an homage to the intro of BotW. The climb-anything mechanic was probably inspired by BotW as well. Cooking interface is just a simplified version of BotW cooking UI.
Non-Toxic
Imitation is the most sinscest form of flattery
Non-Toxic
They got inspiration from Botw and thank god they did because that's one of the reasons some people were attracted to the game. I remember the "this game looks like botw let's give it a try" I told myself back then, lol.
Non-Toxic
Uhh every game uses some sort of inspiration or good systems from games in the past and that’s totally ok.  Botw did that as well. It was not the first of all those things lol.  If something is good, adapt it to your game. That’s the recipe for success.
Non-Toxic
People can be stupid
Toxic
You should tell them that BoTW is copy-paste of Assassins Creed, Elder Scrolls, Snake Eater, Phantom Pain, Tales series, Atelier series, Bayonetta and so on.   Even the new Tears of the Kingdom’s demo reminds me of Craftopia.
Non-Toxic
Imo u can just go "so what?" Do u play genshin? Ofc not , if u did u won't be able to spew these BS ... Learn to know about things u tend to criticize.  Also even if they did copy what can u do , not that u can stop me from playing or stop them from making... Stop harassing ppl just cuz ur too self aware to play a simple videogame...  This msg is not directed to you , respected OP ... I am furious too , I hope this helps if more idiots pisses u off with there nonsense bs.
Toxic
For a supposedly copy-cat game, Genshin did very well for itself. I wouldn't worry much about it. Also someone already said that the devs themselves took heavy inspiration from BotW. I could see that inspiration from the design of Mondstadt and some part of Liyue, but after those 2 regions everything about Genshin felt original, at least to me.
Non-Toxic
maybe stop trying to get blood from a stone.
Non-Toxic
Don’t defend it. Anyone who still says that they copied rather than took inspiration (because they did take inspiration, but didn’t copy everything) never actually plays the game for long if at all and they want to believe what they want to. You’re wasting your energy on people who never wanted to change their minds in the first place.   There’s no point in upsetting yourself for a fight that can’t be “won”. Just play the game, enjoy it, and ignore them. Genshin will still exist even if you don’t defend it.
Non-Toxic
I love how the BotW sequel means this discourse has sprung up again, now with a side order of uno-reverse "TotK stole stuff from Genshin".  My go-to defense has been "Yeah, it's been nice to have a new open world to explore while waiting for the sequel!"
Non-Toxic
They're just mad that Genshin is successful and BotW is stuck with weapon durability and sliding down a climbable wall when it's raining.  Can't blame them. Equipment durability is one of the worst systems in any game that isn't supposed to be "survival" and made me put down and refund the game pretty much immediately.
Non-Toxic
Someone told me they thought it looked the same just because the grass was similar in both games, I’m still confused.

Non-Toxic
Where is your source that support your claim of your statement?
Non-Toxic
Are you saying that as long as you explicitly declared that you took inspiration from the game then you are free to copy literally everything to that game as a justification?   Man, each country has their own copyright laws so you do not know one day someone will sue you then you have to pay with huge amount of money
Non-Toxic
Because so many people are positive genshin copied botw when the two games couldn’t be any more different!

They also copied a lot from Devil May Cry. Some move sets are straight up 1:1. So what?
Non-Toxic
Without Castle Wolfenstein, there wouldn't be a Doom or Duke Nukem  Without Virtua Fighter, there Wouldn't be a Tekken or Dead or Alive  Without Street Fighter, there wouldn't be King of Fighters  Without Resident Evil there wouldn't be Silent Hill  Without RE4, there wouldn't be a Dead Space  Without Daytona there wouldn't be Ridge Racer or Need for Speed  And I could list all of the games that either took inspiration or copied from one another.  You sound as if people haven't been copying or taking inspirations off each other since the dawn of time.  I will repeat, **WHENEVER THERE'S INNOVATION, PEOPLE WILL FOLLOW**.  Edit: heck, I would even go far as to say that without Dungeon & Dragons the Board Game, there wouldn't be any Turn Based RPG Video Games.
Non-Toxic
As long as you are chinese, you are
Non-Toxic
>Because so many people are positive genshin copied botw when the two games couldn’t be any more different!  It's really not worth crying over spilled milk because like I said, people take inspiration from one game that is bound to be copied to another.  Like they always say: whenever there's Innovations, People Will Follow
Non-Toxic
And where were you when Immortals Fenyx Rising came out?
Non-Toxic
I'm not sure if your question is serious but it's an open world game with stamina, gliding, fighting very large and difficult enemies with patterns and weak spots you have to climb to find, while using weapons like a bow and sword, listening to an atmospheric soundtrack, riding a horse, solving puzzles, picking fruits and collecting lizards... That came out in 2005.

Yeah to me it's a gaming classic but I wasn't sure if it's old enough for people not to know it! In that case you're free to borrow it when people are being annoying about Genshin, haha. The devs of both the Zelda series and SotC studio have said in interviews they're fans of each other and love getting inspiration gameplay wise from the other teams.  So yeah my personal opinion is it's silly to have this argument at all but if you want an example just to shut annoying "but it's a copy it's not original!" people up, it's worth looking it up (and it's imo one of the most beautiful games ever).

Especially knowing you can switch out during her burst with no consequences. Definitely a good thing about her kit too. When I got her c6 I slapped redhorn on her I think her shield busted out 50-65k damage at one point. It was definitely beautiful.   I might use her for my commissions again.
Non-Toxic
She’s cracked if you build her right

As a Heizou main; Im very happy he is a 4 star tbh. His C6 is busted and would have been impossible to get for me if he was a 5 star. He is a 10 star in my heart tho, as he is best boi. And holy molly he hits harder than my 5 stars.

> She was slated to be a 5* but they downgraded her because they couldn’t be bothered to smooth out her auto attack pattern.  Why do people keep spreading the same missinformation all over  She never had the 5* title. People assumed she should be a 5 star purely because of the travails video having Diluc and Ayaka as 5 stars, yet she never was  If anything, Barbara would have been more of a 5* than Ningguang would ever be, and that is due to her Burst animation

they should really fix that bugs me so much

i mean so does yelan without xingqiu or 220 er
Non-Toxic
Barbara was originally going to be the Standard 5* Hydro Catalyst, till they swapped her with Mona after realizing players needed a solid healer option early in the game. They left Barbara’s burst animation as is.  All the evidence points to Ning being lined up as a 5*. The complete lack of a Standard Geo, her having a tailor made 5* weapon (Memory of Dust was clearly tailored for her. All the other Geo themed weapons follow the exact same pattern of ATK substat and extra ATK stacks that double with shield, and yet every other Geo character either scales with HP or DEF. Ning is the only Geo that benefits 100% off ATK.) She is the leader of the Qixing with two 5* subordinates, and was the featured character of the Liyue plot. Diluc, Ayaka, Cyno were all 5*, every Harbinger has been a 5* and Dain being 5* is practically guaranteed.   But hey, I’ll put the caveat that she was “likely” slated to be a 5*. Savvy?
Non-Toxic
I’ve learned to work with it by either holding backwards or forwards, it cancels some of the end lag by trying to reposition her. Annoying but effective once you get used to it.
Non-Toxic
Sub but she buffs electro crit dmg which means she's great for raiden and yae miko
Non-Toxic
By himself, he does 10k charged shots, 23k tap e's, and 3k ticks on his burst. With Faruzan, it goes up to 18k charged shots, 43k tap e's, and 6k burst ticks. With a full team of buffs, it's 33k charged shots, 78k tap e, and 10k burst ticks. I'm proud of him and his busted supports!
Non-Toxic
there's something incredibly satisfying about playing noelle with a debate club and send things flying while she says cleaning things being all polite. sometimes i dust her off just for that and giggle as she does her thing
Non-Toxic
Every character that has a high ER cost needs high ER. Surprising.  Sarcasm aside, I really would like to know where this misconception about Yelan needing Xingqiu (a character that has a higher ER cost than her) for her ER comes from.  Just use Favonius and it's done. There is no need at all for 220% or Hydro batteries.
Non-Toxic
Difference is, Yelan can fill up her burst gauge near max with her E with that much er. My fav yelan with 200 er almost always fills her gauge back to full with one E. Try doing the same with Xiangling, her guoba generates particles too slowly. She always needs a battery and still needs 200 ER minimum with Bennet and no fav weapons. Yelan with Xingqiu could probably run 160 ER
Non-Toxic
how much does she buff at C6
Non-Toxic
That's not bad, I guess. Why are you using Venti for Charged shots, though? Ganyu has better damage , and can use Venti as a support
Non-Toxic
That's not as satisfying as using Redhorn to send things flying, hitting for 50-60k dmg, and healing for 1000 HP per swing. Now that's satisfying.
Non-Toxic
A lot. 7 Star Jades hit like a truck.

Counterpoint: I love Venti and like seeing him do big anemo numbers. Anyway thanks lol

Swap Xingqiu for Jean. You can do sunfire technique to guarantee melts. Bennett helps Chongyun triple melt and his attack buff will help Shenhe's quills when she is onfield.  https://imgur.com/a/kpnOebs  This is my highly invested team, so the numbers will be much lower.

If you want to use her in the overworld then anything works.   Personally I would use barbara for heals due to her heals not being a ult or circle. Or diona because she also has a shield.

I woud say Chongyun so she can get cryo infusion
Non-Toxic
Hmmm. Well it's not a bad idea since Xinqiu and Shenhe (plus chongyun) will be frozen the rest of the enemys. Thanks!

Wow that looks incredible!!. I really want to try out. Can you tell me how did you build them?

I understand diona, but why bárbara. Since her elemental aply hydro on herself won't be a bad idea since i'm using a  cryo team?. But i may change bennet for diona. But that will have to wait since i dint build her yet. Anyway thanks for your help
Non-Toxic
Jean: 4PC VV. She has a Favonius sword to help team energy. If you ever get Kazuha, he helps group enemies much better since its very circle impacty, but the pyro from his burst is much slower. She's on an EM/EM/EM build for higher pyro swirl damage, but anything works really.  Bennett: 4PC Instructor's (EM buff for higher melts for Chong and Shenhe). Alternatively, you can use 4PC Noblesse. Any high base attack sword works. ER/HP/Healing Bonus because I prefer healer Bennett.   Chongyun: 4PC Noblesse. If Bennett has Noblesse and you don't care about Chongyun, just slap the instructors and give him a sac greatsword. Mine is built for damage though. Any offensive claymore works well here. Sac GS has the advantage of starting rotations with his skill so his C2 can lower the team's cooldowns (great for Shenhe + Jean). EM/Cryo/Crit.  Shenhe: I have her on a 2pc + 2pc Gladiator + Wanderer for this (pumping all her damage into her melts). Glad + Blizzard is a better generalist build though. Atk/Cryo/Crit. Likewise with Chongyun, any offensive spear works here. I just have her signature weapon to help push Chongyun's damage.
Non-Toxic
She does self-apply hydro but cyro characters don't self-apply cyro, so it would only be a problem when facing enemy who does cyro attck.

Okay, im gonna give it a try. Thanks!

Judging by your reddit history, you have had stutter problems on the following (but not limited to) games:  * Genshin Impact * Elden Ring * No Man's Sky * Skyrim * Atomic Heart * Dead Space * Elder Scrolls * Nioh * Resident Evil Village * Back 4 Blood * Warframe * Saints Row * Cyberpunk * Ghost of Tsushima * The Callisto Proticol * Borderlands 3 * Sea of Theaves  At this point my friend I think you may have internet speed issues or your PS5 has a glitch. Have you by any chance taken your PS5 to a friend's house to play on their internet connection? Have you had a chance to play any of the above games on someone else's PS5 to see if it's the same to you on their device?  If the above is not something that you can do, you can also try running your PS5 in performance mode or setting your graphics settings in games lower to see if that helps. I believe some games also allow you to set a frame rate and you could do some testing trying out which frame rate runs the best for you on your connection/console. :)  Hopefully you'll get it solved and you can enjoy playing your games from now on! You've got a good selection going! :)
Non-Toxic
Holy crap op. It’s been explicitly made clear it’s a you problem. Especially when it’s clearly happening in other games too.
Toxic
You've asked this same question on a dozen other games within the last few months. Pretty sure it's just your ps5 having these stutter and frame rate issues.
Non-Toxic
My PS5 has no stutter in Genshin
Non-Toxic
Gotta go with everyone else here and say that I don't have stuttering problems on PS5.
Non-Toxic
That's an issue with your device. I've never had stutter on PS5.
Non-Toxic
It's super smooth whenever I play sometimes it loads 3 fast tho and the textures will pop after it loads up
Non-Toxic
There's never been stutter issues with the game on ps5
Non-Toxic
Might be a ping issue, or a bad spot on your SSD.  Been playing on PS5 for over a year and a half, and I've never had it stutter once.  That includes when it was just the PS4 version being upscaled.  See if there's still the same issue on your side.  If there is, and you're not playing with a ton of ping, then maybe consider getting an additional SSD and moving some of your games over.
Non-Toxic
Im not sure when was the time you lasted played Genshin on the PS5, but ever since the native PS5 app came out for Genshin, performance got a lot better with later patches and today its generally in a really good place with a mostly solid 60fps, but with some drops and stutters here and there.  Im really sensitive to frame rate and frame times, so i always notice the drops, but generally i would say that the experience is very good in single player and these drops happen rarely and they are not that super noticeable. Coop mode on the other hand is worse and many more stutters can happen there, but some of those stutters are related to connection issues rather than the hardware.
Non-Toxic
ive been wondering, are you all playing the upgraded ps4 version and calling it the ps5 version?
Non-Toxic
No

This is a you problem

its not happenimg in all games, ive looked up vids and the the games ive posted ARE having issues. so either avoid my posts or give a nice answer

They discontinued support for the PS4 version on PS5 back in like November or December 2021, so it's not possible to play the PS4 version on your PS5.

Yes. You can only play the PS5 version on PS5. The PS4 version is only playable on PS4. Here's a copy of the mail they sent out before support was discontinued: https://forum.psnprofiles.com/topic/116071-the-future-of-the-ps4-version-on-the-ps5/

ive been atracked before on another dite by a real piece if work who posted a pic of my post history to the public
Non-Toxic
Ayato is well built. No complaints there.  Bennett is interesting, Sac Sword isn’t bad but Bennett’s ATK bonus from burst is dependant on his Base ATK (Character base attack + Weapon base attack) and Sac Sword has the lowest 4* base attack (454 at level 90). I’d recommend Sapwood Blade (Craftable, ER substat, 565 base attack level 90)  Artifacts are focused on healing but the optimal move with Bennett is 4 piece Noblesse Oblige with as much ER as you can get. 4 Noblesse gives an attack bonus on top of Bennett’s burst attack bonus, and having around 200% ER means you can spam it as soon as the cooldown is over.  Xiangling is easy, go to Inazuma and buy The Catch from the fisherwoman there, you can get it up to R5, then farm the Emblem of Severed Fate set. 4 Emblem with 200% ER and as much Crit Rate/Crit Damage makes Xiangling a beast, especially on a team with Ayato for easy Vaporizes.  Ayaka with HoD and 4 Blizz is good, but try to stack attack and I do not recommend using her in a team with Ayato/Xiangling. I would suggest making an entire second team focused around Ayaka, with some good support characters like Xingqiu to help Ayaka get the extra Crit Rate from 4 Blizz against Frozen enemies.
Non-Toxic
Is ur ayato burst support 4 ayaka? Trading out diona 4 cing Ling might b a good choice
Non-Toxic
https://keqingmains.com/  Definitely focus on bennett burst and XL burst for talents though, prioritise that over their other talents until 9.
Non-Toxic
I’ve used ayato as a main dps. bennett as a healer bc i take waaaaay too much damage. xiangling for the atk bonus with bennett. and finally ayaka for freeze and sub dps. if i do change my setup for better freeze instead of vape/ freeze, would diona be better bc of the extra freeze crit rate or someone like xingqiu how you mentioned? I could also use my barbara bc i have her c3 so when her skill is used, i do 20% extra hydro dmg.
Non-Toxic
no my ayato is main dps and i’ll consider ayaka freeze/sub dps. i just got ayaka a week ago and i’ve mained ayato for a few months now
Non-Toxic
Break a mirror or walk under a ladder, then pull on the Event Banner. Ez.
Non-Toxic
No, 90 wishes are merely a really low percentage chance to get Qiqi.  Source: the chance for Mona is the same and I have had no success in 2.5 years and well over a thousand wishes.
Non-Toxic
I haven’t gotten qiqi yet after a year so I’d say no it’s not “enough” in terms of a guarantee but it’s also always possible
Non-Toxic
I'd say you've got about an 11% chance to get at least one Qiqi in 90 wishes.  Though it depends on the previous ~180 wishes as well. If you've gotten zero 5* weapons, then your odds are really low for Qiqi, like less than 1%. If you've gotten no characters, your odds are roughly doubled.  This is including Tighnari in the pool, but not Dehya. Would be about 10% with Dehya, 13% without either, rather than 11%.
Non-Toxic
Good idea, I should've just tried this pro strat.
Non-Toxic
I didn't have much expectation when doing this but yeah, also took me a long time to get Mona. I actually ended up finally getting a Qiqi constellation after doing 3 or 4 10-wish pulls more (I don't remember how long ago that was heh).     Good luck on your pulls, though! Hope you get Mona soon.
Non-Toxic
i got 15 accounts (dont ask) mona is on 3, qiqi is on 5. diluc creeped on one, sadly...
Non-Toxic
I had a vague idea of pity and how the percentages work while saving up wishes, but after doing this I looked it up and your math makes sense (I didn't double check the math but this is pretty much what I'd expect now knowing how the system works).
Non-Toxic
I don't know how many pulls each of those accounts has done so that's basically useless information, but do mind that 12 of them are missing Mona and 10 of them are missing Qiqi.  Standard characters are the least obtainable characters in the game, because for any limited all you need is patience to be presented with a guaranteed opportunity.
Non-Toxic
It is a bit complicated. There's a 0.6% base rate per pull, but this increases between 74 and 90 pity, so I used the average 1.6% rate (including guarantee).  This is equally split between characters and weapons, so 0.8% each. It is *not* split 16 ways, like some people think. The odds of getting WGS or PJWS in particular have not changed since launch, since no new weapons were added to Standard. So that's 0.08% per pull for each weapon, and 0.16% for each character pre-Tighnari. Tighnari and Dehya reduce the odds to pull Qiqi and other characters to 0.13~% and 0.11% respectively.  Then I did a binomial distribution for 90 pulls at that rate per pull. There are more accurate ways to simulate the wish system, but this should suffice for a rough idea.
Non-Toxic
There's 5 AR10's, and 10AR25's.  0 money invested on them, about 120 pulls (free wishes over time) on each, all pulls done on char banners, they were all results of lost 50's AFTER getting the banner char or from the begginer's banner.
Non-Toxic
And the majority of them are missing Mona. The majority of them are missing Qiqi. Odds are the majority of them are missing other standard characters too.  If you want a specific standard character and don't reroll for it when starting GI, you're facing odds that are pretty bad. Under 10% each time you hit a 5-star, which only happens every 1-2 months. An over 90% fail rate and less than 10 opportunities per year without spending.  A path feature similar to weapon banners for standard can't come soon enough. I'm not holding my breath though.
Non-Toxic
id love that honestly...i dont play the accounts that lack tighnari (2 of them) because just thinking about doing sumeru without him is ugh...
Non-Toxic

Non-Toxic
I have a guarantee for Baizhu. Seeing his abilities I think he will be huge for my Cyno - his constant Dendro app even if it's just single target combined with healing and stagger res is imo what Cyno needs. Plus not being bound by circle impact.
Non-Toxic
Kazuha  after skipping his banner 2 two times  it's time to find why everybody praise him
Non-Toxic
I don't know. Probably somebody new who piques my fancy. Nobody currently on the known roster because I either already have them or I'm not really interested in them.
Non-Toxic
I wanted c2 Nahida but i need Baizhu more fore cyno or for the future to sub zhongli that requires dendro applicator
Non-Toxic
Wanderer or Childe. Whoever comes first. Afterwards it's focalors time!
Non-Toxic
C2 Nahida
Non-Toxic
Someone who will actually matter, three years down the line. Someone who isn't just an interchangeable DPS-of-the-week. I already have Shenhe, Nahida, and Kokomi. There's not much else going on in the five-star space, lately.  It might end up being Baizhu. If not him, then it will probably end up being Focalors.
Non-Toxic
Nilou 🦅
Non-Toxic
Nahida. Baizhu.
Non-Toxic
I just get all the new characters when I can, and I will also be going for Nilou/Kokomi since I have them on my alt and love them.  The alt is always there to grab units that I miss but both accounts have over 30k primos saved up atm so I can get pretty much anyone I want.  I don't chase cons as a low spender, so maybe if the stash got really big, I'd go for a good well-rounded weapon that can be used on lots of characters.
Non-Toxic
A new character that I like or La Signora, whatever happens first. Not actually at guaranteed, but sitting on 650 wishes should suffice regardless.
Non-Toxic
I just lost a 50/50 for QiQi and now I am waiting for a character I want to wish for. But at the moment I don't need any so we will see when I will wish again..
Non-Toxic
the only c0 characters i want right now are Nahida, Yae, and Focalors, planning to use my current guarantee to get Nahida when the next patch goes up.
Non-Toxic
Im on 70 pity guarantee doing my 110th wish for Shenhe c1. If I don't make it with my limited keyboard time due to rsi (I aint playing controller lol) then guess Ill just save my 78 pity guarantee for the next archon or something.
Non-Toxic
Kazuha ... but will do a 10 pull at nahidas banner for layla ... 1 layla and hopefully no nahida and i'll be very happy
Non-Toxic
I have a guarantee for Baizhu, but I'd rather have at least C1 Nahida because every one of her constellations is a fantastic bonus to her build. It hurts to even think about skipping anyone as I love to collect and build the characters.
Non-Toxic
Wanderer's constellations. Lowkey hoping that my C9 Jean won't turn into C14 by the time I'm done pulling for him, kek.
Non-Toxic
I have enough for a guarantee and I’m using it on Nilou! I want her for my Nahida team <3
Non-Toxic
I struggle choosing between Shenhe and Nilou.  I want Shenhe, but I don't feel like fighting those lizards.
Non-Toxic
Not waiting for any reruns at this point, so I dunno. Focalors and Murata are the only ones who won't randomly become shitty standard banner characters, and thus the only ones worth saving for. Anyone else can wait for a rerun if they're any good. Don't want to get hyped up for no reason, especially from leaked designs that could change.
Non-Toxic
Baizhu. I love him, have loved him since I met him back in like 2.4 or something. He's pretty, his colour scheme is lovely, I love his voice, chronic illness representation, he's ACTUALLY going to be playable finally, and I very much so need more Dendro characters. He is within my grasp and I can't wait.
Non-Toxic
I kinda want baizhu just because I’ve been waiting so long for him but I don’t really need any of what his kit has to offer ;-;  I’m not interested in any of the leaked characters either

i’m on 50/50 right now but have enough primos saved up (as well as currently being on 55 pity) to guarantee myself a Kazuha :). will have to skip Nahida and Nilou but i’ll get them next time. already have Ganyu, and don’t have interest in Baizhu (plus YaoYao is amazing)
Non-Toxic
Im at 50 pity with guarantee waiting for Nahida! Just a few more days to go…she will also be my first character I have prefarmed resources for too.
Non-Toxic
Nahida because I didn't get her during her first run. I have more than enough saved up to get her even if it is at 90 pity, so now I'm contemplating whether to get her weapon on Baizhu.

If you erased your memory wouldn't you end up doing pretty much the same thing you already did? I'd do the same either way.

If I have erased memory then I would play the game the same way as the first time — extremely efficiently with my resources. No difference. Do every quest, every achievements, build every char.
Non-Toxic
Not burn all my resin on Unreconciled Stars. Fuck me, man that was such a bad move.
Toxic
I don't really have any regrets to fix or anything of the sort. I'd just tell myself to not start the game. Not because I regret playing, but because I'm okay with having done it once and could spend time on something else  Of course, that circumvents the spirit of the question a bit, but oh well
Non-Toxic
I'd do the same thing.  The story, especially with the major side stories in Sumeru basically take you through the entire area.  So if you just do the chests as you run across them then you're going to 100% all the newer areas.
Non-Toxic
Cut down Liyue archon quest in half.. It was good overall but when I recently replayed it my god it dragged on for way too long and filled with useless dragged out crap..
Toxic
I play a second account. I am the other gender Traveler and use other Teams. Also I pull for other characters. Differently enough?
Non-Toxic
The biggest change I would Imagine is not how I would Play, it would be the amount I would end up spending or wishing in general.  &#x200B;  If you been playing since day 1 you have had the chance at every character and weapon banner.  If you were to start now not only are you stuck waiting to use a newly acquired recent character or weapon if you get one in  a wish till you get to the area that has its level up materials,  you are also stuck waiting till the character or weapon you want gets a banner rerun  \-  so in some ways the game might actually be less enjoyable to some as you cant play with the stuff you want to.
Non-Toxic
I probably wouldn't have mained Noelle the first year of the game and the thought of that makes me sad.
Non-Toxic
if I have no memory, I would probably do the same mistakes and play exactly the same as I did the first time.

Well, I started day 1 so for me I'd have a plethora of different characters to choose from and I wouldn't be hardstopped for content for the longest time   Unless we're assuming a time warp back to when you started playing

crit dmg is too low for someone with crit dmg ascension+weapon
Non-Toxic
that crit dmg is wayyy too low even with mistsplitter
Non-Toxic
The build itself is good, just need to work on the substats (as others have said). EM and ATK% are close enough in value that you can use either one for your sands slot, focus on the substats there. Just work on pumping up your numbers and you'll be good. Aim for 75% CR and 200% CD to start, Mistsplitter makes that a very obtainable goal.  P.S. Don't forget the last two talent levels. The damage increase might be relatively small, but there's no reason to leave damage on the table like that.
Non-Toxic
I'm basically farming dendro artifacts and Ascension mats for Nahida and turning the junk artifacts into TF to try and get better ones
Non-Toxic
Pretty bad TBH. Keqing scale really well with CRT, so you need better pieces. Flower and feather should have ATLEAST 25 CV. Mistsplitter means you better of with atk sand ( which is more common, so it should have better sub stat). Goblet and circlet are hard to get, so just slowly gain better ones overtime.  Also, upgrade your talents.
Non-Toxic
What should the stat goal be? This is the kind of Information I can't find. How much Crit dmg /rate how much EM etc
Non-Toxic
I just hate the 40 resin cost for the wolf mats. It's so damn expensive lol  Edit: Tag checks out
Toxic
I’m guessing you are a relatively new player? It’s not a great set, low crit values, em is fine I believe 200-300 is recommended for on field crit builds. With a weapon and crit ascension I’d be aiming for 75+ crit rate and as close to 200 crit damage as I can get without sacrificing crit rate. This will take time/luck though so it’s not like you are doing anything wrong.
Non-Toxic
What is CV? Crit dmg? So 25% on each?
Non-Toxic
As mentioned in another reply, 200-300 EM. Important to note that characters like Sucrose and Nahida, among others, can buff EM and if with those buffs you get into this range then you don’t need as much EM in substats.  Attack sands can be better than EM sands if you have better crit substats and buffs to get you close to 200-300 EM anyway.   For crit stats you can shoot for the standard ratios to start, meaning (without the 44 crit damage from Mistsplitter) go for 60CR/120CD from the 56/100 you have now.  Then, go for 70/140.  Finally, if you’re going full hyper investment you’ll be working for 75/150+ .  More crit damage is better after that point but it’s hard to get there in the first place.  The crit targets are general goals that most guides won’t mention anymore because they’re “common knowledge”, so I understand your frustration.  Aggravate Keqing is good. https://youtu.be/p2suzRJTyRo This guide provides more general build advice.
Non-Toxic
This is exactly the kind of info I needed thank you.
Non-Toxic
Not new but new to abyss. I started at launch as a casual player and I had a physical set on her before now. I have a well built Ganyu but my Morgana team doesn't do well in abyss nowadays
Non-Toxic
CV ( crit value) is a simple number that separate artifacts. CV = Crt_dmg + Crt_rate*2. Because flower and feather have fixed main stat, so you only need to focus on sub stat, which mean it should have good sub stat compare to sand, goblet and circlet.
Non-Toxic
CV (Critical Value) = (2*CR)*CD
Non-Toxic
Thank you ! This has been a great thread for me to learn. I googled Keqing mains and game8 but they don't give the targets just what sub stats to aim for.
Non-Toxic
Let me preface this by saying if you want to play keqing, you play keqing.  But if you want to prioritise abyss success I’d have a look at what other people are playing successfully and follow as closely as your units allow, before investing resin.   https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/12abfyy/352_abyss_data_character_usage_rates_and_popular/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1  If I’ve not messed the link up that’s the most popular teams 36 starring right now.

Yeah ...so,the developers don't really care much about the "endgame content" so that's out of the list   And about your point on giving 2x primos ....... Yeah that's never happening as they have to make money  The only thing that could be probably exceptable might be changing the AR to Mora ratio to let's say 1:50 or 1:100( this is me stretching it a bit)  Other than that I don't see hoyo having any endgame content per se  Well if we have to be real the game's story has not yet ended..so there's that too

There 50 things Hoyoverse could implement with little to no cost that would make the game better.  Everything from an optional endgame cycle to things as simple as artifact loadouts.  It they had any interest in doing anything other than churning out dry patches of recycled minigames, they would have done it already.  Every year, you get 2 patches of content, a bunch of filler, and no QoL changes.  That's it.  That's Genshin.

Simple put. 4 more challenging Daily Quests for high AR's.
Non-Toxic
I also think the same. However, I don't think that a daily gain of 60 primos going to 120 would be able to bankrupt a company.
Non-Toxic
Step 1 to make a suggestion:  Actually properly mention the suggestion itself in your post  >It would be super interesting for AR-55+ players or even restricted to AR-60 plus 4 high difficulty daily missions.  This ain't it
Non-Toxic
It is a net gain of 21900 primos per year of comissions  Doesnt seem like much each day, but it is on the grand total
Non-Toxic
Oh, they are stingy as hell so maybe 90 might be their limit
Non-Toxic
It really needs to be that specific. I figured a little roleplaying sorted things out. Besides, this is more of a rant than anything serious. Because this kind of thing is almost impossible to be taken into the actual game.
Non-Toxic
I imagine that thinking about an annual amount is a little out of touch. Monthly makes more sense (banner time). In a month you can make 1.800 primos - 10 wishes. I know that this must be compared to other forms of gain (exploitation, events, etc.).

I hate diona stall
Toxic
Healing focused is good when your friend wants to test their combo.
Non-Toxic
**To add:**  - They started first   - They kept spamming healing powers (Barbara's burst and skill, Diona's burst, healing cards, etc.)   - My team's overall health kept getting shredded off little by little   - I had lots of omni cards, as you can see I did my best to keep everyone alive as that's the only way I can use this team effectively.. I need all of them  ~~- i also have healing cards~~  - Shields are annoying  Good game!

Based Collei enjoyer

As a stall deck player thanks for the compliment
Non-Toxic
IKR? she keeps healing herself and everyone  One moment she's at 1 health and then the next, SHE'S FULLY HEALED

Tbh this is a rather bad joke...

Very cute. Seems like she's rly -excited- about that rose

Reminds me of Yuni from Princess Connect.

I prefer the rectangle glasses than the round one. Maybe because I also use that kind lol.

reminds me of shiori from fuufu ijou lol

It is her favourite flower!

I've never played PriConne (because I played GBF) uwu is PriConne even still up?
Non-Toxic
That would be why I did both kinds 🐮🥰
Non-Toxic
Priconne JP is alive and kicking.  Priconne Global is ending its service this April =.=
Non-Toxic
Damn... Too late for me to pick it up 🐮😭

jp is fun to play

what, is it not a "nunnery"?

I don't think Barbara is capable of doing something that crass

Anything is possible with "Barbara, ikuyo!"

great bridge builder
Non-Toxic
Mained him from 1.2 till 3.3. I know everyone can be good with investment but its especially true here. I had him built both as cryo main dps and phys dps and he fills both roles more than decently.
Non-Toxic
He's the most powerful tall male cryo sword user in the entire game.
Non-Toxic
Definitely good as a starting character. I'm using him as the main dps paired with a hydro to freeze enemies. I'm AR 35 and in Inazuma. If you get a better dps, he can be kept as an off-field burst support sub dps.
Non-Toxic
Ask here r/KaeyaMains  Not biased at all 👀
Non-Toxic
he’s great in the beginning, super easy to build and his burst comes in clutch really often! great cryo applicator even in the later stages. but if you want to keep using him later on, he’ll need a bit of investment & would really benefit from his cons (starglitter will be your friend..). i’ve mained him since i started & still with him to this day, and it took a while to get him to c6, but i don’t regret any of the wait. he can be really amazing if you’re willing to put in the time! (though i guess that goes for almost anyone else, too) :>
Non-Toxic
He's one of the better 4 stars. Not the best but definitely usable in most situations. His cons are hard to unlock though but other than that at C0 he's pretty decent. You can run him in Melt Teams, Freeze Teams, Physical Teams, Fridge Teams, he's pretty versatile especially compared to the other free 4 stars you get, Xiangling and Collei are probably the only ones better than him out of that group.
Non-Toxic
I just pulled Shenhe to pair with him, and it has been great! But even without her, I think he is one of the best 4\*.
Non-Toxic
Yeah. Has the highest atk multiplier for NA amongst sword users. Budget off-field Cryo applier.
Non-Toxic
One of the best cryo appliers for cheap investment.
Non-Toxic
I’m still using him at ar57/ar56, used to ran abyss floor 12 with Kaeya, chongyun, sucrose, xingqiu. He’s still on my abyss team. With the addition of Dendro you can run a fridge team with him. He’s a solid 4* sub-dps/dps and yes you do need supports for him like most dps in Genshin. I run physical kaeya in overworld and he does fine.
Non-Toxic
He carried me in the early game as a physical DPS, but I'd definitely say he's the best as a Cryo DPS when combined with other characters. He also has amazing synergy with Tartaglia so I'd recommend you to to use them together if u have/plan to wish on Childe
Non-Toxic
If you had to build a starter he would probably be best outside of mc
Non-Toxic
i have a pretty maxed-out kaeya (lv 90, PJC, talents 10/12/13, C6, generalist 2pc/2pc artifacts), and my opinion is that he’s very solid. i run him as cryo sub-dps, which is objectively his best role.   he’s not gonna give you your slam dunk win teams like xiangling or xingqiu, but he contributes well as a sub-dps and cryo applier / battery in freeze and mono cryo teams. if you have c2, he does especially well against mobs.  don’t get too suckered in by people citing his high NA scaling though. he has that because he attacks slowly, so the dmg per second all evens out. I used to run phys kaeya with aquila (hence the crowned normals) and it definitely felt cool, but cryo is for sure my personal preference!
Non-Toxic
he's a decent support if you need a second cryo character for the 15% crit chance.  He's easy to build as well, and I run him with R5 Harbinger of Dawn to get his crit stats up.
Non-Toxic
He is pretty good starter unit and f2p friendly for overworld/story contents. If you lucky enough to raise his constellation he can be pretty good.
Non-Toxic
Pretty good. I'd argue very underrated pairing with Ayaka as a subdps and battery. I was able to 1-phase the Wenut with Kaeya/Ayaka c0/Kazuha/diona. R1 for both Kaeya and Ayaka and c6 Kaeya tho (I've been buying him from starglitter shop for a while). Regardless, he still works well in that team without c6, just a bit less dmg and needs a bit more ER.
Non-Toxic
Excellent in Freeze teams and physical DPS if you build him for that.
Non-Toxic
He has his ups and downs, you won’t get too much value out of him if you use him as a main dps but he is really good for his burst and skill. In most of his teams he is used for his burst similar to how xiangling is mainly used for her burst.
Non-Toxic
He's on par-ish with Rosaria.  They're both pretty good but not top tier or anything.  I run him some times in mono cryo in abyss for fun.
Non-Toxic
Not that amazing, at the end of the day, he is still a 4 star and his cons are hard af to unlock.
Non-Toxic
Cryo Mustang (FMA) is often both over rated and under rated.  He has the second best off field cryo application (besides Ganyu).  His burst is pretty powerful (especially at c6) and can be used off field ala Xiangling.  He can main DPS well for most of early game.  But he's still a 4 star (that isn't the national trio). I've been meaning to build him as a support/off field dps for a while, just not really sure on his weapon/artifact set (Blizzard was borrowed from Ayaka briefly when I was testing out his new C6 DPS, that still might be viable for off field?).
Non-Toxic
Ah Kaeya..By  far the most charming and sus character of all genshin..still think his eyepatch hides a khaenri'ah shaped eye. He's not good as a main dps...very low attack, he's passable as a sub dps, you can use his e and burst to setup reactions, but he has no utility beyond that.
Non-Toxic
Garbage without cons.
Non-Toxic
balls
Non-Toxic
He is good for early to mid but still balnce Imo. It is hard to get his constellations when it is only only on standard and starglitter.
Non-Toxic
 His dmg are mediocre but very good as shield chipper. If you lack cryo, and trying to fight lets say electro mitachurl, hydro mimics, abyss herald, electro scorpion or fire bird. he is the 4 stars that is very good against it, he also got 100% burst up time which make him pretty durable since you can just i-frame many times.
Non-Toxic
At the end of the day Cryo dps wise Ayaka and Ganyu are better but he’s probably the strongest 4 star Cryo imo
Non-Toxic
Anyone can be good if you build them good enough
Non-Toxic
he has one of the highest base attack in the entire game if you wanna make him physical, which is viable for the overworld, and the fact that he’s cryo for superconduct makes physical kaeya even better.   He’s decent in freeze and is good in reverse melt, and is a great option for fridge hyperbloom teams (but literally anyone can work in a hyperbloom team if they just continuously normal attack)
Non-Toxic
One of which there is only him right am I forgetting someone
Non-Toxic
Is Collei considered good? I saw people call her kinda weak, but she carried my weakass second team through floor 9 and half of the floor 10 of the Abyss so idk
Non-Toxic
From pulls yea, but he's in the piamon's bargains shop every June & Dec so you can get him to c6 that way over time at the worst.
Non-Toxic
His open eye is also khanriah -esk. Ashikai had the theory that one of his parents were not of royal blood so it's not as obvious than deinsleif for example.
Non-Toxic
That's the joke lol.
Toxic
Don’t let Kaeya touch him, he might need another eyepatch
