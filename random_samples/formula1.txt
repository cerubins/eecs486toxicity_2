Look, Ferrari might not be the best ones to raise this - but at this point they appear to be right. What I'm seeing if I am another team principal is that I can overspend, develop a winning car, and be punished lightly while running away with a championship the following year.   Sure we might see some teams get closer to Red Bull this year due to the wind tunnel time, but we surely aren't going to see anyone on Red Bull's level. They are just too far ahead.

The second place was Ocon in a Renault. Either way his car was far from the slowest, it was second or third fastest.

I think Red Bull had the same idea when they promoted Gasly, Kvyat and Albon to the main team. Showed promise in AT/TR, but didn't live up to expectations in the main team. They cna get him to test the sim and can evaluate him there, to see if he can handle a different car.      This is why they went outside to get Perez, who is performing decently with his 2nd in WDC - they didn't have someone in their pipeline to take up the Ricciardo sized gap. Tsunoda had many on/off weekends in the past, and we don't haven't seen him shine consistently.

I honestly wonder if the 2020 Racing Point would be considered 2nd fastest if the driver lineups were different. Albon did worse than both Racing Point drivers, he beat Stroll by 30 championship points, but it was also 2 DNFs for Albon compared to 6 for Stroll.   Swap Verstappen and Stroll between the teams and I honestly think that with Verstappen/Perez the Racing Point would be considered 2nd fastest compared to 3rd fastest Red Bull with Albon/Stroll.  Drivers matter a lot in the perception of speed of a car.

I feel like Ferrari and the other teams should appeal to the FIA to just be consistent with penalties. Now if something similar happens in the upcoming races, teams will use Sainz's penalty, Gasly and Sargeant's lack of penalty as a reference. Also people commenting saying both Gasly and Sargeant were out either ways and a 5s/10s wouldn't have made a different. Don't they give a grid penalty or 5s/10s penalty added to the next race? I mean Carlos also got 2 penalty points on top of the 5s penalty, which the other two did not. I am just confused! Correct me if I am wrong. This entire thing is just a shitshow.

He did say that in the Mercedes era he was mostly doing just the broad lines design but let others do the details while he focused on other projects, but that for the RB18 (and probably the RB19 since its a direct evolution) he did do (surprise surprise) the suspension himself.

The penalty was a little harsh, it was essentially a lap 1 racing incident which are usually not treated as harshly as it was. Also, it was only as punishing as it was under this specific circumstance where they only had one lap and just follow the SC to the finish line. Under any other circumstance a 5 second penalty would've dropped him 1, maybe 2 spots down and not put him outside of the points entirely.     Not to mention that Sargeant did something much worse and didn't get anything for it.
