I am not trying to minimize Karlsson's offensive success this year, and I don't have all the stats in front of me to strengthen my opinion on who should receive it, but the award is for the defensive player who exhibits the best '*all around play in the position*'. In my opinion, it should go to a defenseman who has great defensive **and** offensive stats and play. Karlsson certainly ticks the offensive side of the position, but I don't like the idea of a crazy offensive year making up for other areas that may be lacking. It is counter-intuitive to the 'all around play' part of the award description.
