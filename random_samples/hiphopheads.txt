Cilvaringz isn't a terrible producer, he's had some good stuff on Wu related projects over the years. I liked the track he did with Rae and Ghost "Silver Rings".   I don't think its impossible for a rando with access to coordinate a decent Wu album. Hell, Remedy did last year and he's a fucking terrible rapper lol, but he managed to collect enough Wu verses and beats to make something decent. Guys like Andrew Kelly and Mathematics have done a better job than RZA curating Wu compilations in recent years.  With that said, any Cilvaringz Wu project is just trying to capture an old feeling and tracing a blueprint rather than giving something new. So while that album might be decent or even good, it's not likely to be great. *A Better Tomorrow* may have sucked but at least RZA was trying for something different. So this Wu head will rest easy knowing he might never hear it.

Came out last night in Australia, listened through 3 times. This is phenomenal and one of my favourite R&B albums in years. Its a shame Daniel himself is such a dickhead because hes one of the most talented dickheads in all of music. The stretch from Let Me Go to Homiesexual is insane. Other than a few moments i didnt think were anazing (the writing on Vince Van Gogh is pretty lame, and Unstoppable/Valentina arent exactly mindblowing songs), this is a pretty incredible album.   Overall im feeling a 9/10 and confidently better than his last album. Well worth the wait.   Do yourself a favour and set aside an hour one night, take a night drive to this album. I did last night as soon as it dropped. And my god. It hit.  Fav song: Always, Cool, Let Me Go, Pain Is Inevitable, Homiesexual, Do You Like Me?  Least fav: probably Vince Van Gogh bc of the corny lyrics. Feels like a watered down version of the flexing he did on FRONTAL LOBE MUZIK from his last album, where he made:  > Used to be bummy and now i get to the racks, Used to be ugly but now I hit from the back   Sound hard as fuck.

there’s a lot of components to it but the general idea of it is that everything is to sound balanced, clean, polished, and competitively loud.   when someone refers to mix as a sounding “off” it’s when one of the aspects of the mix is out of balance, common examples are, the bass overpowering everything, the snare hitting too loud and hurting the ears, the top, bright end of the vocals sounding shrill, the melody being too quiet, etc. this is very general by the way, there’s wayyyy more to mixing and it’s not to be confused with DJ mixing which is mixing multiple songs together.   in this case, most if not all of drakes low end, which carries rich harmonic frequencies, is cut out which causes his voice to sound thin and over-processed. it’s a stylistic choice but not a very well received one clearly.
