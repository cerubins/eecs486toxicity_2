She is a woman, regardless of how awful she is, and it’s really disheartening to see the transphobia, however unintentional it may be, in these comments. Caitlyn is a nasty, selfish, misogynistic, racist, homophobic, transphobic WOMAN. Period.

Rich people’s take on "minimalism" is always hilarious to me 😭 They really took the whole idea of minimalism, which is to believe that owning a lot less stuff is the key/a key to feel peaceful... and they went "I know what I’m gonna do !! NOT stop buying new luxury cars, but asking that they all be painted ALL IN BEIGE ! So that it can be all that much more puzzling that I have seven different luxury cars since they even all look the exact same now !"

Exactly! Kris is the reason that her daughters hold on tight to these toxic men. She has such a warped sense of reality that she passed right on down to her kids. Their family culture is so engrained in them that I don’t see any of them being able to learn or grow and break the cycle.

Kris is very close friend with one lf the executives at D&G, and since nobody wants to publicly associates themselves with D&G since they made comments and created racists that were deeply racists etc... They have to settle for the Kardashians to be the face of their brand. That’s kinda how Kris moves through the celebrity world in general: Ellen Degeneres and James Corden agreed to star in the Kardashian show only AFTER they were "cancelled" (I’m not saying they were not friendly before, or maybe even friends, but they would have never publicly associated themselves with the Kardashian brand like that), and there are a lot of other examples of this...

That just made me realize that until this wedding, there had been 4 weddings between the 6 karjenner kids, 3 of which were Kim's. And despite those 4 weddings, plus Kris' two, at the time of this wedding, none of them were married. That kinda makes mee root for the barkers even more.  ETA that ALL of them had children out of wedlock (except Kendall... For now), and Kim is the only one who had any while married. Out of the 12 grandkids, only 3 were born to married parents! Not that I give a shit, but that's not very super christian of them.
