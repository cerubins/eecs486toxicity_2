Kris is very close friend with one lf the executives at D&G, and since nobody wants to publicly associates themselves with D&G since they made comments and created racists that were deeply racists etc... They have to settle for the Kardashians to be the face of their brand. That‚Äôs kinda how Kris moves through the celebrity world in general: Ellen Degeneres and James Corden agreed to star in the Kardashian show only AFTER they were "cancelled" (I‚Äôm not saying they were not friendly before, or maybe even friends, but they would have never publicly associated themselves with the Kardashian brand like that), and there are a lot of other examples of this...

And despite those 4 weddings, plus Kris' two, at the time of this wedding, none of them were married. That kinda makes mee root for the barkers even more.  ETA that ALL of them had children out of wedlock (except Kendall... For now), and Kim is the only one who had any while married. Out of the 12 grandkids, only 3 were born to married parents!
