I'm personally a fan of the X formation for people who are otherwise simple farmers. Genetic testing and such is a deeper level of concentration than I care to in a game about living on an island with animal friends, y'know?  The X formation does rely on the center flower being able to breed, yes, but it then has four potential partners, any of whom can be used to create a desired offspring. The simple way to expand that chance is to expand the layout. If there was another red hyacinth two spaces to the right of the original, then it can also have a chance of four potential partners while reusing the two yellow that could breed with either red.  Aside from me using the wrong info on hybrids for the blue rose, this pattern has been quite effective for me in getting every other flower in a relatively reasonable timeframe, as I wasn't in any particular hurry.

I've never been a fan of a whole island reset. I figure it'll take less work to re-terraform an island than to grind through a few weeks to even unlock the ability to do so. And then there's the loss of the catalogue. I'd personally only consider a reset if you really need to change the unmovable things such as the plaza, the dock, river entrances, etc.  But, if you must, then start looking for inspiration on your overall theme. Fairycore and cottagecore are popular. Maybe you want to make your island into a city, decorating villager homes like businesses (both inside and out). I had been playing Breath of the Wild, so I made used that to theme my island layout. Regardless of where you get inspiration, remember that you'll probably still want an area, at least for a while, for the purpose of growing/gathering supplies, so you won't reach a finished stage for quite some time.  Once you get an idea, it might help to print a grid and do some rough sketching of areas. The designs will change as you start to place things and realize what works and what doesn't, but that's part of the process.

Once you've done that and she accepts, you should be good! Villagers, i think, may or may not say something about talking to Toom Nook cant remember if they all do it every time.
