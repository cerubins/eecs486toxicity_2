She is sweet, intelligent, compassionate, hilarious, and such a gift to the queer community. Queens like her are the queens that protect and nurture us. For her, you can tell drag is not just about getting attention, but about being a beacon for queer happiness and self expression. Love her so so so much. I want more queens like her in my life!

Great looks and messy TV doesn’t always equate to good TV, so I understand. Whereas Mistress can navigate messiness while making it entertaining, there’s something about Irene that just misses the mark for me.  Edit: don’t know if you were asking what my flair refers to, but it was you saying “Loosey being the child of a cop checks out” and refusing to retract your comment after someone said your comment was disrespectful. I respect a Bitch who stands firmly in what they believe in. ❤️
