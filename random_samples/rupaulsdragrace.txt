She is sweet, intelligent, compassionate, hilarious, and such a gift to the queer community. Queens like her are the queens that protect and nurture us. For her, you can tell drag is not just about getting attention, but about being a beacon for queer happiness and self expression. Love her so so so much. I want more queens like her in my life!
