Yeah. When Roy started destroying the bar his cousin joined in. If Jim were there he would’ve left and never looked back.  And it didn’t have to be about Pam. Imagine Roy dated someone else Jim never met and wasn’t interested in. He wouldn’t condone the behavior. Imagine it wasn’t a girl at all bad he was fired “unfairly” or he was getting audited or he had a complaint from his HOA. Destroying a bar for whatever reason is unacceptable and Jim wouldn’t condone it or be friends with someone who would do that. He’d nope out fast.

Mine was "I swear to God I didn't kill her, she just slipped and fell. I would never lay a hand on her. She was the love of my life. That's not a gunshot wound, what are you talking about? ***Get out of my house!***"  *Classic Stan-Lan-Da-BamBamBam.*

Sorry, I just deleted my comment because I realized how unrelated my response seemed. I meant that in season 1 the writers had a very different idea of people’s roles and had all those extra background characters. Season 2 was where things really started to solidify, in terms of everyone’s office role. I know in season 3 Meredith says, “Hi I’m Meredith and I’m an al-…good at supplier relations.”
