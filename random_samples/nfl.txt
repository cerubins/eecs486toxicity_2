  Of course, both sides know that it all comes down to the number of zeros after the dollar sign, but it sets a good tone and

Both of those approaches are old tbh; Bill trades back in the 1st round, and then takes chances in the 2nd.  It's been a sporadic combination of the two since (at least) the anomaly that was 2006.  Back then I thought it was brilliant getting Laurence Maroney in the 1st and Chad Jackson in the 2nd round!!!  It didn't quite work out the way I'd hoped though lol.  After that Bill started getting a little too cute I guess.   Just a reminder to illustrate my point: Tavon Wilson was drafted in the 2nd round in 2012... that didn't work out.  One that worked? Gronkowski fresh off of back surgery, drafted in the 2nd round in 2010.  Bill does things the way he wants. A positive for that is, most times, over the last 20+ years, he's proven himself right. A negative is that when he misses, he **misses**... BAD.  It comes with the territory I guess.
