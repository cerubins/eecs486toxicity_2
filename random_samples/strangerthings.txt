It's a public poll Tumblr people can share and vote in it if they want too. A lot of them are also members here too from what I've seen on the Tumblr tag for byler. If you redo it then it will just happen again like you said cause it's public there is no rules telling anyone not to share outside of reddit and if there was I'd find that kind of stupid reddit isn't the whole st audience and at least by sharing it elsewhere it's giving more of a accurate telling of what ships people like or don't. I like what you're doing with this poll but I also don't have an issue with what byler shippers are doing either.

They complain Bylers are intervening on the results of the first round by sharing the poll on Tumblr, but they also have their own ways of maintaining their Mileven heaven here on Reddit by reporting and downvoting pro-Byler and anti-Mileven content until they're suspended/deleted, and also by distributing awards to pro-Mileven content to boost them. This behavior creates a false sense of reality here lmao  It's not that Bylers aren't on Reddit. Many of us are here daily reading  stuff or talking about other topics. We just don't talk about our ship that much to avoid drama, since the few Bylers who share their thoughts here receive a poor treatment.

>based on his...clothes? And him being awkward at first in California?  no, i described in detail how mike's behavior is out of character for him, you’re ignoring most of that.  as for nancy, you're being pedantic. the point is that as she grew older she stopped being into nerdy things and instead started trying to be cool, dating steve is just an example of that. keep in mind that in s3 mike is around the same age as nancy was 3 years before the start of the series, which he seems to think is the last time she was interested in dnd.  >Also, if D&D is as much of a primary interest to Mike as you seem to believe, to the point where it's practically a personality trait  and now you're just putting words in my mouth.  I'd say the fact that his girlfriend was publicly humliated, arrested, then being hunted by the government is a pretty good distraction that explains why he never mentions d&d, lol.  frankly, i don't get why you're getting so worked up over this. this show focuses very heavily on how forced conformity makes people hide their true selves from others, especially in s4, it's not exactly a reach to think one of the main protagonists who thinks of himself as "just some random nerd" is also doing this.

interesting, i never noticed, thanks for pointing all this out! i noticed that in Mike’s case his issues were more so resolved in the end (his best friend was rescued, vulnerable feelings shared which make his relationship more steady), for Nancy it isn’t (Barb died, her and Jonathan still have stuff that needs to be said and worked out). i think in S5 it would be kinda cool to see Mike giving her advice or something, as a way to show how their relationship has changed and that he’s no longer her younger brother who she views as like childish or immature or whatever

I’ve been called a lot of things recently, but that is next level stuff. Surely you see that???! (also, are you queer? If not, then you have no grounds to say “nothing about mike is indicating internalized homophobia or comphet” when you have no experience with or understanding of either and many queer people are telling you, “Um, actually you’re wrong. He does exhibit those traits because I’ve experienced them myself.”) I would never be insane enough to compare Mileven to cult leaders or to hate groups or to any of the insane things I’ve seen Byler compared to. The level of arrogance to think you alone are sane and collectively ALL the millions of Bylers must be functionally in a cult cause there’s no way intelligent people can watch the show and come to different conclusions. YOU’RE the one who needs help. Not for shipping Mileven which is ultimately harmless. It’s fiction. But for being insane.

If another ship and Byler make it to the top 2 maybe we just call it a draw since the results will probably be skewed in favor of Byler.   Instead of a “winner” we could have a tie, which isn’t bad. Ultimately up to you, OP. You’re the creator and those of us with frontal lobes will respect whatever you decide.

I think the way the "least favorite ship" poll is formulated it will first eliminate ships that are involved in major ship wars in the fandom ( byler & mileven, stancy & jancy) because people have strong feelings towards these ships either liking or disliking them, for example in the previous poll post there were more people mentioning byler than kared and ted when objectively byler is no worse than them, same with mileven being eliminated before them. I wouldn't be surprised if the next ones are Stancy or Jancy and that Karen and Ted last quite a while in the poll without being eliminated because people just don't care enough to vote for them.

I could be wrong. Though Stranger Things ending shouldn’t involve the D&D game because that will give it all away. Though, Will has felt the mind flayer , and survived it though the only one source must be destroyed to stop the upside down once and for all.

His monologue to El was such a amazing example of this. The way he reflected on their argument and responded to what she brought up was amazing. That he loves her unconditionally, why he was unable to tell her he loved her, that he feels his life began the day he found her, that he doesn’t know how to live without her, that he’s never been afraid of her, that he knows that she is capable of anything. No wonder he and the Duffers were so excited for that scene! It was perfect!

No point. If they hooked up, at least it would’ve had some relevance. All it did was find a dumb way to get Billy possessed and then give him a small humanizing moment when he didn’t flay Karen.

1) They started filming ST4 in January 2020 (r February idr) in Europe with some cast members, and then had a table read with the whole cast in March. We have no idea if location filming will be needed before Atlanta, or if a group will have to come earlier. No idea!   2) The show has never started filming with finished scripts. The scripts are usually half-way done and the writers finish while other directors film. That could be the case this time too. We also have no idea of how far they are with the scripts. They started in August. They could be done in a few weeks.  3) May has 31 days. We're in early April, if they start in late May, that's a little under two months. That seems like a reasonable amount of time before filming, especially since pre-production has already started according to people.  I don't even care when they film. There's only a few days from May to June. But I don't get why if two actors insist that filming is in May, some people weirdly insist that you know better and it must be June.

Many are slightly or fully AU - just noting this.  Author FateChica has a couple good ones - though they're quite long so be prepared to settle in! Warning that "be brave and kiss the girl" gets mired in typical tropey ff angst near the end before resolving.  "Full Circle" is intriguing.  "Eleven & Company" is short and all fluff.  "Here We Stand" is new and in progress but shows promise.

Well, it's understandable as to why seeing this couple leaves a bad taste in the mouth but it doesn't suffice in explaining as well as to why it's been voted over Ted and Karen and the pairs that I've mentioned among others. Again, shocking because this pair IS a couple and it has its reasons for being a couple and it has amassed fans.  I'm guessing that since there are too many options, many of which are not technically couples, people will first focus on the meaningful ships/actual couples.

Absolutely, and I think that regardless of your alliances in the ship wars, they're the one thing everybody can agree on. I've never seen Elmax and Lumax shippers being anything other than besties, even though their ships are technically non-compatible. As much as I care about Byler, Lumax deserves the top spot by a long shot
