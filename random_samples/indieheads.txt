> uncertai  Hey, thank you!  Pros of studios are the ears of some talented folks that aren't in the band and the gear they are very capable at using.  Cons are that it can be prohibitively expensive which then means you have to work faster than you might otherwise work.  There are definitely positives and negatives to both ways of working, and I don't think one's better than the other, they just create different outcomes.  We've done some soundtrack stuff -- we did Justin Theroux's first film that he directed, called Dedication -- and we've done some other things, including a live soundtrack to Harry Smith's Heaven and Earth Magic. -- J

Im a major (I mean *major*)Konoyo fan so this was likely never going to match up but it was still a really good listen (seriously this man knows his sounds).      It's sounds like Haunt Me got a Ghosts V software update. Cold and glacial but bigger? encompassing? Cinematic. I think his soundtrack work that he's been doing lately really shows on here (Especially The North Water). No Highs comes across as a synthesis of all the styles Hecker's been playing around with cause when listening there are points where I go " oh that's so ravedeath, oh that's so north water etc" but instead of the push/pull of electronic and natural sounds on his other work, on No Highs he's really reeling everything in and making a Tim Hecker record. Which in Tim's case is by no means a bad thing and arguably actually a very good thing.      Personal highlights are Winter Cop and Monotony ll for sure but like I said I will be happily sitting with this record despite Winter being mostly over where I am.

I always miss these when you do them, so I’m glad I caught it this time.   The new album is great, I’ve actually been listening all day today. I’m really glad you guys are bringing the Gorge Trio esque vibes back into the compositional picture more often while still retaining utter Deerhoof identity. Jet-Black Double-Shield is really gorgeous stuff.  Who can bring me back to the Friend Opportunity era and tell me about the formation of the piece Look Away? I’ve always been really curious as to how it was constructed, did John create a framework on guitar that was later augmented by Greg with various keyboards? For years I have pondered how the dense yet minimal landscapes of that particular piece were able to manifest themselves. It wasn’t until I saw you guys perform it live in NYC Feb 2019 that I was able to fully appreciate the arrangement that was put together for it. Ever since then I’ve deeply wondered about its creation and if there was anything significant about its process.  Been a fan for 16 years! Thank you for doing what do, and continuing to do what you do. It’s so marvelous. Sorry if this is a dork question btw

That song is so unique. The arrangement, unorthodox rhythms, and his stuttering take on spoken word (enhanced by the background vocalists) are stunning.   The fourth wall break in the last verse is vulnerable and honest, even by Arthur Russell’s standards lol. It’s like he’s inviting you to rewind and truly listen to the lyrics. Upon subsequent listens, the seemingly nonsensical non-sequiturs become thought provoking commentary on distractions and degradation, more relevant now than ever.   If you like how the bass plays with the Zappa-esque orchestral accompaniment, listen to Diagonals by Stereolab.
