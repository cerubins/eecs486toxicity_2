I can imagine Tom Ford 002 book he made similar stuff inside.

I went to Baylor & attended many basketball games during my time there. Yes, Kim is an iconic coach who really can put a team together. But I feel you may have blinders on. Kim pushes boundaries - a lot. The way she screams in the refs faces, stomps angrily on the court (even bumping the officials multiple times in just the game yesterday), is not ideal. I've always been confused how she manages to not get technicals for her behavior - many other coaches immediately get penalized for the same thing. Additionally, she coached Griner while at Baylor. I understand having different viewpoints, but the fact that Kim couldn't say a single positive thing about BG or that she's in her thoughts or she's hoping it works out for her or she's sorry to hear about the situation, etc etc, speaks volumes on character. BG was a record breaker and together she & Kim really propelled themselves (rightfully so) and earned hella respect. To seemingly not give a hoot about that individual when they are in a scary situation is hella weird. Again, I am assuming as I can only go off what Kim publicly shows. But remember, people pick what they choose to show you publicly. And her actions make her look a bit selfish and uncaring.   I did appreciate the respect and kind words she has had for opposing teams players. Just wish she had the same decency for some of her previous players. That helped her get the job she has today.

I was at lunch with my colleague last week - we're pretty close, have a fun dynamic and some chemistry but I pretty much treat her like any other friend cause she has a BF (and it's easy to be wrong about this stuff anyway).    Anyway, we got a bit tipsy and she said she wanted to clear the air - followed by telling me if she was single, we'd have already had a lot of sex (before also saying she loves her BF and has no intention to be single any time soon)   I understand that when you have an SO, you are still attracted to other people, so maybe she just felt like she needed to get that out there and continue as normal - which she seems to be doing.   At the time I was very flattered ofcourse but this feels like a complicated situation and I am not sure how to interact with her going forward.       My gut is to just to be straight up and tell her it's left me a bit confused and unsure on how to interact with her now - but is that just going to make this situation get more complicated?     Exclusively attracting women with BFs so far in 2023 and not sure why - it is not ideal.
