Cryo Mustang (FMA) is often both over rated and under rated.  He has the second best off field cryo application (besides Ganyu).  His burst is pretty powerful (especially at c6) and can be used off field ala Xiangling.  He can main DPS well for most of early game.  But he's still a 4 star (that isn't the national trio). I've been meaning to build him as a support/off field dps for a while, just not really sure on his weapon/artifact set (Blizzard was borrowed from Ayaka briefly when I was testing out his new C6 DPS, that still might be viable for off field?).

I'd say you've got about an 11% chance to get at least one Qiqi in 90 wishes.  Though it depends on the previous ~180 wishes as well. If you've gotten zero 5* weapons, then your odds are really low for Qiqi, like less than 1%. If you've gotten no characters, your odds are roughly doubled.  This is including Tighnari in the pool, but not Dehya. Would be about 10% with Dehya, 13% without either, rather than 11%.

Did you play at the very start of Sumeru? or did you uninstall just as it was coming out?  If it's the former, not much has really changed besides Nahida being extremely OP, easily a top 5 character. They also added another 5 star to standard banner (Dehya).  If it's the latter, Dendro is hilariously OP, easily outpacing most older teams in terms of DPS. Every electro character got a big buff from Dendro, besides maybe Electro MC. Kuki Shinobu is a top tier 4 star now as a hyperbloom carry, and Thoma is actually useful as a burgeon carry. Keqing went from zero to hero due to Aggravate. Lisa is decent. Hydro is still omnipresent. Xiao got a great 4* support in Faruzan. Burning still sucks. Scaramouche got released under a different name. ~~Still no Eula rerun.~~

I’m guessing you are a relatively new player? It’s not a great set, low crit values, em is fine I believe 200-300 is recommended for on field crit builds. With a weapon and crit ascension I’d be aiming for 75+ crit rate and as close to 200 crit damage as I can get without sacrificing crit rate. This will take time/luck though so it’s not like you are doing anything wrong.

Imo, what actually drives people mad about forbidden knowledge is not any kind of comprehensible information, but one that is corrupted in itself, like looking at some lovecraftian moster.

Ayato is well built. No complaints there.  Bennett is interesting, Sac Sword isn’t bad but Bennett’s ATK bonus from burst is dependant on his Base ATK (Character base attack + Weapon base attack) and Sac Sword has the lowest 4* base attack (454 at level 90). I’d recommend Sapwood Blade (Craftable, ER substat, 565 base attack level 90)  Artifacts are focused on healing but the optimal move with Bennett is 4 piece Noblesse Oblige with as much ER as you can get. 4 Noblesse gives an attack bonus on top of Bennett’s burst attack bonus, and having around 200% ER means you can spam it as soon as the cooldown is over.  Xiangling is easy, go to Inazuma and buy The Catch from the fisherwoman there, you can get it up to R5, then farm the Emblem of Severed Fate set. 4 Emblem with 200% ER and as much Crit Rate/Crit Damage makes Xiangling a beast, especially on a team with Ayato for easy Vaporizes.  Ayaka with HoD and 4 Blizz is good, but try to stack attack and I do not recommend using her in a team with Ayato/Xiangling. I would suggest making an entire second team focused around Ayaka, with some good support characters like Xingqiu to help Ayaka get the extra Crit Rate from 4 Blizz against Frozen enemies.

Cheapest new one I can see that is safe on pcpartpicker would [be this one](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/ntxRsY/bitfenix-formula-bronze-600-w-80-bronze-certified-atx-power-supply-bp-fb600ulcb-7r) at $45. That puts you at $183 and there's still most important part - a video card. Absolute **lowest** new that can run any games is [GT1030](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/Q4648d/asus-geforce-gt-1030-2gb-video-card-gt1030-2g-csm) for $90. However it represents a horrible value for the money and if you once more look into ebay deals - $45 does buy you a GTX 1050Ti. So $228 + shipping is the lowest I can imagine, half of the parts from ebay. It should perform okay at Genshin, give or take 40-50 fps at medium settings.   If it was new only - no way to build anything with gaming potential below like $400. And if it was said $400 - well, you could get the [following experience](https://youtu.be/PKmJJb_k_fk).

neutral multistop the neutral you neutral neutral using positive intensifier meta for him ? if neutral neutral neutral positive intensifier neutral positive neutral neutral neutral from tullaytallah 's negative neutral : neutral positive neutral layla looks intensifier intensifier imo . neutral positive neutral negator hnegative neutral her neutral neutral positive hnegative neutral hpositive neutral hnegative characters

But... the weapon you have Wanderer using is very meta for him? If I recall it's literally his best weapon pick aside from Tullaytallah's Remembrance  also: Skyward Blade on Layla looks so pretty imo. It's also not bad on her but it's unfortunately far better on other characters

In Freeze it's obviously Kazuha, no clue who'd ever tell you something else.   For reaction heavy comps Sucrose C6 is usually the better choice.   With access to weapons like Hakushin and TTDS she easily matches his Buffs.      Although Kazu pulls enemys closer together, meaning comps with limited AoE like HuTao are probably still better of with him.

Oh yeah don't stall on it. You are just scuffing your overworld boss drops and increasing your resin usage. Clear the ascension quests the moment they hit you. Lord I would hate doing extra runs on bathysmal vishaps. I have ascended my shenhe to the last stage and also prefarmed for my future Yae. Never again. Fck those two bitches especially.
