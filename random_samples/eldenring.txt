I’m playing the hero starting class, which starts out with high strength and low dexterity. And I’m keeping him that way, so I’m mostly avoiding weapons with a dexterity requirement.  I do use Radagon’s Soreseal though, but I’m doing the opposite of what you’re asking. I didn’t want to be unfocused and have too many weapon options.  There are definitely enough weapons for me but there’s a lot I’m purposefully not trying to use.  I use mainly use: - Grafted Blade Greatsword - Greataxe - Executioner’s Greataxe - Great Mace - Rusted Anchor - Banished Knight’s Greatsword - Arbalest - Clawmark Seal - Beast-Repellent Torch

Not parasitic, THE ERDTREE could be seen as parasite but the Greater Will couldn't give less of a shit about what happens in the lands between. We must understand that the elden ring and by extension the erdtree are but mere tools of the Greater Will, a being who we cannot even begin to comprehend. We see many forms of the outer gods but that's mere physical manifestation of what they could potentially be for all I know the Frenzied Flame could be an all consuming mouth in the shape of a sun. The formless mother could be a bag of blood from a hospital and the rot god could be an insect (I aay this bc malenia's butterfly symbolism, the antspur rapier and the scorpion stinger)

On my second playthrough, I think my favorite boss this time around has been Mohg, Lord of Blood. My Night Comet spam wasn’t going to be effective against him since he jumps around a lot in phase 2, so I went at him from the get go with my Darkmoon Greatsword and got him down in two tries on my own, whereas before I needed a spirit ash summon to help out. That was really good.  I think my favorite boss from the first playthrough I did was Godfrey (the one with the second phase). His fight feels like a dance in the first phase. You can see exactly where your attack openings are, you just have to react and respond accordingly. Then you get to phase 2 and he suplexes you like a WWE Superstar dreams they could. The fight gets way more frantic in phase 2, especially if you don’t know how to dodge his wild swipes.

No that's actually just head canon. The game in fact tells you the opposite, that Ranni and the Assassins teamed up just for the Night of Black Knives. And Marika shows no love for anyone in her family. Not her  husbands, not her kids, not her Shadow Malekith, she doesn't even seem to care for Radagon who is a part of her. We habe zero evidence that Godwyn was anything more to her than her first non-Omen child hence the first she felt she could show publicly.

STR/FTH is easier to build up to and you get a lot of good options for offense and defense.  There's a REALLY good weapon that scales well with DEX/FTH, but it requires farming a specific enemy and the drop rate is low.  The big thing with faith builds though is buffs, specifically Golden Vow, Flame, Grant Me Strength, and the regen spells. As for damage types, FTH boosts fire and holy damage and fire damage is useful throughout the game while holy becomes less effective on bosses later on in the game.  Both are viable but I would recommend STR/FTH, especially since you get tools that scale well like Clawmark Seal.

IMO, does not matter that much - Talismans, incantations, meats and aromatics work better generally with damage negation.  Where they do matter is if you want high poise to go toe-2-toe with a foe.  A few pieces have buffs, like Rapotor Black Feather (jump attack buff), White Mask (bleed buff), Black Knife chest (silence/sneaky buff), Mushroom (poison resistance) etc.  Most people just take the pieces with the highest damage negation while still having a medium roll.  Personally, I like to just wear whatever is fun and don't worry about what they do - antlers with lights are a must for me.  I would certainly say do not rely on it to protect you - learning how to evade is way more important and effective. There are 'tank builds', but the protection comes from two greatshields and the armor really is only giving you the poise bonus.

200% not parasitic lol. Everyone is still convinced that the erdtree is some sort of parasite of the crucible, but it's not true. The crucible and the erdtree are the same thing, just in different ages and called with different names. (If they were different things, why would their incantation crests be the same? Also in Japanese the crucible is called something like "the beginning of the golden tree".  The crucible is basically the erdtree before the rune of death was plucked away by Marika. So there's no tree parasiting other trees.  The Elden beast could be seen as a parasite, since it basically lives inside of Marika.
