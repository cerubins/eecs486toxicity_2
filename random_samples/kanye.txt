No, that’s my theory as well. Donda seemed to be all of the elements listeners enjoyed of all of his albums. Come to life is runaway. New again is flashing lights. Off the grid is can’t tell me nothing. Ok Ok is Black skinhead…if he makes another album I can’t even comprehend what it would sound like or be about; maybe healing?

It’s my favorite. Its the album in Ye’s discography that feels the most groundbreaking. I was a huge DG fan when it came out and I stupidly ignored it because people said it was biting that sound.   After listening to it dozens of times you can tell it has some industrial hip hop influence but it also stands alone as a singular piece of pop culture.

Unpopular opinion incoming which will probably get me a ton of downvotes but I don’t rly rate blood on the leaves and it’s near the bottom of where I would rank the songs on yeezus. I also feel similarly about diamonds in sierre leone so maybe it’s something to do with how the samples are flipped which doesn’t do anything for me
