I mean, they switched strategies when some of these shows were already shot or in production. They’re going to release them as planned, and then in the future they’ll slow down. I expect the remainder of phase 5 to be stretched out quite a bit, and Kang Dynasty and Secret Wars to be delayed by a year or so a piece. They definitely need to let these projects breathe, and it makes sense given the critical reaction to Love and Thunder and Quantumania. If we got 2 shows and 2-3 movies a year, that would definitely help the cause.

And considering Tony is shown as being smart in several fields, the movies are already pushing it enough as it is.  My point is: Tony is good with tech. He can hack S.H.I.E.L.D.'s stuff, but he's not a spy, nor a detective. Heck, as someone else pointed out, he probably only accessed whatever files Fury had access to, and considering he wasn't HYDRA, there would be nothing pointing towards them. In Winter Soldier, they have Pierce unlock S.H.I.E.L.D.'s database, and even then, it need confirmation from both Pierce and Fury!

This has nothing to do with forced representation and everything to do with mediocre writing, which is the problem across the board with these shows.  They shouldn't stop trying out new or lesser known characters because the MCU wouldn't exist without that mindset.    What they should do is stop approving scripts that could benefit from another draft or complete re-write from a stronger writer.  It's boring ass writing that's hurting the MCU, not diversity.

But Mr. Perl­mut­ter was no typ­i­cal cor­po­rate em­ployee, nor did he act like one. If he didn’t like what he saw from lead­er­ship, he picked up the phone and aired his con­cerns to pow­er­ful al­lies like for­mer CEO Bob Chapek and ac­tivist in­vestor Nel­son Peltz.  >	When Dis­ney was bat­tling with Flor­ida Gov. Ron De­San­tis, Mr. Perl­mut­ter said he called him, too. “Ron, you’re right. Dis­ney doesn’t have the right to get in­volved with pol­i­tics.” > Mr. Perl­mut­ter, who is also one of Dis­ney’s largest in­di­vid­ual share­hold­ers—he owns ap­prox­i­mately 30 mil­lion shares of Dis­ney, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple close to him, worth about $3 bil­lion—said he has tried for years to con­vince Dis­ney to spend less on its Mar­vel Stu­dios su­per­hero movies, which he be­lieves are too long and too ex­pen­sive to pro­duce.   >	“I have no doubt that my ter­mi­na­tion was based on fun­da­men­tal dif­fer­ences in busi­ness be­tween my think­ing and Dis­ney lead­er­ship, be­cause I care about re­turn on in­vest­ment,” Mr. Perl­mut­ter said.
