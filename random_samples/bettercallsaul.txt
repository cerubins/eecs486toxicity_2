I would like to see a courtroom game, similar in some ways to the Ace Attorney series, but more along the line that you can choose how you handle a case - whether you play it clean or play it dirty. A game where you can maybe pay off or intimidate witnesses and jurors, or bargain a plea deal with the DA, or try to discredit or tamper with evidence, things like that. It could be very compelling, but I imagine it would be hard to write a game like that, considering you would need very good dialogue to write good court room drama, but also be willing to accommodate multiple branching paths for different decisions made by the player. Might be too difficult to make but I’d play the hell out of it.

Howard putting Kim in doc review can’t be interpreted as anything else than a “dick boss”.   1) He blamed her for stupid shit that Jimmy did  2) Even if we assume that Kim bears responsibility, the correct thing to do is either teach her or fire her. Putting a capable person in a menial role is a complete waste of human talent.
