You can't honestly expect Disney or Star Wars to retcon billions of dollars worth of movies because fans didn't like the plot or characters. There's also been no precedent for Disney/Star Wars to just start completely over, it just hasn't happened and probably won't happen because branching off from finished eras is better.  The problem with all the hate for the newly announced Rey movie is it is paradoxical. Yall flame tf out of Rey Skywalker and the Sequels but refuse to even consider that the new movie may be a chance to right some wrongs, improve characters and flesh out the universe.

I tried to Add to Cart to see if it ships anywhere or is local pickup only, but I get an error message that I don't know how to overcome. They have a phone number at the bottom of the website for internet sales. Maybe if you call them when they're open they can give you information about if you can order it from them, and if not, maybe they can give you enough information to find someplace else you could buy it, because I am not able to find any other websites just by Googling the product name.

The Force Awakens is a perfectly fine and unoffensive Star Wars film in of itself, but in the context of the wider saga its horrible directive. It’s follows the same basic plot and structure of Episode IV, and while that’s debatably what the Star Wars franchise needed in 2015, it clearly wasn’t what the series needed in the long run. It started a chain of events that led the state of the Galaxy to be exactly the same as it was at the end of Return of the Jedi, effectively making everything Luke, Han and Leia fought worthless as it all gets destroyed either before or during Episode VII. That being said, The Force Awakens is in no way a bad film. It is a Star Wars film though and though, which is its biggest problem. It’s not unique or original in comparison to the original trilogy.

I believe the story is that he was a Jedi that fled to the Unknown Regions after receiving Obi-wan's warning message.  So he's a fallen Jedi.  I'm not entirely sure of the apprentice.  Their lightsabers are both Orange.  He's likely not associated with the Sith, rather following his own dark path, or perhaps he studied a dark cult in his travels through the Unknown Regions.
