As for the 3 tracks by other artists: When there was the first internet in East Germany, in the deepest country somewhere in the forests of Thuringia, I was already a teenager and untitled files were saved on the computer by my bigger brother. I remember that until then I only knew Phil Collins and Celine Dion and then I double-clicked Sigur R√≥s - Flugufrelsarinn: [https://youtu.be/lfKFFeHjgTI](https://youtu.be/lfKFFeHjgTI) , later my first "own" music I liked was The Album Leaf - The Light: [https://youtu.be/dM6lFQysxtg](https://youtu.be/dM6lFQysxtg) What do I listen to today?

If interested, I put together a playlist of [Chiptune and Indie Game Music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/57aOBK2jSaSfvtrIP9vGk4?si=c7f390814b6f4994), between 4-5 hours of music, arranged by key of song so songs transition smooth. Unfortunately, a lot of the best video game music isn't here because Nintendo and some other companies don't allow their music to cross onto platforms like this, but there's a vibrant chiptune scene out there of people who do this type of music in the current day, and it's pretty common for pixel art style indie games as well.  Feel free to skim around it and hopefully you discover some great stuff. Some of the leading composers today in this style are Lena Raine (Celeste), Disasterpeace (Fez, Hyper Light Drifter), Jake Kaufman (Shovel Knight, Shantae), Toby Fox (Undertale, Deltarune), etc.

Hi, Sry for beeing late but thanks for taking time for this! I was wondering - as your approache towards music seems to be quite intuitve. Do you practise any kind of meditation or how do you get in touch with that Intuition? On the other hand - how important is (or maybe was) formal training like taking music lessons for you? Looking forward to seeing you in Cologne!

Great question!

Will likely spend a bit of time on the Yoga Sutras in this regard, as its got some absolutely incisive pointers into the nature of the Kleshas.  It'll be a first for me, so a bit nervous but will prepare the best I can!  -CC

I could (and still can) instantly recognise a Habstrakt song or an Eptic song or a Must Die! song or a 501 song, or whatever. That's something that's missing from most newer artists I hear nowadays - they sound like everyone else with a few minor differences.   A lot of NSD: Black Label stuff, or Disciple, or a lot of bass house labels, sound really samey compared to other stuff the label's putting out, to the point where you can't even guess which artist it is. I like a label having its own sound and culture, but it's important for individual artists to stand out, too.  The real issue is that artists end up in a "bubble" where they're only taking influence from other artists in their genre. The sound just becomes incestuous and derivative. The songs and albums that really stand out are the ones that take influences from further afield and fuse them together. Nero's _Welcome Reality_, for instance, very clearly has huge _Blade Runner_ influences, along with '80s pop and disco influences, along with the obvious ~2010/2011 dubstep influences, and it came out sounding very different from everything else at the time, and has stood the test of time much more than many releases from that period. Whereas riddim/bass house producer #172 taking influence from riddim/bass house producer #626 just results in the sound homogenising.
