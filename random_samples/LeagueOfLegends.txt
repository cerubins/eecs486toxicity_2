I’d like to get back to the early seasons 2 tanks could fight for minutes late game and maybe longer, a tank would lose 1v1 full build to most adcs also at full build even if they could stick to them, a tank was there to cause disruption and if ignored he cced the back line(engaged and disrupted) but the tank wasn’t going to kill people he was going to get them killed…there was far less true damage I think it’s nuts just how much there is and I believe there was only 1 source of % max health true damage…at this point I kinda think there should be items that reduce true damage. And healing/sustain should be hard to get on champs that aren’t designed to heal/sustain. I like to see tanks not getting one shot in one spell rotation but I don’t like that they are competitive with some of the duelists in duels. (Que the argument “if tanks don’t deal damage they are ignored” if they are ignored your carry’s will die in cc the tanks will get them killed)

>I mean it also only has happened like twice the whole time league of legends has existed  That's generally because NA has been unable to pass to Bo5 stage. If C9 win finals they are automatically in Bo5s at MSI.  >"He is good in NA and not a problem so we shouldn't replace him" approach  This is a really dumb argument since there have been teams that have tried this and end up failing even more in NA. Look at TSM in 2018 dropping DL. 2020 TL dropping Xmithie. These were teams who tried to focus internationally and where unable to even win NA until they fixed their mistake. It also doesn't make sense. How are you going to make roster moves to make your team better if they aren't the best in the region?   > Fudge is good in NA but he is just another top laner at international events  You're entirely wrong about this and the problem yourself. Fudge was incredibly good internationally in 2021, but you hyper focus on 6 Bo1s in 2022 and say he can never be good. He was playing better than Korean & Chinese tops in 2021, and the decline seems to come from his stint in mid, which he has clearly recovered from at this point.  >Also Zven is just painful to watch as he sits in lane 24/7.  No he doesn't, he's constantly making moves with Blaber when needed. C9 usually puts Zven on strong laners to help Berserker as Blaber focuses on topside, but his Rakan game this split was insanely good. He's also dramatically improved this split.
