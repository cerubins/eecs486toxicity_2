The problem there are a lot of people who don't know shit about boxing.      
James changes a lot of AJ's foundation.  His guard is different, the 
piston jab was different, the angle which he threw the right hand downwards.  
His approach and angles were different.    AJ looked tense and uncomfortable with all 
of it. He didn't look scared but he did look like he didn't trust himself.      
Maybe this change is 2 or 3 years too late.  But I think another fight or two and he will be vastly improved.

I'm not qn AJ fanboy, I agree his only chance is to hope the belts get fragmented and he becomes mandatory. I cant see Usyk dropping a belt anytime soon, as he wants undisputed. If he fights Fury, and Fury wins, I can see the IBF going vacant after they stripped him last time.

I respect Canelo for taking the challenges he has and what’s he achieved but his fanboys need to chill. Judges clearly favor Canelo just as they do any cash cow.

Usyk took the 70/30 split then told fury’s team that if he wins, on the rematch he gets 70% and fury 30% which is more than fair. If he wins he holds all the belts and fury has nothing. As it stands he currently holds 4/5 if you want to include the ring. Fury denied. When he denied Usyk called it off because Fury keeps moving the goal posts - he wants all the money and a rematch where he continues to get all the money because that is all he cares about at this point in his career.

He wasn’t at a career high in weight, nice try.  And Ruiz is never fast on his feet. He’s a plodder. Watch any fight. Whether he’s 250 or 280, he’s not timing anyone down.  And you can come up with whatever favorable scenario you want to. If my uncle has tits he’d be my aunt. Everyone knew what AJ would try and do. Ruiz did nothing to prepare for it. That’s his fault, not the refs.  You don’t get bonus points for being lazy and one dimensional. AJ beats Ruiz 9/10 because he’s longer, more agile, more well rounded, and can actually adapt.

Is diet really the cause of height difference? If anything the food available to regular people these days is way more polluted and damaging to hormonal development. Testosterone has dropped massively, the majority of people(at least in the states)is overweight or obese, and the list goes on. Liston grew up on a farm, had an extremely tough upbringing combined with healthy naturally grown foods without bullcrap soy, plastics or ridiculous amounts of sugars.   The only difference would be the availability to steroids, doctors and such. But that height correlation to "good diet" thing doesn't make sense to me at all.

Hard to quantify something that is awarded on a ref's discretion. It doesn't happen that often to be honest.

A 250lbs Chisora is physically just stronger than a 215lbs Sonny Liston. It's just the way it is. You said Fury being heavier than Wilder like it is somehow a point, when it is very clear from all of their fights that Fury is physically stronger than Wilder, he just doesn't punch as hard.  You somehow try to make the point that being heavier does not make you stronffer when it is absolutely the case. The same guy weighing 200lbs or 250lbs him at 250 will be stronger, if his body composition is about the same. And that's just a biological fact. Also Frazier was shorter, but he wasn't lighter than his opponents. He had huge legs, which obviously was the source of his power. He knocked out Foster who was taller, but much weaker because he was lighter.  Also Liston being stronger than Foreman is moot anyway, as Liston died when Foreman was 21. That's before you get your man pounds and become a bit physically stronger anyway. And you know what made George so strong when he came back? His additional weight. He slimmed down to experiment against Qawi to to 235lbs, but after that he always fought north of 250lbs because the added weight offered just a bunch of advantages

Nikolai Valuev retired as an atg heavyweight champion who was 5 feet tall and 4 get wide. His fragile chin was protected by his incredible reflexes, lightning quick hands and feet and crazy head movement. He also has the best hairline of any boxer ever, and is definitely not buddies with a genocidal, mass murdering autocrat.

I assume you weren’t alive at the time, but the idea that Holyfield was washed was absolutely not prevalent at the time.  That’s been decided later by people with agendas.  He was the betting favourite in the run up to the fight and Ring’s #1 HW, above Lewis.

Are you serious? He deserves zero respect for “coming back swinging” against random roofers and Uber drivers😂 
AJ fanboys are mad for coddling him and making excuses… the fact is if he needs 2 or more 
tune up fights against bums before he even thinks about taking on a top 5, he’s not the level of fighter some people still think he is.
