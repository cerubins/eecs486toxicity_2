This is not the investigation into SM I was asking for. LSM is that way -points towards whatever country he ran off to-.   If they are guilty I doubt serious consequences will be served so at this point the 99% just shrug and the megacorps pay their "cost of doing business" fines. But at least SK is investigating. There are sure a lot of companies I'd love to see get raided by my governments authorities.

I keep seeing people say how weird it is that he kept mentioning how young she is but I think the reason why he was so overly conscious about it is because he knows that kpop stans like to take stuff out of proportion and run with it. Saying you’re a fan of New jeans and being an adult will get you side eyes from left and right bc you’re automatically assumed to be a creep, and I know he’s aware of that. In the video he even says not to misunderstand him since he knows how harsh people can be on idols.   The whole thing was sensationalized and turned into something that it’s not so I’m glad they’re doing something about the defamation.

There’s unfortunately zero nuance when it comes to Kpop fans online. I think what you’ve said is completely valid and a very respectful critique of the situation! Fans going after people like you who are voicing discomfort is the wrong thing to do objectively. And doxxing is of course never ok.   But I do think a statement like this from Abyss is warranted considering there *are* people who are saying wholeheartedly he’s actually done criminal activity so this is a warning to cut it out before they actually come after you (obvs not you specifically).

Like I said a conversation should be had but it's not happening...he said she's an ideal type, not made sexual or derogatory comments about her or towards her...the problem is putting a black and white view on a situation that is not black and white.  It's not being pedantic to make a distinction between being inappropriate to or about something...even the definition of what is and what isn't appropriate is something worth talking about.

He should speak out about the situation and offer clarification as well. but I’m saying I’ve seen worse on here and on Twitter. So just because you saw a few innocent tweets doesn’t mean that’s what the majority of them were or that there weren’t ones that were way out of line. In that case he has a right to feel that way about the trolls or more extreme people. It’s like two things can be right at once. He can need to clarify his statement but people saying he’s a predator/pedo can also be wrong. It’s like idols who mess up getting death threats. Yes you can say how they’re problematic for being colorist etc but death threats are a separate matter
