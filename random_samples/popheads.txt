They still bully her. I'm no sequel fan but it's ridiculous how fans still talk shit about Daisy and Rey to this day. I see SW fan accs on my feed all the time and when the sequels are even alluded to, the comments say "Finn/John deserved better" (absolutely true) and a whole bunch of Rey slander vaguely aimed at women in general.  On John's side, I wouldn't be surprised if he's done for good. They (both official creators and fans) took one of his life's passions and destroyed it. Besides Finn being pathetically written out of a lead role, Reylos (particularly white women) \*are extremely racist and harrassed him endlessly when he joked about the ship once.  After both creators and consumers generated such a mess with the sequels, I'm shocked they're even going back to that era.

Mariah Carey and Glitter fiasco. It wasn‚Äôt necessarily career ending, but the respect the public had for her was down the drain. The movie wasn‚Äôt received well, and the album wasn‚Äôt considered good. On top of her mental health not being in the right place, and her attempts to be comedic with promoting loverboy didn‚Äôt go over well with the public. Instead they tried to portray her as being crazy lol. It also didn‚Äôt help that Tommy was trying to sabotage her, during that time period, and she was dealing with conflict with her family. She really had it rough.   Charmbracelet came afterwards and while it has some good songs, it once again wasn‚Äôt like any of the stuff the GP was used to from her. She had success ofc, but it wasn‚Äôt the same.   EMOM came out three years later and she had gained respect again. The music was better, her vocals were more impressive again, she was charting and created more hits. Her public perception massively improved again, and she got taken more seriously like she once was before.

neutral neutral neutral neutral neutral her neutral would've charted neutral hpositive if selena neutral negator positive neutral neutral neutral with hnegative you to hpositive neutral , although neutral neutral the neutral .

I still think Look At Her Now would've charted WAY better if Selena didn't release it right along with Lose You To Love Me, although I saw the vision.
