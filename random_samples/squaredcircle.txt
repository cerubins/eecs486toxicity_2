If this is true, I can understand why a lot of guys are frustrated. The main event scene has been all but stunted with Roman holding two world titles. That’s not Roman’s fault, he doesn’t control his booking, but all the guys who really stepped up to guide WWE through the pandemic and whatnot have been shoved to the back burner and sitting in a holding pattern. Drew, Lashley, Seth Rollins; they’re just hanging out because they’ve outgrown the midcard titles and there’s nothing for them to compete for. I’m not a Drew fan, but he’s definitely a valuable asset to WWE, so I’m hoping they work something out.

Finally, after carrying the NXT UK women's division for nearly two years, after leaving that brand and having her name and presentation changed in NXT, after losing an unnecesary amount of times to Mandy Rose, and even after losing to some rookies not so much time ago... FINALLY Alba is champion again!! I was starting to think that she was receiving the role of the 'veteran that wins every but the most important (title) matches'. Glad to see that was not the case.  Happy for Isla Dawn too! I thought they would simply forget of the talent that was left after NXT UK finished, but it was the opposite since not only Isla is champion In NXT but we've also seen Blair Davenport, Stevie Turner and Lyra Valkyria there too (the latter seems to have a permanent schedule with the show).  Finally, just realized that Alba is the only woman in the entire company that has chances of holding every active female title there. She's been NXT UK women's champion, now she's NXT women's tag champion. Hopefully in the future she reaches the NXT women's title too, she would be closer to the previously mentioned achievement of holding every active female title in the company.

Thanks boss.   Triple H still has the book, but Vince will always have atleast *some* amount of influence and suggestions. More so now since the whole merger. Either way Triple H was bound to ask his father in-law, who for better or for worse ran the entire show and micromanaged everything for a very long time, for some ideas and his thoughts on certain things.

I genuinely wonder if they *COULD* pull something like that off if they held firm until SummerSlam. Have Roman run down the WWE roster one by one again but this time *more blatantly cheating*. Then you have them post-match beatdown each opponent until they're "hurt" and off the show.  Then one by one at SummerSlam as the full Bloodline surround the ring against *the* guy they want to win, you have all of those people return one by one on the stage then rush the ringside area and beat the shit out of the Bloodline leaving Roman shellshocked to take a Finisher in the ring and finally lose.  If Wrestlemania was the Infinity War, then SummerSlam is the Endgame complete with the "portals" scene of injured wrestlers returning to help.
