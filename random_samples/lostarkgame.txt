I have 1540 tai scrapper that will stay there. It's not that I don't like the class, but that I don't want to invest in it to be able to keep up dmg with other classes. Now if it only needed like 1/2 lvl 10 gems then I would be fine with it since it's an alt. Scrapper needs way more than that and should be treated as main class in long run to pump dmg. Sorry, I'm not a whale that can afford to get all lvl9-10 gems yet for a alt.

3rd stone. New striker alt that I wanted to eventually main swap to.  Was still relatively new to the game, didn’t know about 9/7 stones really or the implications of certain engravings.   3 stones. 9/7/1 Ambush/KBW/defense  I’ve been 5x3x1 for months. Few points to make before anyone goes out spending their life saving on a 9/7 A- it isn’t the huge dmg increase people make it out to be. In fact, if I don’t have a high uptime crit buff, I potentially do less damage than a striker with 5x3 and adrenaline 3.  B- I’m never running kbw 2. Even if it’s a dps increase at 5x3x2 just feel sick to even consider it.  C- for the performance I get- the gold cost to dps ratio isn’t even close to worth it. I had to buy class and dps leg books, a 5/3 class piece on the most expensive class in the game.   I’m not crying here. It’s been an advantage at times. When I’m in the right group I absolutely slap. But I’ve also been beaten on damage by people who are 5x3 plenty of times and it’s not a skill issue or am I played bad/didn’t crit rng. The difference is pretty minimal even in trixion.   Now if I was able to go adrenaline 2 at ancient, I think that would be a game changer, but like…. You need to dodge so many bullets to get that stone. I saw someone else post here that they got a 9/7 with adrenaline at 9. I’d literally break my computer. Because for all the luck I had on my strikers 9/7 I paid back tenfold getting 7/7 on all of my Alts.  Stone cutting is absolutely cancer.

But it actually makes a LOT more sense to believe that that 1560 who couldn't understand clock numbers in clown g2 maze and that other guy who turned into a clown in g1 three separate times and then jailed us in g3 were actually newly-bought accounts rather than people who previously bought busses.

So this recent video was put out by Kanima and I find it interesting because usually we see tier lists which argue for Burst DPS, with the most recent one thats relevant to NA/EU region being the one made by Legalia. **Essentially his argument is that consistent dps is more favorable to burst dps because most relevant raids from here on out will not be outgeared so easily. As a result consistent DPS matters a lot more because skipping mechs will be less frequent.** What are your general thoughts on Kanimas argument that ultimately consistent dps is more important than burst?

Yea, what gives, do people still don't know how to build their character properly, it's an alt too so he is supposed to know how to do it. You don't really need a degree in engineering, you start with whatever book you have that you can equip, then stone then class engraving accessory, then you can either go on the neck or find everything else first and fishing with the neck (if you have a 77 stone and two +12 books your neck will be an easy 5 plus random stat and that's super cheep and easy to cheeze free stats points). You can go with a  +3 class engraving and +3 some other stat if you want to find a cheaper class accessory (but then the neck piece will cost you a lot more since you will be looking for good quality piece)

Even last week I was in a party with my bard and most the DPS were standard 1540+ 5x3 title lvl7 gems etc. Somehow our DPS was so lackluster that we were seeing the tornado mech and if that wasn’t enough, we got 3 separate sets of blue meteors when we were fighting her near the bottom. The last time that happened to me was on a prog party week 1-2.  I really believe that our DPS were just all running around dodging and thinking someone else will do damage.

Its only a "mistake" in the sense that the real issue is something that isn't Lost Ark related.  Logically there isn't any benefit to deleting them. There should be no reason that you cant have the 1460 around and only play 1 or 2 characters & ignore the ones you want. Some days will come around and you may want to do just a little bit more on Lost Ark on that week, the option being there is always nice.  But if you can't control yourself like that/improve it and its either delete them or only FOMO then I guess, sure. But honestly I'd take that as a moment to self reflect because stuff like this is going to affect you everywhere in life and your going to deal with it in plenty of places outside of this game. It really isn't a Lost Ark issue, Lost Ark just brings the issue to the forefront for people who have it.

if you neutral anyon with neutral negative they positive negator hpositive mech hnegative , if they neutral endgame titles , neutral negative gems , and neutral neutral they neutral neutral playing the neutral and positive neutral hpositive hpositive mechs

If you see anyone with roster level <160 they will not know mech  However, if they have endgame titles, 5x3, all level 7 gems, and most importantly LOS18+, they are heavily playing the game and will most likely know mechs

thi neutral positive diminisher hnegative multistop and neutral of the redditors neutral positive for the positive numbers . diminisher of them negator neutral neutral neutral neutral the neutral and negative these numbers neutral positive for them . neutral positive , you positive neutral hpositive neutral neutral neutral of these numbers neutral intensifier hpositive neutral neutral intensifier scenarios . neutral cooldowns , neutral for checks , mechs , etc multistop intensifier neutral things neutral neutral your neutral .

This list is mostly useless...and most of the redditors are falling for the big numbers. Some of them can't even back attack half the time and assume these numbers are helpful for them. Reality is, you will most likely only ever get 60-70% of these numbers as really good player in real scenarios. Holding cooldowns, waiting for checks, mechs, etc..so many things take  up your time.

neutral neutral hnegative neutral neutral , negator neutral neutral of them neutral hnegative neutral dure neutral neutral when neutral positive hpositive judging neutral their igns runs diminisher neutral positive . negator hnegative neutral sinc we hpositive neutral neutral neutral positive intensifier hnegative with bots and rmt .

I’m afraid I am, not saying all of them are bad but during prime time when it’s obvious judging by their igns runs rarely go smoothly. Can’t blame much since we know why NA West is so rampant with bots and RMT.

I thought that my computer was glitching after I saw 20 white haired sorcerers named after gibberish,  intereacting with Siera. I was so confused and thought the server was being raided by bots, I'm still unsure if they were all actual players and that them all having the same skin was coincidence or that they were actually bots.

neutral neutral , intensifier the raids neutral your neutral neutral to positive positive , hpositive things , ect multistop ? neutral neutral neutral how neutral that neutral neutral negative of characters neutral would neutral neutral for hnegative . neutral neutral negative the negative positive to neutral negative . neutral seems positive neutral neutral positive neutral positive neutral for neutral hnegative neutral , neutral intensifier frustrating if you neutral neutral to neutral with neutral neutral of the neutral .

I see, so the raids are your gold generation to further hone, buy things, ect...?     I can see how doing that on a bunch of characters weekly would be fatiguing for sure. I'm guessing the alternative is to swipe too.     It seems like Lost Ark is a fun game for a casual play, but extremely frustrating if you're trying to stay with or ahead of the curve.

Depends, i had one week someone join a group (last person) saying he can do Prokel to then after G1 was done to say he cant, that he 'misunderstood' jailing everyone.    So if that's the reason I kinda admire the guy for trying to prevent people getting jailed

“ neutral ” mech positive neutral neutral for negative positive neutral among members neutral aoe . intensifier if neutral neutral positive neutral with debuff neutral positive hnegative neutral and neutral neutral negative . you negative hnegative players to negative positive . aka neutral the negative intensifier negator dies

“Soak” mech is a term for damage is split among members in aoe. So if one person is alone with debuff it will inflict heavy and often lethal damage. You want other players to stack together. Aka soak the damage so nobody dies

This is why you should make a mate who's willing to wait for each other. For latest contents, DPS main without static will struggle to get into a group. Support main will struggle for some lower contents that has enough supports. Help him when he needs you, and make him help you when you need him.

I ran a few on my other alts where there were only 1-2 bots in there. They can not do mechanics and most all of them are Reflux sorcs. They are good for like 1, maybe 2 bars of damage before they die just more or less standing still.
