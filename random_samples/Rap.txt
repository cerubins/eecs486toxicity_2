I like alot of these albums, but being influential is a factor in good music, the best pieces of art no matter the medium influence others to make art, whether it be Sargent peppers lonely hearts club band, the college dropout, pet sounds, the rise and fall of ziggy stardust, ready to die, or even some of the albums that are on the image, have all inspired others to make good music, influence is a factor

Look into groups from Rhymesayers Entertainment.Id start with a group/duo called Atmosphere. Listen to song called trying to find a balance to see if you like it. Thats considered indie-rap and his catalog is massive and he still performs even though he came out in 90s.   Or try a group called Blackalicious - blazing arrow album.   Most *popular* rap has been about drugs, women and guns since the 90s, and it doesnt seem likely to changes. Teenagers eat up the misogamy and like to feel tough.

It's a bad take.. Mostly because talent don't lie... There's like 3 white rappers. So when he says "all those 
half decent white rappers" makes it sound like there's a lot. There isn't. The other part is... Do peo
ple bump Em at the club  or at a party... That's not the music he made. His shit was comical or personal... 
So it was up to people to like it or not. I think most did and even if they didn't really fuck with it, they still recognized the skill.
