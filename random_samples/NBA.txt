Exactly. Tanking is smart unless you're a contender or could be soon. That does not apply to 20 teams in the league it doesn't even apply to 16 of them.   Now you can't have half your league tanking but if they really wanted to stop it there's more drastic things they could do.

Once some guys latched onto to the eternal tank narrative it just caught on. Two off seasons after a good trade is really all you need if your general manager is Sam Presti. It‚Äôs been greatly accelerated because of Shai morphing into a top 10 player, but it‚Äôs still mostly damn good management and a good vision
