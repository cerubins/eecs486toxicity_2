FA have already stated they can't give a red card after the fact, only decide the length of a ban when a red  and is given.  Because the ref dealt with it on the pitch and  o card was issued, FA won't just GIVE bruno a ban. Would be a huge issue for football if they could just remove players for what THEY see fit after the incident   Getting a red card and deciding the ban is fine  Giving bans even though the ref decided not to is not OK if you want football to be even remotely enjoyable.

Former referee here.  One of the reasons to get sent off is "violent conduct." The issue of rolling around like you've been shot or connecting with an opponent is irrelevant when a player does something that can be interpreted as "violent conduct." Once a player does something that can be considered "violent conduct" why on earth should such a player remain on the pitch? A referee would be mad to not show a red.

I prefer him despite the fact that he is worse on the ball than Kepa.   The problem with this lineup is, on paper, Havertz and Felix is a good partnership, however in reality, they both play as second strikers. Neither of them are 9s for the other to feed off of. Also, they both struggle with finishing.  So, alternatively the best could be a 4-2-3-1:  GK: Mendy LB: Chilly LCB: Silva RCB: Wes RB: James CDM: Enzo RCM: Kante LCM: Mason RW: Madueke, Ziyech, Sterling? ST: Havertz, Broja, Auba?

Almost like these deluded Kane haters have forgotten that fact.   "bUt No TrOpHiEs", I'm sure he's crying into his WC golden boot, multiple Prem golden boots, and soon to be his top scorer in the Prem record..
