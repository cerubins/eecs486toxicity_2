I believe, and I'm speaking anecdotally as I don't really follow this stuff, that she was not very kind to Megs when Megs came out with the initial accusations against Rated. If so, it's clear why that happened in hindsight.   That said, Lyndi is a victim, and I don't assign her blame. Nevertheless, some relationships might be past the point of salvaging, which is unfortunate.

This doesn't really show how Ramee feels about death threats. Just Ramee being a bit defensive too quick and probably cuts off before he even says anything of meaning

neutral positive that you neutral neutral neutral positive to neutral that the neutral with neutral hpositive neutral intensifier neutral and nopixel neutral positive hnegative , neutral of positive that you hnegative neutral hnegative . that says neutral intensifier . neutral positive neutral negator that they **said** you neutral to neutral with neutral , positive negator neutral him neutral , neutral taht they intensifier arrested him , held him neutral neutral neutral where neutral neutral negator neutral to neutral , and positive started the hnegative neutral of neutral him to the neutral neutral to neutral him neutral neutral neutral neutral , neutral negator neutral him . that positive what neutral neutral hnegative . that positive neutral neutral neutral procedures they neutral neutral to neutral when neutral neutral .

I like that you're immediate reaction is to suggest that the person with far greater IRL and Nopixel knowledge is wrong, instead of thinking that you might be wrong. That says a lot.  It's also not that they **said** you have to come with us, then not telling him why, its taht they literally arrested him, held him in a vehicle where he was not free to leave, and then started the actual journey of taking him to the police station to send him on his 72 hour hold, ALL without telling him. That's what made it unlawful. That's why police have procedures they are supposed to follow when arresting someone.
