As far as the piano sonata cycles of the 20th century, Prokofiev is the best. The third is the most popular,  but the greatest are the War Sonatas, # 6-8. The finale of the seventh Sonata is perhaps the most insane keyboard finale ever.  Prokofiev also wrote many other piano pieces both charming and intense.  In the latter category, check out his Toccata or Suggestion Diabolique.

I attended a performance of Mahler 5 last night from a balcony seat.  I don't mind people moving, head bopping a bit, quiet toe or finger tapping, etc., but what did bother me?  The guy in the seat ahead of me inexplicably leaned all the way forward in his seat at the beginning of the piece (for a decent section of the first movement) and then again in the final movement.  What I'm sure he didn't understand is that messes up the sightlines for whoever is behind him--the seats are configured so that from the balcony and mezzanine, most seats in the centre and centre side areas have unimpeded views of the entire stage \*if\* everyone sits normally in their seats.  He completely blocked the conductor and the first couple of chairs of the strings on the left-hand side (violins and cellos.) I'm not really sure what exactly he thought he could see \*better\* by leaning forward a foot or two.  Luckily the seat on my right was empty so I was able to lean to the side and crane my head around to see.

Based on my experience as a college student and from working with professionals, I am certain that professionals mess up all the time but they are very good at hiding it. Even if you knew the piece they were playing super well, you would only notice a mistake if you were watching one musician closely the entire time they were performing. Of course, there are some occasions when performers make more obvious mistakes, but professional musicians usually have to work so hard to earn their positions that this rarely happens.

Whenever he gave instructions during rehearsals, he would randomly bounce from language to language - English, Portuguese, German, Italian, maybe others, plus lots of grunting and literally pounding his own chest with his fist.

I'm reminded of a college professor & conductor I studied under many years ago. I don't see/hear his name mentioned much these days, but he was a bit of a big deal in choral music back in the day, having been the go-to guy for preparing choirs for performances under the likes of Bernstein, Muti, Mehta, etc.  Anyway, one thing he was known for was that, whether conducting or as part of an audience, he would breathe very loudly and dramatically with the music; shuffle his feet with the rhythm (usually quite loudly; legend has it that he's the reason most conductors' podiums in the NY/NJ/PA region were carpeted); and sometimes sway in what I can only describe as a manner more apt to an extremely Victorian case of "the vapors" than to a concert attendee.  He was one of the most musically knowledgeable people I ever met, and IMO an absolutely brilliant choral conductor...but everyone I knew absolutely *hated* listening to music if he was in the room!

 I think Williams is at least the equal of Holst as a composer.  He certainly has a much greater stylistic range, and in my opinion, is the best orchestrator since Ravel.  Spielberg himself has said how important Johnny's scores are for the success of his films.  Without Williams, at a minimum _Jaws_, _Close Encounters of the Third Kind_, _Star Wars etc_, and _ET_ wouldn't be anywhere near the success they were.  Compare to any other film composer today.

I just posted this in another thread as ad. I think it applies to you, too...  I'm not going to respond with "pieces that sound similar to what you already like." I'm going to approach it from your Michael Jackson example.  In pop(ular) music, we tend to see similar styles from an individual.  I.E., a slow Jimmy Buffet song and a fast Jimmy Buffet song still sound like Jimmy Buffet. It's done by genre (country, pop, rock, metal) and also by ERA. That's actually more important,  IMO. An 80s country song has more in common with an 80s rock song than it does with a 30s country song.  Classical is similar. If you like Beethoven Symphony #5, you'll probably like #3 as well. But you'll ALSO find contemporaries of Beethoven that you like. And some you don't. This gets more important the closer to modern times you get - music changed MUCH more between 1900-1950 than it did between 1700-1750.  What I'm saying is, search both ways. Look for composers who were writing when your favorites were. And look for similar pieces (symphonies, tone poems, etc) that you like, but by other composers from the same, and from  different time periods. You'll find things you like and things you don't. Lather, rinse, repeat with the ones you like. Soon you'll have thousands of favorite pieces!

They're quite different things in literally almost everything.  Anyway, I do like the adagio from The Limpid Stream (that greatly resembles Tchaikovsky's own adagi for his ballets) and the music for the comic Pas de Deux with a crossdressing "willis", and find the Bolshoi staging for that show quite fun, but the whole of it is... along with The Golden Age (the real deal), just kind of unremarkable. It felt like very disjointed, often rambunctious music with no apparent structure that Shostakovich was not really into, something you can't say about the most popular late XIXth and early XXth century ballets. Think of his Suite for Variety Orchestra, but stretched over two hours.

You need to hire a seasoned piano technician, not people who just like pianos, but do not understand their innards. New pianos will often be using synthetic parts. Some are tested, some less so. Some are still in the experimental stage, some will be a great asset, some not. Also what you want in a piano sound needs to be more formalized. Most people will play a piano say, yes I like that one, and never delve deeper.  I bet you can purchase a new custom piano for nearly the same as the off the factory floor, but with your likes built in.  In some ways we are talking about the same ephemeral notions that one uses for buying a car.  But the piano world is not as big and a custom piano will often require very little change from the stock model. I bet most will have to do with the scaling of the string wire, how hard the felt hammers are, and a few other tweaks to the key touch.  All should be able to to be altered to make the best from the room you want the piano to live.  And yes that room can make or break the sound of a piano. Put a mediocre piano in a live and reflective large room, and it will sound far better than the best name brand piano in carpeted closet.

The reason it seems “flawless” is because we just get very good at moving on and not letting a flub derail us. Mistakes happen ALL THE TIME. Sure each individual might only make one in a concert, but there are 100 of us on stage.   Giant disasters are uncommon, but can happen. In my youth I went to see the Pittsburgh Symphony and the concertmaster completely zoned out and missed his entrance for a solo by several measures. The conductor had to basically snap fingers in his face.   The new principal flute of the Berlin Phil won the Nielsen Competition a few years ago with a performance of the Nielsen Concerto that was filled with mistakes (wrong notes, missed entrances, etc.), but his performance was so filled with life that he still won the whole damned thing.  I can almost guarantee that you have never heard a flawless performance. I know I never have. But the flaws just aren’t important or worth remembering.

It just depends on cultures and people. Where I come from people don’t move about but they applaud skillful improvisations as soon as the improvisation is finished unless the musician makes a hand gesture asking them not to, usually when they want the audience to hear the ending in particular.

>Arnold  Glad to see someone mention Arnold. His name doesn't come up so often here.  He's probably usually dismissed because of the large number of "light music" works and film scores that he wrote, but the symphonies are very underrated and, in my opinion, form the best part of his output.  The Fifth is probably the finest (and such a great climax at 30:13):  https://youtu.be/21ci-mSDAtY  Relatedly, I found out a few days ago that the wife of a very good friend of mine has a walking buddy (they literally go for walks together) who is the niece of Arnold.

>who's visibly not paying attention to the show  I recently sat in a Rachmaninoff concert, and there was a father-child pair next to me. Seemed like the dad was trying to get his daughter (about 9-10) into classical music, but like most kid, she just didn't like it very much.  She slouched in her seat, tapped her feet, made noise by scratching her sequinned dress, yawned, shuffled through the programme ... while the dad coughed every 30 seconds and was on his phone **at max brightness** for most of the concert even though the attendant already said you need to put your phone away at the start of the concert.  Even though I think he was trying to get his child into classical music, ***he himself didn't even look like he particularly enjoyed it at all***.  Thankfully, they left in the second half after the dad **loudly** asked: "Are you bored?" in the middle of Rhapsody on a Theme by Paganini. So loud that a few people in the front row looked back at him.  It ruined the first half of the concert for me and I was mightily annoyed. Near front row seat so it costs a pretty penny.  I don't mind the kid. She's a kid. But the dad ... there's just literally no excuse. Not only he's visibly not interested in the music, he failed to observe etiquette that's quite literally broadcast over the loudspeakers at the start of the concert.

One of my trumpet collegues messed up his timing during a concert, but he knew what to do to coverer it and also did the same mistake in the repetition. No one could have noticed it and the recording of the concert is also great. If I didn't know that this was not on purpose, I wouldn't notice.

Treating classical music as a religious experience is a thing that started in the mid 19th century, before that it was everything but. Since it has become a very expensive thing with mostly a century old repertoire, the tradition has remained, in big part because every concert can be a one time experience for a lot of people.  I can't keep still, though I do keep quiet. It's part of how I keep engaged and concentrate on the music. Some people don't need to move, others do. It's like morning or night people, where morning people won and now the world scoffs at late sleepers. Just keep it limited.  I'd still love a string quartet in a bar, where I can enjoy it however I want.  And it's not a silly question, things shouldn't be so imposing and hermetic. It's not like there is a guidebook anyway.

Three Choral Preludes, which I like, are often played at break neck speed, esp when played on the piano.  I think it has much to do with the person who is performing the choral does not know what the text says, or cares about the purpose of the text.

I definitely do not believe in any one orchestra being the best in the world, there are so many variables to consider.  Vienna and Berlin both have had a shitty record up until two decades ago of excluding many great musicians of a particular gender so that's a consideration when considering the best, because you're not including what might be some of the best musicians in the world.  Conductors certainly all have varied tempos they use when conducting a piece with a specific orchestra so there's that to consider, along with how well they mesh with a conductor and yea, that's just the tip of the iceberg.  Just like there is no one pianist or violinist whom I considered to be the best in the world because they all have their warhorses they play best but then might not play other pieces quite to my taste, same deal with orchestras.  When it comes to definitive recordings for orchestral works, I have quite a varied lot of orchestras.
