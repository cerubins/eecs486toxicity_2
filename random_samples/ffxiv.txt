My laid back attitude may also come from playing WoW first, the addons, the dps meter, the constant competing with other people to be the best, I just don't care anymore? I just want to relax on my couch and do some roulettes after work

If you're already at 15-20 runs you're pushing a rather long time in current content, moreso if people fuck up/wipe. I usually stick around 3-5 after my whistle in current content (because my luck is shit anyway so I've usually been there for the long haul) but if it's not the most current (which it never is, I've never even seen a mount drop before increased odds) sticking around longer is easier. In older extremes you can literally do as many runs as needed in no time flat, so sticking around till everyone got one in those is ezclap (even tho I've gone ~15 runs without drop before)

I never used any reshaders because my monitor have some presets I can flip through. And while I don't think it changes any textures or resolutions they do change the looks of games pretty wildly. It may be that it somehow manages to change settings with the graphics card too, because when discussing this with someone else they did the same thing via the desktop app of their card.  I don't know if this isn't something it's common monitors/graphics cards can do? So many seem to say the game looks bland/blurry/washed out and I'm a bit confused why they seem to need to go through so much effort to get such drastic "BEFORE.../AFTER!!!" images. When all I do is poke a button on my monitor a few clicks. I'm not tech-savvy enough to understand it, but my game is vivid and sharp unless I pick a setting that makes it look otherwise.

Zenos reworked in this way would still have a certain playfulness, but as noted, filtered through the lens of "scary-violent gravitas." Karasu acts clownish, rather than intimidating. Someone with a personality like his, raised in a humorless place where crushing, absolute power is how problems are "resolved"? Yeah, I can absolutely see him having a certain playful streak. If nothing matters and violent suppression is how you have been taught power works, violence itself can become something of a game.  So, we'd get someone with substantially reduced affect becauseof how he was raised, a totally cavalier understanding of violence, and a certain mockingly playful attitude. This would infuse the type of theatrical, scenery-chewing performance I seek from simple villains of the type Zenos is written to be.  His boredom would not be sleepy and inactive, but flamboyant. His delight would not be pinpoint-pupil insanity, but something more gleeful or even childlike. Instead of lame pontificating about how empty existence is, he would be wanting to make the scene perfect, hence the displeasure at being revived when the original scene had been perfectly choreographed. Dripping with sarcasm when he speaks of the "hero" etc.  Still obsessed with the WoL. Still a horrible person, cruel and nihilistic and violent. But *filling* the scene with his presence whenever he deigns to appear.

I've looked into that!  One of the things I actually found most helpful is the research done into NDEs and past-life recall? There's been some really fascinating studies. And by past-life recall, I don't mean a bunch of goofballs claiming to be famous. Moreso, studies where children recalled intimate details of past lives that were largely mundane and inconsequential, but verifiable.  It's also actually been kind of comforting to look further into the idea of the cyclic universe; where even when heat death or the Big Chill occurs? There's still a possibility that the universe has another Big Bang due to the universe achieving a state of equilibrium similar to pre-Big Bang conditions.

That's a death by expansion and would cause a cooling not a heating. I think you're saying a double negative in effect.  Big Rip is death by cooling - there'd be no viable motion at all, so yes 'death of heat' but callign it 'heat death' isn't correct, because there IS another concept for the death of the universe that uses 'heat death' colloquially to describe it.  That would be done by the inverse, if the universe contracted to another 'singularity' like what was effectively at The Big Bang, the remaining particles would be packed so tightly that they'd be doing nothing BUT movement causing a superfluidic plasma as the entirety of what's left of reality.

Trigger Warning: miscarriage At the end of 2021 I became severely ill and was hospitalized for nearly two weeks. 
Turned out to be an autoimmune disease and I made it just in time before any irreversible damage happened 
to my own body. But I was pregnant and lost my baby at 13 weeks. Needless to say, I was in a horrible headspace. In a way, it was oddly therapeutic to play through the Endwalker story. Not everyone got a clean happy ending. But the overall message of fighting through the difficulties and still managing to find hope was definitely something I needed. I don’t enjoy watching people suffer, but it was nice to see a story where the characters struggled to see the positives in difficult times and helped me realize I was allowed to be upset by what happened and that we deserve time to grieve our circumstances. It also pushed me to rely on my friends and family (especially my husband who was very supportive but was also going through a difficult time ). I think that’s the hardest part about any mental health emergency, whether clinical or otherwise. Your mind tells you that you have to get over it, or go it alone. And that’s the most dangerous part. It was nice to see the Warrior of Light need help from their loved ones, especially because your character seems so larger than life. If even this superhero needs to rely on someone, then why can’t I? Hope that makes sense. Doing a lot better and I just recently delivered a healthy little one. But I definitely recommend anyone who has experienced a loss to have someone go through the story ahead a bit as there were some parts that I had to skip to keep from getting into a bad mindset again at the time (namely Thavnair and Ultima Thule).

Not really the reason most people use it, but if you don’t have the space in your retainers or your armory chest, no reason why not until you don’t need it anymore.   Personally I leveled everything that would use something at the same time to save on space, but I also have no life.

If you actively do want to keep playing, level some other class.  Especially if it's completely different from what you've been playing.  Personally, leveling healers was the most draining of all others for me.  But otherwise while you're still feeling the hurt, it's better to take a break.  You don't want to associate ALL the experiences of the game with one person that's gone.  That's how I lost interest in all my previous hobbies.

I will be disappointed if we don't get Goblin Punch from the Hobgoblins in Kholusia. I know they don't have a skill by that name, but dammit, we already missed out from Alexander and Brayflox Hard.  Matoya's Relict could have something from any number of bosses, like the geysers or mudballs. I expect we'll get something from at least one of the dungeon Lightwardens, too – my bet's on Storge's AoEs. The Toad or Imp transformation skills from Dohn Mheg feel made for BLU.  I expect some truly *bizarre* spells from the Weapon trials, like either the magnetized bombs or the cross-shaped sword attacks from Emerald. Titania could give some neat Rune skills. The Primal Redux bosses from Eden... I can't even imagine.  Letting us copy Limit Break from SoS *sounds* plausible on paper... until you realize all the LBs he uses are DPS options. He never uses a tank or healer LB, so Aetherial Mimickry wouldn't work. Plus the only caster LB he has is Black Mage's LB3, and they *probably* won't let us copy that.
