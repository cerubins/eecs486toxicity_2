I would crown Hodor as king because his simple mind would create a limited government that would allow more autonomy between the 7 kingdoms. Sam can be his homosexual king consort because he’s well educated as a maester and being the head of house Tarley in the Reach after his father and brother died, and the Tyrells would be one of the more powerful houses. Sam is also friends with the Starks so that would cement an alliance with the north as well as the vale and the river lands. The Dornish have no beef with either of them and Tyrion really doesn’t give a fuck anymore since the rock is broke. Gendry’s lover is also a stark so there you go full unity right there.

I compared Daeron and Jacaerys in terms of what they did actually bearing some fruit. Compared to Aemond, who spent most of the war burning the riverlands, and ensuring that they absolutely hated the greens, or Aegon who was at one battle and basically disappeared from his own war. Rhaenyra similarly helped with one thing, taking King’s Landing and then does basically nothing.

It felt like a foolish move both politically and personally.  She was a rare individual in Westeros. She ranks at the very, very top of the social hierarchy. She can personally control the modern equivalent of an F-22 Raptor. A big check in the “might” column. She could take out the entire king’s guard without breaking a sweat. She is one of the most powerful people in Westeros, if not all of Planetos.   And she was one of the precious few people in the royal and noble classes that had the freedom to choose her own spouse. The first time, she chose not to choose for herself. The second time, she chose her violent, universally unpopular uncle who did some pervie things to her when she was young. Perhaps they will give us more insight into why she made that decision in the next season.

I actually disagree.  Jon Snow is a liar. In S8 he lies, multiple times, that he was given an ultimatum by Daenerys - either he bends the knee, or the North faces the Others alone... which effectively dooms the entire continent since the army of the dead would snowball after genociding the entire North, war-torn Riverlands that couldn't mount a proper defense as well, and likely the Vale since their army would perish North.  Dude outright doesn't admit he knelt of his own free will and for virtually no political gain, letting Dany take the North's anger and resentment since they reasonably view the matter as her blackmailing them and holding the fate of entire continent hostage instead of him being a dumb cunt.  He's such a lying craven asshole, it's absurd. A hypocrite as well, after refusing to lie to *Cersei Lannister* a season before.

I mean it would be the second time a Targaryen king denies a relative of Corlys the throne against his expectation. First his wife and Laenor now his grandson by Laena. The first time he almost went to war over it, so you would expect him to not put up with this a second time. Then again show Corlys is also an extremely tolerant outlier in that he is just fine with Rhaenyra passing of her bastards as Velaryons wich is arguably even more insulting than not naming his grandson heir to the throne.

I absolutely loved him in the beginning.  Like he's a terrible person but he definitely is the falvour up to like episode 5 then he's just annoying to me personally. In hindsight he's not very likable in the beginning either though I would've liked them to go the 'Daemon likes Rhaenyra because Viserys' route as it would've made him look a little less like a man child in the beginning.   Also morally grey character?  With all the cut scenes *maybe* but if you solely watch the series he's just a murderer with a Targaryen supremacy complex.  He's doing it for his fam? The daughters he neglects and the queen he straight up ignores/abuses?  If anything he looks like he's doing it for the power.   What I don't like is how it's usually his stans that will excuse *anything* like you're allowed to like a character and still have a moment of "wow that was bad" when he kills someone with a rock or like...grooms his niece idk.  Also they're usually the ones coming after others who are tryna stan in peace so yeah I feel like his fan base really put me off him.

Jon Snow. The best leaders are the ones who actually don’t want to lead. They don’t hunger for power. People who want to be leaders usually just want power and are selfish.

That’s an interesting take, I hadn’t thought of it like that! It’s also super ironic that Viserys was so obsessed with being a dreamer himself and yet when his daughter actually was one he was too self involved to even notice.

They are probably planning to make a new post for every dragon every day so 28 posts over 28 days. Going to be real annoying.

Suppose Daemon was confronted with this newly founded oligarchy that has watered down the Iron Throne's power, how would he go about taking power back from the Green Dragon riders who now have seats in the hypothetical dragon council, and from all the lords from across the realm who've now got a stake in central government?

Well we've already got two leaked auditions and I imagine most people are 
warned off the Instagram following method nowadays. There's only so much that 
can leak before filming starts (which is in less than a week now) and 
then we'll hopefully get all sorts of good shit to keep us fed for the months to come.

Daemon describes Otto in rather interesting an accurate way. True. And he is being honest when he says Viserys is weak and other lords preys upon house of the dragon through him. Its that no one  was ever care enough about him or bold enough to point out Viserys faults. And he push away the only one who will ever do so. Ironically enough its Viserys who always surround himself with lickspittles and later a whore.

I wonder what route they'll go down with for Maelor's death. There's certainly place to make that insanely shocking and gruesome !! I honestly hope they do, part of the reason this story is so shocking and good is the large amount of horrific loss of innocent (infant) life.

I expect the dragon and rider being apart for so long will allow someone else to bond with the dragon. It’s a simple enough thing for the show runners to hint to at some point.
