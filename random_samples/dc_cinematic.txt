Snyderverse being rebooted soon, people don't have to watch this to keep up with anything since it's getting cancelled anyway   The only motive left to watch it is if the movie is actually good, but it's got poor reviews all over. Even worse, superhero movie fatigue is real, people have less patience for these

This just seems like a disingenuous criticism of MoS because we as the viewers know his “god fight” isn’t prioritized over the destruction of the city. We clearly hear Zod say he’s going to kill every single person on earth unless Superman stops him. He can’t just say “alright well give me an hour or so to do some damage control and then we’ll have our fight.” He has to stop Zod immediately or more people are dying.   Now I could totally understand people in universe thinking Superman is prioritizing this fight over saving lives, and that’s exactly what plays out in BvS.

I think the problem is that, on a fundamental script level, they didn't tie in character and plot, and with Shazam's light jokey tone, a 160 minute film would be tormenting (*cough* Wonder Woman 1984 *cough*). They could either cut a lot of the jokes, which would leave the film without much of a tone at all (It's not like there's a bunch of serious drama to replace it with, not to mention that some of the jokes are actually plot-relevant stuff that can't be cut), they could cut some of the plot which would create a cluttered mess, or they could cut the character moments.  The fact that those things are all separate enough to even be in that kind of situation is a failure on the script level. To take from Nolan's handbook, every scene needs to have 3 reasons to stay in the film. Looking at these scenes, they only have 1 or 2 reasons each. So it makes sense to cut them. The fact that such important character scenes still don't reach that threshold is a problem on the script level. Not the editing level, the script level.

It's that bad), did actually try to be about its main lead (Whereas Natasha felt like a sidekick in her own movie), and at least Shang-Chi's over-the-top bland CG BS is intentionally meant to be fantasy stuff while Black Widow, which is trying to be a gritty spy thriller, has an ending that I swear is ripped from Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children with how anime BS it is.  There's also the fact that BW had so much more hype and potential. Natasha finally getting her own movie is obviously gonna be held to a higher standard than "Oh they made a movie about Marvel's other martial arts master".

Spider-Man Homecoming had to contend with the fact that it was the third version of Spider-Man in a decade, with the previous films suffering from ever deminishing returns. It achieved it's goal of establishing public goodwill for the new incarnation whilst being a finacial success, and was able to use that goodwill to reach over a billion dollars for the sequel.  BvS was intended as DC's answer to the Avengers, in terms of expected box office returns and audience reception, that's why it got sutch a huge budget compared to Spider-man.

My personal theory right now is Waller gains knowledge of the coming reset during the events of the Flash and her show will be about creating a ‘life raft’ to save herself and some of her assets. It explains how Peacemaker and Margot Harley Quinn can make the jump but few if any heroes will. They tried to get Shazam already but he wasn’t really interested. They get to beat Marvel to the punch if that’s where they plan to take the Multiverse saga/Battleworld and season 2 Peacemaker can be about him adjusting to the new universe to help the viewer understand.

neutral positive neutral diminisher things neutral liked neutral neutral neutral neutral neutral positive neutral neutral intensifier hnegative . the neutral neutral the neutral positive intensifier positive than the neutral itself .

There were a few things I liked about it but overall I thought it was pretty bad. The drama surrounding the movie is 100% more interesting than the movie itself.

hnegative neutral neutral neutral neutral neutral neutral the neutral awakens . neutral neutral aquaman / hpositive neutral neutral with mamoa / gadot positive neutral positive hpositive neutral neutral sinc anyon neutral cavill neutral neutral ( neutral of neutral hnegative neutral neutral neutral negator neutral positive ) and that positive ignoring that neutral *new* neutral positive neutral positive positive introduced neutral positive negative .

Rogue One came out a year after The Force Awakens.   Any future Aquaman/Wonder Woman movie with Mamoa/Gadot will have been roughly a decade since anyone saw Cavill as Superman (outside of a cameo in a movie no one watched)  And that’s ignoring that a *new* Superman will have already been introduced by then too.

Might as well not even do it. That’s the longest pause between seasons of any show ever. People are gonna completely forget about peacemaker once the new dcu movies are rolling out. James Gunns nepotism is so fucking annoying too. Keeping some and firing others. Just reboot everything and everyone
