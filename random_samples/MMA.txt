It was Nunes, Jamahal, Islam (yeah right), Moreno, or weili.   I think the UFC dropped the ball not putting weili as the main event if they wanted a female fight. Huuuuge Asian population in Vancouver, would have drawn huge crowds. Still a chance for a really good co main though

Bo is one of the greatest wrestlers to ever compete in the UFC. For basically his entire life, he's been one of the best, if not the best wrestler in the country at his age group. Not only that, but he's been competiting at a high level at BJJ comps for a few years now. To act like he's a typical 4-0 MMA fighter is ridiculous.  I'm not saying he should be fighting for the belt, or even face a ranked fighter. But there's a middle ground here. Unfortunately the UFC won't do that since 95% of their fans are brain dead, and they  get away with letting him fight cans

You do understand that you are, in the same breath, saying you can't take head-to-head matchups into account, while discrediting the opponents they both fought, right? I mean, the simple fact you are claiming the division has only two elite fighters while a third one is the current champion with a 3-0 record against one of them in different sports should be enough to show how delusional you are being. You are essentially claiming nothing real matters, only your subjective view on Whittaker's skill, which is an insanely deranged argument lmao  Prime Dos Anjos gets knocked out by Adesanya, and I say this as an RDA fan lol He never had the tools to deal with a fighter like Adesanya.  \>not because he's so good that he actively takes it away, but because he's huge and lanky and better at one specific range that makes those advantages matter a lot more  He literally takes it away, but not because he's good, apparently you think he just takes it away because he was blessed by god lmao
