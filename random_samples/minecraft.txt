What I would personally do is just slowly mine towards it, and hope there is no shrieker nearby, if there is you do have a few triggers of it before a warden spawns. I would suggest trying to keep a fairly tight cap on your ceiling, make it 2 blocks tall max(prevents a warden from running after you). If you spawn a warden run back thru your tunnel like 30-50 blocks, just far enough to be very safe, while close enough that it's able to DeShawn on its own. And bring some wool too

Well, I do know that new stuff usually doesn't spawn in chunks you've explored (I learned this the hard way when the update for the swamps came out) and I had to go 5500+ chunks to find a new swamp biome layout and get mangrove trees. I'm not sure if it will spawn in torch flowers or sniffers though since they aren't a biome. However I can assume cherry blossom biomes won't spawn in chunks you've already explored.  Edit to add: I think it comes out in June or July. I've been a bit bad on keeping up with it.

Yes. There's not too many enchantments a fishing rod can have (relative to other gear) and it's pretty common getting an enchanted one in general. I had like three better rods than that before I fished up a name tag I needed.

Step 1: Place lava. Wait for it to travel down to the level you desire.  Step 2: Scoop lava back into the bucket.  Step 3: Quickly place water.  TLDR: You don't. keep the lava stream. It turns to cobble. But you can keep the original bucket and reuse it infinitely.

One block in the nether is 8 blocks in the overworld. To properly link up portals take the coordinates of the portal in the overworld and devide them by 8. That is where you need to build a portal in the nether to properly link them up. I'm pretty sure there are tutorials on YouTube that can explain it better than me though.

You just found a huge vein of copper, keep mining the granite, which is the pinkish reddish block, and you should find a good load of copper. The block you're asking about is a raw copper block, just place it into your crafting and you'll get 9 raw copper back to smelt

if the neutral neutral negative positive adding neutral neutral positive the neutral would neutral prompting them to neutral the neutral neutral neutral allowed into the neutral .

If the mod in question is adding a mob then the game would be prompting them to install the mod before being allowed into the server.
