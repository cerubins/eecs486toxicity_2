I think it's just meant to be a fun weapon. Exotic doesn't always mean good. In a lot of cases they're fringe weapons that cater to a niche. A good number of recent seasonal weapons are like this as well. The Manticore is worse than any of the big three legendary SMGs, but it has a neat gimmick. Delicate Tomb is outclassed by a good number of things, though it has some practical use if you're playing Arc. Collective Obligation is maximized by playing with people going all in on Void, even if there are plenty of other options that simply outclass it.  I mean, they can't make everything better as eventually power creep would be even more insane than it currently is.

I think this expansion has been a lot of fun. My friends and I have been enjoying ourselves. Even when we were struggling through legend avalon the very first time we did it or figuring out master raid challenges.  Strand is neat. There are some very solid new weapons to get, many of them craftable. The raid exotic is really fun. The strand exotics are pretty neat. They made some changes so LMGs are great, heavy GLs are great, rockets are good. The upcoming primary buffs will be awesome because as much as I love SMGs I would like some variety in my primary slot. The builds are strong as ever. I was worried with wells going away they would really cut up some of my builds but now its just orbs instead. Add in those artifact mods for orbs and they rain down, keep my lmg constantly throwing volatile rounds and loaded with ammo. People keep saying "but my power fantasy" and I'm so confused? I still feel stronger than ever while finally actually needing to utilize that power to take on content instead of just running through everything without much effort.   The story was mediocre but thats such a tiny part of this game its whatever.  Every other expansion story usually is pretty meh. Im excited for the next year and what they have planned and I sure hope they dont turn the game back to super easy mode because it gets boring real fast. Anything below master is perfectly obtainable by most anyone if they are willing to set their character up right and learn how to use it, use gear that is good in the current sand box, and put up a little effort.  If you dont want to have to do that then I would avoid things labeled "Legend" "Master" "Nightfall" etc. None of those things sound like they are intended to be chill easy activites.

I don’t recall keeping 1 piece after hours of farming. I’m still wearing all the armor I farmed when it came out. All armor currently in the game is instant dismantle or infusion material. The season of risen focusing was also fantastic. Now, it all sucks. Just trash rolls.

Apparently the time where I'm unable to fire is just the window for the actual weapon reload animation. I probably never noticed it because a lot of the weapons I used to use in PvP were rapid fire frames or have alloy mag which have shorter reload times on low ammo. I've been using a lot of weapons with slower reloads recently and that's probably why I notice it more. Feels weird that something that's existed for a long time in shooters is intentionally prevented, but oh well. Now I know at least.

Tip for that fight: Don't chase him, but stay ahead of him after the first teleport. **And let Witherhoard tick for virtually free damage**. You may want Healing Grenade, or Invis, you do you.

I haven’t read the entire post yet but I do want to make note of the fact that this bow seems to be a lot more useful on Shadebinder than Revenant or Behemoth due to the latter two’s significantly easier time accessing stasis crystals (Behemoth’s entire kit, Touch of Winter for Revenant). The stasis crystals it provides are important in Shadebinder’s case right now because of the fragment that significantly boosts grenade regeneration after breaking a stasis crystal, something that’s especially important for Shadebinder due to most builds revolving around having Bleakwatchers up as much as possible, something that is made infinitely easier with this fragment, and especially with this bow due to its ability to farm up on-demand stasis crystals

The more you play the more loot you'll get and the more you'll improve and therefore be able to earn loot/rep faster over time (primarily because wins give you more rep).   Second, there is no longer any Freelance queue for Trials, there's only the one queue. It now has lobby balancing, so that if you queue in solo, you're far more likely to play against other solos, or against a 2-stack while you're paired with a 2 stack. The chances of you matching against a 3 stack while running solo are practically zero. I've played a ton of Trials this season, mostly solo, and have yet to face a 3 stack unless I am in a 3 stack myself.

The shotgun, lmg, and smg are on a daily rotation. They are guaranteed from the key chest. The smaller chests can drop any of the those three weapons on any day I believe.  For the other weapons such as the hand cannon, they are gotten from Nimbus, gold patrol bounties, and the end of the campaign quest line.

for general crucible thats there all the time i would agree with you (as thats a big part of the reason to why bungie *already* nerfed ability regen especially in pvp)  but for a time limited game mode? No, Eruption is by far my favorite IB mode rn. its also not like you have the increase ability regen all the time, its a *reward* for streaking kills without dying, while the exploding is there so that you **cant** just wait till your abilitys and super are up but that you actually have to be on the move and have to kills stuff with your guns too  i understand that having eruption and mayhem in the same week is a bit unlucky, but its not like crucible is all the time like this

Prometheus is better than you think. Being able to scorch without needing a kill is excellent for the synergy it provides with several solar fragments. (Damaging scorched targets recharges class ability and killing scorched targets recharges melee)   Try it on bonk hammer titan with radiant and solar surges, it's actually really strong.
