C2S6 was pretty bland and some of the things like crafting didn‚Äôt stick.  C2S8 wasn‚Äôt that terrible in hindsight but as someone who likes challenges, the system was terrible. It didn‚Äôt help that by the time they made all the quests worth more XP I had completed all of them.   C3S4 It‚Äôs like they took all the cool interesting parts of C2S8 and rehashed them but way worse. Chrome made everything it touch ugly and less fun to play in. I did enjoy all the floating poi‚Äôs but they never amounted to anything.  C2SX I think it was hated a lot when it came out but people like it more now. I personally still hate it with a passion and it is easily the worst to me, other than the event and battle pass which doesn‚Äôt make up for how bad it was.
