Patient and calculated possession is the future of football. The fact that he has a Championship side playing Pep ball is very impressive. But not only that, the players he brought in were identified to play that type of football well, like Ian Maatsen. Tells me he can successfully implement his style of football as well and identify players that will excel under his system.  I think it's hard to learn and adapt to the new, and to implement complex tactics especially with championship level players. I'm not saying Dyche is necessarily a bad manager, it's just easier to implement cross and inshallah, brexit ball, hard nose defending style of football than be able to explain and coach more complicated tactics.   Wtf do I know though, I'm just a commenter on reddit.

I think you're overestimating the impact of parachute payments - it took Villa three bites at the cherry to come back up.  If Bruce had clung on for another couple of weeks you would've need a fourth go.  Look at the clubs you listed - with the exception of Preston they all went down in the past 10 years and had extended stints in the Championship - Blackburn and the Mackems even spent time in League One.  Do they help? You betchya - but they aren't some cheat code that leads to an automatic bounce back, and as Sunderland showed if you don't spend them wisely it can go south verrrrrrry quickly.

You raise some good points, maybe it isnt fair to judge him based on the world cup. However Brazil arguably had the best team in the world cup stacked from top to bottom and he struggled to make an impact and Messi and Ronaldos teams were never as good as Brazils current team(at least on paper)  Idk if its fair to say barca wouldnt have won 3 in a row considering madrid beat barca pretty comfortably because Barcas 4 most important players were injured and we had to play a disgustingly bad midfield containing busquets and roberto with alonso in CB. And even then the first half barca was arguably the better team, second half was a different story though

I'm in no way an expert so could be wrong but from what I've seen this season arteta is just a little bit more direct on attack then pep has been. Pep loves to cycle the ball and have another go and while arteta does this too I feel that he always has the goal a little higher up his priority list. I think that peps caution prioritizes possession overall while arteta is pushing for chances. It's a nuanced difference but I think that peps absolute focus on possession comes from vast experience. He wants to avoid the painful games where the team dominates but ends up losing on the counter or through individual brilliance of an opposing player. As a result though he gets some games where play is cycled too much and no significant progress is made in the final third. I think that artetas system promotes beautiful and formidable football, but I wonder if it can withstand long-term pressure from the rest of the prem. I'm excited to find out

I wonder how much of that is a rumor spread by an agent or whether Camavinga was like Tchouameni and actually preferred Real Madrid.  30m seemed like a steal even for PSG at the time. I just can't believe PSG wasn't willing to at least match it.  I guess I can't complain since that transfer window was still a pretty good one for us, especially with the gap in transition from Leonardo to Campos. Though, whoever made the decision to become a retirement home and take on salaries of aging Messi, Ramos, and Gini over prioritizing a promising young player who was terrorizing us since he was 16 should definitely lose their job.
