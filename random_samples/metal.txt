As for other bands, I got really into Lordian Guard the other day, epic heavy metal with some symphonic undertones. The melodies are second to none.

Decrepit Birth, Krisiun, Vader last night, fuckin awesome. Bill sounded great and hopped in the pit at one point. Talked with him a fair bit after their set, he's a cool guy.  Krisiun was crushing and fast as usual. Covered Ace of Spades, fun AF moment there. Much tighter live compared to some of their old albums.  Vader sounds great, wild to think Piotr's been doing this for 40 years. Really enjoyed their setlist too, lots of songs off their debut and revelations along with the classics like Wings, Sothis, Carnal, etc. Played like 20 songs too I was pleasantly surprised with the length of their set. All the bands seemed to be enjoying the smaller venue too. Neck and body are sore today at work thats for sure hahaha

I'm not really familiar with them, but they were giving a good performance and people seemed to be into it.  I was really there (as I missed Creeping Death) to see Municipal Waste, and they were awesome. Live shows are obviously a huge strength for them. I'm a fan for life now.  I caught a couple Carcass songs and then took off. Again, I'm not very familiar, but people seemed to be enjoying it.

Are you looking for thrash in general because I just made a [massive thrash post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/comments/12chzlc/comment/jf7d8gv/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) in the Wednesday thread. I have been on a massive thrash journey lately myself and all the links there will definitely help you.   Since you are already a fan of Toxic Holocaust, I can tell you where to start. I too am a big fan of the family of bands that are inspired by Venom. I can recommend, assuming you have not heard of any of them already, Hellripper, Midnight, Abigail, Sabbat (Japan). You might also enjoy Manzer.   Other newer thrash bands you might have missed: Antichrist, Division Speed, Condor, Deathhammer, Ripper.  There is a ton of older stuff in the top genre list and the essentials page that people should absolutely not miss. My favorites from those places are Coroner, Demolition Hammer, early Sepultura, and Razor.  Other favorites I have are early Death Angel and Mekong Delta.
