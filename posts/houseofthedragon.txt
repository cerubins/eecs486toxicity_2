Doesn't the fact that Rhaenyra needed Viserys to defend her on his deathbed show she royally screwed up? If you need a walking corpse to atone for the consequences of your actions, then you reaaally messed up
Do you think Daemon thought there was a connection between his father's death and Otto?
You only have 15 extra minutes to tack on to the season. What scenes would you add to give the black kids more depth?

If only Otto had allowed Daemon to remain as heir for a few more years, he would've had an easier time placing Aegon on the throne.
Understanding ‚ÄúFire and Blood‚Äù the book vs ‚ÄúHOTD‚Äùthe show. I hope this clarifies some of the confusion I saw some fans having.
If viserys had married laena velaryon instead and kept rhaenyra as his heir do you think the dance would have still happened?
What's the hype with Daeron?
If Alicent told Rhaenyra about Visery's talking about Aegon's dream, and Rhaenyra explained what 'that' actually was, would Alicent submit the crown to Rhaenyra?

How are they going to fix this?
I can't believe there was a time when people were questioning if Emma could pull it off. I think Emma's Rhaenyra is the definition of how a Targaryen queen should look like.

What do you think
Show Rhaenyra Feels a Lot Like...
Okay, so now i'm presenting you two actors who could REALLY play the Conqueror.(Because of their age, they're not in their 40's) Aaron Taylor-Johnson(32) and Sam Claflin(36) Watch Bullet Train and Peaky Blinders, they both have incredible charisma for the role. And both are british. It's important.
