Who is TSM's academy mid?
Doxa but not LCS ready yet. Its literally dooming his career to put him in.  Also I dont think hes in the US?
>This one rewards constant fighting which removes one of the biggest weaknesses of infinite stacking mechanics: Needing to spend time away from the team to slowly farm up and the need to focus on specific targets  Someone tell Veigar/Senna/Thresh mains to stop fighting then lmao
MAN KT SUCK. KT DON'T LOOK GOOD AT ALL. I DO NOT WANT A TELECOM WAR FINAL. ABSOLUTELY DO NOT WANT THEM GOING TO MSI. NOPE. NO SIR.
Kiin
Man KT really made T1 believe that they are worse than HLE
TOP fucking GAP   Difference between top 2 all pro and the rest of the tops is a fucking canyon damn.
THE BIGGUS DICKUS DADDY  Also top diff man
Doran is so bad
Imagine losing on blue side lmao.
AIMING YOU ARE SO FUCKING LUCKY
Kiin is just that fucking guy
Bdd so good.
BIG DICK DADDY CAME TO PLAY  also wtf was that Doran sure let's NOT build armor pen into the tank????
THIS IS JUST TOP GAP.  WTF IS DORAN DOING LOSING TO SION LOL
BIG DICK DADDY
Kiin is on another level right now, solo kill as Sion against Jayce early in lane, and BDD's teamfights were so clean
Was KT taking T1 to 5 games a sign that they were always the 2nd best LCK team...?
Get this bum Doran off the team he's been playing like shit all playoffs.
surely focusing on the Sion every fight will work... KT played so well in teamfights they used their mobility super well
KT ARE STILL GOING TO LOSE IM 1000% SURE
Kiin playing tank is so damn scary and also why Bdd playing like S3 Faker? Wtf
some takeaways:  doran still playing shit, or kiin is just running it. and this wasnt even kiin jayce...  what this game emphasized is that geng's main weakness: gimped out peyz and it will be SO MUCH easier. ban zeri or OP scaling characters and the game will just be against chovy.  delight is more or less dependent on peyz. if peyz is behind, delight is more or less invincible. not really bad but not much of a help either.  peanut is 50 50.  and if chovy isnt using a dmg dealer its just gg from beginning to end.  macro is just insane for KT. and their champ pics are not "one or two goals" type of plays. its usually adapting and has a lot of safety nets when shit comes to worst.  honestly, geng's win chances depend on KT playing shit (some questionable solo picks against KT), initiation mistakes on mid to late team fights from KT, and BDD.  EDIT: also if lehends wins all of this, oh boy. thats going to be a big slap in the face for GENG
doran just stick to sion bro
THANK BROTHER DORAN
STOP USING YOUR CDS ON SION WHY  I DONT UNDERSTAND
BDD IN THAT LAST TEAM FIGHT R U KIDDING ME????
Kick Doran.  Also Delight isn't much better, dude doesn't know how to play TK.
When is GENG gonna bench Doran? We'll never know. LOL
Doran is just not human. Put him on Ornn and give Chovy a carry and you maybe have a very small chance to not get 3-0d
Aiming lmao man. You gotta play safer
watching bdd play so well after running it down for half the split, WTF
Kiin soaked the damage but Bdd's Ahri was so good
So...Marin just left TL right
What an incredibly fun game. That teamfight at 25 minutes, which KT won and then followed up by getting a Baron and soul point... that was beautiful to watch. Absolute on the knife's edge play from both sides. I just love watching these teamfights where in the moment you can't even really be sure who's winning.  Special props to Aiming for absolutely throwing the game at minute 30 to keep me from getting too excited about clean play. And special special special props to Bdd for being just an excellent, amazing, beautiful, lovely, magnificent carry.  Lost track of how many times a teamfight pivoted around Kiin absorbing a bunch of damage, setting up a knockup, and Bdd ulting in to take advantage of it.
losing sion jayce lane as jayce is crazy lol
Report Doran
BDD IN FORM KIIN IN FORM LEHENDS IN FORM
Even if they win the series Doran needs to go.  Pathetic last fight from geng
Kt looking doomed :)
Aiming there ...
Aiming making sure the roller coaster isn't smooth smailing. .
doran
Can't believe these 4 kept saying "I'm worried about Doran and Delight" like 30 times before the actual match and they didn't jinx it, those 2 really struggled damn  But KT and their GODLY solo laners mamma mia
When I watch KT play I feel nothing, no emotion whatsoever. Nope. I will watch their games but I don't look forward to them at all. Believe me.
lmao how the fuck does a Sion solo bolo a Jayce in top over and over with no help from jg?
GenG lost the moment Chovy chose to priotize cs over helping his bot lane on a Lissandra lmao
Chokevy Comeback baby <3
Peyz got so disgustingly intend by his team it's unreal. Please put doran on tanks, jayce is the worst champ for him
Zeus might be on the best team but Kiin is the best top in the world.
Chovy fans this game:   Chovy was the only reason gen g lasted 30+ minutes   Chovy wasn't put on a carry champ so he can't carry   Chovy CS tho   Chovy's the only person NOT to blame this game on   Just watch Faker's Lissandra performances and watch this one and tell me he played well. Also Doran proving again that his lows are the lowest, dumbest lows and he is overall not that good of a player.
PLEASE Kick doran he isn't even  LEC level.
Kiin and bdd went crazy! so many amazing charms from bdd to turn fights.
PeyzPal trying to be useful off Zeri challenge (impossible)
Doran and Delight are war criminals
Insane top gap.
KT reminding fans not to have hope, don't get excited.
BDD so good. Massive mid diff
Massive top and supp gap.  Outside of keria , haven't seen another convincing tahm kench
Bdd with the non-vegan Ahri build saved a lot of these fights
DORAN is straight up inting it and chovy please that's not how you play lissandra
aiming almost threw it but KT held firm
Kiin so hot right now
Solo lane diff
BDD JUST TOOK A HUGE DUMP ON THE HEAD OF CHOVY WITH ONE OF CHOVY'S SIGNATURE CHAMPS
KT gave me a heartattack at somepoint hope they keep that tempo
not sure what cVmax saw in Doran
I really hope KT keep this up, i want to see Kiin @ MSI finally.
now it's time for KT fan to get excited
Everyone calm down, though KT played amazingly and was very fun to watch, there's no reason to be excited. I repeat, EVERYONE CALM DOWN. Don't even get excited for the top match up (although Doran is actually griefing)
You CAN'T die as Jayce that early to Sion solo WHAT
we need kiin in msi pleaseee
As expected from Doran. Why did chovy stay on this team after lehends and ruler left Peanuts shotcalling can't fix whatever he's doing.
KT IS A JOKE TEAM THEY CANT WIN THIS SERIES GG ANOTHER GEN G VS T1 FINALS
MAN THIS KT SQUAD FUCKING SUCKS, I CAN'T SEE THEM WIN A SINGLE GAME AFTER THIS, THIS IS IT BOYS GENG MSI INC
GIVE US 5 GAMES PLEASE! [This fight](https://clips.twitch.tv/VibrantNaiveMochaPanicVis-tpZFSWnc13uISKkI) at 3rd drake was insane
I’m EXCITED
Maybe Doran could play a tank now? Please
Not gonna lie, GenG genuinely looked like they were going to cry when walking back to their discussion room.
In the name of the Big Dick Daddy, the GigaLehends and the Holy Kiin amen.  May the Lords have mercy and not get tempted by the devil and get excited.
GenG almost signed Aiming but I think Aiming prefer his deal with T1
my god the macro from kt this game im actually shocked i think this is their best game this season
GEN need to investigate Doran's crypto wallet.
Doran got absolutely fucked in lane AND did jackshit in fights/skirmishes. Absolutely reportable how he blew full combos on Kiin only to either do like 5-10% of damage OR, when they were fighting in red side jungle near blue, Doran legit saved Kiin by E'ing him away so that Peyz couldn't reach him. Legit griefer
Doran Jayce surely will go well vs Kiin
Doran needs to be banned from playing jayce
Doran man, YOU STINK
whats that aiming? you afk facechecked enemy fountain? dont worry we’ll even it out next fight by stopping and checking out the sion charging q for 12 years
I find it hard to pick between BDD & Kiin for MVP this game
BDD was considered to be next Faker when he first came to play, seeing him doing well feels perfect
Can someone explain to me what Delight was doing with his Tahm Kench W’s?
That top side is so unplayable for GenG
Support canyon this game. On one hand Delight failing to do what TK does and protect a target, dying early on; and on the other hand Lehends shutting down Chovy every single fight, preventing him from looking to GenG's wincon. That final engage was beautiful, excellently following up on Bdd's perfect setup too.
GenG making teamfighting decisions like an average solo q side was really painful to see.
How did red side manage to get Vi, Xayah and Rakan???  Hello??
im not excited. im not excited. im not excited.
Solo lanes diff
Kiin!
I need to see the Kiin vs 369 matchup
Doran is an absolute fraud together with Peanut. Put them both on tanks and let Chovy/Peyz carry.
Man Doran really just let sion free farm and solo kill him. That loss is on Doran not being able to assert himself in lane.
SCHRODINGERS LCK TEAM,ITS TIME
Jesus this KT seem will sure dip into 10th seed next split. What a massive precedent for another disappointment
THEY NEVER GONNA GET TO FINALS.
What a waste of electricity watching KT.
DONT GET EXCITED!!! DONT YOU DARE!!
KIIN NEVER ALLOWED @ MSI NO SIR.
Apparently hirai said they have been crushing cn teams in scrims. So excited for kt.
Sanest KT ~~enjoyer~~ victim
Pls help me im so high i didnt understand if wether you were serious or not
And bdd. Absolute gigachads.
I was one of those who wanted Rascal over Kiin. Thank God I am not part of KT's decision making team.
I thought Sion into Jayce was supposed to be a neutraliser, you're not supposed to get solokills and plates
KT, also known as "Kiin Team", is a South Korean League of Legends team that plays in League of Legends Champion Korea (LCK). KT is famous for cosplaying a rollercoaster and sending their fans to the emergency room department for heart palpitations and cardiac arrest. KT has a few signature moves well loved by LCK fans, namely the patented "Kiin go kill", "Clean 2-0, nothing to see here", "Lehends die at level 3" and "BDD Azir TF”. They also regularly participate in a circus act called the "Telecom Wars" where a variety of circus tricks are performed in front of a large korean audience.
Doran
cuzz play so well despite got counter by tham/veigo
Honestly I believe the reason GenG was able to kill him after he TP'ed trying to save Aiming was because Viego got fed Xayah's stat from his passive. Otherwise there is no way for GenG to kill him.
You don't get it. Kingen vs T1 is World finals MVP no matter his current form
HLE winning over Dplus in the first round didn't help either lmfao. Had us all fooled.
Nah man. HLE are T1 kryptonite, they actually become a team when they see T1 as their opponents.   Zeka and kingen become worlds Zeka and kingen. Clid develops hands from 2019 and switches off PayPal and switches on monitor. Viper is viper.
How good was LSB tho
its a mental thing... T1 believe they might choke against HLE lol
HLE players get a huge buff vs T1. Zeka returns to Worlds form, Kingen turns into the best top in the league, Life plays better, and Clid time travels back to 2019.
Kiin is actually outrageous right now.
It doesnt help much that he is playing into Kiin who is on fire right now.
Going to say most toplaners will look bad against Kiin right now
Cant play Malphite, can't play Jayce
he has been terrible in playoffs hopefully he can bounce back
kt doran showing up HUGE this game
he better thank bdd hard for that next fight lol
Jesus fuck Aiming has been fucking running it this playoffs. Not remotely the same as regular season form. He needs to step up.
Aiming on a warded bush oh no
must have bought a doran shield because doran is shielding him from all the flame
I thought his build was the best thing he did. After he lost lane, he was never going to be able to do meaningful poke damage through fed Sion regardless of how much ArP he had, so he may as well get Goredrinker so he doesn't get blown up by the pick comp.  His problem was he did get picked repeatedly, and every time he got picked was after he dashed into melee range of Sion. If he'd stopped trying to add his relatively insignificant melee damage to the whittling down of Sion's health, he could have survived long enough to be useful in team fights.  Delight got a bit hyphy too at crucial times, but it matters a lot more when you're on a carry top.
Got fucking solo killed too lol
sion does win the lane early but getting solo killed..
i mean, they are 2-0 against gen g regular season. if KT didnt shit the bed in certain series early season (mainly that clown series against LSB where cuzz got outsmited idk how many times and that KDF series where they got clapped 2-0) they would be 2nd seed for sure.
time for him to pull out the J4 top to prove everyone right
Tbf he was sick early on in the playoffs.. but yeah he should really have recovered by now.
You either hit him or you try to walk past him and then he just q's you like that last fight.
I mean what can they do? Ignore him? Sion will fist them if they do
Peyz was really not the issue in that game I didn't think. Doran, Peanuts, and lack of leadership in the teamfights is what stood out.
>honestly, geng's win chances depend on KT playing shit (some questionable solo picks against them), initiation mistakes on mid to late team fights, and BDD.  Not even aiming on bush could save them
Kiin has that 369 energy that if you left him unchecked or give him a couple of early kills, he's gonna be a fucking raid boss the whole game. Basically what happened to T1vKT g5. They needed to focus on Kiin's Jayce or it's gg.
All part of the plan to not get e-worded
just don't pick taliyah
Also are Thanatos, Clear, etc. locked up by contracts or can GenG steal one of 'em away for top lane?
CHOVY CS BatChest
Are we really gonna blame Chovy for this game?
Well, on his defense Ahri got the early push. But truly we see BDD is totally the better mid laner here.
GenG lost after the 5th time their players decided to walk into Sion's Q....
The pan over to him cs'ing made me lose it
I mean I don't think him being there would have made a difference.
It's not like he never tried to make plays. KT just read those plays perfectly and responded. He completely inted the drake fights though
While also being kinda a counter to ahri.. like lissandra wins 80% of the time against ahri but of course chovy just didn't do anything on her. Props to Bdd for playing insanely well
just put chovy on late game champ at this point so you will play 4v5 early on
smooth brain take, that fight was over before Ahri roamed
Delight trolling the Dragon fight and Doran just... whatever he was doing. It wasn't a good show
I wouldn't call it all that bad though. Geng have been able to pull the gold back to even if not ahead after a losing teamfight. I think their the only team to do so through cs. But it sorta looks like shit as an eyetest..
PeyzPal good? You ok dude?
Bin is in argument we will see during msi but I think they are undisputed top 3
Cannot wait for the rematch
Least biased redditor xD
Bruv please, while Kiin did get the better of Zeus in their previous series, Zeus has been buttfucking Kiin like no other for over a year and a half now. Not to mention, Zeus played with nothing in their previous series while Kiin was getting the highest prio, and he still dropped the ball with that huge lead he had.
Bin >>>
Interchangeable for me like they are 50/50. Put Zeus on carries like Jayce and he'll deliver but his tanks are kind of a level down compared to Kiin and Zeus knows how to play weak side while kiin is like the carry of the team with Bdd.
Alot of T1 players are completely overrated.
LMAO the same LEC where Armut was thriving. Nah he's not that bad but he'd look better in LEC just like Malrang has probably.
Ik you are exaggerating but Doran would probably unironically run the LEC if he went there despite how bad he is for eastern tops standards.
Really low effort bait, try harder
We kiin at msi?!? No we need KT at msi!!
Its funny because Aiming come from T1 Academy
Probably should just sell their spot in the league after that disaster performance smh
begone jinx demon
duality of t1 fans
KT going to finals here and then then going to finals with T1 at MSI again would really suck. 3 telecom war bo5s in the first half of the year would be horrible. I really hope it doesn't happen.
Fr ? Source ?
explains the confidence the team is playing with tbh. the macro this game was beautiful
Yeah, they only scrim bad Academy teams.
Big Ding Dong
Yeah he was also great
Makes me happy to see Kiin and bdd doing well.
Felt bad seeing him drop out of top 4 lck mids last year. nice to see him bounce back.
>I was one of those who wanted Rascal over Kiin  Well can't blame you for that after last season haha
SAAAME  i've never been so happy to be wrong lol
What a way to flame the player who did everything he could and more for your team last year lol, very classy
>Rascal over Kiin  This has to be trolling
Not if the opposing Jaycee is doran
Bruh doran had to flash after aa on sion under tower like wtf man 🤣
and it took em forever to even kill sion 1v5 lol
Kingen vs T1 is the best top laner to ever play the game
FRRR, THIS is what we should be asking. Willer and friends hindsight redemption arc???
They may be up there with T1/KT with a decent upgrade in Top / Adc imo
Best top in LCK no? Feels nice that he has an actual team now.
top die
Kt doran was cracked tbf
As a KT fan, yes pls let him pull out the J4 top again!
I used to love playing j4 top and when it was locked in I was like, "lets go this'll be awesome" and then it was fucking useless 😭
Listen unless this man's been deathly ill for the last month there's no excuse for what he's been doing.
I agree but at the same time felt like Lisaandra could have tried flanking because Bdd was just doing so much stuff
Huge difference between running into sion to hit him and forcing sion to run into you so you can hit him while kiting backwards
its the classical aiming in playoffs form really   KT fans are probably having a heartattack due to him again
only shot gen g have at contending tbh. Doran’s too much of a weak link at this point.
I mean he remained mid a lot of times while bdd roamed and some of his engages were not it
reddit and their hate boner for chovy name a better duo
He's not the sole reason of course. But it just shows that they're unprepared as a team
In this meta, he should've abandon the cs as soon as BDD went missing. All of the stadium and their mothers knows where BDD heading to
one game in bro chill out
No it might not have, but it shows that GenG don't know how to use their comps to their strengths
they killed the Ahri in lane once, almost got her again on a 2nd gank, and Chovy was up in farm in lane. what more is he supposed to do? how is it Chovy's fault that Doran inted top hard and Aiming/Lehends controlled bot lane?   Bdd absolutely crushed teamfights even after being behind in lane and dying.
who
bin on tanks Aware
yeah im exagerating but he is clearly dragging down geng
Even fucking Malrang who was bottom 3 jungler for his entire LCK career stomped that circus for a while
not exactly  he said he was very confident against them and that if there was rift rivals, KT would play 1st or last set and they'll play anyone, not against a specific team  chat trying baiting him into leaking scrims but that was as far as he got  i think the biggest take away here is that KT is feeling extremely confident rn and it's showing  [source](https://youtu.be/Vy3lFxGY7xw?t=89)
Big Digiding-digiding Dingdong
Big Dick Daddy
> last season  pretty sure he was still doing solo kills and shit. well, at least for the first half of this split not sure since pre playoffs. iirc he was still leading the top solo kills  after 10 games or so lmao  not saying hes better than kiin, but kiin just went super saiyan this split and has been more or less consistent and a key for KT to win.
What? Lol.   This isnt even meant to shit on Rascal. Its a pleasant surprise that Kiin is returning to form as the top lane monster he was and KT is the one benefiting from it.
Rascal was absolutely better last year
Last year Rascal was the solo kill king. His style was very feast or famine. Something fitting for a roller coaster enjoyer lol.
It’s like watching prime TheShy
Can confirm. Mom predicted this shit before Chovy moved
It's literally Chovy's entire career bruh. He'd probably be great if league was a 1v1 game, sad that he chose the wrong game.
Chovy not leaving his lane once to go help bot while bdd went there in like the first 10 mins of the game was when it started going down hill for GenG. His on a f lissandra the least he can do is be proactive and even the casters called him out for that. His engages were also not great mid game.  Doran was the biggest fraud in that game though.
Yeah seriously, Chovy was up in farm, **what else was he supposed to do?!**
I mean when Bin is carrying this hard don't even let him hover a tank
Yeah dude doesn't bleed as much on tanks but he has such shit decision making he can throw a team fight god forbid he's the only engage and he's more comfortable on carries. When he's on carries he can bleed so much so it's a huge risk as well.
yeah rascal was insane last year, wasn't trolling at all to be high on him. but clearly kiin was the better decision in the end.
Or if he swapped to top.
yeah he definitely could have roamed more, his engages were okay at times, just the rest of his team couldn't get through the Sion for follow up. bdd also outplayed Chovy in teamfights with charms landing constantly on him
shanji will expose that fraud today
Bdd was absolutely smurfing those team fights
Almost every time. Maybe not 100% cause shit happens and there is always a change of beign unlucky but if pro took the game seriously and went all in they would win nearly every time.  So probably like 95/100, maybe even higher.
Assuming they take it seriously basically 100%.   Even without comms the coordination difference is just too big. Pro teams can make plays that are impossible in SoloQ because you can rely on the team being on the same page.  If you get matched with a bunch of onetricks of unpopular champs (assuming bans are not allowed) maybe they demolish all lanes hard enough that its unwinnable, but that seems very unlikely to happen in all lanes.
100%
Your average challenger soloq team probably has 1 or maybe even 2 OTPs. The pro team will just ban those out and get a super easy win.
What if we don't tell any of the players who each other is and put them all on alt accounts?

Omg you're my savior. It finally works. Thank you so much!
You died too. You didnt "win." You went even in a fight depite having a combat summoner advantage and they used their summonor spell to gain an advantage. Trading kills when youre ignite vs a tp player is losing.
save it for the group chat bruh
If you play ignite vs tp you have to make sure you can stay in lane after a fight and get a proper recall off.  Ignite isnt for beign turbo agressive. Running it means you are punished harder for mistakes in exchange for bonus damage. Ignite makes sure its harder to 1vs1 you. Trading kills is almost always a loss for you unless you have good wave state.  In other words its a defensive summoner in lane.  Let it be lesson learned and next ti.e maybe make smarter decisions.
another top laner inting the irelia to make the game unplayable for their adc.  nothing new to see here folks.
You need to learn about wave management. You can absolutely still be behind in XP even if you get a kill if you’re not recalling properly. Wave management and wave status is something to always keep your eye on.
my champ was actually executed under tower but even if its a 1 for 1, it makes no sense that i was punished for killing the enemy, let alone killing irelia twice and still fall behind in levels. Implying that i make the mistake of bringing ignite and killing my enemy makes completely no sense. How is killing the enemy a mistake????  &#x200B;  supposedly if i did not make the kill and instead back away, irelia heals on minions and in long run i will be in further danger, and my champ has no innate healing except for 1 doran blade, certain early game jgs will kill me, and its an irelia who can just q me to punish me for not going all in, isn't that completely a stupid decision and a huge mistake??????  &#x200B;  If that is the case, everyone might as well just bring tp and play scaling champs and win the game. In short, i completely do not understand your "smarter decisions" meaning at all.
yup, think how a bully laner such as darius or illaoi approaches ornn/malph/shen with ignite vs without
holy fuck no wonder everyone hates adcs. grow up
So just like what you guys do to every Draven you face.. Got it
I assume after you died irelia TPed back to lane and pushed the wave making you lose bunch of exp to your own tower.  Early on exp is extremely important and even 1 lvl diffrence gives you bigger advantage than a kill. What i'm saying is that going for a kill in exchange for your own life isnt worth it this early in the game.  Making smarter decisions involves knowing when its good to fight and when its good to let it go. You choose to fight and even though you got a kill, long term it was wrong decision.  Nothing is ever so simple in league of legends, there are situations when getting a kill costs too much and its not worth it. This was one of such moments.
yes i guess for the wave part i should be more specific. I just checked the wave was slow pushing, neither irelia nor me have the minions crashed under turret. Irelia tp, and i walked back with the wave still slow pushing to irelia side. So my point still stand, bad lol mechanics at play.
If it was slow pushing towards irelia then thats even worse. Not that it matters now. Its how this game always worked and how it will always work. This isnt team deathmatch.
> Does anyone have a solution to this  What OS version, hardware, graphics driver, antivirus, and other running software?  Nobody knows what is really causing it yet, except possibly riot, and maybe not them either due to how early it is. There are lots of useless/harmful voodoo "fixes" floating around, though.  With enough info, we can hazard a guess, test it, maybe prevent it, and hopefully riot can fix it.
Definitely looks like you should’ve hit her. 🍝 code :(
Outplayed
 her model was extended forward from casting her q
See my friend told me long before he dropped the game, the only way to climb is to never lose. The more I play the more real that seems.
I feel your pain. Last time I tried to climb on my main I was stuck in Plat 2 with a 68% WR consistently losing LP. Riots MMR is broken beyond repair and it punishes you for playing the game too much
start a new account?
demotion shield fucks up mmr, I assume that's what must have happened. Have to see it as though you're actually a few divisions lower than what your rank says since in the game's view your rank is overinflated compared to mmr
Ok so youre winrate doesnt matter at all. When you loose so much lp then it means youre mmr is significantly lower then youre rank at the moment. The system is now programmed to push you towards the rank it thinks you belong. When you would have a 50% winrate that is actually what would happen. But since you still win more games youre games should become harder since the hidden mmr rises and rises. The problem now ist that the increase and decrease of mmr isnt constant.   For example you play a game where the average mmr is gold 2 and youre mmr is silver 1 then you get a massive mmr boost. Much bigger boost then a game of gold4 mmr would give if you are silver 1 mmr. Remember youre mmr doesnt mean youre rank. You could be gold2 but with a fucked up mmr of silver1. That is because there is always a range of how difficult (mmr) the games are you q up for. Otherwise q times would be much longer. And where you land in that range is totally random.  So how to fix that? The fastest way would be to winstreak. Because after 3 games or so the mmr increase isnt linear anymore. So every win more give a bigger mmr boost. And once you had such a winstreak youre mmr is fixed. With youre lp gains you describe i expect it takes like 6-7 wins in a row. So my advice would be After 3 wins in a row to dodge games that dont look like winnable in champ select. Overall it is really hard. So in reality just keep playing you are doing perfectly fine.   Btw the same counts for the other direction. One thing that should never happen is loose streaking. So when you loose more then 3 in a row. Stop playing ranked on that account for the day. Take a break and start fresh the next day.
I’ve had Twitch prime on this account since I got it so I have quite a few skins I’d like to not lose
I haven’t lost at 0 LP with a shield
I won 7 in a row yesterday and won 20-21 for each and then went immediately back to losing 29 for each loss. My win streaks don’t seem to affect anything
No.
Aight, roger that
Do you have a solution to the "problem" or are you just here to bitch?
Riot removed smurf queue recently
maybe but wcyd?
adc<top<mid<jungle<support
Solo q: top, mid, adc, support/jungle, jungle/support  In pro play it's a bit different and midlaners have much more importance simply because of the combo of their position on the map + gold and exp income compared to other roles while jungler is less powerful than in solo q and is more supportive than straight up carry unlike solo q. Some teams top don't matter much and they put them in safe role to basically not int or soak some enemy pressure for the team but some teams often have their toplaners as their win con and play around them (usually some Chinese teams see BLG, EDG, OMG).
for soloq, jg/sup > mid > top > ad  importance is potential for influence, jg and sup are very similar role where they can impact all lanes and invade as well. mid can rotate to more than the sidelane roles, and ad has the least individual agency since its effectiveness is so tied to team coordination
Its been 3 days and he isnt an easy champ no matter how they change him.
"PC gaming is dying. I highly recommend Mobile Legends: Bang Bang to future-proof yourself from this dying MOBA."
Top lane is fake news. Forget it exists, do not gank them. It’s a waste of your time.   Oh wait *anti* advice hmm 🤔
Seraphine top is not a troll pick.
Clarity is OP
Switch to the smallest resolution you can, and make sure your NVIDIA scaling is set to No Scaling. This way, your game is on such a tiny window, that you don't have to move your eyes or your mouse as much.
Always flame your teammates specially the jungle. Your team will than you after the game end.
Try and do anything in life without moving your head and eyes from side to side. Thats you playing league.
Overall it’s better to not have your camera locked so you can see more of the map and keep track where all the enemies are. Good to see the overall situation before you get there (enemy hp/did they use ultimates/do you have a flank angle/should you just clear a wave instead) lots of uses for it but takes practice to get used to it.   In team fights to track yourself you can also hold space bar or tap it to recenter your camera.
Personally, I think the biggest advantage is that when you're trying to do combos, your camera isn't moving all over the place. Like, if you were a Riven and you were trying to make sure your cursor is on the enemy champion, if your screen were locked, you would have to adjust constantly to stay on them even if they were standing still. On the other hand, if your screen is unlocked you can just put the camera in a comfortable place and just focus on hitting your skills.
It's so that you can freely move your screen over the current position of your champion to check more stuff going on, and it also makes checking other parts of the map smoother. You can always press spacebar (or whatever button you use) to return the camera to the center position of your champion.
xd
I generally play locked, but I toggle it on and off constantly and use f keys and minimap click and drag to see other areas of the map. This game is impossible to play well if you can't absorb as much information as possible.
a lot of the time it feels really awkward if youre joining a team fight or on the edges and cant really see whats going on  kinda like driving without any side or rearview mirrors

have 500 mastery points on 150 champs
https://old.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/vczso4/challenges_catch_em_all_question/ich9bui/  I'm reading this as have 150 champions with Mastery Points of 500. Then it's 1000, 5000, etc.
What would the 461/500 be telling me?
your lowest champ in your top 150 is at 461  edit: could also be your closest to 500 points that isn't yet, you'd just have to look and see what champ is at 461 and how they compare to your others
>could also be your closest to 500 p  Yeah that was it thank you, the 150th highest mastery champion was at 461. What a bizarre way to display the information lol.
Do u smoke weed? cuz ur being paranoid.

I agree
Outside the first drag and maybe second one it’s not just on jungle to set up for. Honestly I would argue supp has more set up then jungle since all they can do pink ward put and sweep while supp can also place wards around the area on top of all of that. Outside of being a stat to flame people for with no context this seems a bit pointless
You could just count
You could literally sit and argue that every single stat on the screen is pointless "outside of being a stat to flame people for".  Also, as a jungle main, EVERY objective is undeniably a large part of my job and most of my jungle wins are attributed to the fact that I secure the vast majority of objectives in most of my games. If any jungler said "Support should be setting up dragon" in-game, they'd be lynched.  The fact that dragons, heralds and barons aren't tracked at all is fucking weird.
Congrats mate!
…please teach me your ways…
How often do you buy CDR boots on her? Are there any niche mechanics you perform more often than most people see from Rell?
Share couple of Rell tips&tricks! :)
Think you proved what everyone says is true. Support is an op role. Congrats though it’s no easy task taking league seriously and actually thinking to improve.
I always  feel bad for rell players, shes a solid champ once u get past her one flaw and I loved playing her support, but ppl just dont care. Im worried about renata since my friends started talking about how since shes low pick rate it must be shes bad and riot doesnt care, like shes solid please leave her alone.
Have you tried celerity on Rell? I started to experiment with it lately, so far it seems quite useful, but only when run with glacial augment, hexflash, etc.
nice so you are good at rell but good at league? who knows! congrats bro
Thank :)
Ask w/e you'd like :)
Pretty much 100% of the time I'll buy ionian boots. Flash is way too good to not have up significantly more often. Makes it feel much less bad to do so, either.  Learning to E during crash down makes avoiding ganks or setting up kills significantly easier. Especially if you learn to flash WE effectively.  You can flash Q and the spear points towards where your cursor is. Good for a pinch.  If you shove your face into a wall and hold your cursor into it, you can crash down immediately. Good for when you want to be dismounted in lane but don't want to be an easy target for your enemies. Still best done out of vision. You could likely instaknockup an enemy if they walk into you while doing this, but due to collision stuff probably unlikely.  If you time your ult right, you can stop Janna ultimate from doing anything but the knockback effect. Incredibly good. Same thing goes for any sort of mobility.  Keep tabs on enemy health values and whether they have shield items like maw, shieldbow, sterraks etc. so you know when the best moment to preemptively Q is. The sooner you get rid of an enemy shield, ESPECIALLY if it's instant, the better.  You can cancel Q cast with E if you feel it's not actually a good time to do so.  If you try and detach E while out of combat and an enemy is in the stun aoe, it'll activate the stun instead of detatching. Useful if you don't want it to go on cooldown. Would be useful to reliably do, but I don't think about it enough.  Standing still while ult is active has a stronger pull than when moving around (there was a thread in rellmains that kind of explained it).  Don't attack E to an ally you're about to gank for, as the sound/visual will be a tell for an enemy to react. Only do so when you're certain the enemy won't be able to get away.  You can charge hexflash so long as your health doesn't take damage. So you can sit on bush edge while charging hexflash for a mount up initiate on an enemy trying to poke around for you without them being able to respond as effectively.
You can cast Q during mount up's flip animation (W2) if used on a non-champion.  When flipping an enemy champion with mount up, your Q is pretty much guaranteed to hit them regardless of direction cast. Good for ensuring multiple targets are hit for maximum Q healing. Also ensures that they are the target your passive will apply to.  Your Q is an ability that can be buffered, so using it when enemy CC is about to go off works.  Mount up lets you move while rooted if you attack a nearby target. I've gotten some good plays from this because people don't expect it.  If you're condemned by Vayne or rammed into a wall by Poppy, you can buffer Crash Down if you were on the wall before it happened to still permit your movement effect to occur. This was something I figured out recently. I assume it's because the knockback effects don't occur if you're already on the wall, permitting you to still move.  Q heal is op. If you have a strong mega tank on your team (sion, cho, k'sante, w/e), you can heal them forever in a fight provided you land your Q's on at least 2 targets per.  You can crash down immediately if you shove your face into a wall and cursor into the wall before casting. Useful to dismount quickly.  During SG Rell homeguard animation, the startup of the sprinting plays a metal grinding sound. Mashing S while also mashing to move can make your ally's ears bleed.
Tbh if ADC players did more macro plays (shoving 2nd wave into mid lane roam or jungle invade) they'd feel a lot more confident about their ability to make a difference in the early game than they do. Very few ADC's I supported wanted to do stuff like that. Most of the time, but not always, I had to lead them into it. So it's not so much that Support is OP, but that Support is naturally expected to have to pay more attention to what's going on around the map than ADC's are expected to.
Imo Renata is a rly good pick. The thing is that you have to rely on your adc not being... afraid. Which most of them are. There's the boosted ones, the alright ones, the stupidly aggressive ones and the actual good ones. Those last ones are those that Renata works incredibly well alongside, all the others will make you end up being a nonfactor. Coupled with the fact that her only sustain to make trades is a shield, as opposed to nami with heal.  She is incredibly good, and having displacement is nice, but player mental is a common factor that must come into play with the performance of many supps. Tbh if anything, they should prolly reduce her Q cd a bit late, as it is her only actual survival tool. A GOOD tool, but when all the enemy has to worry about from you is a single skillshot (speaking from experience with brand, xerath, and others as well), it leaves you incredibly vulnerable.
That's the sorcery tree rune that increases the effect of bonus ms boosts, right? I tried it once or twice in some norms. Downside of running it is that nothing else from the sorcery tree really feels as useful? And you lose some of your lane survival by not going any green stuff, and you can't get rid of hexflash because it's just too obscenely good on Rell. If you manage to make it work, tho, keep trying it out. I feel like it'll eventually run its course, tho, like how shurelya's is a not terrible mythic in low elo.
Bans? Matchup preferences? Who you want as a duo? WHAT IS YOUR PREFERRED BUILD?
Thank you bro! Lot's of good tips. Lastly what top 3 adcs you'd like with rell?:)
What made you switch from jungle to support and now when you do play jungle (if you do) do you feel like your mechanics have gotten worse?
I usually take it against team with only few cc options, so i don't rely on tenacity from the green runes. It kinda works for me, might be low rank opponents as you said.
I've permabanned nidalee since season 1 since I don't trust allies to do well with her and I like good matchups, and playing a 5v4 vs inhibited enemies isn't fun for me, either. But if you're not like me and actually want a proper ban, Wukong is one of the most frustrating champs to go against as Rell as you can't do anything against him when his ult is up.  I'm fine supporting most champs but the ones I hate most of all are single target champs like Jhin, Lucian (ESPECIALLY Lucian), and Cait if she can't actually set traps on the enemies I CC. The ones I really enjoy supporting are Varus, Aphelios, Samira (but sometimes you get ppl that never play Sam that only pick her because you're Rell and they can't ever S rank), and I WANT to say Kog'Maw but they've all disappeared.  For build it really just depends on the game state. If my adc is someone that needs to be kept alive at all costs (like vayne or kog) I go knights vow, locket, eventually considering getting a redemption 4th but never getting around to it. Evenshroud for if my team has a LOT of good aoe damage or the enemy team is filled with a lot of squishies that NEED to be bursted down much faster. Abyssal Mask if the enemy team problems are AP and my team has a good AP champ (vik, lissandra, karthus, all that good stuff). Since thornmail changes, oblivion orb is a much better option to SIT ON if there's an enemy drain tank that will never auto you. NEVER BUY ZEKES UNLESS YOU HAVE A KAT ON YOUR TEAM. IT'S THE BIGGEST GOLD WASTE IN THE GAME. If enemy team has an ez or kat or kog, get anathema and slap it on them.
Varus, Aphelios, Samira (if they're not first timing)  With Varus I'd like him to build at least 1 AP item tho.
I switched from jungle to support because I felt I needed to work on my macro (and random support players SUCKED SO BADLY), since support and jungle macro are kind of close to each other at a point. And I don't really feel like my mechanics in the jungle have gotten worse, since I've more or less always played Kindred there with some dabbling in ivern and failing miserably at rek'sai, and I also one-tricked them back when learning. I can pretty much go back to them on a whim if I wanted to.  But mostly, my ability to jungle effectively is partially dependent on my teammates doing their part to ensure the things I do or want to do are backed up by map information. And I was pretty hard-pressed to find a support player that actually had more than half the vision score of the enemy supp v.v The feeling of wanting to do things bot lane but not being able to because it's warded from the blast cone to mid bush to their blue side and even in lane because they just refuse to get any info is pain. I also have a friend that I play norms with that spams jungle panth, so I don't really have opportunities to go back in there often and spend my time trying to improve on other champs in the meantime (on my alt).
Is Radiant Virtue not a good mythic for her? :0
Hmm interesting, why x1 ap item?
It's too expensive, tbh. Functionally it's in a pretty good spot, but cost wise not so much. It heavily delays what you'd be getting second (generally knight's vow or abyssal mask or smth). And it's frankly not worth the wait, imo.
His AP scaling with his W is insane. Without any AP, its damage is negligible and can be heavily ignored. With AP, a WQ on a 30% midgame enemy can go from doing like 18% of their health to a kill (with at least 1 stack, mind you). With nashors alone he can kill any enemy before midgame with 2 normals, ult, WQ. Now factor in that stack damage coupled with his not insignificant ult ratio and how easy it is for Rell to help the spread of the tendrils and line enemies up for his WQ. It's a lot of potential damage.
Hm, I’ve been picking Frozen Heart second a lot, I keep needing it there’s always a fast attacker like Jax or some shit.
FH has no health, so you miss out some value from it. If Jax gets on you, you're going to die regardless (since a lot of his damage atm is magical as well, and his W resets don't rly care about FH reduced attack speed). Better off just CC'ing him when he tries to stun an ally or ult him off mid-jump. A lot of jax players tend to fight even when their stun is down, so pretty easy to take advantage of like that.
The only thing obviously lost is your mental lmao
Here's the different hats I can put on:  1. Never give up until the Nexus is destroyed - Self-explanatory. Don't care if my team gave up, game is over when it's over.  2. "I disagree with your take" - You might think the game is "obviously lost", but I see a comeback/win condition that we can still meet and it's viable.  3. Spiteful hat: "Suffer with me, knowing this loss was your fault" - I don't mind waiting another 5-10+ minutes for the game to end, if it wastes your time. I have a second monitor so I don't care about "wasting my own time" - I'm a multitasker! In-fact, I've been watching Netflix this entire game.  4. Contrarian: "I think the game is lost but I want to extend the game to see what happens" - like 3, but more for self-amusement purposes.  5. Pride hat: "I never give up" - same as 1, but more so for vanity than actually wanting to win.
Some men just want to see the world burn
I feel satisfied that I played to win and did my best. That's the main reason I play League :).   Whether I win or lose is not as important to me as doing my best to win .
The answer for me is basically that I value my time. I hop on league to *play* league with the objective of winning, not hopping on to win league games. If you're playing a game, but not having a good time in any game where you're losing, or lost, then you're either only enjoying your time 50% of the time, or a smurf and we really don't want you here anyways.   Even if the game is lost, many many people find situations where you are behind interesting. One of the fundamentally great things about a game like league is that despite there only being one map, is that there are so many variations of gameplay, with one of those variations being "playing from behind". It's the same type of people who say, enjoy playing Dark Souls and dying 50x, or playing DMC on the hardest difficulty, or the way it took me 20-30 times to beat Mile High Club in COD4. People like us tend to enjoy challenging situatoins, over coming those situations feels great, and losing to those challenges doesn't seem like a setback of any sort or a waste of time.   If anything, I find FF15 games a bigger waste of time, because you're chooseing to spend 15+ minutes for queue + champ select + loading + 1.5 minutes where often peopel don't do anything in norms, and then to FF jsut past laning phase is such a waste of life.
Why do people choose to lose a game intentionally? Ive never gained LP for hitting yes.
I understand the whole playing it out, fair is fair if the surrender vote fails I keep playing.  But when the vote fails and then no one wants to do anything risky when it's 7 turrets and 2 inhibitors to 1 turret and 25 kills to 5..what's the point of not surrendering?
Because sometimes the desired effect is to troll games and then force you to suffer as much as possible all because they got demoted for being a dog
Why do people refuse to use the search function before asking 'why do people refuse to surrender' for the umpteenth time on this subreddit.
Well some people lose their mentals right away and afk farm a side lane. Those people for sure suck but I also think games are winnable way more often than people think. I've experienced countless examples of being down 10 kills early but still winning. It's Solo Q, people throw games ALL the time, especially when they get early leads and get overconfident. Just gotta capitalize on the mistakes.
Because their champs scale well into the late game and they get to feel powerful even if they lose, and they want to report you for inting when your bad scaling champ gets 20-30 deaths with only a few kills.
Force a baron fight, enemy takes baron, force another aram fight, enemy takes ur nexus. Fastest way to end these hostages, but it requires the enemy team to do the right thing.
because i want to play league of legends and if we surrender im not playing anymore
if you're not super far behind but outscale you shouldn't group up to fight for objectives, unless you think your opponent won't be there to contest as 5.
If I'm playing with someone who doesn't want to ff but doesn't try to win aswell, yea I am not happy.
Almost always 2, sometimes 1, 3 if discussion at point 2 goes real bad
I think people either do it because they don't realise how fucked we are or because they just want to at least beat their teammates if they can't beat their opponents.
If only people were trying to win when voting no.
Because it saves time and your energy. The majority of games where I offer to ff we just lose anyway. Would rather lose the game than have to suffer playing a lost game with a team that's not even trying anyway.
When some people can't beat their opponents they at least try to beat their teammates.
Just archive whole reddit, everything has been said, no need to repeat anything.
Games where you're down 20 kills have no towers taken, enemy has soul and you just lost a teamfight and the team still wont ff. I usually don't surrender games that I think we still have a chance but some games are just unwinnable.
People who ff arent trying to win.
I guess there's one more hat:  6. I'm heading off after: This is my last game for now since I got to cook, go to the gym, do some homework, go out, eat dinner, whatever. I might as well use this time to get some practice in or just play for the 1% comeback.
You already gave up when wanting to ff even if the vote goes to keep playing. You are the problem
If I made time to play one game I want to play a whole game. FF spammers waste my time by giving up on winnable games. If playing the game is "suffering" for you why are you even playing... People like you make the game worse for everyone else lol
there is a 1% chance the enemy team will hard throw and u guys can win from such a deficit! Thats what some of the ppl here think lol.
He's saying the people who refuse to FF don't even try to win the game. I think he'd feel differently if they didn't even but played to win
I don't get this attitude, there is nothing wrong with wanting to ff. Just because you think it's wrong or the game is winnable doesn't matter, maybe they are wasting your time but you might be wasting theirs. Maybe the game is winnable and they have poor mental but they could also see something about the game you can't.   You have to feel like you are better than them to think you are always right in not ffing, they may be salty or something, but they are people as well who are independently thinking about whether ffing is worth it. They are not inferior to you just because they want to ff.  With the recent stats of 96.6% of 4/1 surrender votes ending in a loss, I think in the small percentage of games where the entire team wants to ff it's actually better for your LP to just ff and save time.  Mainly talking about ranked here, but yes people enjoy winning more than losing. Losing does feel bad but it happens. In the games where the team wants to ff often there is just no play at all. Those are the games that are "suffering" to play, where you are just locked out of doing anything besides catching waves at inhib turrets.  Do people ff in winnable games? Yes obviously. Should people be able to ff? We are too far gone to suggest no anyways, but there are some games where ffing is probably just saving everyone time. Just because some people ff more than they should doesn't mean you just ignore everyone who wants to ff and see yourself as better for continuing to play.  I know you hate dodging because it wastes 9 people's time, so maybe do some introspection and consider if ffing "makes the game worse for everyone else" or if this is just your opinion and a majority of ranked players feel that you are making it worse for them. Everyone is entitled to vote for an ff, you can vote no if you want but don't make yourself seem better than other people who ff.
The person who isnt trying to win the game is more often than not the one spamming ff.
People who want to lose are an isuse. You can try and justify it however you want. When you ff you are choosing to lose.  And Ill take the 3% chance of winning a game over a 0% chance any day. Idk why anyone would choose to lose when winning is an option. I wont even try and get into how much of the 4/1 data is skewed by ff spammers who dont get their way and run it down to "teach hostage holders a lesson." People giving up and making games unwinnable is a massive issue caused by ff mentality.
Remind me what draft modes this game has again? Is there an equivalent of a "Captain's Mode"? That's effectively what you want.  Anyways, this just reads as lack of adaptability to different "problems" created by drafts as well as complaining about your allies. I could then use this logic to request a mode where my enemy picks champions I find easy to beat or have low winrates and say that's valid.
You have this level of control if you play ranked flex with friends. Just make friends with OTP / champ mains of all your favorite champs to have as teammates
making queue times longer for you will affect queue times for everyone else
Maybe as a separate ranked mode but I don't love the idea of being able to pick the champs you'll "allow".
>Ive noticed a few things;  Every single thing you noticed is pretty much no-sense, except for the last one about supports matching their picks.   However, in SoloQ matching picks is terribly stupid unless you can really use that champion. If you can't, or can barely do that, picking your best is always 30 times better than matching the pick.  In any case, your idea seems terrible. You are basically saying that, IN SOLOQ, mode created where you should focus only on yourself and where no one else matter, you should have the perfect team comp.   If you want a mode like that, go in FLEX with 4 premades and build a team.  Also QUEUES time would skyrocket from 2-3 minutes to 30-40 minutes, unsure if you realize it.
Willingness to play with certain types is not the same as demanding no enemy picks of the same or whatever they want.     Yes I'm complaining, matchmaking is crap and thats well known, this would be something people could opt into or not for faster games what would be the issue? that weaker champ types wouldnt be picked? ok.... so then balance changes become more obvious now?
The issue is everyone wants their own form of ideal matchmaking and Riot is not going to accomodate every little request.  Commonly includes:  1. Language preference (less of an issue in LoL)  2. Roles selection (iirc already implemented, no idea actually) - so you don't have 2 people fighting over mid/carry  3. Strictly enforced MMR differentials - e.g. why do you have to support someone lower MMR than you?  4. Avoid list - why should I play with someone who obviously hates me and will grief my games?  5. Ping - why am I getting such high ping to this shitty east coast server or whatever?  Now we want people who want specific archetypes of champions filling their role and then require that said allies also have their requirements fulfilled. Then, what happens if they don't pick a character that fits with that? Or what if they get counterpicked or see a known spammer of one character and want to play something else?  You then have to add an enforcing mechanism (report + verification).  Also, chances are, if someone's picking a "weak character" and maintaining MMR as you - then they're doing fine. Also the fact that average MMR pubs are not that amazing - it's not pro gameplay, draft matters but not as much as you think.
Your overall win/loss might be under 50% so you'll just have to go a bit further I think.
Current MMR system is to make you grind more, tbh yeah pointless. My hardstuck smurf got less frustrating once I turned it into a drinking only account tho.
It took me about 80 games to go from +16 -24 to +27 -17
Sounds like a scam.
Feels like a scam tbh
Not really all that enthused about this announcement I won't lie. So they're like, FIFA card NFTs but for LCK players? But what do you then use them for? I don't really get it?  I wish it were something physical like Panini Football stickers, but for LCK players/legends. I would have loved to collect a sticker album of my favourite players/coaches. But this? Nah I'll pass.
\>NFT Shit  No  Fucking  Thanks
I wish there was decently priced physical LoL/LCK stuff that wasn't from AliExpress... I even live in Korea but LCK shop stuff seems either low quality or Uber expensive. Maybe I'm spoiled from buying Echo Fox gear on clearance when they got booted tho :(
😮 Gotta catch 'em all
Take a look at FIFA Online scene in Asia will explain it to you. Gacha games thrive good here, even bleed well into the West, like Genshin.
event emotes excluded
you will get a random emote
Anivia by a long shot
I’m a big fan of Sejauni, my go to jungle pick when playing with friends that despise jungling. Easy to play and has great knock ups and stuns to get any baddies off of your carries
Anivia can do pretty silly things from OTPs. The wall can be anything from one of the most powerful abilities in the game to something that straight up helps the enemy depending on how you use it.  Also scales really well.
Definitely Anivia - A late game mage that scales well, has good damage and wave clear and of course she is from Freljord :)
If you're looking for the option that can lose early, but still have a reliable late game. Then what you probably want is someone that has less early game options, but good midgame spikes. It's good to know that late game options only exist if you can reach late game when behind, so the best scaling champs will have many games where you feel like you're just a little gold away from teamfight ready.  Olaf scales, but scales better when his team enables him. Braum is heavily dependent on doing well early, so that he doesn't just disappear midgame. Tryn scales with knowledge of his limits, so he's good one trick to dedicate a long time to.  Lissandra has a safe early. Even when she loses, she has great utility midgame, and only needs 2 items to disrupt teamfights.
Udyr is pretty good since he's flexible can be played a bruisery tank or a one shot assasin
Trynda is a classic onetrick champ.
The answer is anivia because she's blatantly OP and has been for a long time. It's just that nobody talks about it because she super boring to play and looks stupid as hell. So nobody plays her. Pick udyr
Probably Sej, you can comfortably play her Top/Jg/Sup especially if you're 1 tricking. She's evaded nerfs yet pro teams do not pick her either so she's remained strong and under the radar. Also not usually banned is a big one.
Anivia’s really strong right now, so you could probably get away with a lot on her.  Tryndamere’s also not too bad either. Definitely not as strong but if you lose lane you can just perma push towers and there’s really not a lot that people can do to stop you.
Troll anivia scares me.
Sounds cool ill try her out thanks :)
I personally prefer mages alot more than bruisers (im currently a karthus mid player) but u recon aniva is a better pick than karthus for onetricking then?
My brother in Christ what pro games are you watchin? [Sej has 72% pb this season](https://gol.gg/champion/champion-stats/77/season-S13/split-Spring/tournament-ALL/) & literally just got a [solid set of nerfs this patch](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Sejuani/LoL/Patch_history)
Keep in mind if you want to enjoy league Anivia is probably the worst champ to onetrick. She's piss easy, shallow and probably top 5 most boring champs to play.
It's not even close anivia is beyond busted and never gets banned. And due to her abysmal playrate riot clearly has no intention of balancing her. On top of that your only other option here becomes lissandra. So ya...  I would never main either due to them being uninteresting to play. I think karthus is more fun. But if we're imposing the freljord restriction we have to be flexible.   I personally think you should value fun.
Thats preference tho, I played 2 games with her just now and she seems like a decently enjoyable champ. No towerdives from zed, yone and yasuo, good damage, stun skillshot and w is a very «diverse» spell
Anivia ain't too bad to play, she just has a niche playstyle that most people wouldn't be interested in. I guess that can be considered as uninteresting, but she definitely has a lot of depth when it comes to macro and a decent bit of mechanics, positioning/adapting playstyle depending on the game is super important.
it’s old announcements popping off all at once
makes sense, but how does it explain the teleporting and scores being added with no pattern
what scores? I experienced the same thing a couple of times and that is what it is. While it happens you typically disconnect so when you seen to regain control your champion has walked all the way back to the base. This is a known bug
check out 0:21, kayn teleports under bot turret  also check out the irelia clip, blue team gains 9 SCORES, while the red team only gains 4
They have actually stated before that they intentionally make the hitbox of abilities slightly bigger than the visuals would assume. I think their philosophy was that it's more frustrating to barely miss an ability than it is to barely get hit by one.  With that being said, some abilities are definitely out of control
It's mostly design choice, some can be changed over time, but things like Sion Q and hook champs are very much stay the same till... whose know. Some skill hitbox code as center to center, some are edge to edge.
They make content pieces like this before every finals  translated this one because I thought it was funny, also thought other 'romance of the three kingdom' enjoyers would like it too  turn on CC for subtitles  translated from kr LCK channel: [link](https://youtu.be/z5w3juQJExs)  unlisted translations playlist: [link](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaSJayAzGz_kVbi48fXDtIG-h0wYTXnIq)

thank u so much for the translations!
1. Yes teams over-inflated salaries. They tried to buy success in the short term rather than building success in the long term.  2. But the bigger problem is teams sat on the money they got and did nothing with it. Not enough attempts at content, fan engagement, or really making profit.   3. Franchising is a dumb excuse. There were shitter orgs in LCS before franchising too. It's not like there are many good players who aren't getting a chance on LCS teams. Outside of Cloud9 and maybe Gravity(which was a poorly run org) .. what org from relegation actually did well? Relegation turned into teams like C9/TL farming spots and selling them for profit. Teams in Challengers were filled with washed up LCK players / ERL players before franchising anyway ... so it wasn't really any different to LCS  4. Personally think the biggest problem in LCS is/was culture, more than anything else.
NA esports really looks like a handful of people ( players, managers, riot esports ,casters , content creators) got a bag from having a monopoly and just threw it into toilet rather than develop anything sustainable for when the bubble popped.  It’s interesting to see LOL in the west become more of a meritocracy due to the shrinking capital and these legacy orgs and talent just bust up the second rubber meets the road.
> "I refused multiple high end offers, partially because of loyalty, partially because they were absolutely idiotic and over the top to begin with. I wasn’t worth that kind of money  what the actual fuck kind of hypercope is this
Imma be honest this has to be some of the stupidest shit I’ve ever seen in my life. I understand Amazing knows league, but when it comes to corporate and business I think he can stay in his lane
this legit is just starting to feel like this era of players is deciding they are done with league so league should be done in general
This is all well and good, but this is a financial and business collapse and last I remember, Amazing is a player and not an economist or financial analyst of any sort.
I'm sorry, I don't want the opinion of someone who regurgitates Thorin's bullshit.
Franchising of course was a mistake, but riot wasn't going to pass up 200m (20m per slot?) for a dying league.  It sucks, relegation was one of the best parts of LoL anms every split actually had stakes.
> "Also: Franchising was a mistake. Horribly run organizations for the most part with horrible signings and no ideas or personality Milked the scene dry that was built by others, and Riot enabled and encouraged it. Despicable shit, and only because no one protested it on time."  This is so true. As much as TL, IMT and TSM killed the scene with ridiculous salaries, it was also really uninteresting watching their super-rosters stomp whatever GGS, IMT(lol) or OpTic cooked up, and I say that as a 2023 GGS fan.   Having 5 interesting teams and 5 teams that legitimately play at wildcard or EU tier 2 level meant that on a given day, 3 or 4 out of 5 matchups were useless unless an upset happens
franchising was a lie sold by greedy team orgs who just wanted more money. They said franchising would allow more academy players to make it to LCS, but the result was fewer NA talent going through the system after franchising than before. Riot is a fool to have listened to them. Relegation is a better system. It forces teams to lift their game, instead of just coasting when they're at the bottom, knowing their spot is secure as long as they don't finish 10th 4 splits in a row.
I'm not gone watch non-NA players play in NA.
The 3 players you mentioned didn't accomplish anything (no worlds win) which is all that matters.   NA LoL died when XJ9 got banned. Most talented player NA ever had. What a shame.
> Franchising is a dumb excuse. There were shitter orgs in LCS before franchising too.   Franchising caused a lot more issues than just bad orgs. Just one of the many things
Biggest problem is Genz and teens in NA don’t play this game so they aren’t going to care for it’s esports scene.
>  There were shitter orgs in LCS before franchising too  The point is that they get relegated and replaced by more derseving orgs even if they didnt pay the 10m buy in. How many orgs are currently paying lcs min and just coasting?
Probably offered a lot more to join shitter teams. Amazing would definitely sacrifice salary to play on a better team.
The funniest comment in this whole unhinged rant. Image someone offers you a big raise at your job and you turn it down, saying “Nah, im not worth that much”. Like what is this guy smoking?
On the other hand the businessmen tried investing into a product that revolves around nerds and virgins, knowing nothing about the game, and they got bit in the ass, not really the nerds and virgins.
The financial and business collapse does not happen if all the investors and analysts don't make crucial mistakes. Businessmen were handing out salaries that random twitter shitters thought were overinflated, and the random twitter shitters were right.
It was 10m per spot. Overwatch was 20 mill.
Putting TSM and not C9 lmao
I think this was also reflective of a problem with the game in general, or at least high level perception of it - these secondary teams were absolutely terrified of trying anything different. You constantly had them trying to beat the loaded teams at their own game with inferior talent. Of course you're going to lose over and over.  Innovation was dead in League. Riot should have ensured the meta couldn't be boiled down as far.
Hey GGS had some good years haha
None of them?  Apparently TSM is now looking to pay close to minimum, but the only orgs I would even try to guess are paying minimum are IMT and maybe CLG, and even those I'm skeptical of.  Sorry kids, not everyone is going to be 1st, someone will inevitably be last, doesn't mean it's for a lack of trying and doesn't mean it's because the org is "shit".
The shitter orgs back then we’re just replaced by other shitter orgs. The current shitter orgs have either had their moments (DIG,TSM,TL) or are fairly new (IMT)
It wouldn't be a raise in your job, it's more like being offered a similar job in another company with a better salary. You would be surprised how many people reject those offers, and there are many valid reasons, being afraid of changes, very comfortable in their current job, or just actually stupid.  Anyways, the way Amazing worded it, sounds like a combination of being comfortable and a bit stupid (you want to cash out in a very short career).
I agree the business people got totally fucked for not knowing the market, but that still doesn’t mean I’d trust a league player to run my business
The business people know it's a risk, that's why venture capital was investing in league esports. Venture capital's whole purpose is to take a bunch of long shot investments where most will fail but some will succeed so spectacularly to cover the other losses.
I find this to be a fascinating paradox, because this thread is full of people complaining that salaries ballooned, which is probably true, but the other half complain that teams weren’t trying to be competitive under franchising. But being competitive would have required them to pay the inflated salaries
C9 actually only paid real big for Perkz bc they got a ton of money off the trade of another player.  The rest of their salaries have not been the highest in the league.
The big point is that then you at least had a chance to get new competent orgs replace the bad ones, now there is no chance for that. Also easy to use former times as excuse where things just were not as professional as they are (supposed to be) now
Ironically Reginald and Steve were both LCS players before they became Owners and they... both made some really questionable business decisions. I get that meteos is not good to listen to for business content but man no one involved really is
Honestly I have the most faith in GGS, C9, and FLY (new owners) staff. GGS and FLY are traditional sports owners and C9 seems pretty prudent
whats wrong with some champions being better at the highest caliber of play? surely azir is not gonna work as well down in iron-gold, so why do people hate seeing him and other good kits in pro play? do they want pros to select random champions every time? at that point just spectate high elo soloq
The issue isn't that these champs are actually the best to pick.  The "issue" is that it takes hundreds of games and frequent re-play to be able to play these champs at a professional level, severely limiting a pros pool.  There are almost always better champs to pick in a draft, but there's no way for these players to be proficient on every possible pick.  The power in these champs lies in the fact that they are _good enough_.
removing zeri from the game opens up like 100 more picks
I disagree. I like how some champions are difficult but very strong in pro players hands. I don’t expect to play as well as faker.
> I only want league to be as fun to watch as it is to play  That's definitely a hard goal. Appreciating the beauty of coordination and min-maxing/pushing a character to its maximum potential is one thing - being able to replicate that is going to be hard, for your "average MMR" player.  No comments about your specific changes as I don't understand them, simply because I don't know what the characters are :D
It’s because it removes a big element of strategy, and freshness. Its not really about making it random, moreso to make the game about the whole cast of all the characters and how they interract in a high caliber teambased scenario
Yes or maybe just removing her wall interractions? Having a high ms ad is interresting, but then slows should be the answer, however her wall gameplay removes that option
I see your point, but I think there is a difference here between difficult, and difficult to play against if properly played, insecs and shurima shuffels aren’t really that hard, but accounting for them in a competitive setting with all the other variables involved dissentiveces picking things that dont have the safety to deal with it. Making proplay an arms race of who can have the least counterable playstyle. Ironically removing the skill expression as a result
Thats exactly the point of strategy, picking the best champions and play the best way to win, sometimes brave teams try counter strategies and they work.  wanting to include all champions just for the sake of inclusion is such a flawed aspiration and I wont even debate it, some champions are unique and they should be this way, Teemo is a 'joke' champion but if someone gets very good at it he is not played in pro play and uncommon so players are less experienced vs it - which is good for the Teemo player.  Riven/Kata are strong soloQ picks that never appear in pro play so they never get nerfed.  Being good at champions like Azir means you will probably not do well in soloQ but if you do you are probably very good and will transition better to proplay if you theoretically wanted that, etc.  Wanting to rotate metas and champs just to see more champions is such a silly state of mind. but you do you.
I feel like that's the solution to her as well.  Let her keep her dash, maybe even with an interaction where it gets decreased/halved CD if she dashes against a wall reducing in a less than full range dash, or whatever else to keep her "hyper mobile".  She's still mobile, she's still fast - She just isn't uncatchable when played well.  &#x200B;  Hell even in my gold games you hit her with the chain CC engage, she hops over a huge wall with her mythic item shield, and proceeds to somehow carry the fight from the 10% left as she kites the entire world.  Or she doesn't, because it's gold and most of the Zeri aren't great.  Some do it though, and it feels so wrong.  Let her kite us forever, but let us kill her if we get her off guard or over-stepping.
>Data shows that 98% of league players have been flamed at some point  What data?
Honestly you sound biased and have no data. Yea I’m sure over 100’s to 1,000s of games people get flamed. Chat is extremely useful, although the new chat policy is about as big of a fuckup as I’ve seen riot make in 8 years of playing this game.
But really what Is flaming.  I guarantee everyone on this board has a different threshold that they consider “flaming” and what makes your definition better than mine?   I honestly don’t care if people call me out for a bad play. If I’m hard throwing a game have at me, it happens from time to time and I don’t really care especially when I’m the one screwing up. It usually makes me take a break and reset my mental.  My hard line is the obvious racist/sexist bullshit. Outside of that who really cares, it’s a videogame
Didn't read + downvoted, go play hearthstone and have your online experience reduced down to "your turn" if you can't handle anything more
I wonder if making it an honor 5 "reward" and if needed having honor 5 be harder to get would work.  Pretty crazy to think that something so basic would need to be so heavily moderated, but I doubt it will happen, the last time Riot tried to remove chat people argued that most of the toxic chat came from one's own team rather than the enemy team.
just delete chat and replace for premade lines that everyone can use to communicate.
Asking for a friend because I definitely dont play league of legends, but how do i mute everyone for chat but not their pings? I thought mute all makes it so there is 0 form of communication
Removing chat won’t stop players from being toxic or getting tilted over their teammates. Removing chat would just be a bandaid fix for one avenue in which toxic players interact with their teammates and enemies. They can resort to out right running it down and selling all their items or start soft inting in a way that can’t be detectable by Riot’s automated ban system (such as initiating a losing team fight or delaying their abilities). While I do agree that League has a toxicity problem, removing chat won’t stop the Disco Nunus
I get what you mean, I've had some annoying, and even downright horrible and disgusting things said in game chats, even just during blind or draft - but I also feel like that communication is kinda fun sometimes, lets you joke around w ur team - because every now and then you find other players that are actually nice
Regardless of whether those of us that enjoy/benefit from chat actually are in the minority or not, the fact remains that you can always opt out of chat if you don't like it, there's no need to delete it for everyone.
Honestly, responses like this tell me right away that you're not actually here to debate in good faith. You can come at me with the obligatory "the burden of proof is on you yada yada", I don't care. If you were actually interested in proof you would have taken the 5 seconds it took you to type this comment to google search it instead.  Edit: Lotta downvotes on this one. Me thinks the jokers that comprise the majority of this subs subscribers doth protest too much. People generally don't react positively to being called out on their shit, even if they're only indirectly being called out.
My data is that anybody who has played this game for any decent amount of time has almost certainly had multiple bad experiences with extreme toxicity. I don't know of a single league player who hasn't been the victim of some form of toxicity. The league community has a well-known reputation for extreme toxicity, which is really saying something considering that it manages to stand out even in the online gaming community. Even people who don't play online games have heard about it. And don't tell me to "prove it", this is common knowledge.   You're not wrong that chat can be extremely useful when utilized correctly. Unfortunately, like I already said in my post, the overwhelming majority of chat entries are very much not constructive, and if that's how the average player is going to use it, then the cons significantly outweigh the pros and we're better off without it.
Very rarely, maybe even never, have I witnessed legitimate constructive criticism in chat. It almost always devolves into multiple people insulting each other for the entire game instead of focusing, which is the crux of my issue with chat. You don't care when people call you out for a bad play? Good for you, neither do I. But that's not the issue. The issue is that everyone else seems to care, and it ruins games and that's not fun.
Congratulations, you're only contribution here was serving as a live example of why chat can't exist.
Maybe. Getting honor 5 is actually pretty difficult and requires quite a few games played. Receiving honors in the first place is also typically from playing well and not necessarily being a decent person.   The people that argue that toxic chat usually comes from their own team are definitely right, which is why getting rid of all-chat is pointless. Gotta throw away the whole thing.
That's a solid idea. Pings sort of accomplish that already, but I'm sure Riot can come up with some premade lines for more specific situations.
Dota 2 has a lot of chat wheel lines. Some of them are used sarcastically to BM.  - Good game, well played (both to all and allied chat versions) upon mistake/error  - "Thanks!" if someone dies and support/ally did nothing/the wrong thing  - Then custom hero voice lines e.g. "Talentless", but mostly used ironically.  - Ping "?" on death, on them doing something bad  Also no idea if these are possible:  - Ping your allies items and the time, which implies "you only have this at 15:23 i.e. underfarmed/poor/bad carry/mid"  - Ironic/sarcastic chat wheel line just for toxicity  - Spamming a laugh voice line, some can be really obnoxious - especially after every perceived mistake, error, etc.  - Pausing the game (not a thing in LoL pubs)  - Sprays on the ground like "Feed feed feed" (with pictures of puppies) or other BM  Gameplay-wise, if someone's tilted/done:  - Wasting a spell/ultimate on an ally and pinging them
In-game when you tab out to see everyone's builds, runes, etc. there are buttons next to each summoner that you can click to selectively mute that player's chat and/or pings.
You're right that it won't stop all toxicity, but that's an impossible standard. Removing chat would remove the easiest avenue towards toxicity currently available to players, which is a pretty big step in the right direction. It's certainly better than doing nothing.
Im not seeing where you got your "data." Making stuff up wont help your argument.
Just show us where you got your "data." Its that easy.
If you're going to make an argument under the basis of "data" you should be able to provide said data when asked, just like you should be able to provide your source in any other debate.
You still haven't put the /muteall argument to rest. Everyone can already make the game how you wish here by using it. Regardless of how you think it's used, it still can be used in the exact way that will solve your complaints.
>My data is that anybody who has played this game for any decent amount of time has almost certainly had multiple bad experiences with extreme toxicity.  Thats an anecdote. Not data.  And most people are fine in chat. Youre complaining about an extreme minority of the playerbase.
I use chat constructively almost every game as a JG. Usually to tell people to not invade, or spread out and watch for an invade vs certain champs. Or to give a gank eta as I’m clearing toward a lane so they know to let a wave push in a little.  Like I said earlier your being biased likely due to some bad experience you recently had
I don't care about your opinion, stop being so soft
exactly
but at least you cant get your account permaed for using those. I had to completely isolate myself from players to avoid getting banned over and over again for the most meaningless shit. The new ban system is completely trash, it makes chat impossible to use. So better just get rid of it altogether and replace it for pre approved lines.
I was aware of that, its just annoying to click each for every game. I was hoping there would be a command that would just make it quicker. Tragedy
I absolutely have, if you think otherwise you need to re-examine your logic because I don't know how to make it any clearer. Toxic players by definition use chat. Even if every single non-toxic player has /muteall active, the toxic players are still ruining games just by interacting with each other. And that's in an ideal situation, which we absolutely don't have.
Like I said in your first comment thread, it is common knowledge that league of legends has an exceptionally toxic community, even amongst other online gaming communities. If anything, you're the biased one because you actually use chat constructively. I'm happy for you and wish more people were like that. Unfortunately that isn't the case and the 11 bad eggs in the crate outweigh the one good one.
Cared enough to leave a useless comment in my comments section. Sorry, two useless comments.
go into settings and turn off chat
I think you have proven yourself unworthy of the privilege of commenting on reddit with that show of toxicity calling my contribution useless, best we reduce your further comments into only pre chosen emotes.
thanks :D
There's a big difference between showing toxicity and stating a fact. Your comment did nothing to add to the conversation, it was just pointless and self-satisfying, just like all your other comments. I won't be gracing you with a response to any further comments, you aren't worth the calories I expend typing these out.
exact same logic you use anywhere here can be applied to your reddit comments, so start with reducing your own speech to emotes first
Well deserved based on the results early on in the split, as well as how he performed in Academy.  I understand why you bring Eyla in when his visa issues were resolved, but it was evident as the split went on that Winsome just gelled with the team better.
Hopefully that means they Winsome games against C9 this time
LCS has been popping off this week with news.
No brainer, surprised it took this long
Took them long enough to realize eyla doesnt speak korean
The tweet that started it all: https://twitter.com/VulcanLoL/status/1628883367835074560
I'd imagine they've been scrimming with both and winsome performed better
This is honestly a make or break for eylas career. Dude was crazy hyped afrer his time with TL he was being compared to Vulcan and Core. Now he's a part of a super team where he legit just has to cup princes balls and they win and he fucks that up wonder if this sway's the fan vote for tomorrows match
It’s about time tbh
Finally.
Maybe unpopular opinion, but is a poor move from FLY IMO. Not because Winsome isn't good enough, or even potentially better than Eyla, but they should've changed at the start of playoffs if they wanted to make a move.   It absolutely could work out well, but changing at finals weekend instead of at the end of the split when it was already clear what Eyla's struggles were just seems like bad planning.
cannot believe there are people in this thread acting like eyla has not been all around fqs worst performing player lol
Thank you, Eyla!
Oh lord.  If Winsome is better, and FLY loses, upper management and VicLa careers are in danger  If Winsome is worse and FLY loses, Winsome career is in danger  If Winsome is better and FLY wins, Eyla's career is in danger  If Winsome is worse and FLY wins, GGS look really fucking stupid
Was hyped on Eyla ended up super disappointed with him. FQ seems like a bad first start for him so hopefully he either steps it up for summer or finds a new team that suits him better so he can actually pop off. Still believe that him and Yeon are good players that have decent potential, they both just didn't find their groove. (yeon did pretty well though just thought he'd be like peyz or danny where they immediately look like a top 3 player instead of needing a bit more development) Winsome hopefully fix some of FQ's early-mid issues but they still need spica to perform this playoffs. A lot of people are scapegoating vicla right now but Spica was horrible against C9 and consistently got outpathed and outplayed by blaber so hopefully Spica can do better and play better with Winsome.
I feel bad for Eyla, came in the middle of the split, less than 1 week of scrims with the team and no one gave him any mercy online. People were ruthless day 1 calling him trash given the circumstances. Knowing that thousands of people online from day 1 screaming at your team to replace him must be mentally draining, no one even gave mans a fair chance.
Good, sports is the closest thing we have to a perfect meritocracy and it would have been criminal to keep winsome on the bench.  People always say "give this guy more time" but you earn the right to play not given it. Eyla looked completely terrible.
Excited to see if this will be the change Fly needs to reclaim that nr 1 spot
Can't believe they'd just randomly bench the 2nd best support in North America like that right ahead of finals
Any FLY fans can explain if this would really make that much of a difference since it really feels like Vcla has been the main griefer on the team?
inb4 FlyQuest loses to GG and FLY fans will still bitch about how Prince could beat Berseker if only he had a different support
Uh oh 😳
I really wanted or root for GG going to finals, but I can't root against my boy winsome.
LS said that it want happening on Facecheck? hmm whatevers this makes me really happy that c9 wont 3-0 finals at most i think c9 wins 3-2
ggs 3-0
this is so last minute and not a good look for Flyquest I'm smelling some desperation
Was commenting on another thread I would be surprised if this happened. FLY management doesn’t seem as reactive or knee-jerk as some orgs to fan criticism. They must have been trying it in scrums and finding more success.
Can't wait for FLY to shit the bed so people will realise Eyla was not the problem but just the easiest scapegoat for an underperforming team.
Poor eyla. I feel so bad for the guy
Don’t think this really changes anything,other teams were not good earlier in split when fly was winning with winsome. And winsome is just an average player nothing special.
holy shit finally
Eyla can still have a decent career it was a really bad fit for him
Congratulations to FlyQuest for winning the LCS Spring Split!
flyquest winning LCS now.
Yes!!!  Finally!  Flyquest will beat c9 now.
Holy shit, this is big. Imagine if Prince pops off
I find it amazing a decade plus into league esports and NA still can’t develop top laners and supports that don’t play like wards. Yeah every lane gets gapped in international but when fudge and Vulcan is the best you got there’s a 0% chance of not being embarrassed at MSI and worlds. Keria is going to slap these bottom lanes back to season 2.
I don't think this is a scrim thing, I think this is a mental health thing. Prince was saying that Eyla was very nervous. After his performance last weekend the prospect of going back out there to even higher stakes is terrifying. He knows he has all these eyes on him. I also don't think FLY would have started Eyla last week if they weren't committed to him through finals, you want that stage experience v C9 for the roster youre playing this weekend.
Finally! 🙏
Flyquest learning the good old "if something works, don't fix it" adage in sports.
Damn, Vulcan didnt even qualify for finals qeekend and will still have as much playtime as Eyla
I would've given it up until super week at the max tbh better late than never but doing literally on finals weeks is insane
Elya slept with princes girlfriend
FlyQuest just became significantly more competitive
Why didn't they do it earlier...
THANK YOU GOD
Hell, it's about time
Wait... So you're telling me there'll be 5 FQ players?
The GG dream is one step closer....
A crumb of good news in the sea of sadness
Shocking
Won't matter. Fly will lose to GG. And GG will lose to C9.
Reminds me of the TSM Akaadian/Grig situation
It should have happened after week 8 tbh
It looked like it could have just been a huge communication issue. It felt like once they swapped Eyla in, there was a much bigger disconnect between jungle and mid/bot.
[removed]
https://media.giphy.com/media/Y5VUAL4LUf41a/giphy.gif
Won't happen since GG is gonna face C9 😎
They will, 3.
Every hour is a banger lmao
you better keep clenching or the spicy news train is going to hit C9 next
U cant blame them for giving Eyla a chance, but imo they took too long to replace him. Hope Fly finds success though with this roster.
im 80% convinced they did try earlier in scrims and it didn't go well. apparently during the first round robin FLY's scrim winrate wasn't very good at all but they just kept winning stage games.
Hot take: Winsome is not good and he’s gonna get exposed this weekend. People seem to think FLY was some brilliant team with him, but they were frankly exactly the same as they are now but other teams just got better.  They got rinsed in scrims all split even with winsome, so their clock was always ticking. Community is gonna be giga disappointed when he doesn’t magically solve any of FLY’s problems.
Papasmithy really liked Eyla and thought he was the "winning ticket". lmfao i think if they didnt sub out eyla after that egregious thresh play against beserker i think the whole FQ coaching staff needs to get mentally re-evaluated.
Lmao they have a chance now
Better late than never, I guess.
It was an interview with Ashley Kang before the split started when Prince told her that him and Eyla would lose every duo queue game in korean solo q.
kinda feel bad for him tbh, you know vulcan lives in his head now haha
does anyone know if they had like pre-existing IRL drama/beef? when him and vulcan clashed over twitter it def always seems a tad more mean spirited than normal (not even against that kind of stuff btw just curious)
I also imagine that they actually just asked Prince who he'd rather play with. They might have also looped other players like Impact or Spica into it too, but most definitely at least Prince.
Maybe recently, but it must not have been the case most the split or else he would have gotten subbed out earlier. I imagine despite the hate, he was prob really solid in scrims.
Holy shit 'just has to cup princes balls' wasn't an expression I knew I needed but goddamn is it so undeniably accurate when supporting a star player, in any sport. Cheers
Yeah it’s all Eyla fucking things up. Vicla getting constantly gapped, impact getting solo killed by Fudge multiple times, Spica picking bad gank angles since day 1 of spring but now getting punished for them, all have nothing to with FLY’s decline / stagnancy. Definitely just cause Eyla failed to lift up Prince enough.  Can’t wait for Winsome to get exposed this weekend so people stop acting like FLY with Winsome wasn’t a flawed team that just happened to be facing even more flawed teams at the beginning.
No way they win anything when Vicla is playing like this.
OCE imports have all honestly been hyped as fuck and non of them have delivered other than Fudge. FBI is pretty good too
I don't think it's make or break.  It was a great opportunity for him to have that didn't work out, but he can still play for other teams.
It's the papasmithy modus operandi. People in this thread say they feel bad for Eyla. Fucking feel bad for winsome. He's the one in the lion's den rn.
I don't know, Vicla has been competing pretty hard with Eyla in some of their games while taking up an import slot. Subbing out Eyla does feel like the correct move but Vicla needs to step up big if they want to beat C9 in playoffs or even in Summer.
It's nothing against Eyla as a person but it is painfully obvious that he's an Academy support playing with a super team
yeah but so was Winsome lol
I think most people here even didnt watch the games. If they watched last 10 games of FLY they would see the problem.
imo I don’t think winsome is in as much danger as Eyla even if he loses. He’s being put back in a team during a high pressure scenario.   Obviously he played with them before but imo it would be pretty unfair to give him as much shit even if they lose. It’s not like Eyla was the only problem, just the most notable
Not sure what you mean with that last point. FLY is a good team, but GG is also a good team and across the split have blown expectations. Whether Eyla or Winsome are trash the other 4 FLY members 'can' outperform GG without GG necessarily looking stupid.  Thats entirely dependent on the play and not the end results of the match.
Eylas career is his own doing, he played like fucking shit mate.
Dude played half of the split + some playoffs. He was given the chance. Playing with Eyla instead of Winsome is just downright silly if they want to win the split.
His thresh game vs c9 was hard to watch
He played 16 games, that's more than a lot of players.
I agree that it was messed up that people were so toxic to him. But saying he wasn't given a chance is a little too far. He got half a split to show something, and unfortunately at no point did he do anything to prove his doubters wrong.
Talk about a fair chance. Imagine if you are winsome, you are literally doing everything you can, everything is clicking and your team just replaces you.   Now that they are desperate they want to return to you? Eyla got a chance that wasn't deserved and winsome got a chance taken away from him that he deserved. Talk about fair, winsome was the one that was robbed.
[I mean this thresh is playing for the enemy team here](https://youtu.be/Xr_0ungnumY)
Eh I mean yeah but he was also making mechanical mistakes that were outright lane/game losing. His Rakan was atrocious in games 1 and 2 against C9, and the game 2 play where Spica ganked bot and they couldn't kill Soraka, and as soon as he left Eyla engaged and got killed in the 2v2. That put FQ so far behind. And yeah as people are mentioning the thresh stopwatch in game 3 was brutal as well.
Meanwhile Winsome being forced into a position to go god mode after this little stunt flyquest decided it wasn't worth in the middle of playoffs.
he could play a preseason, he could play 10 weeks of scrims   He's ASS.
he got more time to settle than needed and he still performed like shit 16 fucking games and he performed like trash how much more time did he need?
He was consistently running it down in last month of FLY's games though. You are not supposed to lose bot lane that bad if you are playing with the best ADC player in LCS.
Winsome didn’t exactly turn heads when he was playing. FQ was winning on stage while getting smashed in scrims - there was always going to be a downturn.
Still don’t see them winning a single game against C9 unless everyone else remembers how to not be shit
Fly management mentally booming or looking for an scape goat and blaming it on Eyla
I think there are two important things. 1. VicLa's highs are still really high, 2. VicLa isn't the one laning with Prince.
While Vicla can solo lose the game there's also been times that he's performed extremely well. Eyla (who I really was hoping would be good) has just not really done anything except look exceptionally subpar. He hasn't been a factor in any game they won, but he was definitely a factor in every game they lost.  Add the fact that FLY is all-in about playing for prince, as they should be, and you'll take the support who Prince looked best with. It's also not always just strictly about  player skill ingame. Eyla is super quiet while an underrated aspect of Winsome is that he's extremely vocal every time we've seen his comms (in both FLY and C9) which could also be a factor as to why FLY have seemed much more disjointed since Eyla came in.
I feel like everyone forgets that Winsome speaks Korean. It’s certainly within the realm of possibility that Winsome speaking Korean gave Prince a bit more comfort and also maybe helped our Vicla.
cause prince is wincon so if they want to win, he's needs a support that can perform
Vicla can at least adjust his mental and try not to tilt. That's a much better problem to have than straight up just not being good.
that is exactly what will happen
I respect all the TL flairs coming out to defend their boy but FLYs gotta try *something*  It’s clear as day that if they don’t make a change, they won’t win the title
Even if Winsome sprints it down 0/20 every single game it wouldn’t change the fact that Eyla was a huge problem for FLY  Not the only problem with mid lane, but a very big one
What? Eyla was a huge weakness in Laning and in team fights. Yes for sure flyquest has a lot of different problems but this potentially fixes one.
i mean yeah you are probably lowkey right. Prince admitted Fly had a terrible winrate in scrims during the first round-robin but just kept winning on stage. It's very possible they just found a groove/honeymoon in a bo1 environment. I'm ngl its arguably more likely GG find their first ever LCS finals now.
Winsome fixes a lot of tiny problems that would snowball games into losses for Flyquest.   For example not tilting the fuck out of Prince since minute 1 and as a result Impact also not tilting since he has no bot lane. Have you seen their player cams???? Winsome also brings more picks to the table, he has a bigger champion pool
Eyla is a problem regardless if they win or not  Eyla just simply sucks  Whether winsome is the solution remained to be seen (i don't think he is that good, but still performed better than eyla)  at the end of the day if they want to improve they need Vicla to performed better, and to get a better support cuz Eyla ain't it and i personally don't think winsome is it too (still better than eyla)
true
GGs 3-1.
Or the Bio/Treatz playoffs swap that TSM got a lot of shit for
Uh oh, we know how that ended up. Team blew up & they had to throw in a rookie at the end of the year, failing to make worlds. I was never a fan of TSM, but that roster move pissed me off so much. Akaadian was smurfing the previous split and the idea to sub him out for "fairness" was one of the dumbest roster moves I've ever seen.
It really does. 2 bad players that people pretend like will make a difference when the team is underperforming.
Just put TSM infront of these names and you’d have people flaming the decision for drama
Robot
Based GG enjoyer.
IM VERY FUCKING CLENCHED
Inb4 "Thank you for everything, Blaber and Berserker" or "Competitive Ruling: C9 EMENES"
He was given his chance as he should’ve but at no point he looked close to where winsome was. Especially near the end of his time with the team
I actually do blame them. I am fine with giving him a chance at all but you don't ruin something like FQ had going for the sake of giving a chance. You can give him a chance next split when he didn't just get off the plane.  Hopefully, they pick up where they left off but if FQ does poorly I don't want that to be used as an excused for how badly Eyla has been playing. If FQ lose I don't want to see "Told you, it's not eyla, the whole team is performing bad" when FQ clearly ruined all momentum and synergy winsome built up. You can't just sub out a player for half a season and then some and then sub him back in and hope that everything goes back to the way it was.
I agree some of the laning deaths were atrocious and winsome's weakness was his laning phase and it still looked better than Eyla's
pretty sure even iron redditors knew that eyla was shitting the bed. not sure what goes on in NA management team but its not good lol
Kind of agree. It is worth the try though, as team dynamics often change quite a bit even with one player swapped. But Winsome is not a World Class support that is going to fix FLY's issues over the night.
he is gonna get exposed this weekend and thats not because he isn't good but he won't have enough time to gel back with the team  not only that they lose all momentum as a team, u really can't usethe performance now to judge how he would performed. he needed more time with the team again.  Winsome is not amazing or great but he is decent enough and gel with the flyquest team better than eyla thats all they need tbh
From what I understand, they were average in scrims at the beginning. Decent, but not amazing like their stage record. Then when Eyla got swapped in, they gradually started getting stomped, with GG apparently 6-0ing them and C9 also claiming they were stomping them. I don't know if winsome will be the answer to FQ's problems, but...   A. You don't necessarily need to solve all your problems to look good in NA.   B. Let's not beat around the bush, support is FQ's biggest problem and they definitely need to try to fix it in some way. Again, unclear if Winsome is that fix.
So Papa giving Eyla the Ry0ma treatment back on 100T? Lol
i just realized papasmithy kicked aphromoo off of 2 teams lmao. what's actually funny is he replaced him with stunt and eyla.
FQ games are legit 4 v 5 everygame. the only difference is that FQ gets a moving ward while the other teams don't.
vulcan lives in no ones head
Vulcan is friends with Winsome since they both play soccer/football with other LCS pros. Vulcan even said in an interview that his comment was honestly just looking out for his boy who got subbed out rather than actually flaming Eyla. Of course, it got traction and Vulcan likes to meme a bit (like Zven and Spica), so they threw shade at each other before the match.
Vulcan was def the one who instigated. He said he did so because Winsome is in his soccer league or something.
They seem like they don't like each other irl, I think Vulcan Tweeted bring back winsome and eyla got offended and then Vulcan kept flaming him lol
It was either Vulcan or Eyla that basically said in an interview that this is real beef not just shit talk.
How could someone like Vulcan lmao
Well obviously its both, they scrimmed with both sups then prince/rest of team chose
No one blames Eyla alone for their wins. They blame him for his super obvious lane mistakes. He quite literally inted their lane when the wave was building instead of waiting for the wave to crash then fighting on even terms.   Even on The Dive they were appalled at that play, it’s like super super basic laning. It’s the equivalent of not being ready for the enemy lane to hit lvl 2 first and getting caught off guard - fine for a regular league player but mistakes like that should never happen to a pro.
I know right. Unless eyla was mind controlling vicla into inting, FQ still lose to C9 with the way vicla is playing.
Even if Winsome comes in and plays poorly today, people will excuse him for playing against one of the best teams in LCS while being effectively brand new to the team. With how well he played earlier in the split it would be hard for this series to hurt his career unless he plays incredibly badly.
i agree that vicla is probably the next liability next to eyla but at the VERY LEAST ive seen vicla perform well multiple times, i can see potential in him getting it together.   i have not been impressed by eyla at any point, idk whats going on but something with him and this team is just never working
Eyla would love to be able to say that he's not actually dogshit but just tilted and underperformed.
I agree he needs to step up but he hasn't at all been that bad in this playoffs. He completely gapped 100t and then was fine in game 1 + 2 against c9. Switch Vicla and Emenes in the c9 series for game 1 + 2 and nothing changes in the matches with how hard Spica + Eyla were inting, his game 3 was awful though in that series. Vicla really didn't have a chance to shine against c9 and I think can imo as long as spica + winsome don't run it down like what happened last time FQ played bc individually he's looked fine so far.
It matters less since Prince is clearly Flyquest's win condition, and also the factor it's still a bot-centric meta.
I know this sub hates vicla and he hasn’t been playing good but Eyla is on a completely different level in my opinion. I don’t give a shit about how „vicla is supposed to be a big import so that’s worse!“ what matters is the performance and Eyla was by far one of the worst supports for anyone with eyes and you really can’t go any lower that much.  You have the ability to replace him with somebody who already has synergy, it’s a complete non-brainer.
i missed like the first 2 weeks of the split but from what i saw of winsomes run and from the entirety of eylas run, winsome is still a step up.   they arent a perfect team still but at least now your support will have some impact at some point
The turret hook into stopwatch into watching prince die in stasis into giving up the double kill… brutal.
Ngl winsomes thresh game was also super bad. To the point where they threw him on tahm Kench next game
Was it not because Eyla was supposed to be the starting support and had some kind of issues, so they played with Winsome until Eyla arrived? I don't remember exactly, but pretty sure, Winsome wasn't supposed to be the starting support. I may be wrong
Bro everyone flaming this but he clearly just stop watched to avoid giving Aphel the stacks for his gun, lifesteal and a reset, thresh had everything on cooldown and nothing left to offer but auto attacks without his E passive, all this would have achieved is giving aphel a reset meaning he might now have died after the tp........ bad take by most everyone on reddit about this one
I sorta agree but it's scape goat not escape goat lol
nah they are going to use this when FQ don't win that it wasn't eyla's fault. When they ruined the completely fine synergy that FQ and winsome had and then just subbed him back in after ruining everything.
Eyla been shit mate what are u on about
I agree. They do need to make a change and support is probably the easiest change since they know that Winsome did work before.  I just  dont think thats the issue and FLY have an impossible expectation to live up to. They started so dominant in spring off the back of Prince playing extremely well, Vicla not inting yet and other teams still figuring it out.   It appears their practice was never that good even when they were dominant on stage, and they just had a strong early start. And even when they were winning every game, their gameplay did not impress - they were still winning games by playing to late and scaling, their early game was always going to be exposed when teams got better.
based
At least they won the championship with bio. With grig/akaadian they didn’t even play both at the end
Well, it might end up following suit exactly like this lol. Treatz was subbed out when TSM got thrashed against GG and then Bio came in, faced them again, and won.   Here, FLY got thrashed by C9 subbed out Eyla, putting in Winsome and…we shall find out this weekend what happens
Funnily enough, Spica WAS that rookie.
The choice to split time between Grig and Aakadian destroyed Aakaian's confidence, Aakaidan said that himself. Keeping Aakadian as the permanent starter could easily have been the difference maker for TSM to make Worlds that year.
Don't worry, Jack wouldn't lose Berserker and Blaber to one of these incoming orgs...
I'd be open for Eyla to get a chance again on DIG. He looked good last year when subbing in and in academy. Maybe on a team with less pressure he'd do better...plus he could theoretically help with DIG late game shot calling issues.
totally true, that being said the first half of the first split of the year is always wonky and winsome may not perform as he did then, i know hes done very well in salt league individually but this may not pan out. not any other options so it is a good move but just throwing that out htere
Yeah I agree. I thought maybe it was the stage nerves or something else, hope he overcomes it. I wanna see him in LCS again later when he’s “grown” more.
Did winsome ever look that good? Like I think the team plays better with him (probably due to Korean bot), but he himself never looked anything special.
In my unqualified Redditor opinion, it was perfectly fine to give Eyla a shot for a few games during the regular season when the team was practically guaranteed playoffs already; C9 did the exact same thing with Emenes & Diplex where they had a 7-2 record. Emenes absolutely bombed his first game on stage but slowly grew more confident (with one or two massively inting games here and there) and I don't see anyone complaining about him now.  The difference is that although Winsome wasn't a fantastic support, Eyla has not found his footing across the months he's been here throughout a relative slump for Flyquest. It's a fine move for a team that's all but locked already to test a new variable that could elevate them to new heights during the regular season, but at some point you have to call the experiment over if it's not yielding returns.  I assume Flyquest must have tried both in scrims and found Eyla was doing better to justify continuing with him for so long, but the stage performances have not been it.
It would suck to lose out on the chance you earned because of us immigration.
Nah this isn’t A good take IMO. You can literally see an opposite example on C9 when they took a chance in EMENES mid split. People were saying the same exact thing you are saying that they were doing good, but look at C9 now it paid off and they are far far better than just “good”.  With FLY yes Eyla holds them back but he’s also a classic scapegoat. He showed incredible promise in academy and especially when he played for TL during the lock in tourney last year.  So what is it, are you also gonna say that C9 should have stuck by diplex? Because if not, then you’re kinda trolling by using this logic
It's also much harder to give him a chance when all the games are BO1 as well. Can't try him and then swap him out for the next game
I don't think Winsome really gels better with the team tbh, people just look at FLY's record with him and make that assumption. The factor they dont consider is that other LCS teams started improving as the split went on. I personally think that FLY would have the exact same record even if they played Winsome the whole split. Most of their early wins were off the back of Prince scaling and hard carrying the game, but teams got better at punishing them as the split went on.  That said, its good to see that they are at least willing to try a roster swap, although I still think they get 3-0d by C9 if they can beat GG.
Incorrect. FQ roster (incl Prince) was done before Papa even joined.
VicLa really gonna get a pass just because Eyla was bad too?
If you're going to call out eyla why are you giving vicla a free pass?
Hey now Vicla doesn’t count as a whole player either.
I'm pretty sure he lives in eylas
He lives in your head
he lives in eyla's mom at this point
It was Eyla. Don’t think Vulcan cares he’s just meming
Tbf how many times have I watched professional botlanes lose to Ali level 2?
I dunno man, Eyla seemed fine on TL when he wasn’t under an absurd amount of pressure to immediately be a god on a team that was losing scrims since day 1 while coming in halfway through due to visa issues in his rookie year.  Like I don’t think Eyla is the reincarnation of Mata or something, but I think he’s gotten an unfair rep for what was an extremely messy situation for a first year rookie. I think Winsome is legitimately not good and has a much lower ceiling, but people are hoping FLY will randomly reascend the being the top dog if they switch back to him, which won’t happen because the competition around FLY simply got better, they didn’t get any worse, they more so just got solved.
Yeah tbh I think Eyla really fucked over FLY when he forced Spica to get hard jungle gapped 3 games in a row by Blaber.  The people calling for Winsome back probably don’t even understand that FLY has had woefully bad early games since day 1 and it’s been a problem that got worse as the opposition got better. Just look at the first game of the split against C9. Spica picks a horrifically bad gank mid that is complete countered by Blaber, and then an Akali E glitch ends up miraculously losing C9 the 2v2 fight, but 10/10 times in normal circumstance that shoulda just been a game defining bad play by Spica.   These types of things were happening all the time in FLY’s first half, but people just see wins stacking up and assumed FLY was some god tier team.   Opposition improving had a bigger effect on FLY’s win rate than the support role swap.
While Vicla was losing lane, his most egregious errors were in his sidelaning. He was playing those sidelanes way too greedy. I wonder if that's because the botlane's shit lane phase no longer made them a reliable wincon. We also saw this with Vitality when they had Neon. The Vitality topside did some really coinflippy shit because they lacked confidence in their botside. I'm not confident that Winsome will fix things, but FQ's biggest issue by far is the rock that was weighing down their main carry threat.
I know right. Are people not remembering when winsome played thresh? His whole job to lantern and he couldn't even do that.
yeah eyla was originally going to start. the issue really is that the team performed noticeably worse after the swap and they wait until fq has been on a big down swing and is in losers bracket to bring winsome back.   it's a pretty bad look and they should've just swallowed their pride or whatever was holding them back from subbing winsome back in sooner
For all I care winsome could have been supposed to start for a local clash team. You are top of the standing and had one loss, you don't fuck with something like that because it's so rare.
bruh what. hooked the turret, flayed with galeforce up so the flay doesnt matter + he's not in cage anyway, and then stopwatching when aphelios is in no world going to focus the thresh at that point in the fight.   at the VERY least if we're baiting the 2v1, hold the stopwatch til it actually matters in saving eyla so that the tp can come through and maybe its a 1 for 1      you cannot sit here and say that this entire play was not eyla trolling lol
There are literal pro support players like Treatz who said that play was shit
How about he like doesn't hook a turret or miss literally every skill known to man. He even put the box late so it did no damage until berserker walked into it to kill eyla.
Regardless of how they played it they probably just both die for going for it to begin with. Apehlios up 3 levels on Thresh and 2 on Jinx with the perfect guns. They lose this every time.
r/BoneAppleTea
True
[Is it though?](https://youtu.be/_TYKQwMZnGM?t=58)
Yea he ended up turning out good, but him being the plug for Akaadian/Grig & later Dardoch was pretty crazy. A rare W for TSM
If his confidence is destroyed by being told he needs to compete he's not worth a starting spot. Being upset about it is one thing but that just proved he wasn't worth the starting spot.
Yeah sometimes splitting time just flushes your career down the toilet  Truly the hallmark of a good player.
Bro spelled aakadian 4 different ways in 2 sentences
Why do you hate Eyla so much?
No but he made Prince look amazing so that's probably what you want from your support.
yeah, the issue is just they take the experiment too long i think,
Its sports, better player for the team should play. Yeah it sucks that someone loses a chance they otherwise should have, but once you saw the first 9 Fly games, I don't think you should have given Eyla a chance unless its in his contract/the team is pushing for it. Give him a chance in scrims before Summer maybe.
You are comparing 2 completely different players in 2 completely different situations.   Diplex was statistically one of the worst mid laners in the LCS. He was the definition of a passenger. Hell he couldn't even kill minions properly. C9 were winning in spite of him rather than because of him. C9 lost against top teams because their mid laner was just a black hole. There was 0 risk involved in the move since diplex was a non factor so unless Emenes chain ran it down every game he couldn't be worse.  On the other hand FQ was top of the standing with one of the best historical starts and winsome was playing well. Him and prince were gapping bot lanes. You don't ruin one of the best historical starts in LCS history and that's what FQ did by subbing winsome out. And once you sub winsome out you are never going back to that time even if you sub him back in.  Also Eyla isn't scapegoated, he is legit terrible.
I still think winsome and prince looked better.  Atleast winsome didnt have some huge mistake like eyla did thats game losing.  I just think they should start looking for a better support for next split. Since i dont think either of them is the long term solution  Giving eyla a chance is right, but its quite clear he is bad
Flyquest was a relatively slow team throughout the split, but it wasn't just their scaling that they played through to win in the first half of the split. Their vision control around objective setups was miles better than what other teams were showing. Every team was walking into complete darkness and getting fucked by turns off dragon/baron. They had very complex setups (for NA).   Now, I agree that it may be that other teams caught up to FQ in terms of vision/objective setup. But, I wonder how much of that was the support swap. We know that Winsome's strength is that he is really aware of what he needs to do in the midgame. He's a meh laner (still better than Eyla at this) and meh playmaker, but he does play the map fairly well to create favorable setups for midgame objective fights. I think (and maybe it's just FQ hopium) we will see a more stable botlane laning phase and better coordination around midgame objectives.
vicla is honestly a bigger offender with his bad games, legit cosplaying tactical while hes supposed to be a big name import
Eyla makes the game 4v5.    Vicla makes the game 4v6.
to be fair Vulcan has his brand pretty much set and has nothing to lose really. I do have some empathy for Eyla in regards to the shittalking aspect of it all because he's a fresh face thrown in, he's making the team worse than when his sub was in and then a big fan favorite personality starts dogging on him too. It's average bants for Vulcan but for Eyla it has to be super stressful.    But the best way to shut people up and win people back is to perform where it matters, which he hasn't done yet and may not even have the chance to do again with how poor he played.
again youre missing the point, eyla was making incredibly obvious mistakes than no lcs level support should make, mistakes that winsome isnt making. winsome might not be going above and beyond but at least botlane is playable
I agree. It is literally results based analysis. FQ had some really really close games in the first half of the split that everyone forgot cause they ended up winning those games.   >Opposition improving had a bigger effect on FLY’s win rate than the support role swap.  100% agree with this. I don't really think FQ got worse, but they didn't really get better either. Everyone else just got better over the course of the split while FQ stayed the same. They swapped supports and it sounds like they split scrim time to try out winsome recently, so it's no wonder they haven't looked as cohesive as other teams. FQ needs a full split of one locked roster, no changes. I also wouldn't be surprised if the community sentiment impacted eyla as well.
I agree with everything you said, it bothers me that it took so long to bring Winsome back
I agree with you, but then there are contractual obligations that need to be followed from my understanding.  What bothers me is how long it took them to bring him back
literally happend with diplex and emenes and no one is saying its the wrong decision because they win
Honestly,  all he needs to do is stopwatch before aph  R hits him, thats literally all he needs to do
Dude talks a lot for someone who never even did any better than academy level.
well Treatz is barely academy level so that might mean the play was actually good
yes
> Dardoch  Man I don't miss that era
man have you gone to work a single day in your life? Imagine being the employee of the month for half a year, and then your manager said "nah, this guy is better, let's let him have your position, fuck it, you know what? i just hired some another guy, let him try out your job too". How would any normal sane person would not have imposter syndrome right there and then?
His confidence was destroyed by Regi telling him in front of everyone that he was shit :/
man you are pleasent.  Akaadian was actually pretty good during that time, made no sense to sub him out for a much worse player.
Oops, was typing on phone lol
I, for one, watched Prince have to lane with him
Especially when the disparity between the players at the beginning of the split was minimal. This isnt like a top Korean was coming in to replace a struggling prospect. Winsome is pretty young in his career, the first 9 games of this split could have been the start of him being good and Fly being able to take credit for his growth.
You could scare away imports for years to come with that kind of treatment. You absolutely give him a chance.
Winsome wasn’t good when he played. The team as a whole played really well, but he was always the clear worst player.
Man's spittin so much fire here he needs an extinguisher.   Flyquest got greedy and thought they could rock the boat of one of the best LCS starts ever and get away w/ it.
At least you can say Tactical isn’t fit for ADC. He could very well be a toplaner with how he plays.
Winsome might be killing it in academy idk - but he was definitely making lots of mistakes in those earlier games that just didn’t get punished.
yeah i feel so bad for him, all that momentum they had with him meshing with the team and building their chemistry is, in theory, gone now. yet they're now expecting him to be the secret weapon to pull them out of losers bracket to reface c9 lol.  atp just keep eyla in and let winsome come back fresh in summer. poor guy 😭
> You are comparing 2 completely different players in 2 completely different situations.  > Diplex was statistically one of the worst mid laners in the LCS. He was the definition of a passenger. Hell he couldn't even kill minions properly. C9 were winning in spite of him rather than because of him. C9 lost against top teams because their mid laner was just a black hole. There was 0 risk involved in the move since diplex was a non factor so unless Emenes chain ran it down every game he couldn't be worse.  > On the other hand FQ was top of the standing with one of the best historical starts and winsome was playing well. Him and prince were gapping bot lanes. You don't ruin one of the best historical starts in LCS history and that's what FQ did by subbing winsome out. And once you sub winsome out you are never going back to that time even if you sub him back in.
or that, yeah, didnt even think about that. basically just do any chain of decisions that were not those ones that he made lol
But he was the best support the last time he was in Academy
well that is just not true lmao.
At least it gave us a banger Bo5 vs 100T.
Yeah there's a **big** difference between getting subbed out when you're playing like shit, and getting subbed out when you're playing very well and on the top of your game  Just imagine getting benched for virtually no reason, it really would hurt most people's confidence
People got a mega low bar for "pretty good" XD
I’m pretty sure Grig had a better record and was more clutch in late game fights. Also the team probably knows best about roster moves because they see x10 the games the community gets.
This ^   Eyla earned his shot and was picked to be started supp and winsome was picked for academy.
This isn't a situation where there is a large disparity between Eyla and Winsome. Eyla was hyped but still a rookie not some high profile import player whose spot is going to be guaranteed. Of course you swap your players if your high profile import is late for the split.
Tactical being unable to adapt in new metas really hindered his development. Felt like he was unstoppable on Kalista when she was good.
I have nothing against that man as a person but knowing he plays in a game is anti hype. Feels like there is nothing good to expect about him. Like Dig tried a new ADC and he was outclassed, they had to bench him, happens. Tactical plays Malphite every game because teams are too cheap to pay a decent ADC.
man i have no clue how to say this other than you must not have watched winsomes games in lcs vs eylas, this eyla guy was genuinely griefing every game on stage, and this isnt even an overstatement. winsome isnt good i agree but at least he isnt a griefer
for na? he wasnt a bottom 5 jungler so, yeah he was just pretty good  for in the world? yeah he was not good.   &#x200B;  also, how many accounts banned?
Yeah but now flyquest is a lot worse because of not having reps with winsome. Team performance is the most important thing
I don’t think it’s an adaptation issue with Tactical, he was fine on other ADC picks that didn’t require him to dominate lane or play close up.   He simply started inting in team fights and mispositioning on the map.
This just reeks of a desperation play. Bet FLY has been getting fisted in scrims all week
At least 0
You're speaking in hindsight though. Eyla was supposed to be the better player and it was supposed to be the better move. They did the right thing by following through and the decision was team performance orientated.
Nah winsome was playing so good by the end and the team was cliqueing so don't fuck it up. Doesn't matter that eyla was supposed to be better, winsome was good
maybe they need the low diamonds so the high diamonds can actually play a match? lol idk but id assume they saw a data pattern in ranked that proved plats cant be with diamonds
Still waiting for them to remove duoq entirely.
yes
No. Its 1 game every week.
Yepcock
No. Each game you play banks 7 days, and you can bank a total of 30 days (or maybe 28 I can't remember)
Dear LCS,  I dunno what you were thinking putting Finals on Easter Weekend, but don't do that again.  Sincerely,   Someone driving up from Florida through the awful holiday traffic.
It’s quite simple really. The playoffs were done in studio but finals will be at a larger stadium in NC.
Lmao “confusing”😂
Scheduling an arena is probably trickier.
It's really not that confusing lmao
It's not confusing. They need to sell tickets to these things. People are more likely to go on the weekends when there's no school/work.
They moved the date to Thu/Fri.   But then Finals is on Weekends.   They can try to make up some bullshit that through the usage of their tools, they found out the viewership is highest on Thu/Fri. So that's why they moved the dates.   But the answer is pretty obvious where the highest viewership is from seeing their actions...
It's because the LCS studio is now the valorant studio, simple as that.  Valorant does weekend games, so if LCS wants to use the studio they can only use it during weekdays- hence Thurs/friday
really sucks since I work Sundays and LCS schedule has actually been perfect for me this split except for Finals... unlucky but even if I didn't work on Sunday I'd be doing something with my family on Sunday for Easter so that is just a pretty bad day to have finals rip
You don't do a finals on a random weekday.  I don't see how that's confusing.  Also, doing finals on Easter weekend is stupid as fuck and whoever didn't see that should be fired.  You decided to hold finals in North Carolina which is part of the bible belt where about 80% of adults identify as Christian.  Pretty much everything is going to be closed for Easter and it's just going to suck to travel there for finals.  Edit: added some stuff.
In what would would anything think thry wouldn't do finals on a weekend?    Lmao. Imagine doing a live semi-finals match in a big arena on a thursday at 2pm...  Like, sorry, but explain what part of this is confusingM
The  dates have been scheduled and advertise for months. Every single time during the broadcast they told you when finals was. How is this confusing?
I’m 2 hours away and will end up doing 8 hours of driving in the downpour over the two days just because I want to see my family on Easter. Kinda pissed tbh.
I'm curious but is easter weekend a big holiday weekend? Feels like most companies don't give the time off and if you aren't religious then there isn't much of a reason to travel.
I'd rather it be Easter weekend then LCS having a two week break because of some guy who died 2000 years ago
Ah so you're saying their studio was given weekend priority to something that was said to not be affecting LCS then?  That's strange, it definitely can't be related to the giant light up "V" behind the players on stage.  I guess we'll never know
You realize the audience they are targeting is different in both situations right? Regular LCS they are targeting the online population which gets a lot of views during those specific time blocks. But a lot of people wouldn’t be able to make a live show in that time block. The live show is a different audience. Want to pack a stadium with a live audience paying admission, need it on the weekends or later at night. Quite obvious really…
Big traveling holiday, yeah. It's not exactly that people celebrate the holiday so much as it's a reason to road trip after the thaw, or before the heat of summer, depending on where you are.
A loooot of people will drive 1-4 hours to go see family, especially on Easter Sunday
Easter Sunday is a huge holiday in the sense you get together with family.   Lots of travelling and plans made that take prio over league.  I honestly can't believe LCS didn't skip a weekend to spare the viewers.
I get what you're trying to say. But also other people are saying it could have been one week earlier or later. For many people especially Americans, this is a Holiday to be spent with people. I myself am Catholic but don't care for Easter. But its an excuse for family to get together and it's nice.  I'm sure out of casters, LCS staff, production and many others would feel similarly as myself and now they are missing on the opportunity.
damn you must hate whenever you get a day off on christmas
Well religious people do celebrate Easter so no need to be a dick for no reason
There was literally one weekend of overlap with Valorant this entire time, they definitely could have done it on weekends if they wanted too.
Not only that, but regular season and finals have slightly different target audiences. In the regular season they are trying to make the games as watchable for diehard LoL fans. For major events like LCS Finals, they’re trying to make the game as watchable as possible for non-LoL fans or casual fans as well.
LoL isn't on during December
I'm not, how do you know I'm not Catholic? And how does my religion make any difference to this? Easter isn't important unless you're devout.
Not to mention its much easier to plan to watch during a single weekend of finals than to catch it every weekend.
Jesus isn't just 'some guy who died 2000 years ago' it's a little bit offensive to say that. And Easter isn't just a religious holiday it's also a mainstream holiday too
I believe it is related to the challenges feature     https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Challenges\_(League\_of\_Legends)
Aw shoot, I thought it is normal game MMR. But this makes way more sense.
Interesting. That makes sense! Thanks!  Edit: didnt see link first time
It blows my mind that people wait this long before they consider restarting their client
You made a good choice for your first main, Malphite is pretty simple and he's also relatively strong right now.  I would generally max R > Q > E > W, but you can prioritize E over Q in any matchups like Tryndamere (or other autoattackers that can heal), since they can try to sustain through your Q poke but the attack speed slow on E helps cripple them when they try to fight back.  Item-wise, as a tank you generally build according to the enemy team (armor vs. physical damage dealers, magic resist vs. magical damage dealers, health vs. both). If instead you want to be an assassin mountain, you can build AP and do more damage but die a lot faster, it's more of a meme build.  Since you're new, you should probably rely on Riot's recommended runes and items while you read through your options and figure out what you like/what works best (e.g. Arcane Comet might be a better rune if you prefer to poke from afar, while Grasp of the Undying would be better for scrapping in melee).
Someone gave you a generally good tip so I'll chime in for some details - your question is quite a complex one, but those things come from one place. Your enemy in lane.   It's pretty much a chart with some exceptions sometimes.   If your lane is melee and you expect to fight them in melee range a lot - farm grasp. Then: >If it's ad champion, go iceborn gauntlet or whatever it's called. Then: >>If it aa a lot - trynda, Jax - max e. You wanna get rid of the thing that's dangerous to you, so you remove their as >>They don't aa a lot... There is nuance... But let's just call it - max Q. Coming back, if it's ap - mordekaiser, maybe cho Can count - you probably wanna keep the idea relatively the same, but alter your build. Maybe jack sho or abyssal mask or even force of nature.
Basically you R the enemy Adc and after that you type "rock solid" in all chat
I don't know what crack you are on, but for 3 patches the main max order for malphite is RWEQ, with RQWE being favored in matchups where you don't want to trade (like Darius or jayce)  When you are maxing w and e first you build grasp runes, whe maxing q and w you take comet.
I guess I missed when that changed, though u.gg and League of Graphs both recommend Q > E > W.
No, they definitely do not
Uh... what does this say for you? https://u.gg/lol/champions/malphite/build
Malphite builds on stats sites heavily colored by people who don't play malphite.   In any ad auto attacker matchup w max into e max is by far the best.   Running grasp and maxing q is a recipe to be oom constantly.  As I said, w max has been the meta for 3 patches.
That's fair, but that's also definitely not what you said in your last comment lol, about what the stats say.
You don't. Katarina's design is flawed to the core and it got literally forced removed from Akali's kit. For some reason we're okay with it on Kat. I do not understand and will never what riot is trying to make Katarina do, but to me... They fail every single time. And the issue you talk about is just a one problem with how unfun and unintuitive playing against (or sometimes even with) kat can be. We can only praise the gods for removing gunblade.
Full bruiser isn't one shotting with ap damage, but there really isn't a good reason that the 3 hit proc of botrk is magic damage, or that wits end does magic instead of physical damage, or (and I know this isn't relevant to your post) any reason that kraken slayer deals true damage instead of physical. There are a lot of issues with the item rework that just break the game on various levels and riot doesn't seem to want to address them in any systemic sense.  &#x200B;  More to the point of your complaint; basically Riot are unwilling to make viable ap bruiser items; the closest we have is RoA + Seraphs, which Katarina obviously can't benefit from. Since she can't be allowed to have high enough scaling to one-shot people, because that would be overpowered because of her passive, she must build bruiser and since she can't build AP bruiser, she must build AD bruiser and for some reason Riot decided ad champions needed a lot of magic and true damage on-hit effects.  &#x200B;  But how do you build against it? You don't have to, just juke her q dagger and backping your 10 hp teammate who's coming to 'help you' if you're really behind save your gapcloser ability for after she uses her w and dodge her dagger pick up. She's really bad/easy to outplay. She's also really slow, so if you go around popping all the jungle plants, she's easy to gank any time she leaves lane to roam.
Yeah the akshan rock griefers are a different breed.  My trick with them was to pick a champ that could hop the wall to join them and leech exp/minions. It shouldn't make a difference to them, but it always makes them rage because it gets in the way of their main character syndrome or causes them to die because they don't level up in time.  Usually can get to level six or so and then go do interesting things instead since I have enough stats to fight. Other funny options are using anivia wall/trundle pillar to interrupt the spins
iirc they played like this to level up their account until level30 and then sell it. so basically theyre doing this as a bot account, they play the game themselves but doing very little.   i either dodge if i see any akshan, or i pick top/jungle champs when theyre in my lobby
You're level 1 when he hits 18? Wat
This has to be a troll post right
yeah i ran into an akshan who did that too, actually a terrible gameplay experience  i was vayne mid and eventually just moved top to soak a bit of XP so i could have levels to go with my gold  i reported the akshan and said something along the lines of "probably not a reportable offense, but this was awful to play with"  no idea what else you'd do about it, and i don't really think it warrants a change to the game outside of something specific to co-op vs. ai to make it stop working (like giving enemy minions invincibility in the enemy base before towers fall or something)
It's grief but don't really matter, the game will be won anyway without any asle it's a bot game after all, someone can go 1v2 toplane , peolple already are doing that when someone want to play jgl in the gamemode.
It's a bot game nobody cares lol
Is it really griefing if he wins the game with this strategy?  I understand it's not fun for other players if someone takes all the resources, but that's just how league is. If you carry the game, it's not griefing, even in bot games, that's my opinion.  I think the best solution would be to just make the AI respond to a champ proxy farming in their base, if the strategy only works because of bad AI, fix the AI.  My suggestion, next time something like this happens, and you have nowhere to farm. Just go with him into the base, flash the wall, and farm with him. At least until you're strong enough to play the game. Then just go do your thing, get kills, farm plates or jungle camps, or whatever you enjoy doing.
Wtf is this thread lol. It’s a bot game, you’re not getting griefed lmfao. Get over yourselves, holy.
i think starcraft might be a more suitable game for you
spin on rock
He waited until everybody was locked in before even hovering Akshan. Otherwise I would've picked Anivia
Due to him spinning around the rock in the enemy base, the mid wave and the side wave (in this case bot-side) are perfectly pulled towards him. It's basically as if my lane only has ally minions. Without minions dying, no exp. Hence the lvl 1
No there are genuinely people who play AI matches instead of real matches. Weird group but they exist, introduced a friend to league and they only did AI matches cause real matches were too difficult/stressful esp with how 1 player doing bad can ruin the match
Why do you think that?
It's 100% a reportable offense, because it's griefing. Griefing is on the list.  My comment about changing the rocks for example was made out of frustration. I'm sure there's a way better way to deal with this that I can't think of at the moment. Your idea is already better, but I don't think riot will ever change anything in regard to co-op games. It's part of the game, but it is totally forgotten about and even looked down upon.
To me, yes it is griefing. I play the game for the game, not to win (even though it is the objective; confusing, I know)  I'm fully on board with fixing AI. Riot showed years ago (doom bots) that it can make decent AI. It's sad that co-op games are reduced to not even being an afterthought, but it's probably due the lack of players compared to normals/ranked.  I do intend to do as such should it happen next time. As mentioned in my replies, I didn't think everything through whilst in the game due to frustration. It's definitely something I have learned from that game.
Genuinely curious: why does it being a bot game make it so that it is not griefing? I don't understand the logic/correlation behind this
How so?
But there is top and jg still?
I'm similar to your friend. Once in a while I play some league and when I do, I don't want my enjoyment of the game to be dependent on how others are playing and/or talking. That being said, I also play aram from time to time for the same reason. There it sometimes gets annoying already, but that's more due to the random champions that you get. That's how aram works so I deal with it.  Vs AI is different in that regard. Someone actively chose to take the enjoyment of playing away from multiple people (in this situation at least). For the rest you can play however you want and it will pretty much always be fun. Weird builds, 2 duo lanes and no jungle, it all works without getting flamed for it.  When PvE events happened, I played those a lot as well. Doom bots (good old times), the star guardian event, the odyssey event, all very good memories for me personally.
How were you level 1 when he was 18?
maybe you have the main character syndrome :P
all they need to do was tu revert the E infinite spin thing. it wasnt like that before, but for some reason rito decided to make it like that and never looked at it again despite people have been calling this out
But it's still the same game, he's not breaking any rules, he's not cheating. It's just a different game state than you're used to.  Try to catch yourself if you're getting frustrated and take a step back, you don't play games to feel like that.    > I play the game for the game, not to win   Well, the game is to kill the enemy nexus, there are infinite ways to get there. Personally I love different game states and weird strategies, trying to figure out the best ways to win is what I enjoy most about league. What do you enjoy about league?
Its bot games my dudes, if you dont know that Akshan is going to grief your team and 2 people take smite you will have 3 or even 4 people having to go to top lane and soak whatever xp there is.
Top was a duo who took the minions there, which is fair. Jungle wasn't a proper option since I had a Cass with tear. It took me 4 backs just to clear chickens, which ended up giving not even enough for lvl 2
Due to him farming 2 lanes within the enemy base he got full exp from there. He continued to do so without punishment because AI isn't exactly smart. I was still lvl 1 because there were no minions in range that died for me to get exp from, nor could I properly jungle. I could've shared lane with top, but I chose not to (I mentioned this somewhere else here). Me staying lvl 1 was caused by him, but made worse by my own choices
Probably just sat in lane poking the ai trying to take tower instead of just flashing into the base to share XP.
I think I understand your point of view. I don't fully agree though. You are correct in saying that it has no influence on the outcome of the game. We still won, as expected. That's not what my complaint was about though. For me, the game was being ruined by making it near impossible for me to play. It's not about the kills (I play plenty of support). The player in question purposely made me and someone else into a walking test dummy due to taking away the normal source of experience aka the lane minions. I was left with basically walking around, dodging everything, since nearly anything would one shot me. Had I picked up on his plan, I would've maybe gotten a support item for some passive income, so that I could get items and then try some jungling for exp, but I was in lane before I noticed what he was doing.  To me griefing isn't limited to whether the game is won or lost. I couldn't play the game at all. That is also a form of griefing. At least to me it is.   People play normals/ranked mostly for winning (and get frustrated when they lose). I play co-op to enjoy the game for the game (and the lack of toxicity, mostly)  I do understand your point about sensitive bot-only players as I have met those as well (whining about who claimed which role first the whole game long for example). I don't think I fall under the same category, but I do see why you might put me there. That's fine, because everyone is entitled to their own opinion.  Regarding your very first statement (similar to stealing CS or kills), I disagree mostly. Some people share your lane and purposely steal CS/kills. Those people are annoying, but you at least get exp and you get to be a champion still. The situation I'm talking about removes the exp from that, leaving you to become less than a minion at times. Again, I do understand where you're coming from with that statement.
You're a cynical ranked player, OP is an optimistic co-op player.  You've been trained by the game to expect the worse from your team mates and carry by yourself, he wants to have fun and still believes in playing as a team.  I can empathize with both your points. "they're just better at bot games than you" made me laugh, but the guy just wants to have fun.
Yeh and? That's just how it is. 4 top and end asap to get out of the game asap and just report the guy   Unless riot change afk detection with akshan E or remove the infinite spin there is nothing else to be done
Chickens is the hardest camp to clear as there are so many of them, gromp is probably the easiest since it's only one target but if it's still too strong you can do scuttle? And you don't need to kill minions to get XP btw, you just have to be in range when they die so you can either just go top anyway to get at least to level 3-4 or flash over and soak XP with the akshan and once you are strong enough you can just jg  Sorry you had to go through this game but there were ways to make it less awful
Yeah, I saw your other comment after writing my question. I wasn't aware Akshan could do that.
I do admit that I could've done more to mitigate the griefing that Akshan did. I did take the scuttle once I had a tome (ran out of mana before scuttle died and Cass basically has negative aa dmg). I didn't want to go top, because I felt awful if I took the exp from them. Flashing over to get exp from Akshan is something I just didn't think of, so you make a good point on that one.
Yeh just a few ways to at least make it a bit playable. 2 people and 3 people splitting xp is not much of a difference so don't feel too bad as that would be the quickest way to get out of the game by pushing together even if it means the resources are getting further divided
In hindsight, I fully agree on this. It's still infuriating that someone would willingly do this whilst not being afk to boot. Your suggestion for a change on afk detection mentioned below is a very good one actually
He can still just click a bit everytime be gets the warning so idk  But yeh idk what they gain from doing this
Literally nothing. You have insanely boosted stats at the end of the game, but that's it. There's no skill expression that comes with it. It's purely screwing over multiple people so that you can nearly one shot every bot at roughly 15min in the game
watching TF blade put his cam & mic back on is my peak hate watching. The guy will start a trade, miss every spell and still find a way to cry about his team at the same time. Not to mention banning half his audience in chat as soon as they laugh at his play or call him out on his flame.
All of tfblade's accounts(sorted by when he gave up on them):  [fight with brain](https://www.op.gg/summoners/euw/fight%20with%20brain)   [forsenCDKEKW](https://www.op.gg/summoners/euw/forsenCDKEKW)   [ONE LAST TIME99](https://www.op.gg/summoners/euw/ONE%20LAST%20TIME99)  surely the 3rd account is the one right guys?
Thanks for posting my man!
Yes surely when you inevitably run into the statistical occurance of having weaker teammates for an unfortunate amount of games it means the account is cursed and you need to open a new one, surely the new account wont run into the same mathematical truth, right? surely playing 50 games on new account is better than just taking the L and losing 10~ unfair games before going back to climbing right?
🙏 Glad its useful!
They're just abusing how the hidden mmr works.  The longer you winstreak with minimal losses the higher your mmr gain gets each match bc riot knows you are smurfing and is trying to get you to the correct rank.   If you lose too many games for any reason the system takes away your smurf mmr gains and puts you on normal ones as it thinks you have finally found where you belong.  This is why they make new accounts because it is actually easier than to slog it through with normal gains.
as you play more games and start to trend towards a 50% winrate, your MMR will become more rigid. making new accounts is undeniably the most effective way to grind for rank 1 if you're able to play near that level.   he's not trying to reach a mathematical truth, he's playing variance like he always has and always will. he's good enough that inevitably he will get into challenger abusing the highly elastic MMR of new accounts.
If it’s anything like the preshow for Worlds, it will be for both days and weather permitting, both inside and out. It rained a bit on the day of the finals, but they still had everything “open” outside. I’d recommend going early, just make a day out of it!
https://twitter.com/LCSOfficial/status/1644473507735011329?s=20
He wins about 52% of his games most likely
Mostly because people are bad at closing games and Asol has pretty much infinite wave clear from a very safe distance.   He can stall games until he becomes lore accurate Asol and wins any team fight.
>325 dust at level 6  "I've never played or read this Champ in my life before, but here my take on balance."  Redditors sometimes...
Low elo nerf line is 53% so 52% is fine, this is from riot metrics
Because he has been *vastly* simplified in his gameplay rework. He no longer has people tanking his WR just by trying him out, and has more people deciding to main/get good on him.
Rather than nerfing numbers, what asol needs is for specific item combos and interactions to be looked at.  E shouldn't completely stall waves, it makes it basically impossible to siege against him.  His synergy with Rylais needs to be looked at, it makes it borderline impossible to reach or fight him as a melee champ, especially since his threat range lategame really is not that short.  And the the RoA seraphs rylais setup has too much damage for how tanky it is. Having Q scale more off AP and nerfing the dust ratio could be helpful here.  It's extremely frustrating to face him as a short ranged champs, since even if you manage to reach him, he's got so much HP + seraphs, it's hard to kill him.
It's 50.73% not 52
Riot should change the champion so it at most wins 50% of games.
A good reason to nerf the champ if it’s problematic in every Elo.
Yea, it should very very rarely be empowered at level 6.
I double checked and Asol has a 54% winrate in bronze and 53% in silver according to u.gg.
For low elo it is 52.5% for champions with high ban rate, and he has 53.1% winrate in that elo according to [u.gg](https://u.gg) anyways.
Why?
except 50% isnt problematic.
325 stacks is freaking MINUTE 30!!    Who is Level 6 at 30?  Should you ever found your selfe there I'd highly recommed to start from tutorial again.
Should they buff chanps to have a 60%+ winrate, or balance them to a 50% winrate?
It’s 52-53% in every Elo.
You understand. Unless the Asol is turbo inting, he should not have empowered ult before level 11. It shouldn’t be something easy to obtain early.
Yeah but why asol? Did you just lose a game against him or what? There are many champs sitting at 52% and higher.  Plus your comment on bronze win rates makes no sense. People in bronze also play 5v5 so 5 players are winning and 5 players are losing. If you say that most champs should have a sub 50% win rate in bronze there would also be champions having a much higher winrate in bronze (the mean will always be 50%)
What is... Every elo? Last time I checked, he was below 50% in plat+ which is bare minimum you should use to track champions strenght. When you check for win rate in bronze... Well you can as well nerf every single scaling champ, I'd imagine.
so is ahri, annie is higher, viktor is getting close etc.  a lot of champs sit at this winrate and are just fine.
If you look at champs that have a 50%+ winrate in bronze, it’s not a huge list. The fact that Asol has a 52% winrate in bronze suggests he is a low skill champ and the fact that he has a 52% winrate in all other elos suggests he is a noob friendly champ that is overtuned.
All of them according to lolalytics. Actually, u.gg has him at a 54% winrate in bronze, only going to round 50% in diamond.
I believe they took the win rate from my post which was discussing the items rather than individual champions balances  Though in terms of tracking these numbers there's unfortunately no good source for aggregating data based upon multiple factors including match length, items, elo, etc.. The major analytics and tracking platforms such as u.gg, [op.gg](https://op.gg), mobalytics.gg to name a few all tend to just combine it regardless of these factors   I'm sure its possible via riot games api though balancing around low elo players is usually wrong but thats not to say high elo players can also have terrible macro but in terms of all champions currently he seems to be problematic comparing him to ahri, annie and viktor is not adequate cause none of them scale
Please... Don't use bronze as a measuring stick. It's like giving toddlers chess and saying king is overpowered cause one of them took it and smashed all other pieces with it. Besides that, I think you're using stats incorrectly my friend. This patch has been up for a very short time and it's not accurate. That's how sample size works unfortunately. Everything about sol from last patch to this was either nerfed or not touched(I believe this was the nerf patch, but I can't recall for sure). It for sure wasn't buffed tho, so let's get that clear. Asol is either weaker or same with previous patch. Go, check stats for it. It's quite obviously negative and it has multidude of counters, unlike 2-4 right after rework. Asol is now gonna be in a slow upward win rate trend, due to people hopping of a previously op pick and leaving otp's to move wr higher. Previous Asol was pretty much always high wr. It was okay, cause it was only otp's playing it and they tend to have 52+% wr, due to sheer experience with a pick. As the situation stabilizes(cause other players also learn to play against the pick better as time goes on), it will get either nerfed or buffed.
Well... I agree that analysing that data may be quite a challange. But in the end it is what it is. Would riot nerf a champion just cause 50 people found an incredibly op build, while rest of the players still go a build that's 49%? It is exactly why you also can't balance around bronze. "Let's get grasp of the undying, tank asol to ~50% wr, surely that's a good balance to be around 50..?" Or "Let's make sure the bronze asol's who get 80 stacks in 5 minutes, just cause people don't walk out of e, q or r is 50% wr " Like, you just... Can't do that. Sometimes you must - Master yi being 70% wr would be a good thing to at least adjust - but I'd say 45-55% is just... A victim of circumstances.  Also I think Annie is absolutely broken for last couple of patches(I remember they nerfed her, didn't play enough on the patch to see if it was enough - don't think so)
So the play experience of bronze-gold AKA the vast majority of players does not matter according to you?
I haven't personally had issues with Annie this or the prior patch I'm sure I've lost a game or two but her pickrate is fairly low still fortunately  on the build factor it's just an overall issue with the game in general and one of the things I personally think was lost after the item rework is the years of balance :p  still would be cool to see analytics based on certain factors instead of a majority maybe then more people would abuse certain builds mahaha more abuse = more balance in the long term in some sense
I go to specify later in this thread that sometimes champions needs adjustments to work better in lower tiers. I also specifically said bronze not gold or silver. It's an extremely low rank where runes, builds and champions are a concept that's far less likely to impact the game than anyone's performance.  If you expect me to backpedal, tho - no, I don't think champions should ever be balanced around iron, bronze, silver and to be honest, gold too. Does that mean player experience should not matter - that's you trying to strawman my point, I never said that.  Riot often goes out of their way to adjust champions to not be "unbeatable" on low tiers while good in higher ones. They often also fail miserably creating shit like yi that can choose where to go after alpha strike. They try though and that's nice and needed  But the idea of *balancing* a champion *around bronze* is just laughable. Let's balance pawns in chess so they can fight of a queen, cause newbies lose queens too easily...
Lucky you, specifically about Annie support. Or maybe I'm bad. But her wr was dumb as hell. Anyhow the issue you talk about is.... Well, extemly hard. What if some champion randomly has extremely high wr, with force of nature, even though it's a completely out of place item(maybe, force of nature on vayne or sth). It might be a new hidden tech... Or just a thousand matches against 5 ap champs. It just need an insane analysis and that's... Not gonna be easy to create
ASOL has around the same winrate in silver and gold as well. They should be balancing around the experience of most of their players or else the game will die off. There is a reason they created the “normal,” “skilled” and “pro” balance categories because ignoring most players is a recipe for disaster.
Still within attack range so normal
Is that normal?  Did it happen to anyone else?  Should it be like that?  (wasn't my best game)
Oldest trick in the book
Yes, it’s normal and happens all the time when in this position.
CLG and TSM have been B tier orgs for a while. Bjergsen had a long tenure, but it’s a reasonable time to retire. The doomsaying is getting old.
another overreaction from reddit. nothing new
can we put the doing good at worlds will increase viewership conspiracy to bed already
What are people on about, it has has been declining for YEARS, TSM and CLG didn't really bring that many viewers over other teams in recent years. This isn't 2012. LCS hasn't seen decent viewership since 2016.
I'm thinking the opposite.   With CLG dying and tsm probably going away soon, there could be new life with new orgs into the LCS.   I doubt many fans were left from the TSM/CLG glory days because those are like....5+ years in the past.
Honestly. Any time anything happens lately = NA is dead/dying. It’s getting annoying lmao  Bjerg has already retired previously, and has been pretty mediocre since his return.. His retirement won’t effect anything  TSM/CLG have mostly been bottom feeder orgs for a while (CLG had a decent past two splits, but before that they were consistently at the bottom for years. During which literally everyone was calling for them to be removed from LCS!! even people on the CLG sub)  Most of that TSM fanbase that people constantly bring up, is probably long gone anyway. considering the past few years the org has had. I can’t imagine that it isn’t just the most diehard of fans nowadays
You're gonna say FLY GG DIG TL EG combined have a higher fanbase than TSM? If TSM leaves, a lot of viewership is gonna be gone too.  Same goes for G2, and FNC. If they were to leave, viewership in LEC would drop as well.
Be honest with yourself, viewership won’t go higher for NALCS without international success. Cloud9 winning back to back to back to back lcs tiles is gonna do it?
NRG especially is huge. They always make a lot of content with their teams and put a lot of effort into content.
> Any time anything happens lately = NA is dead/dying  I mean... have you seen the viewership as of late?  LCS is, without a doubt, dying. Death by a thousand cuts.
lol noone gives a fk about TSM for like a 6 or so years since Regi was known to be a absolute douche.   the remaining that like league at all will just cheer a diff team. funny how bandwagon style fans think everyone obviously likes the "popular" team. they havent even been that popular for a long time.
And still generates more money than every region not named LPL.
Does it generate said money in profit?  I'm more interested in who is actually running a profitable show, not that the LCS has spent X million to lose X + 50 million a decade into its existence.
Maybe LPL is the only region running profitable, and LCS was just barely not profitable in I believe 2021 as stated by head of esports.
I don't think he mentioned a single thing about being "barely not profitable" but feel free to cite that if I'm wrong.
This is normal unfortunately
It's a consequence of Riot making you waste a lot of time before you can really play the game.  For quite a few people $1-60 is worth far less than wasting a day of their time fucking around before they can play with their friends.
That's what happens when leveling takes a huge amount of time and they sell 30lvl accounts for 3-5$.
What I do is just report them, and I receive later league’s feedback. Thx btw so sad this happens
Spoiler, most of the time they don't get banned. I doubt the feedback reports are even real.
I'd easily give up on Roa+seraphs of I could get twin shadows on my Veigar again..
One main point I had completely forgot about mentioning... ~~(got side tracked)~~ I think the main issue is not necessarily theses champions damage output rather the combination of the damage output + sustain
I feel like they are part and parcel of a larger systemic issue. These items, on these Champs, are meant to allow them a high scaling build with a relatively large health pool and effective healing.   I think the problem isn't that they are too strong, but they don't have strong enough counters.  Assassins and early game Champs are primed to attack these scaling Champs early, at their weakest, and there isn't enough of this leverage being taken.
The problem is that mages dont really have alot of items. Most of their items just straight up lack damage and compensate by giving health for some reason. So mage mains (myself included) just pick a champion who scales and will do damage regardless i.e. veigar , asol, cassiopeia. That way they it doesnt matter if the items suck all they need to do is not die so we build the most befensive items we have resonable access to.
We bitching about 51.5% winrates now? Thats too much huh? And lets not forget kassadin with that 49.2%, someone please stop that menace!  Only aurelion out of these seems op.
as a ryze main, nerf roa into the ground. I dont care. Just dont touch my seraphs, it was already nerfed.  Currently I like everfrost more anyways. I just wonder if ryze would need some compensation buffs that hes never going to get, if they were to hard nerf roa.
There is a world where we people who love champions in x state get to watch them become more or less powerful in states that are entirely unfun :(
i hate that they removed so many cool items... i dont get it. Just one of the many things to add to why i really dont like riot games as a company.
Well yes but in patch 13.4 they nerfed experience gain whilst being low level so even if you do get early picks as an Assassin the reward tends to be less than it used to be hence lots of people running teleport mid instead of ignite because getting a pick as an assassin running ignite isn't as impactful as it used to be especially if you end up resetting and the opposing laner is right back to farming     Not to mention most veigar and asol players with decent macro will play safe enough to avoid getting killed early game both veigar and asol also have decent disengages veigar has his cage and asol has his astral flight      Another thing in my experience is veigar running first-strike does not lack in early game damage and his newer "nerfs" actually make his late game scaling for his Q and W do more damage
Yeah that is definitely an issue lots of the items for mages are on-hit though in my experience it makes the current game of mage vs mage pretty one-sided especially leading into late game or against snowball champions     Even seen champions slowly move into weird brusier builds which even though tend to be broken/good are entirely unfun to me
The win rates don't paint the whole picture these numbers are averaged out between all regions and all ranks that was not the point of this post rather something to back the current issue with damage output and sustain of the underlying items and to see the opinions on others via poll and discussion
Yeah mage items have been suuuuper scuffed since mythics. You literally couldnt build glass cannon if you wanted to im pretty sure the only mage items that dont give health or some defensive stat are liandry's and luden's but those are mythics. With it being like that champions who want super high ap numbers but arent veigar arent viable. Like why cant horizon focus give 120 ap and no health its not like 150 health is alot and the champs that would buy that item dont want health anyway.
try the tank mage assasine Gragas
Malphite
Specifically for support, Thresh is really good ahead or behind. His kit has solid disengage and utility when your team is behind. When ahead, his hook makes for easy kills and being able to reposition teammates with lantern always feels good.
You are looking for something that simply shouldn't exist. A balanced champion can't be strong in all stages of the game while being good from behind. At the very least, one can't be true. I can agree that tanks usually fill a role you're looking for but if strong=big impact... Tanks can help, they won't win. And most of them still feel bad from behind just... Can kinda hide behind cc.  Soo... What, Master yi? He's extremely shit from behind and not very strong early. This will be signed by many hard carries. Kassa, kata, twitch, w/e.  And so and so. What you're looking for is an op pick. So you will have to change your pick each patch. This patch It's probably gragas. I personally think Cho is very good if you don't get him a hard losing lane. Pantheon is quite strong from my experience and w stun with e shield is very good even if behind. Also can get back into the game by killing enemy bot with ult.  Anyhow, to get what you want... Go for op pick every patch, practice few games on normals, then try to get lp.
Tanks are kinda the only class that is still useful while behind. Or like pyke is always helpful.
Gankplank He does it all, you name it, he have it
some people moght not agree with me but Rhaast (red Kayn) even behind he has enough dmg to be a problem if not killed qnd sustains enough to stay alive long enough to become a problem
Every champ has their weaknesses and that’s part of the game there is no super overpowered champ and if there is they usually get nerfed.   I’d say play an easy champ like garen or annie and learn the game thru them, it’ll teach u the game and help u improve your overall gameplay without having to focus solely on champion mechanics.
Gragas really kinda nutty right now for real
Tank mage assassin? Sounds like a fun combination. What others besides Gragas.
More like Pyke is never helpful
Yeah I figured tanks would always pose a problem.
gankplank is too hard specially if you’re starting off nope

jack off
All I'm saying TL   Cain is free agent
"due to differing opinions and MaRin's personal issues".  Sounds like throwing shade tbh.
Very curious what those differing opinions were
I wonder if this means they're blowing up the TLCK project or if they're just going for a new coach.
LCS: “we’re trying something different this year”  *explodes over the course of a week*
It's not unexpected. MaRin wasn't a coach on another team before this. I always hated the "MaRin will fix Summit because they're both top laners" as if MaRin had been active in LoL like at all recently. To go from retirement to Head Coach was always wildly off to me. It might explain why the team had a hard time improving/course correcting.
Shhh they snuck this in right after the Bjerg announcement.
fuck it man, let corejj coach. (/s)
I’m just saying Bwipo is sitting on TL as a streamer looking for a team…maybe this is related
yea Marin should have stayed in T1 or his previous org for junior coach, get experience and then started with proper coaching but ur know NA so why not :D
With a team having such high caliber of players, it's definitely gotta be issues at the coaching level for them to struggle this much. Hope they make minimal roster changes and instead focus on improving strategies with existing roster
Honestly? Save your money and kick summit, add MaRin to your roster D:
Yet pyosik is still employed
Hope TL gives some academy mid/tops a shot now. I think yeon can still work but summit isn’t it for his potential high cost and performance (in NA at least) and Haeri isn’t impressive, rather see a native top and new mid. We seen that certain players step up if they have true potential and well, perhaps it’s just a dysfunctional team and NA in general but yeah…
I think this is the best approach. I don’t think the issue was entirely TL’s players. They can improve, but need the right support.
i forgot he was the coach, I'm surprised he didn't sub in for summit
I still don't really understand the "all Korean" thing.   Are Haeri and Yeon that fluent in Korean? I assume they've spent most/all of their lives in Australia and the US, respectively.   Was speaking Korean just to make Summit and Pyosik more comfortable, and to better listen to Marin, an unproven coach with no experience building systems in the LCK?
Imt next please
Why didn’t they just kick summit get Marin top and get a new coach would have been more fun
“personal issues”?
Just a stupid move by TL to bring in Marin as a head coach on TL for his first coaching gig in general. This year should've been Marin in Academy learning how to coach well and TLA coaching staff being promoted alongside Yeon Haeri. In the end TL should just try to revamp coach + topside now. Either commit to Haeri or Pyosik or drop one of them. Imo haeri looked like an anchor to pyosik but it's still whether TL thinks their talent has promise beyond this split.
Yeah, no way is TL running that roster back.
TL are such a cringe fest. Haven't seen an org take so many high profile people and turn them useless. And then throw more money and buy more high profile people just to kick out.
3 world champs can't win
I would love to hear what those differing opinions were.  My guess is that Marin was right about something and TL management didn't want to swallow the bitter pill of truth.
But yet you keep ChokeJJ
Who would have thought hiring a headcoach that wasnt in the scene for years would not be a good idea.
No coach will ever fix NA. This region is complacent on winning LCS and being happy with that. Players don't really have to try very hard, all they have to do is work hard enough to keep a spot on the team. LCS started 2013? So it's been 10 years of "we're trying something different this year" this region is doomed.
rebuild around summit and yeon, the other 3 are frauders
I will forever remember him as the "coach" who tells his players, in TL SQUAD, to just figure it out themselves. I also remember getting flamed by TL fanboys for saying he's a fraud "coach" xdd.  "After we get home, go and review your games and figure it out yourself."   "If you already know you have that problem, fix it then."
Rip TLCK.
STEVE  just promote Spawn already he proved himself in academy!
Wow I wonder who could've predicted that a top laner who's entire career was TPing on demand with Rumble wasn't a great coach
So i wonder if mir will be brought up or if pyosik will stay cause mir did win MVP of the CL league cause I imagine pyosik is pissed he didn't even make playoffs
Hoping the personal issues are more just homesickness and adjusting to living in NA versus some kind of issues with the team.
Does he want to uproot his life in Korea to come coach for a mid-tier team though?
inb4: "Welcome our new top laner, MaRin!"
paycheck stealer gone
They just keep RO as coach, no?  Or… RO to jg, Pyosik to coach…?
Truth: Not every world champion is fit to be a coach
Tanks.
Wait wat never know Marin aka the best top laner in LOL history, was coaching TL.
Surely Dodo has to go now too? It has been a long series of bad decisions by TL, last year it was Dodo and Steve calling the shots together. But this year was all Dodo and at some point you have to realize that he doesn't know how to build a championship team.
Please man.. Cain's "Thank You" video was sad. Bring him back!  https://youtu.be/H6JcocxJPDo
Doublelift said he was the best coach he ever had (atp at least)
Does he want to uproot his life in Korea to come coach for a mid-tier team though? And didn’t he leave in the first place because he wanted to go get married?
Best coach we've ever had
Subscribe.
Bring back Cain, Impact, and DL with Core.
YES
Cain from John Wick? Nahh, he's too expensive even for TL. You gotta to be a member of high table to hire him.
Yeah that part seemed a little bitter. Because that was tacked on, it reads like,   “WE MUTUALLY, TOGETHER, NOT JUST MaRin, decided to part ways. We upset him with our opinion, causing him to want to leave, so we agreed he could leave. He clearly has personal things going on at home, that he needs to sort, before he can be an effective coach.”
Months ago I got flamed for telling people Marin with no experience was a huge gamble. Worlds champ and high elo or what not. People seem to be clueless that the best players aren't necessarily the best coaches. Time and time again it gets proven.   In real sports the best coaches don't need to be skillfull at playing, but somehow in league people are circle jerking it needs to be a high level ex-player for some reason.
Man imagine having the kind of ego to talk shit on a worlds winner when you can't even get out of groups!
That’s NA/America for you
Sound like Marin own personal problem
"You guys need to play better League of Legends."   "No."
TL: Hey Marin, we're looking forward to learning from your experience in Korea and implementing the system that helped you win worlds.  Marin: OK great, here is our schedule (filled 18 hour block of practice, scrims, solo queue)  TL: *Thank you, Marin*
Differing opinions were that Marin was more interested in playing solo queue than preparing for LCS. Head coach should understand the game at a high level but shouldn’t be playing as much solo queue as the players.
Who knows. NA is trash so it’s hard to blame a coach for how absolutely shit the whole scene is
It’s very possible they just realized that hiring a no experience head coach to coach an experiment with other rookies was not going to make them better.  Worlds MVP and rumors of shot calling are apparently more enticing than just getting a mid tier LCK coach, which may have payed better dividends.
Hopefully, they need a new topside if they plan to compete.
if they don't blow it up, I don't see the result being any different in summer.
This isn't part of the explosion though, this is typical staff shifting off an underperforming team during mid season that happens every year in every league to a degree.
I'm staying SUPER CLENCHED
Yeah but no one really cares about Marin leaving. This is just a not performing coach leaving
Every day at LCS is a banger
I mean, it's diffy, usually the implosion is during worlds so this year we're getting at least 2!
Score went straight from the military to GenG's head coach position and it worked out ok. Admittedly that was a gamble and people were skeptical at the time for good reason, but I can understand why TL chose to try it out. Bringing in someone new to head coach like that probably really relies on having a strong supporting cast of coaches. To go back to GenG, Score has Mafa who has been coaching for a lot longer and was his former teammate, so they probably work well together. Plus the other members of the GenG staff. Not sure if TL had something similar to help Marin adapt.
> as if MaRin had been active in LoL like at all recently.   he is? he's still high elo and invested in league
Iirc Marin is still playing solo queue around Master Elo when he was coaching LoL the Next. Not sure right now if he is still playing though or before he join TL.
TL did the same thing with Jatt. No coaching experience whatsoever, but straight to head coach because he's an analyst. Idk what TL is looking for in the head coaches but I hope its more than "knows about the game at a high level." Coaching/teaching is an entirely different skillset
Core coach, Korean-speaking Bwipo supp let's go
Well first you have to let KiwiKid coach for a year so corejj learns how to not coach.
he doesn't speak korean
>he doesn't speak korean  From this subreddit to the TL subreddit. You'll never be able to escape the "Put in Bwipo" fans lmao
Bwipo is really bad tho
The drafting was so frustrating. Lucian/Nami sucked for 80% of the time that it was played in LCS and TL kept trying to win with it lol. LCS is Bo1, you can't be stuck on something that long and expect it to work or you'll be out of playoffs. Toward the end they tried to switch it up a little more, but it was too late.
>With a team having such high caliber of players  Other than Summit, who is high caliber? CoreJJ struggled last year, not horribly but it was noticable. Haeri and Yeon were Academy / Import prospects who havent been in LCS before and last but not least the ONE PATCH WONDERKID of Pyosik. Not to disrespect him, but literally all of last year in LCK he was middle to bottom half performing of all the junglers in the LCK. He had 1 magical run on the Worlds patch and people been on the biggest copium ever since. I honestly was in shock when TL decided to import him.   This team was a high risk / high reward roster, and it stumbled. If anything I would have fired the scouting department who recommended Pyosik, because obviously the only tape they reviewed was Worlds.     Dear LCS Teams, please import young talent (if you are going to import) from the Challenger / LDL leagues because they will last longer than underperforming / aged out players who were gonna be cut from the LCK / LPL.
Cant agree there. Summit was an inter last time he was in LCS once he got figured out, he toned down the inting but was on tank duty a lot this split which clearly isn't his preferred style.   Haeri aint it, just plain and simple not LCS calibre.   Pyosik was never a top tier jungler all the time, he had high peaks and very low lows. Yes he won worlds but he was also 10th place the year before, hardly a superstar and individually not a top 5 LCK jungler before leaving.   Yeon is an untested rookie, looked alright but not a star yet.   Hardly a superteam.
It's not a team of high caliber players. They have 0 high caliber players total.
Disagree, really hope they make roster changes and stop the Korean roster plan. Keep the botlane, bring back Santorin, Jensen, & Bwipo and you've got a worlds contending roster.
its very likely hell be gone soon
I don't think anyone on the TL roster should still be employed. Core is the best one but with this roster being built around him and being this bad then I think just nuke it all.
Dang if they pivot from Korean speaking team then haeri might get cut if not he knows more LoL Korean the. Yeon did at the start of the split so dropping him is a sign that team one language is over
Based on what I’ve seen on Squad episodes:  Haeri’s Korean seems pretty good if not nearly fluent.   Yeon’s is just okay and probably good enough for LoL-speak. He can probably understand way better than he can speak, which is already the most ideal when it comes to the adc role.  But I personally think Yeon could thrive in an English environment more. Haeri definitely hasn’t performed well enough considering his level of Korean compared to Yeon.
Summit to coach and Marin to top for the dankest timeline
“High profile people” Marin hasn’t been in the league scene in 4 years. He wasn’t a “high profile” signing when they signed him as coach.
This is an L take in this case
its a cringe fest? i get disappointing but to the point that it becomes cringey is interesting
Tell me what high profile people TL took at their peek that didn't suck before coming to TL?  Piglet - No one wanted him in the LCK because he was not good enough, TL hired him expecting something else, didn't work out.     Broxah - One of the worst junglers in EU the season prior and TL still took him expecting something else.     Alphari - Monster in lane, best top laner in lane by far, but shit after laning phase, could not translate his lead. Same thing happened in TL, not sure why TL thought he was gonna change there.     Bjergsen - A year away from playing as a pro, TL recruited him as a mid laner. I do not think he did bad, but he was just too expensive for what he was bringing.     Bwipo - In t he decline, was not even in the conversation for top 3 top laners in EU before he went to jungle, spent half a split or a year in the jungle, monster of a jungler, TL recruited him as a top laner, where he was under performing. Didn't work out.  Summit - Beast top laner, dies a lot to ganks, makes stupid plays and can't team fight.  Pyosik - One of the worst junglers in the LCK. TL Recruited him, still one of the worst junglers but now in NA.  Same thing can be said about almost every TL Head Coach.   TL goes after big names, base on name and not on their plays. Feels like they just want fans and hope for the best, which is now backfiring. TL does not know how to scout for good players or for good imports, they go by name and historical performance, not by current performance. They are just not doing their research.
TL's problem is they keep committing to declining or internationally irrelevant veterans
But they are already hired by nrg
he was training T1 top laners until he came to TL, scouted Zeus and Oner for T1, he was in the scene
TL is only interested in world champions, so in their defense it's not easy to find a world champion that coaches!
Spawn doesn't want to because he doesn't want to move away from his family
He was literally the shot caller and a primary carry for the greatest iteration of SKT of all time but sure, he was just Looper 2.0.
ur brave for this one and also correct, even as someone who liked him on afreeca
There is no way pyosik stays on TL. That would mean both sides mutually think that's a good idea and I don't see that happening lol
I’ve hear rumor they are bringing Nosferathree in to coach
[removed]
I'm sure Parth and Nukeduck are coming up right behind him.
Maybe he can take a 1 year "vacation"
[removed]
Yes, that was the unquestioned best LCS team of all time. Let's run it back.
“Mutual agreement for termination” is a common, super formal, professional way to allow someone to quit gracefully “on their own,” and if they choose not to, they’re fired.   It’s firing without actually firing, but it at least lets you choose dignity.
WE LOVED HAVING HIM AS OUR HEAD COACH AND WILL MISS HIM AS OUR LEADER. WHY, OH WHY DID WE HAVE TO MUTUALLY AGREE TO THIS???? with that said... dude is fkin weird and obviously has something wrong going on upstairs. also, you didn't hear it from us btw, we think he's cheating on both is partner and taxes.
The problem is with league unless you are a player that reached a high level, your players won't respect you. Add on to the fact that all the power is basically shifted to the players and you get what we have now, a highschool where instead of a football game we have league matches.
I hope u get flamed even more for this dogshit take. You can literally rephrase your sentence and apply it to failed teams that had nonpro coaches. Some of the best coaches were literally former pros, most of the world championship teams had a former pros as a head coach. T1 is considered to be the best team in the world right now. Can you guess what Bengi was before he was a coach? Dumb as rocks take
Pretty sure there’s a worlds winner out there who got arrested for something but yeah go off king winning a video game championship is a great indicator of good social skills and professionalism!
Imagine Marin thinking TL would be a good first coaching gig
Damn, looks like the Nukeduck strategy of "Just win" won't work either.
Actual transcript of the "differing opinions".
> but shouldn't be playing as much solo queue as the players  Sounds more like a problem with the players lol
What's his opgg?
Aww, but I really enjoyed TL's "I can fix him" arc after watching Summit play for C9.
I mean Yeon outside of lane also leaves a lot to be desired. Nuking the whole roster wouldn't be a bad decision IMO, but realistically I think small changes will happen between splits and if it still can't get worlds then I expect every single player and staff to be gone for next year, along with the value of every player being pretty tanked honestly. The sum of those parts being as bad as they were in spring is embarrassing.
No they need better mid and adc. The other roles are serviceable.
I think outside of the beginning summit was probably their best performing player. Yeah he dies a lot in lane but at least he has the potential to win hard. I think midlane is the most glaring role that needs to change.
You could not spread my cheeks with an industrial piston I'm clenched so tight
Thank you, Berserker.
Score was also a consistent top player at his role and lauded for his understanding of the game at a macro level.   Marin's claim to fame was being the worst player on SKT 2015 and then mid-level performances on various teams in LCK/LPL thereafter.   Whatever value he had as a player, making him your head coach was an insane decision made by people who clearly did not do their diligence in vetting for the position.
I should have said Competitive LoL. Being high Elo doesn't say anything for coaching ability, team environment, management, etc.
He was playing champions que when it was still running earlier in the split. I heard people say he was smurfing it and might have unironically been better than Summit lol
https://www.op.gg/summoners/na/TL%20Honda%20MaRin  He's currently rank 27.  Compare that to the top laner he's coaching  https://www.op.gg/summoners/na/tl%20honda%20summit
i think an unironic bwipo coach angle might be approaching. WAIT UNRELATED BUT I JUST FIGURED OUT WHAT 100T ARE GONNA DO TO REPLACE BJERG. BWIPO MID.
"Get ready to learn Korean buddy" - TL Management to Bwipo
I mean if Marin is leaving they might be changing from a Korean speaking roster. Could do Summit, Bwipo, APA, Yeon, Corejj.
lucky TL 3 of theur members are fluent in english
Throw him Google translate and he would fix right in.
Pretty sure Yeon, haeri, and core all know English bro
Yeah but like if you just put Bwipo toplane the only korean player would be Pyosik who I'm sure the team could translate for if needed, everyone else on the team is fluent in English.  If you put Bwipo in jungle, you can bring up Bradley and then the whole roster is English speaking again and you have TL academy core to build around + Bwipo and Core
Bruh
Also putting Haeri on Azir for like 60% of the games despite winning none of them
tbf, GG played the same amount of Lucian Nami TL, and GG went 4-1 vs TL's 1-4, the amount of Lucian Nami isn't necessarily the issue. The current top 3 teams (C9, FLY and GG) all made Lucian Nami work (with 1 loss on that combo each). So it could be that they correctly identified Lucian Nami was strong but just couldn't execute it. And they figured the best way to improve as a team would be to practice the power picks instead of trying to develop your own meta. Still a coaching issue, but I don't think the Lucian Nami picks are as egregious as it might first seem, there could be some logic behind it.
Pyosik was bad most of 2022 before worlds, true, but he was really good most of 2021 and at least decent in 2020. He's not a one patch wonder, he's consistently inconsistent
Yeah Pyosik is not a high caliber jungler, even in the worlds matches they won he didn't look exceptionally good.  There's a reason his nickname was pyoshit by people who actually watched the LCK.
PLEASE GOD JUST GIVE INSANITY, COPY, OR APA A CHANCE I BEG YOU
I also don't like that the two least experienced/rookie players are the least fluent in Korean.   I understand playing towards your star players, but don't the rookies benefit more from communication? The veteran stars understand the game and pro play way better.  Props to Yeon and Haeri for trying, but this project seemed messy from the start. An "All Korean" project should be five players who have literally played in the LCK or at least LCK academy, being coached by a somewhat successful and experienced LCK coach.
Summit to his players. Now you didn't dive him at under turret at level 2, Why is that?
Impact, Doublelift, Jensen
Right? He was probably the best player in the tournament at worlds 2015 but somehow the failure of an LCS roster he coaches 8 years later proves he was never actually good. What a bizarre take.
> for the greatest iteration of SKT of all time   Thal Blank Pirean Bang Effort would like a word.
I mean what else did he do besides that SKT run? Get replaced and outperformed by Duke in virtually every way?  Doesn't sound like he was that important
I like that when I ask what else he's done people can only point to random game moments and not actual accolades.
budget
robot
Scarra
lol. lmao even.
What does that have to do with Cain being the best coach TL had?
This is a bot, original tweet : https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/12ezgg7/team_liquid_thank_you_marin/jfdgmby/
Mutual agreement can have many benefits, not just for the person being let go / wanting to go, but also for the org. At least it's like that in most of Europe and while I don't know whether worker protection law is as good, I doubt there are any major differences in the US.
Which is great until churches do it for pastors who get caught doing sketchy shit. Then the next church is oblivious to why the pastor really “left” the last place and it happens to them too.
>dude is fkin weird and obviously has something wrong going on upstairs. also, you didn't hear it from us btw, we think he's cheating on both is partner and taxes.  Has anything actually come out about him? This is the first I'm hearing of him having personal issues. Was it coming across in TL video content or something?
Explain?
>The problem is with league unless you are a player that reached a high level, your players won't respect you.  That's because most of these players are young adults who have below average social skills.
Lmao, most of the coaches in korea were former starcraft players. This is also a hot take. Fnatic 2015? That coach had a poker background. Also, Kkoma was a starcraft player. That is changing rn because the current coaches are the 2nd to 3rd generation of players. If u ask why t1 is the best team rn, it's not because of solely bengi. They have 5 talented individuals led by one of the most experienced player.
You are wayyyyy too happy to insult someone over an opinion. Like weirdly fast, go take a breather.
Grow up
Ah yes, under this logic 3 time world champion coach Kkoma is a dogshit coach because he never hit high elo.
Uhh who is it? From TPA or? I need more info lol
Are you saying the TL players weren’t playing enough? They were known for being the biggest grinders, for better or worse.  Coaches should not average 4-5 solo queue games in the middle of the split.
[this](https://www.op.gg/summoners/na/TL%20Honda%20MaRin)
& watching Pyosik at worlds apparently. They tried to do the EG 2022 roster while having terrible vets lol.
Strong disagree with Yeon.
Please educate yourself before saying this shit.  https://oracleselixir.com/
Thank you, Doublelift
How do I delete someone else's comment
> Marin's claim to fame was being the worst player on SKT 2015  wat
Worst player on SKT? 2015 Worlds MVP Marin??  Bro at least fucking learn to google if you’re gonna make stupid claims
>the worst player on SKT 2015  No way you think this after the Worlds that year?
MaRin like hard carried SKT at Worlds 2015 dude, what the hell are you smoking.  Rest of it accurate though
bro Marin was arguably better than Faker in 2015, id put him slightly below Smeb/TheShy at his peak but during 2015 he was the best player at worlds that year.  I agree with everything else you said though.
How to tell someone didn't watch League in 2015: they say shit like Marin was known as the worst player on SKT 2015 lmao
Coach Curtis in shambles
Turns out T1's long list of Worlds champions are all really good at the game.
Would not be surprised. I don't think you can really unlearn league. Sure builds and reworks and new champs will be new to you but im sure marina renekton or fiora could still smash some pro play top laners
Marin could probably play instead of Summit and nothing would change as they are similar players.
Summit was challenger for most of the split and higher than Marin on the ladder. The LP loss you see is due to decay, you start losing LP after 2? weeks of not playing in masters+.   Yes Marin is currently spamming solo queue, but he also only plays 3 champions and is pretty much a Rumble on trick.
Summit doesn't grind between splits or the off-season. He was like that in Korea too. I remember checking his account when he got signed to C9 and it was D2 but had peaked 1500LPish when he grinding during LCK playoffs.
> Compare that to the top laner he's coaching https://www.op.gg/summoners/na/tl%20honda%20summit  It says he was C1 1280 after his last game played 11 days ago.
[Bwipo in spring split](https://media.tenor.com/RQxhiycUoWcAAAAC/dr-strange-power.gif)
Anyong haseo!  Ashiba!  Done
Yeah, it wasn't the same for every team. You still have to switch things up if something isn't working out though. They tried forcing whatever was working in scrims and it just didn't work out.
Nah this is just bad analysis. Except for his terrible smites in finals Pyosik played really well in all of bracket stage at worlds. His flanks in game 5 kept his team in the game before Kingen went god mode.   Pyosik in LCK has been an exceptionally swingy player. He was either pyoshit or Pyosick. 2022 summer split he was shit, worlds he was sick, and last split he was a lot closer to shit. But he can turn it around just as fast.
He got carried so hard by Zeka and BeryL
People aren't ready for me to say Insanity > Jensen but its true
I'd take it personally, but I think TL wants instant success.
Insanity and copy have been given chances
Xmithie and corejj too
Well this, for one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSRIe184Oh0  Funnily enough I was thinking about this play just earlier on today.
thank you for highlighting bots but, that's not a tweet
Worker protections in the us are far weaker than most of Europe's
Very relevant
hyperbole joke parodying tone of statment
I know, that's why I called it all a high school. Except these high schoolers were plucked from home, showered with millions and told they are gods constantly, league as a whole is now suffering from exploding way to fast.
When the coach is better than his own top player.
Other than the baron steals pyosik was good at worlds
Tbf Pyosik looked sick at Worlds but a lot of that probably had to do with Beryl's shotcalling, looking like a goose on the loose without someone micromanaging his ass
Not necessarily terrible vets, just not vets who are used to taking a leading role.
Yeah I'd go with changes in top and mid
Welcome, Doublelift*
Has to be a MonteCristo viewer, and the Score circlejerk...he couldn't make it more obvious
You definitely get out of shape, if you put in the hours you can get your level back up quicker to a certain degree as a newbie could though.
Marin's current LP is also higher than Summit's peak though. And while Marin's LP pretty much entirely comes from Rumble, Summit's LP also pretty much entirely comes from Jayce too. Not to say that Marin would actually be doing a better job than Summit ofc, but I am actually rather impressed how well Marin's skills have kept up even at a solo queue level during retirement.
Nicu!
He was playing horribly in worlds play ins. That was around the time they subbed in juhan. He only really stepped it up in the group stage and afterwards
It also helps that Kingen was basically always winning his lane in the 1v1
Insanity was doing very well and was replaced for no clear reason. And Copy? Has he ever been in LCS?
i think it was just a joke about how they read the TL language as (like dramatising how it can be read as throwing shade) lol
He should have subbed himself in.
He was fine, but hardly the piece you want to steal.
Sure but you had to ignore his entire lck split...
Personally, I just want to switch the JGL with academy. Pyosik adds nothing in my opinion
Yep Marin is good at solo queue. Just wanted to point out its unfair to look at Summit's decayed GM account and compare it to Marin who is still playing, when Summit was in challenger for most of the split. Ultimately, they're both very good solo queue players.  Also, while its impressive that Marin can reach top 30 challenger still, he was playing as much solo queue games as the players during the split when he was the head coach, which is IMO a big reason why he should be replaced. The guy is more focused on playing than coaching.  Perhaps he can get back into pro play.
Thats factually incorrect. Juhan was getting the majority of playing time from the end of LCK summer into the Gauntlet. Playins is where Pyosik started to play well enough to earn the starting spot back.
I think on c9 for a bit with king?
The winterfox Paragon special
This comment chain kinda shows why I think it needs a whole topside. Every single player in the topside has a really strong argument of needing to be swapped out.
that's what i'd look for as well. Despite being the reigning world champ, he might be the weakest link, even with 2 rookies.
Bwipo for pyosik
I am scarred by his sejuani against mad.
C9 never played Copy in main team, they played most of the rest of the academy team (Darshan, K1ng and Isles). But not Copy.
I like how CoreJJ manages to escape any form of criticism for multiple splits now.
Yeah but the bot side is just as bad… and therein lies the problem, everyone is kinda bad for differing reasons and all of them could in theory be replaced, including CoreJJ if we are being honest.
I don't think he has escaped that, he has not been at the top of his game for a while now and people have noticed.
There just isn't a strong case for other supports to replace him that would be easy to get. Core has played like shit I'm not defending him, but TL can easily find 3-4 players for every single role on the topside that they could take to instantly improve.
Because he hasn’t been bad? Bot wins mostly for TL
TL won’t get a better support and he’s no longer an import? And he’s a well liked and respected veteran… maybe that’s why?
He's still easily the best player on team liquid. Not that it was a high bar this split. Also who the hell are they going to replace him with? NA supports aren't too great
The issue is, who would you get to replace him? Summit and Pyosik have regularly looked awful and a handful of available players could be potential upgrades, and Yeon and Haeri have been pretty invisible rookies which means pretty much any pro can go in that slot. What support is available that's better than Core, even in his current form?
true, still an above average support imo, just not godjj
Just play, MMR will fix itself if you play a bigger amount of games.
Post your OP.gg because then people can give you a legit answer.  Edit: okay you have 17 games on this account. No where near enough games to have a legit MMR based on your abilities.
When you lose and drop to 0 lp or if you lose while already at 0 lp your mmr drops but your lp doesn’t. So over the next few games it has to even back out through smaller gains or bigger losses. If you are able to hover above 30 lp for a while it should even out after maybe 30 games.
This is my opgg https://www.op.gg/summoners/euw/Wendysbutt
There are posts asking this same question daily. Did you consider reading one of those?

Okay thanks for your help
Wild how your claim was easily shown to be incorrect as above
Omg yes!
Group A is so ridiculously stacked
Geekay really smurfed in Play-Ins just to get drawn into this group
Group A is brutal o.O It's hard to draw a tougher group. Maybe LFL first seed instead of TCL first seed?
whers the best place to see the schedule/streams for the games?
TynX vs LDLC in group C is a nice storyline.
easy mode for IW
I was expecting to see some British teams ?
Yeah, feel bad for those 3 teams for being drafted into the same group as Geekay eSports. Sucks for those teams that the #1 spot is already taken.
Lol eSports has a good schedule I think
it would happen because your recent games aren't 60%, and your earlier games in silver are what's bringing your rate up.
Nothings wrong with your MMR. Your LP is outpacing your MMR. A 60% win rate is unsustainable, so the game doesn’t want to toss you into diamond when your 60% win rate is against silver players. If you keep playing, you will drop in win rate. You LP gains and losses will even put.   Your performance in game has no effect on LP gain or loss.
You should make a new account, with your old one you will be hardstuck
This is it, and by the way, although difficult, it can happen the other way around. At the start of the season I was trying champions in ranked and was gaining 23lp with 47%wr, so I started one tricking and now I'm gold 2 gaining 32lp, my overall winrate is 55%, but my one trick winrate is 72%.
Honestly that’s the bullshit thing about MMR, my original account is stuck in silver, but it’s 8 years old and currently at a 58% WR in silver and getting the same LP gains/losses as OP. I have a new account I opened last season that’s sitting G2 with a 53% Wr and getting even LP gains/losses.
riot makes money with it so they keep this system up
no easy way  for blind/draft/arams, your total is listed after a game (W / L). I've been playing since 2013 and mine hasn't reset  for ranked, only way is op.gg if you had checked your profile in the non-recorded years. my op.gg has all my ranked games since when I started, just gotta do the work of adding them up
You ask to support
The obvious solution is just moving Nukeduck from Coach to Mid.
Do you hear that? Someone is blowing the Ryoma horn!
Reuniting Jensen with DL  For the world's spot angle
Copy, Jensen, Diplex, Insanity, maybe APA (doubt it though).   They do have an import slot, so they could cash out if they wanted an import.
Speculating some options:  Maple - If the TSM rumors are true, he could be unhappy with his cut salary/drastically reduced staff and willing to move. Had a decent split despite missing playoffs, and stylistically would not change 100T style that much given that he almost exclusively plays mages.  Diplex - He's sitting in C9 Academy after winning both the most recent academy split and spring academy playoffs. Could be willing to move since I doubt EMENES is going anywhere.  Pretty - Current 100T academy mid laner.  Another NA academy mid laner - somebody could be willing to move after performing well in spring playoffs (APA/shochi/insanity/spirax/others).  Vetheo - Sidelined at XL due to mental reasons, but maybe a fresh start in NA could help him realize the potential he showed in LFL and Misfits LEC.  Other regions - I couldn't tell you who, but 100T has worked with players from KR/Turkey/OCE/PCS/VN before. It's not out of the realm of possibility they go out and find someone unexpected from abroad. The team is only using 1 import slot currently (Closer).
100T Chovy would be the real heist.
100T ShowMaker.
Nukeduck is unironically the best choice atm
IT'S TOMMY TIME.
Wait a minute...does this mean Busio is role swapping to mid lane and Aphromoo is coming back to retake his record of most LCS games played and give us the Rush Hour sequel we all desire?  Edit: Had to let em know the fans are ready for more!  https://twitter.com/Archbizhop1/status/1644464139786506240?t=3jJEvA1WAPo3HJGGm00NIQ&s=19
Nemesis would be a crazy pickup
100T Magifelix
Diplex/Jensen come to mind as highest upside, highest ease (assuming buyouts aren't a bitch)  Think you'd be hard pressed to find someone on short notice better than either of them
They got a few options  Vetheo- Probably the most mechanically talented player on this list, dude can go blow for blow with Europe's best mid laners and lord knows that's an asset an NA team can use. But his mental might be boomed and he might not fit into the team, as we've seen with excel he's not always a good fit. Worked better with Zanzarah than anyone else, so perhaps he'd need a more supportive jungler than closer  Diplex- Obviously too good for NA academy. Buyout might be a bitch but he would also be a great option, and Diplex has at least shown he can compete in the LCS and have great games despite his obvious weaknesses.   Toucouille - Has shown to be a great asset in the LCS. Has had great games and garnered a fanbase in both France and NA. The downside is that he might not be willing to leave home, because he's doing fine on GO and may want to hold out to maybe get an LEC spot.  JimieN - Dude's having a lot of fun in PCS right now. I know he's an import and not a native english speaker, but he's played with Tenacity and Busio and has made a PG finals with them as teammates. The downside is that even though PCS has less money than NA, CTBC may hold on to him because they're a rich organization, plus 100T didn't promote him the first time for a reason.  Jiizuke - Free agent. His peaks are obviously really fucking high, higher than Bjerg or anyone on this list, and we've seen almost everytime he's mic'd up that he's a smart teammate despite his psycho playstyle. He had a good split on GIANTS in 2022, leading the LVP in every stat, but perhaps was drowned out in EUM, however, his teammates were much worse than him and had no business being in EUM in the first place. The downside is that he might run it down in your worlds qualifcation game. Ooops.  Mireu - This guy is slapping LLA. Remember TakeOver from NA academy? TSM's prodigial son? Mireu recently turbogapped him in the LLA lower bracket finals, dropping 31 kills in 4 games on the poor kid, letting TakeOver get a total of 4 kills. TakeOver was largely considered the best or one of the best besides Mireu, and Mireu posterized him over all 4 games, even in the loss. This kind of dominance just south of the border may warrant an LCS shot.  APA- Everyone loves him. Everyone wants to see more NA talent in the LCS. If 100T wants to go the full NA route, getting APA seems like a no-brainer. The downside is that perhaps with Tenacity, APA, and Busio, the roster may be too raw and struggle to qualify for playoffs against teams with more veterans.   Insanity- Palafox has had a sophomore resurgence. Why don't we let Insanity try to get his? He reached proving grounds upper bracket finals back to back with different teammates both times. His regular season stats are middling but when the pressure is on he only gets better, which is something you definitely want out of an academy player looking to make the jump for LCS.   Pretty- Pretty may not be ready for LCS. However, he's the cheapest option, and may be better than meets the eye. Bolulu for example was middling in academy stats but when made the jump to LCS, was a clear upgrade over Olive, and he performed much better than dominant prospects in the LCS did. Pretty has had great moments in academy, and with a good supporting cast like Closer and Busio, can probably improve noticeably
Surprised people aren't mentioning Maple more. He's been like by far the biggest bright spot of TSM, and honestly probably better than Bjerg last split. Given the news of TSM trying to go full budget, it'd probably be pretty easy to buy him out.
Safe: Jensen/Diplex  Fun: Maple/APA  Banger: WIDE BWIPO
Seeing As Tenacity and Busio are still relatively fresh, and with DL +Bjerg 100T were definately going for a win titles now not later roster, this is one of the few times where i dont think an academy mid is where a team should be looking. If 100T still back themselves that this young talent and experienced LCS winners hybrid can still get to worlds, its going to have to be an established player to push on. Honest to god can see the Jensen angle if Dig were to let him go as much as i think Jensen is a bit ovverrated currently (star of the lcs all time obvs).  likelihood for me -Jensen -Maple (depending on TSM issues) -Nukeduck player coach? -PoE with the steel chair
Up to doublelift
Tenacity been queuing mid a lot 🤔
With CLG also potentially in free fall and an uncertain future, I think palafox would actually be a sneaky good pickup- I've been dying to see him on a big name roster for a long time, 100T might be more of a middle of the table than I'd like, but I think it could be a good fit. Palafox is proactive and has shown that he can play some of the more notorious carry picks that na mids have struggled with historically. He applies good pressure and is reliable in team fights most of the time, his biggest problem has been consistency and some inting- but I feel like with a better roster around him he can show better consistency too.  100T Palafox pls. That or Vetheo might benefit from a big change of scenery
Offer Nemesis a bag and let's run it.
just so I can be the top in controversial, I also want to throw in beifeng into the conversation.   Aggro team directing midlaners really make LCS fun, and he has shown to want to play competitively. Why not smurf it up in NA?
There are only 4 acceptable options to replace the NA GOAT:  100T Caps   100T Knight   100T Faker   100T Tyler1 (Challenger level Mid, proven winner, built different)
I want Copy
Nukeduck or Jensen.
Bring my boy the Notorious POB back
Faker Doublelift inc
it gonna be nukeduck
Pretty is bad so probably not.  Import eu most likely. They still have one spot.  Ideally it's Young, Copy, Diplex or Insanity
Imports imports imports
Bjerg is putting 100T in a very difficult position by leaving in the middle of the year. 100T would be in a much better spot if he finished out the year. Not only will it be tough to find a good replacement, the team dynamic with two promising rookies will be affected. I'm really surprised he didn't finish out the year.
find some new talent in academy
Nukeduck/Copy/Diplex/Insanity would be good candidates. In EU you could also go VTO and maybe abbe again. Wildcard pick could be someone like Ucal or Fate too if they want to import koreans.
If they're willing to spend and DIG is willing to part ways with Jensen (or if Jensen asks out), then Jensen would be a great option to go for. Otherwise they can look at buying out APA from TL, I feel like he deserves a shot in the LCS.
100t nemesis oh yea lets go
Wide Bwipo
100T Faker.
Bwipo role swap would be best option that is realistic
Save jensen from dig guarentee worlds. The decision is easy
Pick up Vetheo and let him prove himself that he still has the LEC MVP skills. Would be a decent fit imo, have an aggressive mid laner that can help activate Closer. Gives them carry potential in 3 lanes
Has to be Yassuo. My Boi is a gambling genius. No way 100T would fail on those 50/50 barons with him on the team.
most likely nukeduck   or promote one of diplex/insanity
I just hope it is somebody really good. I honestly believe in this team and hope they can make it to worlds at least. They should definitely be better next split.
Dardoch or Cody Sun
I want copy to finally get a chance in the lcs, but i'll be honest I haven't been watching challengers this year so no idea how well he's been playing.
Gonna get hate, but I honestly think Soligo would be a good choice for a "cheaper" option to finish the year.
APA should be their best choice
As I recall, 100T before being approached by DL, and then Bjergsen were going to go pretty budget so I'd assume academy midlaner being promoted, unless the win streak gave them a change of tune
Diplex if he doesnt wanna go home
If I'm Jensen, I don't take the offer. I couldn't handle it. years of people saying he's the second best to Bjerg and then this? No way, man.   Setting aside importing someone new and focusing on local options - just because there's too many choices if you look internationally -   Copy could work, but I wasn't super impressed with him this last split.   APA could put in some work, dude looked good. Insanity performed very well.   If they just need a stable presence to hold down the lane and play second support for Doublelift while Tenacity and Busio develop, Ryoma has a pretty good Galio.   Diplex could do it, but I dont think C9 lets him go until they're 100% confident that EMENES isn't going to flame out, which isn't going to be at least until MSI is well under way, so they probably have to move on somebody else first.   Spirax was pretty impressive in spots, but I don't know if they're a good stylistic fit, and 100T is heavy on rookies.  They've definitely got options, but it's gonna be tricky to get somebody who's both a stable presence in midlane and helps shake up a team that just lost their mid and their shot at playoffs.
It probably depends a lot on if DL also retires. If so, I think they'd have to go with basically a rookie/building team.
100t should also promote unforgiven instead of this old boomer adc
Jojo might look for a team change  Anybody from EU, depending on how playoffs go  Humanoid, perkz even nisqy are in positions where a horrible end to their split can result to them looking for other teams, quite possibly in NA.  But there is a chance (even tho it s really really really really really really really really small) that fudge swaps back to mid, and leaves c9
I hope this starts a series of musical chairs that noone was expecting for mid year.
I want to see Pretty. Some people are declaring he's not good enough, but he deserves to actually get a shot at the LCS before such a conclusion can be drawn. He's an adaptive player that has managed to be *at least* mid-tier in every single league he has played in during his 7-year professional career; it's possible he will rise to the occasion and be a good addition to the 100 Thieves main lineup
Thematically only Jensen makes sense.
So hear me out. 100T doesn't get a permanent mid. Instead, they announce they will have an "Interim" mid laner.  And you know very well that it means 100T Jon Moxely!
My vote is for Maple. I think the team will be even more competitive assuming there aren't any chemistry issues.
PowerOfEvil from the top rope!
Maple makes a ton of sense I think he could play a strong enabling role.
I honestly wanna see Jojo with a jungler like closer. It feels like he has caught all the blame this split for EG I really think him and closer will easily contest for number 1 mid/jg duo
Maple, Jensen or take your pick of big shitters
WIDE BWIPO INCOMING you heard it here first.
I am willing to bet they go with Jensen. He had played with doublelift in the past and is still a decent player that will probably be enough for them to make worlds. It's a safe option. I would like to see Pobelter come back but I don't think that will happen. They could look at an import too but I don't know who they would be interested in for that.
Busio
honestly 100t vetheo would be dope
Copy or Diplex would be really exciting. Also Vetheo could he available.
No other answer. It’s the year of the duck.
please jensen it’s actually perfect 1 jensen has never missed worlds lol and 2 he might be one of the only mids that doublelift would want to play
Diplex + a stable top would make 100t an insane team
Nukeduck has been whispering in bjergs ears telling him how he must be so tired after years of playing. Now we will get year of the duck
gotta be Jensen or Nukeduck for the summer split
Tenacity mid, Bwipo top
Put doublelift on mid and unf0rgiven on adc.
Quite a few options really.   From academy I think that Insanity, Pretty, Diplex and Ryoma should be considered.  Insanity has been one of the best mids in academy for a while and was at least decent on Immortals during his time there. Not always the best and maybe a little lacking in aggression during his time in the LCS, but maybe a good chance for another shot.   Pretty is on 100T academy right now and is a really solid mid laner. Not amazing, but could potentially develop into something greater.   Diplex was good on C9, and while EMENES no doubt replaced him and had better peaks, Diplex was far more consistent, and while his laning wasn't as strong, his teamfighting was fantastic. Pretty much the best replacement for Bjergsen you will get in academy because they play the same way.  Ryoma isn't a meme. I was genuinely impressed with both times he subbed into his teams over the past two years. At Lockin 2021 he was a top 3 mid during the tournament. I expected GGS to sub him in with how poorly Olive was playing. Then this year he subbed in one game for Jojo and absolutely crushed it. One of EG's best games all split long was with Ryoma as their mid laner. Could be a great time to give him another chance.   Outside of Academy, Maple is the option that makes the most sense. He's a strong mid laner, 100T can spare the import slot and I feel like he plays well towards his side lanes, which is exactly what 100T are looking for. If they throw Chime in as a package deal, it's a bargain and the only way it isn't an upgrade is if Chime doesn't synergize with Doublelift.   I would say Jensen but I think he's going to stick with Dignitas. I'd like to see DIG try for a move in the adc role. Otherwise they finally have a chance to start a split from scratch in Summer, and Jensen by all means seemed to enjoy being on Dignitas. Maybe he's an option for 100T, but I'm doubtful.   I don't know who else though. They could do trials. Maybe Pobelter or POE. They could trial Nukeduck but they also need a coach in that case.
Diplex maple vetheo or develop a home talent
DID SOMEONE SAY YEAR OF THE DUCK?
If he's still in shape I don't hate it- it's a *gamble though for sure
yup i mean stixxay did it, look where golden guardians are now XD
he’s the better mid anyways shhh
Does anyone know if he plays much now?
PapaSmithy isn’t coach anymore so I think we’re safe from Ryoma.   I do miss Papa though.
Tommy hasn't looked too bad recently
Bring back the Ry0ma/Eika golden era
Jensen has never fucking missed worlds. Imagine he goes from last place DIG to 100T and qualifies lmao
Imagine if 100T asks NukeDuck to be the midlaner after trying to negotiate with Dig for Jensen and failing. Dig decides to reopen negotiations but 100T already hired a new Head Coach they believe in better and get Jensen, so they trade NukeDuck as a player to Dig. Year of The Duck Fuck.
I actually think freeing Jensen is the angle… he actually was pretty good but everything around him was in shambles, so even if he was in moderately okay positions it just looked so, so much worse
What the fuck
Jensen, Copy or Insanity if they want stability, and that's probably the smartest strategy when shifting pieces between splits  Really want to see Young or APA though. They remind me of Jojo with their high mechanical ceiling and potential to completely win games on their own, but might be a little green sadly
Wow, none of these seem that great except for Jensen, but idk if DIG would even be willing to let him go. At the end of last split 100T positioned themselves to be able to make a potential title run for Summer, but without Bjerg that’s looking really unlikely. 100T wants to win now so they can’t pick up another rookie, but not many talented midlaners are available. My hope is that they can pick up an underperforming Eastern mid otherwise I don’t see them making Worlds.
> Maple - If the TSM rumors are true, he could be unhappy with his cut salary/drastically reduced staff and willing to move. Had a decent split despite missing playoffs, and stylistically would not change 100T style that much given that he almost exclusively plays mages.  Maple definitely makes the most sense to me. He's quietly been really solid on TSM, the players around him have just been... not great, to say the least. Honestly he was probably better than Bjerg this past split. Should be pretty easy to buy him out too.
Yeah, Maple would make a lot of sense.  However, if I were 100T manager I'd organize tryouts. They have time to try several players and see who fits the most, they shouldn't rush it.
I know he doesn't look as good now, but I would love to see peak MSF VTO come Smurf in NA
Diplex won’t fit 100t imo. He not great in lane so 100t is just gonna keep at their all egg in adc basket and hope to outscale late. In reality, they are gonna get fisted early by any competent team.
Yea Maple and Diplex seem to be the most likely and best options,   Maple is on a burning Ship and Diplex is an LCS quality Mid laner, if 100T wants to make it to worlds, they have to keep their eyes on these two.
100t copy pls
I've always thought Maple was better than he got credit for. He didn't end the split super well, but I think on a good team, he might be able to shine.
I'd forgotten about the Vetheo thing, but that sounds like a bad idea considering the situation that already happened with 100T this split. If they start losing again, it's a real gamble whether Vetheo would be able to recover.
Vetheo is the best option mechanically if we consider last year as a more reasonable expectation, but he's a resource heavy mid when you already have a toplaner who wants to play carries and a bot lane that wants to hoover them up as well. Not enough CS and jungle help to go around then.  Diplex is relatively weak early- if we assume 100T wants to play towards it's side lanes, this can be a problem if the enemy midlaner is getting prio and moving ahead of Diplex or working with JG more.  Maple and Nukeduck are both capable of playing the push and go to sides style that likely benefits 100T the most- Nukeduck's champion pool last summer was Ahri, Taliyah, Lissandra, and Twisted Fate as his top four and he was looking really good. Maple similarly has spammed Taliyah, and likes champions such as Galio and Ahri as well.  Any rookie probably doesn't make sense with the already rookie heavy setup w/ Tenacity and Busio.
Nukeduck: Just win  *100T loses*  Nukeduck: Okay, I'll do it myself
Reminds me of Dota 2 where Ceb filled in as a last minute offlaner for OG and they ended up winning TI
Agreed, though the irony is, from what DL said about him on the C9/FLY costream, it sounds like he's actually a pretty good coach.

Stop, dont do that, dont give me hope and get me so erect.
Rush hour to save the LCS, lets gooo
[AnnualShallowBlackwidowSpider](https://gfycat.com/annualshallowblackwidowspider)
did you seriously just plug your twitter for this shitty post?
Would love this for sure.
Was looking to see if someone said Lemon. Actually the best choice but, will never happen. Nemesis in NA would be a WILD.
Nemesis would come out of streaming and easily be best mechanical midlaner of LCS hands down. But I don’t know if he’d mesh well with the rest of the group.
Not really sure you would want Diplex. He had some of the worst laning stats and was pretty obviously just getting carried by the rest of C9. Plus, Jensen has never missed worlds, and I could see him and Closer being a great duo
Jiz peak in not higher the bjerg
Bring back the big Jiz
I dislike pretty much all of these options. Not like any of them are bad but don’t think any of them are good enough either. Vetheos play style does not seem repeatable for wins. Even his MVP year was basically him producing miracles from nothing.  Duplex wasn’t bad in LCS but the same laning problem will pop up once he gets back in.   Toucouille wants to be in France doubt he comes back to NA.   Jimean honestly don’t know anything about since I don’t watch PCS ever. So completely unknown entity same with Mireu   Jizuke I liked him and felt he undeservedly lost his spot but after seeing JoJo come in and play felt like the improvement was clear. Only team I can see him coming and immediately improving would be Immortals.   Apa seems risky but it’s a franchised league so why not give him a shot.   Insanity- don’t think he would be that much better on 100T. I think the winning would be good for his mental but then the microscope would be magnified. Highlighting his really poor performances again.   Even you know Pretty isn’t LCS ready. So why set him up for failure?
Jensen and Maple could also be available on top of everyone you mentioned
[Pretty](https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/Pretty) is nearly 26 and has been playing league professionally since 2015, if he isn't LCS ready already he isn't getting there.
Don’t need to buy him out if he just decides not to take the supposed pay cut they were looking for their players to take.  Not a lot of reason for LCS teams to give buyouts for TSM players when they could just be free agents.
If they actually got bwipo mid that would mean bwipo has professionally played 3 out of 5 roles, 4 if you wanna count season 8 when non marksmen bot was meta.
I was thinking that too but they have been mostly top lane champs
Hell no palafox does  not move the needle
XD
One of these is not like the other
TBH a team with T1 and DL would be not only extremely entertaining but I think DL could keep T1 in check.
T1 isn't at the professional level
POB/Hai/Damonte/Goldenglue all available 😅😂
IMO he's making it easier for 100T.  They weren't improving... They were such a one dimensional team. Not saying things might change with Bjergsen leaving, but still, something had to change in order for them to make worlds (and not embarass themselves there by playing scaling).
100T most definitely was already looking to modify the roster, I feel like this could have happened even if Bjerg didn't choose to retire
Idk, if I were Jensen, anything is better than being stuck on DIG. And what better way to one-up Bjerg by replacing him and leading the team to worlds?
If I am Jensen I take the gamble to try and improve upon spring to show I am better than Bjerg.
There’s a non-zero possibility of Jensen and DL to EG just like they had originally planned a year ago
It probably has been almost 12 years since the last time it was the year of the duck
IIRC he was actively playing Champs Queue along with MaRin
If his performance last year is anything to go by he’d probably be decent enough.
Was he ever coach? I thought he was general manager?
Ry0ma is coming to FLY after VicLa ints this weekend 💪
Why? Now he’s keeping Eyla around instead of swapping back to Winsome
How has his competition looked?
Would DIG even let Jensen leave? I imagine they could do a big buyout for him..
i mean he kindve already did that before LOL 10th place to semis in 2018
I think u just can’t go with a rookie as 100 thieves atm. Busio and tenacity still have to find their footing and with the EG collapse you can easily sneak your way into top 4 or even top 3 to qualify for worlds.
Not jensen his form has declined quite a bit
Imagine if Bjergsen had the split Jensen had. He wouldn't choose to leave, he would be forced to leave.  However, Jensen literally somehow gets a pass for being exposed that he can't be a carry because all he does is lane for himself. Somehow dig was 3-15 and Jensen playing mid lane, didn't play a major role into it and it was everyone else's fault.
Biased (get Jensen out lmao) but also DIG literally sold River who was their best player last year. The team is not a team that plays for wins, its literally always in the process of pawning players for any money it can get.
I think he'd be a great package deal with Chime. Chime is TSM's best player in my opinion and is great at playing around his junglers which would be great for Closer. Would be an upgrade over Busio individually. I don't think he would pair well with Doublelift though, so I'm unsure.
Gotta play better than the Duck to get the spot
League is so mentally based that I find it hard to blame anyone on that XL team individually once they started losing. That’s what make Fanatic not crashing and burning so crazy to me. If I were their top laner, I would have been in shambles after the first couple games.
If Diplex join, have to drop Closer for meteos to come back to 100t then we can have sneaky costreaming and it will be a paradox since they look odentical
100t would make it to worlds with diplex??
You probably won't believe this but I specifically added that tweet knowing it would bother you personally. Also, I'm desperate for attention on my decade old unverified Twitter account with like 100 tweets so I hope you can grace me with a view. Or don't, I really don't give a shit 👍
Honestly I think him not meshing will be a good thing. Need some strong heads to push away from whatever that terrible playstyle was
His laning stats weren't great, but he had some good moments in mid to late that were impressive. Is he a superstar? Hell no, but I'd bet on him winning you more games than he loses you
To be fair these are the options that aren't in the LCS right now and all of them aren't for a reason. Realistically Vetheo and Jiizuke have the best ceilings, Diplex is the safest and APA is your best shot at a franchised player. It's going to be hard
> Even you know Pretty isn’t LCS ready. So why set him up for failure?  Pretty is one of the best midlaners in the NA Challengers League and has lots of experience in competitions with high stakes. While there might be better options available,  I don't really see why you are declaring him to be not "LCS ready" as if he'd be expected to bomb in the LCS
Bolulu is also a seasoned veteran with international experience, looked mediocre in academy, then went on to put some great performances in the LCS with quite possibly the worst jungle-support duo in the league. He won't magically grow better hands but he sure as hell can perform better if he really meshes with his teammates
So you are saying they sign Bwipo mid and perma flex their mid and top champs. Sett mid incoming.
Yeah get Caps off this list
Okay but imagine if you lose because DL burns out or something  Massive downside potential
The year of the duck granted XL their first playoffs.It’s coming again.
Unironically was really good on schalke in what 2018?
It's been 10 years since the original year of the duck.  Which ironically was also only Summer + Worlds.
Entirely unrelated, but is that MaRin of SKT fame? Or just the same name
You’re correct, he was GM. I misspoke
FLY just announced that Winsome is gonna play this weekend
Ok how do we convince him Bulldog is aussie?   Edit: actually, it's too early for him to go to lcs, I'll take an APA though
They did swap them though
Man jensen would be an amazing addition though
dig should trade jensen and santorin for 100tmid and closer lol  turkish top/jg synergy and not wasted jensen talent mid
This is the real issue. I'd be sick to see 3 rookies on a top team but at the end of the day you need to have a mid that's going to be stable.
He was pretty clearly the beat DIG player. Hard to look great on a bad team.
He was a bottom 3 mid laner in spring. He was better than Bolulu, Haeri, and at times Jojo. It's really hard to rate him above anyone else. Maybe you can try and claim VicLa is a fraud and carried by an insane top/jg/adc?   100T getting jensen would be a downgrade and makes their summer run harder than before
i mean yea but hes also on an LCS abomination. i have a feeling hes still good enough to win LCS (considering he did it last summer - b4 yall say he got hard carried by fudge/blaber/beserker, i mean maybe but Closer/Doublelift are also no slouches when it comes to carry potential). He would also give them a Bjerg style mid, with potentially a bit more of that coinflip/carry potential. idk though its not ideal but its a likely option.
Lol even Chovy and Faker would look bad on DIG
This is certainly a take
Well said , you can’t just get 3 wins and say the midlander is not at fault at all.
Busio is the future - no way they take chime over him lol.
Diplex was the 12 place mid in most stats in spring and that was just the 9 first half of the split for all players.
Having someone how could be a rock and could back up DLift is what they need. Dpilex had bad laning stats but they where never bad enough to actually lose C9 games. I also think that he will also be the best bang for 100Ts buck if they want a shot at worlds.  And Happy Cake Day.
> decade old  joined April 2021
DL and Closer are both players who've historically preferred to play fast and aggressive early games. tbh I think it was passive Bjerg holding them back. A strong mid who wins lane and roams is basically mandatory for that playstyle.  The fact that he's retiring makes a lot of sense. In hindsight, his heart clearly wasn't in it this split.
> His laning stats weren't great, but he had some good moments in mid to late that were impressive.  100T's early games are bad enough already  Diplex has the lowest forward % and near the bottom in laning stats, and he doesn't have 4 other superstars bailing him out this time. He's a worse Bjerg early game, but a better player late-game, but that's not what 100T needs at all
Except 100t playstyle will for sure mess with him. They will be down almost every early game hoping outscale with the same composition. Diplex had moments where he shine in teamfight on c9 but that only cause the game state was still playable. If 100t lose early and mid lane is always getting bodied early, it over for them against competent team.
Why would 100T want another Bjergsen? It's pretty clear that the problem with 100T was that one-dimensional playstyle they had. Diplex's playstyle would just continue that issue.
I don’t think Pretty is bad. I follow the NACL so he is definitely up there in terms of talent I just don’t think he is LCS ready and would be setting him up to not really succeed by just putting him there.   I’m a Young fan and when he got his start in the first week of LCS that was pretty dope however I feel pretty would have those same results. At least Young knew it was all temporary. Whereas putting pretty in means the failures and losses can hang for a while.
Yeah don't want him to dumpster NA too hard and take out all the competition. Would just be unfair for the others
Still worth it to get out of dig
When you are on the 10th place team, there's literally no downside potential. You can't get any worse than that.
Ye same person
Same one, although looks like he's off TL now
Happens to us all!
Just say its a dangerous animal that is really cute.
No offense, but I don't think 100t would trade Closer for Santorin even if they're a package deal.   Also did you mean 100t academy mid?
What does "stable" even mean here?
> 100T getting jensen would be a downgrade and makes their summer run harder than before  you're on drugs. Bjerg did nothing this split. Jensen easily looked better on DIG than Bjerg did on 100T.
He’s not what they need. They need someone to play through early game. Not a worse version of berg. Doublelift needs someone to take the pressure away from him. Having someone like diplex would just make things harder on him because opposing team could just focus dl with no repercussions.
I stand corrected. Looks like I made a new account adding a 1 after forgetting my login. Obviously important enough for me to bother clicking the link and checking myself. Better count my tweets and make sure it's 100 too
No way, I think DL wants to pull resources and they’re down for it in the end. In the beginning they tried too wide but didn’t work. Nem would def flex stuff that would give top some wiggle room (ksante or panth mid)
Diplex is literally what everyone says bjerg turned into
Someone who isn't going to solo lose you games randomly
It means stable.
Someone regularly performing decent, and not either smurfing or throwing. (If they pop off it's a bonus tho)
What they need is a new Top and Support that arent liabilities on 90% of champions in thier roles, and it is the middle of the split and they are a mid team they arent going to be pulling top prospects that can fix the shit show. What they need and what is possible are not the same thing.
what's more embarrassing is you replying multiple times here with paragraphs and replying to yourself on twitter. nothing says "I don't give a shit" more than actions that clearly show you give a shit. pro tip for the future, if you don't give a shit just ignore shit.
I don't see where you're disagreeing with me
Yah but it’s easier to get one mid than a top and support. And there’s better options than diplex.
If you say so. Always good to have a pro around to give such good tips. Here I thought I was bored passing time on reddit. Silly me though.  Looks like we got some folks who are sad about their chat bans in game though so they migrated here. Always entertaining at least
Oh disagreeing Bjerg held them back. Also, DL def not a fast aggressive player! But I think we agree in spirit :)
>Still not sure if its okay.  I don't think it was okay. I would rather have a region lose in play-ins than eliminate each other. I believe most fans from greece look at this the same way.  The weirdest part is them playing each other seems to be against the rules. Just not sure anybody cares, both teams might have been happy with the draw.
Happy to see my org ANO succeed *again* in the difficult task of qualifying to the main event through play-ins. Sad that we had to defeat another Greek representative to do so  Eager to see the group draw
It wasn't very close despite the score, ANO was clearly the better team.
> The weirdest part is them playing each other seems to be against the rules. Just not sure anybody cares, both teams might have been happy with the draw.  It's actually the other way around. This was not against the rules, but several people spoke out against it, including people from both ANO & WLG
It's not a very straightforward rule, because it sends us to quarter finals for explanation:  >Teams will be drawn according to the same process as in the Knockout Stage   >   >Draw Process. These matches will be best-of-three  But it's stated that we should avoid having same regions in quarters:  >Teams from the same region will not face each other in Quarter Finals   >   >where possible. This rule will be disregarded where it creates an   >   >invalid draw.
Legacy, can be found in Chests/Rerolls/Your Shop.
Just a really old skin. But other than what the other reply said they can also become available from store vault opening but I don't remember when was the last time
I think from chests because I recall getting it from one
Nice.  Thank you sir
vault doesn't happen anymore. replaced by your shop pretty much  except if a champ is ASUd or VGUd their legacy skins come back for a bit
Ohhh didn't know that  But he was already reworked so I doubt the latter would happen again for him at least
yeah I was just saying in general, it's either luck or your champ gets a vgu or asu these days
For context, AEG played the first game with a manager subbing in for Shiganari. So proud of him for having such a difficult day with passport and connection issues, and still doing so good!
Winning a bo3 where you have to play your first game with your Support swapping to ADC and general manager swapping to Support. And they played that game convincingly. WP to the boys !
What is it with LFL toplaner and playing sion? I swear to god every time i watch a game from LFL someone is playing sion
Lot's ability to win lane every single time is absolutely incredible. Massive stepup from Shiganari and Eika too, they carried that miraculous teamfight in Game 2. Amazing job from Lounet with his Zilean too in Game 1 but the autofill ADC gap was too big for Hantera to handle
Such an unbelievable shit outcome for Partizan, to top their group 6-0 only to get matched into the only LFL team in the play ins stage.
I know I'm old when I see people referring to Lounet as "a manager"
Yeah especially Turkish toplaners of LFL and they’re kinda the best tops of the league
Second game was such a banger, idk how Aegis won it lol.
Shit? They were handed game 1 basically playing 5v4 and threw game 2 with an incredible lead. They only have themselves to blame.
Last played competitively 8 years ago 💀
As Partizan enjoyer I was sad. But going with Aegis to 3 games is good. EBL always makes good teams.
Read the comment again.
LCS just decided to combust this week huh
end of an era. CLG gone Bjerg gone. TSM probably soon
The fact that he's stepping away from esports as a whole makes me think this time it's really permanent. :(
Damn. Seems from the video that he just fell out of love with the game after playing it competitively for over a decade.  I think many of us old timers can resonate with that.  Godspeed in your future endeavors, legend.
He's been playing half his life, understandable that he's stepping away from the game. Crazy that Faker is still going strong after playing about as long if not longer
Nukeduck playing the long game for his mid lane spot
Fking blows man
End of an era.   He will always be TSM Bjerg to me   GG WP Bjergerking
He's probably the player that I respected the most in NA. Stayed humble the whole way, always respectful, took a lot of shit from the fans but kept it going as an icon of the league. I think he's definitely one of the players the LCS can be most proud of for representing our league.  Thank you Bjergsen, wish you all the best.
When he said he doesn’t even know if he’d still be alive if it wasn’t for league made me cry, happy for him.
Søren has given us over a decade of entertainment. Thank you and wish you the best in whatever you do next with his life!    Though I wish all these LCS news stories could have been pushed back 1-2 weeks so LCS finals weekend doesnt feel like an after thought it is right now
CLG gone, TSM may be gone soon too, Bjergsen gone too. Fuck man I am so sad. Everything I loved at the start is pretty much gone besides DL, really weird time to be an LCS fan.
Well, that’s sad. Hope the best for him.
Man, that's crazy. Feels like yesterday Bjerg was making his debut and dominating LCS, and now he's gone. I wonder where 100T goes from here.
I’m an old League of Legends fan. I really feel like I have nothing to root for anymore, almost nothing from the old guard is left.
Every run comes to an end. Truly the GOAT LCS mid laner and poss had the highest peak.   Take a well deserved break. Find some hobbies. Take long vacations. And when you settle down, (hopefully) we'll be here waiting to welcome you back as a. guest casting desk or just a stream here and there.
I really hope this means we don't lose Double as well. Sad day
regarding that comment at 5:55  be nice to people, sometimes you don't know what the other person is having in their life and they just want to escape from it
Really sad to see one of the goats go. Been watching him for 10+ years and basically feel like I grew up with him and Double. Really praying Double decides to keep going though I feel like Bjerg was a huge reason for him returning and choosing 100T.
I wonder how much the increased hate he gets lately has had any effect on this decision. He is such a likeable guy in general, and hard working, really doesn't deserve over half the shit he gets.   He mentions in the video having had issues with bullying in the past and even to the point of being suicidal and in a dark place. It has been feeling like he can't do anything good in the eyes of the community lately, and he gets shit on relentlessly no matter a good game or a bad game.   Its not unthinkable to think that this toxic side of the community impacted his love for the game, is it? Sure the grind for 10+ years takes its toll eventually, but I can't help but feel things like this speed up that process.  I wish him all the best in whatever he decides to do, and he will always remain my favorite player. Bjergerking got me into esports, made me a TSM fan (though I later on discovered I was more of a Bjerg/Dyrus/WildTurtle/TheOddOne/Lustboy fan specifically).
Good luck King!   It makes sense. I keep saying, the reason "older" Players cant keep up with the young kids isnt the age or mechanics, its the drive to nolife grind your time away. As you grow older your priorities change.  I wonder how this will affect Doublellifts future
so sad to see him gone, but one of, if not the best players NA has ever had!
I have watched this boy, start in 2014 with TSM, to the man he is today with 100 T. I spent the last 9 years watching him compete as a dedicated fan. I've watched every show TSM has produced, I was knee deep in this mans career. Farewell Soren. Though we have never met, I have never felt a more personal connection to a player. Take care.  Edit: In case anyone was curious, in spring of 2014, I was 14. :) Thank you for all the years Bjergsen!
Awe man.  I still love Bjerg and if TSM was gone I was watching 100t because of him.
Life is full of chapters and those chapters are the stories that make us. Thank you so much for this chapter Bjergsen, you brought so many of us so much joy. Godspeed.
Really the end of an era. Bjerg might’ve spent his first year on CW but he’s synonymous with LCS and NA League. Going to be strange him not being involved at all.
Bro, this guy grew up with me. We have the same age. I remember like if it was today his baby face and scrawny body when he came to NA. And now he is all adult and have a beard. Soren will always be the GOAT in my heart, I love him and I undedrstand that when life goes on it's harder and harder to put the dedication needed to be the best. Have a nice retirement my dude. I feel like this time is fr
Bjergsen is unironically my hero. I started watching him his first split on TSM in 2014. In the 9 years of watching him conduct himself in the most professional manner, always giving his best, always striving for excellence, carrying teams to victory over and over, he’s been a prime example to me of how to conduxt yourself in order to perform in any capacity at the highest level. I’ve admired his work ethic and attitude especially in the tough times. He’s gotten so much undue hate in the last couple of years and it’s been incredibly unnecessary.  I was able to meet Bjerg and get his signature this year at worlds. I got that signature tattooed on my arm. I know it may be a bit ridiculous to some for a video gamer to be a personal hero, but that is the impact he’s had on me as I’ve rooted for him for nearly a decade.  I’ll root for Soren wherever he goes and whatever he does. Farewell GOAT👑
damn
Jensen's time has come
I've always thought that Soren would move into the mental health industry once he was truly done; the dude really became been an incredibly thoughtful and self-aware person over the years.  I'm really glad he's at peace and ready to move on with his life. Nobody in the LCS deserves it more than him
It was time. He can retire knowing he reached the highest point in this league's history, he lost a step or two but never completely went to shit. It was an amazing run.
Great video honestly. This felt like a fitting send off and was definitely done with respect to the legend. GGWP!
My favorite player ever since i got into league, farewell. Legend.
Rippp doublelift joined to play with him
Dude simply grew up and realized playing video games isn't all there is to life anymore. I felt the same way. Took League super serious. Then hit 27 and I just... stopped caring. Changed my mindset after a short break from "take League super serious" mode to "video games are supposed to be fun. If it's not fun, don't do it".
Well then, LCS went from legendary players and org to what? it's just Flowers and Doublelift for me now. This sucks..
A sad day for League of Legends
only makes sense. couldn’t have written a better script. league started with them ( bjergsen wild turtle doublelift) and is ending with them. we love you bjergsen
LCS as we *knew* it is dying/dead. It’s been something else entirely for a long time now, but with this weeks events happening, it’s time to close that chapter. LCS today is still alive, this isn’t the end of LoL in NA or anything, but everything from back in the day is just gone, sold, or completely changed.
Bjerg is who got me into league and made me love league and the analytics. I used to go to my local library to download his VODS just to learn champs based off his gameplay. He will always be the GOAT for me 🐐🐐🐐
My favorite player since I started watching league in 2015. I'm gonna miss him so much :(
It's sad seeing these OG players leave.
Best of luck Bjergsen. A true class act on and off the rift, just letting his play do the talking. It's been a pleasure watching him grow throughout the years, from being a mechanical prodigy destroying NA mids with assassins to growing into a leader/facilitator who could still carry with his pocket picks. He will definitely be missed in the LCS, and I am sure he'll succeed wherever he goes next.
You guys need to chill with the LCS stuff. This is a man who wants to broaden his horizons when his career, hobbies and social life have been consumed by the same video game for 11 years straight.
stay where you are doublelift.
Much love to Bjergsen. Started watching LCS around the time of his first run and was a big part of why I stuck around. It's clear his form was no longer at the level he often attempted to stay at and I'm glad he's going out on his own terms at least.   That being said, wonder what 100T does at mid now? Do they go for like a Diplex or something? I'm not even sure who their academy mid is right now
Goddammit. Love me some Bjerg. I hope that he finds happiness and fulfillment in whatever he chooses to do next.
This is like 7 days late for an April fools pal...
think it will be really hard for 100t to find a midlaner doublelift will be ok with. wouldnt be surprised if he is gone also lol
So long for now and thanks for everything king! 👑 The memories you gave us will last forever.
Thank you for everything, Søren. You’re a part of every one of my favorite League memories and not only my favorite player but a role model. I know that you’ll be successful in whatever you choose to pursue. May you find happiness and fulfillment in all that you do.
I will always remember his first stream on Twitch with the TSM jersey, it was so hype.  Farewell legend, wishing you nothing but the best.  You will be remembered <3
It was time.  I hope Doublelift sticks with it because he still has it as an ADC, but it was obvious from the last split that Bjerg's heart was just not in it anymore.
What a goat. Thanks Bjergsen, for all the times!!!!
u/XLbjergsen love you king, enjoy your retirement. Forever our GOAT 🐐
i know many tsm fans ripped on you for leaving us but to me you are always the king of NA, the very GOAT
im crying bro
wow didn't expect that
Thanks for the good times Bjerg
Any idea who will be 100 Thieves' midlaner in Spring?
Bjergsen is like the Kenny Omega of lcs. He's not the guy running around in a Lamborghini but when he was needed to put in extra work, he would. He had a crazy work ethic. He is his own harshest critic. Farewell to the best mid machine, trophy collector, Bjergsen.
One of the things that saddens me is that he never came back to europe in his peak.. really would’ve loved to see him join fnatic at one point or even g2, but he had a great career and surely will remembered for what he did. Humble guy, sick player, thank you from the bottom of my heart bjergsen, it was a joy to watch you throughout the years :)
Great farewell-video. Best of luck in your future endeavours.
He just wants to play Dark and Darker
he will always be my GOAT
The LCS is in need of more class acts like Bjergsen, but sadly, instead, they promote/encourage shit talkers who can't even back it up.
This man changed the industry so much. He is very well respected.
Humblest NA pro player. Not only did he had the skill, but he worked his ass and had great work ethic.   The speech looks genuine as well as it's not sugarcoated and very up-front that he doesn't enjoy League anymore and even mentions sucidal thoughts, which would normally be filtered out if it was PR scripted
I think people here are just realizing how old they are.. the new gens are coming… good luck to them .. our time is over :)
The hits just keep coming.  This is shaping up to a rough year for long time LCS fans.
Incredible player, awesome person and just a legend through and through
NA league is dead. We had a long run, but now it’s time for league to pivot to Asia like StarCraft.
LCS GOAT
Well ngl, i stopped watching LCS when Dyrus left, kinda before maybe, so I'm not on pair of everything happening in the scene anymore, sucks to see this tho but it was inevitable. The game lost it's spark many years ago when the OGs have stopped playing it and streaming it, the love for the game has died to many of us, including the ones who breathe this game like Bjergsen.  I don't remember the last time i cared about the world's except maybe last year's cuz i just wanted to get free rewards and there was this hype with faker and deft, other than that nothing.   Unfortunately i don't think league will ever top season 1-5 times anymore. Next thing you know faker is gonna step down too and then you know, your generation is gone.
regarding the dark place in his life comment he made, hope y’all feel great about the mean ass comments that ppl constantly made about him.   dude was nothing but a positive force and role model in the lcs and so many people treated him like shit.
WHAT THE FUCK NOOO BJERG! Wish my fave player of all time the best in the future.
SOMEONE TELL ME THAT THE LAST 6 DAYS HAVE BEEN A HALLUCINATION AND ALL THE CALENDARS AROUND ME ARE WRONG AND THIS IS AN APRIL FOOLS!  &#x200B;  Such a sad day. End of an era. He will always be the NA GOAT to me. My BjergerKing.
Kinda sad that Bjerg's last split had him getting dogpiled by braindead LCS fans.  Wish him the best, by far the best NA LCS player of all time. Not even close
Goodnight sweet prince...
aaa my favourite player :(  Bjerg gave us years of entertainment and he was the best player NA had for a long long time.  GL with whatever you do in the future.
My favorite na player is just gone huh? There’s still DL i guess.
🥺🥺🥺  Lcs viewership is cooked
NA League is so dead lmao
Fuck this. This past week's been really really sad already
This year I'm really feeling the pain with LoL Esports. TL's roster this year has left me feeling less enthusiastic about them. I haven't even watched LEC this year despite Rekkles being back on FNC. CLG's departure was a gut punch as I became a fan of LCS through CLG and the documentary series they did that I saw on Machinima back in 2013 I think. Doublelift coming back to pro was the stimulant I needed and I was really hoping to get more Bjergsen + Doublelift than we got. If DL retires for good I might very well find that I only watch pro play every once in a while rather than every week and I think that'll be a real sad day for me.   Farewell, Bjerg. Enjoy your post-Esports career!
End of an era
I’ll always be a TSM fan as long as there’s a TSM in League (so not for much longer) like I have been for over a decade now but I’ll never love a team again the way I loved the 2016 summer TSM roster and Bjerg was a big part of that. I remember when he originally came and that video. I hope Bjerg enjoys his time away and figures out what he wants his life to be like without living and breathing League.
Goodbye my GOAT
GGWP GOAT
fuck
The way he phrase it, it is really done  He is stepping away from League / eSports in general
I’m not crying your crying😢
NA LCS has officially imploded
I wish him the best in enjoying what is next!
Imagine being an lcs fan and just losing everything you hold dear randomly in spring split By next week c9 will somehow be gone and all you will have left is dignitas
Where has the last 10 years of my life gone?? Only seemed like yesterday he joined LCS even though he's the goat
Thank you for all these years Bjergsen.
There’s just nothing left.
My favorite player all time
I'm gonna miss you bro.
No exaggeration, this dude is literally the reason for my interest in esports in general and especially LCS. I was never really a fan of a given team,  it followed Bjerg wherever he went. This feels like my retirement with league and the LCS as well since he will no longer be a part of it. Best of luck to you Bjerg, I’m sure you will do great and amazing things whatever it is you chose to do next.
He's got burnout eyes.  Give him a year or so and he'll be on to something cool.
I'm going to get downvoted as fuck for this because we all love Bjerg, me included, but isn't this kind of shitty? He can't finish out the year for his team?
All those old clips, agh my heart. Best of luck 🖤
next is doublelift??
End of an era. Period.
The fact that so many people seem to only watch LCS for one player or one team is kinda shocking to me. Like have none of you grown other teams or players you liked since season 4/5?
Not afraid to admit this video made me cry like a fucking baby.  Closing the Dyrus chapter was the last time I truly felt sad at an LCS change, and this one hits just as deep in a much different way.   To me, Dyrus represented a lot of the team identity that made me fall in love with TSM over a decade ago. Bjerg, on the other hand, is largely responsible for the trajectory my life took at the dawn of LoL esports becoming "mainstream" and its his near-decade on TSM that cemented esports into my life... for the rest of my life. Before that, I felt like an outcast for not being into conventional sports and the camaraderie I found in him and his team gave me purpose. His comment about LoL saving his life resonates with me more than he'd ever know.   Can't thank him enough for the happiness he brought so many, myself included. I hope he finds just as much wild success in the rest of his life.
Dang.   What getting knocked out of playoffs by GGS does to a mf
In the words of LaMarcus Aldridge quoting Tom Brady, You only get one big, emotional retirement.
All the OGs leaving and Faker is still taking names
It was time.  Love you Bjerg.
Damn after realizing he couldn’t win the LCS by just playing Zilean anymore he decided his time was done.
He will for ever be the greatest player in N.A. what a class act and good human
Tinfoil hat time.  It feels like the people who run TSM, CLG and now Bjerg obviously know something behind the scenes that's causing this massive deflation. I'm not convinced it's just League's natural decline or the incoming and current recession. Maybe Riot is pulling huge budget out of western competitive LoL in the coming year or two and it just makes more sense to give up on this dying industry before your rep is just tarnished, but who knows, it might be something even more spicy.  Either way, goodbye BjergerKing. Hope it's just "see ya later", not farewell for good.
Probably would have had a more significant career in EU. Oh well.
As a C9 fan since day 1......god fucking damn does this hurt.   I've cursed Bjergsen's name COUNTLESS times as I watched him beat C9 over and over and over again.   However, as I've grown up and watched him play, I've come to really appreciate how great of a person Bjergsen is. He never truly trash talks, he's a CONSTANT professional in a scene that has immature kids doing dumber and dumber things, Bjerg NEVER ONCE waivered.   He's an icon of LCS and League of Legends as a whole and the league arguably wouldn't even be near the top without him.   Thank you for everything Soren, sincerely, Every LCS fan, whether they admit or not, you did more for us than we could have every asked.
You know, it's really really sad seeing this. And after the news about CLG and the rumors about TSM. It feels like a really big chapter is closing  But seeing the montage of clips in the background, of him hoisting his different trophies, and wearing his different jerseys, and kicking back with his teammates. To me that's what the LCS has always been about. And why I feel like no matter what I'll personally always come back around to watch it  As someone who doesn't watch a ton of 'actual' sports it feels weird to be this impacted by retirement announcement for the first time ever.   Thank you so much Bjergsen for being a part of it. Good luck
Maybe the lcs imploding like it is will force riot to finally fix the game
While this will ruffle some feathers I always thought it was a mistake of his to go to NA, and another mistake to never try for a European team again after TSM floundered some pretty good teams.
Should've never come back with TL   At least he can rest easy knowing he jumped the ship from TSM at the right time   Even as a Bjergsen hater I can't even deny he's the GOAT of the LCS  Get off the grid and enjoy life
This seems so random. He came in saying this was his split and saying he wanted to prove he wasnt the problem with TL. So weird. What's missing here?
There goes the LCS GOAT.
God I'm gonna miss him. Once TSM always TSM. Farewell my Goat :c
what is this his 4th retirement?
fuckkkkk
He is married?
I knew this day would come but man it hurts :(
fuck me bro
https://twitter.com/Thorin/status/1644445716301991938
Waiting for DL now
finally
goodbye Champ! You were one of the players I watched closely in LCS when I started playing LoL. Always a place in my heart ! Good luck for everything you wanna accomplish, you have so much time left!
Damn so sad... now I am also scared that Doublelift will also leave the scene. I fken loved seeing DL match up against Berserker and Prince this split.
What's next for him is having sex with hookers on all of that tsm, tl and 100t money he saved.
See you in ‘24 bb
I kind of feel this has to do with the decline in LCS salaries + the lack of success
Hes gonna come back eventually,just like the last time.

I mean sad but sheesh yall the finals week is the not the time to be killing hype.
I'm a c9 fan, hurt when TSM (with bjerg) beat my team, but man this makes me feel sad for some reason. Always respected bjerg
Since Doublelift needs to always have eyes on him, we can assume he'll announce his own retirement soon.
Bjergsen was just average since he came back
Farewell Bjergsen  Farewell NALCS
How many retirements does this guy need?
Not the most popular opinion here but in my opinion the greatest of all time in the LCS. Definitely sad to see him go :(
Hasn’t he retired like six times
Weak mental, Bjerg. At least finish out the season and don’t leave your team hanging man
https://twitter.com/nickichlol/status/1644434092669149184?s=61&t=_IJ_CUC0a28ZVNtK2rdqYA  💀
stupid idea to quit right now, there are no jobs in esports literally whole industry in recession, even if there are u would be earning propably 1/10 of what you did as player i would milk this for 2 years and than retire or to 30 so 3 years.      Especialy when dude dont know what he will do. If you dont qualify for worlds its like 6 months in a year where you work to earn few hundred thousands propably or even more ure freaking Bjergsen you could milk a team to earn 1 mil. If swordart was paid 6 mil >.>
Overrated as fuck
o7 the winds of change continue to blowww ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|dizzy_face)
Yawn. Who cares. There are way better players.
glad i got to see three splits of this man  i may have been a hater but it sucks to see him go, I liked his personality and he was pretty fun to watch
yeah surely he won't unretire again to get a bigger bag
Good for the love of god stay retired this time.
Bjergsen retiring in League is just as big as any other player except Faker.
100T can sign scarra now
This really hurts the chances of CLG Bjerg
In terms of 100T, good riddance.   In terms of him as a person leaving the industry of esports, dang kinda sucks :/
o7
Why would he leave after getting 3rd place in the split with a new team? It seemed like they were just starting to get some chemistry 😔
Guess we know where Diplex is going.
Bjerg is a legend, his growth as a person has always been a pleasure to follow. He was such a shy person, that was easy to root for as the horror stories of his bullying was known fairly early.  Surprised that so many people in the comments who have followed for a long time are finding there is nothing left. Been following pro league since S2 worlds. I've always found new teams, but mainly players to root for in the scene.
Rip LCS. It got fucking murdered
Never played league of legends so I would like to know the context excluded from the video provided to me
Team liquid and 100T both failing shows he's not able to compete against other mids anymore.
Oh nooo! Another pro play post. Why the fuck is this sub just pro play.
don't let the door kick your ass on the way out
What's going to kill lolesports, isn't teams leaving, or bad investments, it's going to be this lack of continuity with players like bjerg not continuing their careers through coaching or content creation. Other sports have old players become coaches and cast the games, but esports just doesn't have that. People just be casters, analysts, and coaches, very few of them are old players. Idk what the issue is with retaining players, but if the show was filled with, hotshot, dyrus, sneaky, meteos, darshan, xmithie, scarra, qt, and other popular old players I bet the league would have much stronger staying power inherently. The fact that being on the broadcast isn't a retirement plan for these players is a problem.
Lol I'll see you next year as a streamer/coach/player/strategic coach/content creator  - basically back on the scene.
I can’t count how many times he retired
Again? What happened?
What's that now? The third time or still just the second? I'm out of the loop
Love it dude can't even give this 100t team a full season yet he's been feeling like this for a long time though yet it has nothing to do with results or the team this split. So why did you back to play or does it have to do with the team? Been a bjerg fan his entire career but dude just feels so fake now trying to make everyone happy instead of just telling it how it is. Maybe I'm salty to see him go from a team he just joined and could have been good if they had more than a single split together but I still lost some respect for the na goat.
Quitter
Here we go again...
Does this finally end the debate on whether DL > Bjerg ?
Took him long enough, surprised he still played
Tsm has been shit since season two
Bjergsen you’re dead wrong. You don’t owe your life and all your personal struggles being saved by League of Legends. You owe your life to yourself, your perseverance, your dedication, your hard work. YOU made what you are today in the LoL community and as a professional esports player. You found your first purpose and passion in life and put everything you got into it. Now it’s time to find your next purpose and I’m sure you will! I’m rooting for you Bjergsen and hope you give yourself all the credit for what you have achieved so far in your young life. Thanks for all the memories and everything. Best wishes.
lmao that was fast.  back into retirement then?
Again?
Bye, Felicia.
sad he was still bad when he came back you'd think hed try it all before retiring.
About time the most overrated player of all time let other players his spot. Reminder that this overrated player got rated 8th in 2016 and 10th in 2017 in worlds power rankings outranking godlike players like Scout and Uzi. Western propaganda considered he was worlds calibre off stomping mediocre Lcs mids, where he even doesn't reach top 3 all time being below Jensen, Xmithie and DL.  \#Packwatch
everything is falling apart this week. CLG, TSM, and now bjerg.
Wonder what dlift does next few months or after the split
Well, the end of an era, again
I saw this video pop up and I was like "Little late for April fools".
End of an Era for real this time
King
He will be missed!   I still remember watching his first stream after joining TSM, truly an end of an era with him leaving esports altogether.
o7
Truly the end of an era. Wishing you the best, Bjerg. 🖤
This doesn't suprise me at all. Dude accomplished A LOT in the scene, there is not really that much more to gain.  I would even say that it would be crazy if he kept on playing. He has a lot of opportunities right now and moving on is just reasonable.
Wish him the best in his next chapter! Thankful for everything he gave to League in his time here.
wtf
It’s crazy to see his early days, he was so young then.   Sad to see him go, he’s a role model and someone you consider a “face” of League. I’m happy he’s able to step away and focus on other things he enjoys though. He invested a lot of time in the game.
I guess the esport bubble is finally exploding.  Organizations are starting to realize that this actually isn't a business that makes them money... That's sad but was to be expected, most esport organizations are working at a net loss afterall
I know this isn't what most people will focus on, but I wonder if this means Pretty will become 100T's midlaner or if they will bring in a new one  This is Pretty's 3rd year in NA and he's only played 4 LCS games so far; I wonder if Bjergsen's decision to retire will be his big break
An era is really ending and I am  already feeling nostalgic. Thanks for the great times GOAT
Leaving between Spring/Summer seems very strange to me personally, think if he was done he'd still stick it out till end of Summer because of his contract  Wonder if 100Ts wanted to partways or if they had wanted to do pay cuts similar to other orgs and thats what made him want to stop now rather than summer
Even with me being a hater, I can still see the impact he had in NA and all of LCS. Kind of feels surreal to see him actually step away this time for real. Damn the LCS really a shell of its former self, sad days. But rest up king you deserve the break.
NA Esports are very clearly in trouble, imo. It's not just League; even other thriving esports like CounterStrike have anemic NA scenes.  Not really sure what to do about it or what's wrong, but NA just sucks at gaming, for some reason, despite playing tons of games. It's like a huge chunk of NA wants to play cinematic quick-time-event driven games where you press Q for awesome, rather than, you know, *being* awesome in competitive games with high skill caps.
sad grew up with him was a big fan in 2015 even copied his haircut ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|cry)
I've been pretty critical of him as a player, but there's no denying that he's one of the most stand-up, hard working people within the NA league scene. It's quite sad to see him step away from the scene altogether, but I can totally understand him falling of love with professional league given how long he's been playing. You can only play games competitively for so long before burning out.  He's has always seemed like one of the most mature and grounded league professionals, and I'm sure that as he's grown older winning must have become less and less fulfilling. You can win domestic and international tournaments, but in the end you are still just playing a video game. With how much time needs to be put into the game, at some point you just have to step away to be able to accomplish your other life goals. With his personality and work ethic, I'm sure he can succeed at whatever he puts his mind to, and I really wish him the best moving forward.
Dang, I wonder if Doublelift is next honestly. Enjoys the game sure enough but I remember when Bjergsen switched to coaching Doublelift outright stated that he was planning on retiring too until Bjerg convinced him to ride out one last time with him. They're really great friends so if one of the people that pushes you to compete falls out of the game, how much time does he have left?   I really hope this isn't a sign LCS is dying. I expected teams to scale back but so far not looking great. Regardless thank you so much for everything Bjergsen. Once TSM, always TSM, so good luck out there man and I'll root for you forever.
if winsome retires because of Flyquest, the LCS is over
Damn, goodbye legend. o7
Rip bjergerking
The way how Bjerg answered about his life post retirement and eSports as a whole is a little concerning. I'm not too aware how previous pro players have adapted to this change in life but I hope Bjerg is able to find peace. I hope he's planned well for retirement in terms of money and expenses.
we all saw this coming but it still suck
Western goat.
Oh man. Was not expecting this. I thought they'd have the same team since Doublelift literally said they'll come back stronger in summer after losing the GG game
Rip old school summoners. This was one of the reason why we still watch lcs.
Sad week for the LCS, especially leading up to finals. I believe there is a bright spot in all of this and that LCS will be okay. Good example of why we should cherish the games we get and the players we still have competing, never know when it'll be their last competitive match.
:( I like bjerg wish him the best of luck in all of his endeavors
kind of surprised that he isn't a coach instead of a player at this point
The goat
Haters gonna hate but the man is an LCS legend. It’s easy to criticize his recent gameplay (and rightfully so) but he was the premier midlaner in NA up until his first retirement.
As a TSM fan he should never have comeback to pro play tbh , moving to coaching was the perfect place for him. He still my fav player of all time and why I’m a TSM fan
LCS woke up and chose to not wake up anymore
This definitely sucks. However, return of the duck?
Not surprised TBH. All he's done was League for the past 10 years, now he's tired and wants to explore a life outside of it. Totally relatable.
F me - I had been binge watching Bjerg content for the past month because I just discovered LCS and he was my favorite human. I'm sure it's hard to leave mid season so props to him for doing what he wants.
One of the most important thing to realize as you grow is that you are capable of doing many things well if you apply ourselves.  Most times its not about what we want to do, but how much of ourselves we are willing to invest.  Glad he learned that for himself. He will be missed! One of the GOATS!
Sad. Bjergsen was the first player I became a fan of. You kind of figured it would happen, he did retire once already.   I hope he moves on to much bigger and brighter things.
Good for you, Bjerg. Nothing but the best 💜
My fav player of all time. Every team he's been on is the team I was a fan of. Absolute icon.
This just in. Player gets old, loses reflexes, and moves on.
CLG, TSM, Bjerg…  LCS fans, hell of a last few days huh? All we need now is announcement from Doublelift that he’s done and LCS really will feel a little too close to the abyss for comfort.
Getting older sucks =(
Will never forget all the memories you've provided me with all over the years Soren. Thank you for providing all of us the many years of entertainment and I will always remember your first official game in LCS playing Gragas vs Hai's Teemo.
dude has had an insane career, the past few years have been mediocre for him, i still think he is a few "what if's" away from being the western goat
thanks for all the games bjerg
Peter gone next?
The story of re-retire
Damn truly the end of an era. Wish Bjerg the best.
Shoutout to when Bjerg got the most gilded post of all time with that comprehensive AMA.  It’s been good. It’s been real. Good luck in your next endeavors Soren.
gg buddy, i don’t play the game anymore but you were my fav player. best of luck bjergsen
I know that whatever Bjerg does in life he'll have great success.   I can't say I have been a die hard fan of his, one of those players who the longer he played the more his gameplay got scrutinized more and more, but I've always found him to be one of the most well-spoken, level-headed, and one of the most mature people in the scene. He's always been a class act, humble in victories and defeat. He's always put the work in, and he never seemed to let the community affect him.  I wish him the best in his future, I'm glad that League helped him find confidence in himself, and I can't wait to see what he does next in this world. Quite a touching video, brought back a lot of memories to his earlier times on TSM.
League of doublelift
I give it 3 days before liftlift announces his next retirement
Wait so… who’s replacing him?
I just hope he doesn't completely leave the scene.   Would love to see him still involved in the game in any capacity, be it streaming, coaching or even as a Rioter.
Bjergsen giving up lol all the way?
Now we wait for DL.
Bjergsen, one of 2 players whom I truly felt like a diehard fan of. Maybe because of the timing and me being someone who moved from NA to EU. But damn, his ability to master English and integrate with NA culture was good.  I spent a lot of time following his games, his moments, triumphs, defeats, and persona. The game has changed, his career has advanced, but my nostalgia still sees him as a blend of the mature player he became and the starry-eyed superstar he arrived as in NA when I first followed him (I never saw the NiP tenure).  I knew this day would come eventually, and I'm glad to see him going out on his terms. What a joy to have been a fan during this journey. Life has many challenges besides League, and many that can equal or exceed League. I know with his work ethic, he'll find his way. All the best.
My GOAT. Thank you for all the good times on TSM, TL and 100T!
this video straight up had me sobbing. I wish all the best to Bjerg and thanks for all the memories
Terrible day for rain
BOOM EXPLOSION
While sad to see, good for Søren!   He is only 27, so really life has a lot of opportunities, and him most likely being a multi millionaire helps a ton if he sets it up smart.  Not many people have the opportunities to explore brand new avenues in life once their path is laid, having to live with the burnout to earn reasonable money.  So I really respect him for taking a step back, realizing that another 10 years in league is not the thing for him, and try to see what else life has to offer.    Good luck!
I am grateful for the time that I was able to watch, and the passion and drive he had towards the game.  I wish him the best, and I hope he finds what he wants and needs in life.
Back in season 5 when I started playing league I got into pro play because I saw a few Bjeregsen clips on youtube. That snowballed into me being a tsm fan and later on down the line I started watching my own region (EU) instead of LCS but I still watched each and every tsm game and stayed up until 2 am, had to wake for highschool at 5:30, just 2 watch bjerg. I still followed tsm and bjerg even though I was watching only other leagues at this time and when he went on from coachin and returmed as a player I wasn't really that excited since he was a shell of his former selfe but I didn't care since seeing him play again was what made me remember just how much I owe 2 him for introducing me into pro play. It's fucking mad that I've been watching and playing league for 7 years and Bjerg just saying that he's going away from league makes me feel kinda empty. I'll always remember him carrying tsm hard af in 2015 and 2016 spring regular split, his zoe and that cody oneshot his akali against tl, zed against IMT in 2016 spring playoffs and so many more. I knew it was the end since he just seemed of and not as good as he was but it still hits like a truck. I know you won't see this bjerg but thank you for everything you've done and I wish you all the best in your live.#ZedOrBed
RIP I blame the support and top. Whyyyyy would they get them instead of proven big names that could actually compete. More than likely because of money issues. RIP. There goes double as well probs
Waiting for the doublelift farewell to follow suit like last time.
Been playing and watching League since season 1. It truly is an end of an ERA. We've seen so many pros retire in recent years but Bjerg King, TSM and CLG gone within a week. Holy. End of an era.
I grew out of league of legends but still followed his career. So many fond memories. Sad to see him leave.
The player who got me into comp LoL ❤️ Enjoy yourself, legend.
Bye bjergsen. You’ll be missed
Sad to see all the hate he was getting toward the end. Combine that with his drive and it's honestly no wonder he's choosing to leave the scene. Really hate to see it. Was hoping I would see him play out this last contract with 100T to the end.
[removed]
I started playing league at the end of 2012 and he was just starting to make a name for himself. Crazy to think about it.
what a legend. 100 Pobelter????
Watched the video and wish the best to Bjerg and whatever he does in the future!  As a fan, this totally makes sense. Being an esports pro is such a time commitment and if you no longer are motivated to grind it, it makes sense to step back. In fact, this applies to any endeavor, it just so happens to be that for the most of us, we still need to grind at our jobs to make a living.
saddest thing is that this could be Bjerg just dissapearing away from the internet completely, He seems to love literature and nature so he could probably be happy living a very private life. The dude sure as hell doesnt need to grab a paycheck. Will miss him being a TSM fan since he joined TSM. Real end of an era.
Class act, guy has given his best and what a treat is has been.
So long Whitebeard. Fuck you and your Zilean. - a scorned C9 fan.  He stopped us so many times at LCS finals. I hated him like I hate Tom Brady.
wonder this means for DL..
If Faker retired (suddenly if ever), League might be dead at that moment.
That's a late April fools'.
Absolute GOAT of the LCS. Always come across as an all round decent human being and amazing player. Thanks for the memories Bjerg.
Welp. There goes my reason to watch lcs. Last of the old tsm.  Doublelift I guess I can root for, but between the weird times of the lcs, and the implosion of teams, I don't think I'll watch at all. There's no new talent or storylines.
This is like the ending to a top tier anime. Such a sad and nostalgic feeling watching the video.
What the fuck
Cheers Legend! Watched you from day one, and your utter domination of the NA will never be touched. Along with Doublelift, my favourite League players!  All the best!
Interesting timing
Rip Bjergurking
Bjergsen announcing his farewell the same time they celebrate Faker's 10 years. Something poetic there
Did 100T lost playoffs? Idk ai dont want LCS
How the fuck are you?!?  The Jergersen?  https://youtu.be/jJQCtOS7-VA
Always thought domestically he was insanely good. Overrated internationally until recent, but still absolutely a great player.   It's a shame to see him walk away, but the reality of it is that he's been at it a long time, has had agreat impact on the space, even internationally, despite awful results.   An absolutely fantastic career for him.
Hey there,   &#x200B;  I totally understand how you feel about Bjergsen's departure. He has been such an integral part of the League of Legends community for so long, and it can be difficult to say goodbye to someone who has had such an impact. But remember, new players and personalities are constantly emerging in the scene, and there will always be someone new to root for and admire. Let's cherish the memories we have of Bjergsen and look forward to what the future holds.
When you don't enjoy grinding the game anymore it's time to hang up the gloves. All the best Bjergsen, keep on GOATing \~
didn't he retire once already lol? I'm sure he'll unretire
Thank you Soren for your years of hard work and dedication, you’ll be truly missed. Best of luck on your future endeavors!
Poor Bjerg feeling the same burnout that most of us feel on League these days.   When you lose, it feels really bad. When you win, you feel neutral. There is no joy in playing anymore.
The only reason I still watched LCS is because of Bjerg. Whatever team he was on, I was rooting for and now I feel like I won't have any interest watching LCS anymore.
i love you bjergsen. ill always remember your tsm introduction video! i cant wait for you to start the next chapter in your life. i hope youll always be happy. its a little selfish but please come back from time to time and update us. you were such a big part of my childhood man. <3
I admire Bjergsen for what he's contributed to the scene and how he is and always has been the perfect role model for younger players looking up to him. His legacy will prevail and I'm sure he's one of the names that will be dropped first when talking about the all time greats in League esports 10-20 years in the future.   Thank you Bjergsen!
Hell yeah, god speed Stubblesen.  Thanks for everything, live your life!
farewell king of LCS
I actually shed a tear. I absolutely my favorite player of all time. He is right that all the things that make him a great league player apply to real life as well. I really hope he is happy. Will forever have my support in all his endeavors. While some people are saying the end of an era I think his first retirement was the real end of the era and this one is a completely different thing entirely.   Lastly I want to say. He will be back.    Maybe…
Probably my favorite player in all esports. I will miss you Bjergerking
Sad to see him go, I wish him success in whatever he chooses to do next.
Dang. I just uninstalled exactly when this video dropped. I knew I had a feeling.
Crazy how time flies, it felt like it was yesterday when I was rooting for Bjerg and TSM against Samsung White. Now his retiring for real :(
Thank you for everything, king.
Hope Bjerg gets to read and add post it tabs to all of the books
My goat.   You’ll be missed Bjergsen.
When Darius did his talk, I cried irl.   When I saw this, I didn’t.   But minutes after seeing this and processing what he said at the beginning, sheesh this is the end of an ERA. Bjergsen is so iconic.  You will be missed!
With Ablazeolive and now Bjergsen retiring I wonder which two mids will surely be promoted to replace them.
Money is drying in NA. Expect other big names retiring to do more lucrative stuff.
At least if we can’t find a mid laner before summer we have nukeduck
That means Doublelift is soon to follow. One of his reasons was to come back to play with him.
Is it for real this time?
Farewell, legend.
:( nothing left to cheer for in LCS. Really sad
This video feels like deja vu.
This is an earnest and sincere video from Bjerg.  LoL shaped his life and he helped shape the life of the game itself back. The game wouldn't have been as fun without him, best of luck with future endeavours Bjerg.
Sad we never got to see what EU Bjergsen could've done. Could've been Caps before Caps, or even Caps alongside Caps.
Imagine being a league player in na
Fuck ...
Always been my favourite NA pro, sad to see him go but I am glad he's moving onto something he's happy with! Thanks for many amazing memories Bjerg
From one fan, thank you for your time, effort, sacrifices, and passion into the game and competition. You made it better and provided high quality entertainment for all of us fans to enjoy. Wish you the best and thank you for sharing a large part of your life up to this point with us.
Thank you Bjerg 🐐
Fuck I'm sad he's completely stepping away. I mean I get it and I'm so happy for him but selfishly I hope he comes back in some way. One that isn't so demanding of his time.
I've been pretty critical of bjerg the last couple years. After watching this I'm going to change my reaction to pros play. If it doesn't work I'm going to be less critical of specific members. Too many times i/we get caught up in personal feelings and are too directly critical. I'm gonna change that going forward.
Thank you for everything Bjerg you are a true legend! Wish you all the best in your future endeavors.
Such a great video. Thanks Bjerg for the decade plus of entertainment and for being so vulnerable in your farewell. Don’t think I would’ve been as into the NA scene if it weren’t for you. Thanks for the memories and good luck with everything to come @xlbjergsen
Would love to see Nemesis replace him. Would be risky, but he would fit well with their scaling play style. He's probably not too rusty after boot camping in Korea for the longest time as well.
I hope he secured his bag before FTX imploded, I'm assuming he had some equity in TSM
Felt a big emotional rush when the music went crescendo and there were shots of Bjergsen's career.  I remember getting into League esports by watching his outplays and montages: he was my western GOAT back then.  Ah, the feels man...
5 years ago I came across a youtube video of a skinny guy from Denmark playing a game professionally. I have been in love with league and eSports since. Thank you Bjerg. Sad day for eSports.
RIP to the King of NA... When he moved to TL that's when I learned I wasn't a TSM fan but a Bjergsen fan. Now I don't even know who to watch or cheer for... ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|cry)
Turns out Bjerg retiring completely hits me harder than him leaving TSM :/  Farewell King
Its for the best. He's definitely lost a lot of love for the game right now and has been performing worse and worse since after 2020's miracle run and ruining a bit of his legacy. At least he's still ending hus career as a legend and the best player to play in NA and one of the most well known players in the history of this game
He is the Rory mcilroy of league.
Damn, I've enjoyed watching him from day one, even when he was a timid but extremely talented young player. I can imagine how frustrating mid lane has become as a pro, the #1 most nerfed lane to date as assassins must build tankier, nukes don't nuke anymore, or you are forced to play safer/backseat champs such as zilean considering no mid laner can compete with the possibilities of lets say: a zeri.     People like Faker, Bjerg, Crown, Showmaker, and Jensen kept getting mid champs and mid lane nerfed into the ground while other lanes are getting champions made for highlight reels. Zoe, Vex, Talon are not allowed to insta kill people while building glass canon but tanks are allowed to delete entire teams and output more damage than a glass cannon. We've come a long way and it sucks to see the pressure put on these legends of the game who even if they hit 90 skill shots in a row, can't have the kda impact of these new champs in other roles that avoid damage, aoe stun, have get out of jail abilities and can delete your team while building tanky. There's a reason casters say, "oh yay, another zeri penta" or "oh wow yone has a bf sword watch him 1 v 3 them" which is a 1/10 excitement factor compared to hard earned pentas on high skill champions that riot has turned its back on.
Someone please create a farewell montage for the GOAT Bjergsen. Would love to randomly watch it to reminisce the excitement I had watching him play in my youth. Sad day for LCS but I hope he finds his calling outside of esports.
RIP Bjergsen's mom, I'll miss her.
I may have been a hater, but I still respected the guy.    I hope for nothing but fair winds and following seas for the guy and hope he was a great life after this.    I also hope the LCS can have him swing by for a guest segment like once in a long while.  Even if it's remote.
love you to the moon and back bjerg! you were my inspiration for so long & i think it's time i step away from this game too. thanks for everything man, ill forever be a fan 🖤
God. I hate league too. Catch me playing Nasus JG in like 45 minutes thought
highest peak of the west
To everyone, it’s ok. It’s ok to change. I stopped watching league since last worlds, I only keep up via Twitter which I am hesitant to unfollow the scene. But, players, more importantly people, are allowed to grow, are allowed to pursue different avenues in life. It’s only natural. Do not be sad that change is happening, but be content that you were once part of it in some shape or form. Farewell Soren and everyone, I hope that you find yourselves and happiness in your next adventure.
Damn.
Honestly, despite the rough start, seeing them make a clean sweep to get into the playoffs was wild to me. Legit i only watched 100T games cause of DL and BJerg. I will support any decision that he makes, but I do hope that he at least changes his mind and competes in the summer... split? Season? Not sure what to call it anymore. Anyways I don't expect DL to leave right behind him, but I do suspect that we got at least 2 more years with him. Farewell Bjergsen and I hope you reach new heights in whatever you push for.
Thank you for all of the great memories. Go live your best life. You deserve it.
Legends never die!
The most respected player in the LCS. He will be missed soo much.
bout time
Thanks for all the memories started watching/playing league in season 3 with him leaving, DL is the only reason I’m watching LCS. After that I’m done
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck. The clips with Oddone and everyone, the music at the end, my heart :(
not bjerg making me cry today. god, i have loved watching him throughout the scene no matter what team he goes to.
NO! fk I didnt want it to end like this. Past few threads, always comments about the goat being washed. STFU and let this new roster scale for summer jfc. I truly believe they couldve brought it back summer... You made us so many memories and brought us so much joy, forever my goat <3
Thank you Bjerg it was a really good decade with you. Wish you the best on your future. You will be missed.
There’s something so depressing about Bjergsens official goodbye man. I started watching LCS the same season he joined TSM and it’s so odd to think of an LCS with him in some capacity.  All the pros i grew up watching slowly retiring and now there’s only a few OGs left :(  I hope he stays in the scene to some capacity and this isn’t the last we see of him, but i wish him the best.
Haven't followed the scene so much these days but the news of clg, tsm, and now bjerg is pretty brutal. I was there from the first LCS split and remember Bjerg coming to NA. Hard to believe it's been so long since then. Time really does fly
cya next season when you inevitably return anyway
We love you Bjergsen
He is definitely a legend, a pioneer,  hall of famer but like all of us can agree the LCS is a rotting corpse and it’s not going to get better any time soon
Tough week for long time LCS fans.
This man is the reason I mained midlane.
O.7
Not shocked at all about this but uh...wow, horrible timing. I ASSUME he was going to commit to this no matter what but. Damn. Now I want to cry.     I never even really cared about Berj but it's gonna feel weird.
I hope he finds something that he loves, he's had an amazing career and has left his mark on history. Great player, professional, and just an overall nice person  It's sad but we have to say goodbye eventually, so we can only hope that he is happy afterwards. Good luck Bjergsen!! I wish you the best
Soren you seem like such a thoughtful and intelligent person. It's really great to see and I wish you all the best.
Not again Aware
I remember when he first joined and there was a lot of buzz and what if he's not that good or doesn't fit with the team because regi was *sooo* good
I personally wish Bjergsen the best with the future. It has my pleasure to witness his journey.
I wish best of luck to Bjergsen for the rest of his career. He was a true inspiration to me.
When he was still enjoying the game \*shows him using old runes and masteries\*
MANGE TAK SØREN <3
Such a strange feeling, I've watched Bjergsen since his debut although I did not keep up with LCS NA or EU both until 2015ish and it feels so surreal that he's really stepping away this time permanently - you can feel the passion and drive to compete is just isn't there in him anymore and it reflected in the gameplay as well  This is a huge turning point for LCS, be it for better or worse, two old orgs imploding, one of the two NA biggest player retiring, the only thing could be worse if DL decides to quit too..
Man I still have his first two TSM jerseys .
Weird timing to retire after Spring. There had to be something special or multiple things that prevented him from just pushing through Summer. People naturally just having enough and deciding to retire mid-year has to be very rare. He clearly can still play. Enduring just one more split for your team isn't that big of a deal if you've done it so many times. I'm sure he'll explain more later on.
No matter his game play in recent years. He was truly one of NA's greatest.  &#x200B;  All the best Bjerg!
This is the 2nd time he retired right?
Bjergsen is the sole reason I’ve kept watching league, I didn’t watch the year he was coaching, but every year he has played. Whelp, guess it’s time to move on too.
Goodbye, legend
the dream of every near 30yo who is fed up with their jobs > retiring.  the difference is that he can, or else everyone would be doing the same lmaooooo
Farewell Bjerg one of NA's GOATS fr
Doublelift came back to play LCS with bjerg.   Doublelift left again to retire with bjerg.   How long until the prophecy is complete?
Hope he gets to enjoy the break from the game. Also hope he one day comes back and joins the boys in the costream. Boomer talk would be fun between all of them
None of us even enjoy league anymore, we just play it cause everyone knows it
When it rains it pours.
Respect to Mr Bjergsen for this honest video, thankful you are here to walk away from eSports. Wish you best of luck for whatever you decide to do in the future!!!
Damn he grew up
Fuuuuuuck ;(
Farewell salute to a goat!
Best of luck, Bjerg. There’s a whole world out there. You’re a good dude.
Bjerg joined a custom aram and said merry Christmas to my brother and I like 10 years ago with Dyrus. He is a genuinely nice guy and I'm gonna really miss seeing him.
And a legend steps down.  Most respected and humble player in all of LCS, truly an inspiration. Good luck in you future endeavors my man.
Cc
I'm happy for Bjerg. Dude put a ton of work in. I hope he completely detaches from league and never looks back.
Farewell GOAT
Now we need XJ9 to come and be the burning light that NA always needed.
How much longer for Double lift?
Bye bjerg, thanks for what you did for the scene
Good for him and all, but isn’t this kind of fucked to do the day before finals? This is all they’re going to be talking about all weekend when the conversation should be about the 3 teams remaining
truly and end of era. wow feels old man
Thank you King
In my early to late teens i was watching Grubby, Moon, Fear, and Dandi destroying their games, and helping me getting better at W3 and Dota.  In my early to late twenties i was watching Hai, Darien, Bjerg and the rest building up League of Legends and the esports industry.  Now i'm at my early thirties watching the fall of the investors and hype driven esports, and the rise of the FGC.  Fellas. I'm afraid to say it, but i might be getting older.
good for him. he deserves better than this game and its toxic fans and community.
Dang. I’ve fallen away from League (never thought it possible), but stumbling across this video and the comments just smacked me in the feels. Seeing the shots of the old TSM squads is just… I’d pay good money to go back and experience those TSM/C9/CLG high stakes games and series’ for the first time again.  This almost meets the emotional threshold of Dyrus’ interview with Sjokz, but seeing that live was just unreal.  It’s too bad TSM forgot how to build competitive rosters. Being a fan and watching them in the thick of it year after year was a real treat.  Thanks for the trip down memory lane: editor, OP, and commenters.
again
I have literally grown up watching this man play this game. Farewell my dude. Take all the time you need. You’ve done more already than most ever do.
He hasn't been good in a long time so it's expected.
This legit makes me sad about not just players like Bjergson leaving but the LCS as a whole. I’ve been watching it since 2013 ([link proof just cause :P](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1j49l0/how_cloud_9_wins_games/cbb045j)) where C9 would run wombo combo comps. It’s just mind blowing that 10 years has passed and things are suddenly coming to an abrupt end.
Farewell NA Faker, it makes me feel like Faker is retiring soon as well.
At the rate it's going, there won't be anyone left to turn off the lights next split.
It really is quite crazy, LCS summer gonna look sooo different
*C9 sweating furiously*
The greatest era of LCS was between Worlds 2014-MSI 2019.   It just feels like everything afterwards has been one big decline.   I wouldn’t be surprised if Doublelift permanently steps away as well.
It sucks, but LCS needed a reset at some point.
Tbf people were shitting on Bjerg more and more as the season went on so it’s practically a good thing at this point
Time will tell if it becomes a Phoenix, or if it becomes Chernobyl.
Now everyone looks at doublelift
Not sure why people are surprised with this. A lot of the greats are just aging out - its really hard to keep someone playing for this long. 11 years on the rift at a level less than a single digit percentage of players will ever achieve..thats a lot of time and a lot of dedication to something that really hasnt changed since its inception.  I wish the best for the dude, im glad playing league could keep him around with us and im glad him going into it professional could propel him to this point. He got the most an experience like this could offer and now its time to move on.
Probably for the best. The LCS was never sustainable.   The same will happen to the LEC in a few years too.
And I’ve been banned on 3 twitch channels last month for saying that the LCS was dying (for context: other people were saying they didn’t like the changes, I said it was dead and the changes this year made it worse than last year especially when compared to the LEC changes which are huge and have been a massive success)
This is starting to feel like this generation's Dyrus moment.
fuck it bro sink the LCS I’m tired of hurting
CLG was gone looooooong ago. CLG was hotshot, doublelift, aphromoo and that CLG died many many many years ago
As someone who has been away from League for years, CLG is gone??
You can really tell this is the end in my opinion. He never outright says it, but to me it's very clear that he just doesn't love League of Legends like he used to.  The biggest sign is when he says he no longer enjoys the 'day-to-day' of being a pro player/coach.
I wouldn't be surprised if he comes back as a content creator or streamer at some point, but yeah the way he was talking there's no way we ever see him as a player or coach again, or any other role that would require him to live and breathe the game like he did.
I think it's not unreasonable to expect some players to really think about life fully away from ESports. Just because they've had long careers in esports doesn't mean they don't have other pursuits and interests and nearly all of them didn't go to college and some even quit HS.
As it should be. He was a great player and I’m especially happy that he was since we’re both Danes, but he is not the player he used to be.
He kinda made it sound open ended about coaching/streaming league
Good luck for future endeavours,legend.
That statement is misleading, he is just stepping away for a bit to spend some time with family and explore what he's gonna do in the future. He even says in the video there's a possibility he comes back to League, coaching, etc. at some point.
Have to wonder wtf he's gonna do with his life if he steps away from eSports.  Become an insurance salesman?  He seems like a competent guy but I can't imagine he had time to develop many marketable skills in the last 11 years.  And I can't see him being a fulltime streamer cause he was never interested in streaming.
He's been a pro player from 16-27 I could only imagine it a good thing to experience some of what life outside of esports is before you hit middle age
Well ya... that's the point...
Nah, if you do something for a decade straight as dedicated as he was you don’t suddenly drop it like it’s nothing. He just means in the current present he’s trying to step back to see everything with a broader perspective. Once he finds his footing he’ll back in some form albeit def not as committed
I'd give it 2 years max
Nothing's forever.
Best mid to ever play NA, he’ll be missed
tbf, I don't think any top team would pick him up as a player
Showmaker doesnt even like this game anymore.  Its tough.
It's sad to see, but it was bound to happen. Focusing and living the game day in and day out for that long was bound to eventually have it happen. If you no longer have the drive or love for competition to keep you moving forward, it makes all the sense in the world to step away.
Tbh thati s a thing in many professions, i have been doing my job for 11ish years until one day i just woke up and said fuck it and changed my career 180, from an office job to a trade, because i needed something new.
I think over a two year period I played the game a total of like 6 times, and never for more than an hour to two. Recently played quite a bit again with some friends and found I really enjoyed playing. I think part of it is the mental reset, but I also think a big part of it is that I just didn't care and was in it to have fun. It's amazing how much more enjoyable the game is when you just don't care much about whether you win or lose as the end of it.
Yeah I can relate to that. The last time I played a game was last year and I didn’t find any joy in the game. However, I think it’s a combination of everything which makes it very sad for me.   I started playing in season 1 and I was a bit depressed when I saw in 2021 the pale names on my friend list who never came online again. Combined with how I don’t find the joy in the game  anymore hit me when I deinstalled it because LoL was with me for over 10 years. And now Bjergsen leaving reminds me a bit of this moment.
I also don’t think it helps that Riot has basically neglected high elo in terms of inters/quality of solo Q. Each year it just seems worse and worse in every single region. Aside note is this is probably the worst and least impactful mid has been in forever. So I can totally get why a lot of midlaners have been complaining (before you insta-down vote me)I’m not saying the role is terrible but in comparison to what it used to be it’s just not that high impact (in pro play at least).
Meanwhile Faker is like that Lord of the Rings meme, “We’ve played one decade yes, but what about second decade?”
If league does its MMO well. It will be the "forever game" for every league retiree for next 20 years.
Can’t imagine playing it that much. Even as a casual, the game sucks now compared to what it used to be. I imagine that’s amplified for him
It’s also easier to be motivated/keep your love of the game when you have those other 4 hungry phenoms around you.
Theres a reason Faker is GOAT.
Outside of some stinkers Faker is constantly playing with a team that can win everything  Plus he's making millions.
Is this really the year of the fuck? 🐥
Nukeduck replaced Bjergsen on NIP in 2014. Would be a pretty great story tbh.
really is an end of an era with TSM/CLG/Bjerg's exit
Actually freaking sucks, I thought he’d at least play for one more split as he historically always starts cooking the second half of the season. Of all of 100Ts problems this split, his performance was far from high on the list.    Sad that we only got to see Bjerg and DL together again for one split, hoped for at least one year of them as they were the two players who for me first made me interested in pro league play.
Imagine the day Faker retires
[It's a terrible day for rain](https://media.tenor.com/images/403caa774db03b4e8d0f3842e8ab7cab/raw)
He made me fall in love when he joined and absolutely dunked on every mid laner he faced in the LCS (except for Hai at the time).. His Zed, Leblanc and even Karma (Penta vs CLG) were such a treat to watch. I'll never forget jumping around the living room as they took a single game from C9 in playoffs (undefeated at the time) let alone win the whole thing. My love for TSM went as Bjerg left, but at least he got TSM their last championship.   A bittersweet goodbye.
100% agree, my fav player is Faker and bjerg has always reminded me of him. He represented the NA LCS honorably and this more certain retirement hits hard. Now it's just DL again, and he will eventually retire for the 2nd time as well. That will truly be the end of an Era, the NA glory days imo.
I won't say he was my favourite player since I didn't really like his style beyond the early days.. but everything else you said I do agree with and bjerg is an NA goat.
When I was 13 years old, my family moved to the US and I got very depressed and retreated into league. I hated not being fit in, having people make fun of my accent etc. Hearing about Bjergs story gave me the confidence to move forward and I will always owe a lot to him.
He's always been such a sweet kid. For his success and exposure, he managed to keep a level head and stayed humble, he was always the model player to all of his teammates and everyone loved working with him   The hate he got in this sub his entire career was so fucking unwarranted
I was trying to find who started cutting the onions in my office
That hit hard. I was able to ignore my suicidal ideation in high school by pretty much exhausting myself by constantly playing and consuming everything League related.
This fucking sucks man, I wanted him to make atleast one good run at world's. I never doubted him not even this last split and I wish he could have found the international success I know he was capable of
I wouldn’t be shocked to see him gone next again
It’s was over for me when imaqtpie was gone 😭
What’s next? Kobe?
he'll be fine... as for LCS and NA on the other hand...  both need your hopes, lucks, and wishes.
As far as signing from another team, Maple is probably a realistic option.  If they are going for a younger player, both Copy and Young are former 100T Next players and have played with Tenacity and/or Busio before.  I personally feel that Copy is the most LCS ready of the academy players.
Maple, maybe? If TSM is imploding or only offering minimum salary, I could see 100T making him a pretty good offer.
Diplex? He probably doesn’t want to be sitting in academy
Speculating some options:   Maple - If the TSM rumors are true, he could be unhappy with his cut salary/drastically reduced staff and willing to move. Had a decent split despite missing playoffs, and stylistically would not change 100T style that much given that he almost exclusively plays mages.   Diplex - He's sitting in C9 Academy after winning both the most recent academy split and spring academy playoffs. Could be willing to move since I doubt EMENES is going anywhere.   Pretty - Current 100T academy mid laner.   Another NA academy mid laner - somebody could be willing to move after performing well in spring playoffs (APA/shochi/insanity/spirax/others).   Vetheo - Sidelined at XL due to mental reasons, but maybe a fresh start in NA could help him realize the potential he showed in LFL and Misfits LEC.   Other regions - I couldn't tell you who, but 100T has worked with players from KR/Turkey/OCE/PCS/VN before. It's not out of the realm of possibility they go out and find someone unexpected from abroad. The team is only using 1 import slot currently (Closer).
Nukeduck?
Linking for the nostalgia   https://youtu.be/jJQCtOS7-VA
Dumb choice is to sign Jensen.  Smart choice is to sign Maple or import some mediocre LCK mid who will walk all over the LCS mids.   Spicy choice is to buyout Bwipo and throw him mid.
Probably Jensen if I had to guess. Would make sense if Doublelift stays too.
Faker, Rekkles and Deft are the only ones that really come to mind from the old days.
I miss TheOddOne
Why can't you root for the new players?
I don't even mind that the old guard has taken their rightful rest, it's that none of the new generation has stepped up to be interesting at all. They're all basically just names on the back of a jersey now a days.  Said it in another thread. It's an absolute travesty someone like Jojo didn't try to fill the role as the modern day Bjerg. Like, just stream regularly and put your personality out there and ride the wave.
feel ya
That was me after 2021.   I was a fan since S2, I even got a chance to bring the OG TSM to my college for a fan meet, I supported their Val team, Smash players, and then after 2021 it just is not the same anymore.
If it weren’t for T1 I’d be in your boat. The LCS ship sailed for me when DL took his break, but man the ship is just sinking now. Feels bad. The league ship as a whole feel just feels depressing.
Well you can come to EU. We still have FNC Rekkles <3
LCS has turned into the biggest snoozefest, absolutely ridiculous for it to be that way when this country is the entertainment capital of the world. Instead of building storylines around native players, we get a conga line of imports and still can't even get international Ws. I don't even watch it as second monitor content anymore.
same man, same. started league when i was 13, im 23 now, i grew up on dyrus, bjerg, C9 reverse sweeps, rush hour botlane n all that...its a bit sad to think back and see that no one from that era is rly around no more
Same thing happens in all sports.  It seems like an end of an era and then give it a year or 2 and you get a whole new era.
Are you incapable of becoming interested in new talent?
> I really feel like I have nothing to root for anymore  You haven't been interested in any of the players who have joined over all these years?
literally doublelift
I mean yeah, that’s how sports work. One of the best parts of the cycle is getting excited for the new prospects and the next generation of stars.
I’m so old I remember watching Bjerg debut in the EU LCS (🥺) and getting a pentakill on Syndra first game with Copenhagen Wolves. Time flies 😞
Same boat as you except I stopped watching LCS years ago. Use to watch both EU and NA. I stopped watching EU after Fnatic Huni/Reignover left. Was never about which one is better in terms of skills. NA LCS was just more entertaining for me personally. 2020 was last time I watched league. From time to time Sneaky streams other games and I watch him play those or other old streamers from LCS. So one thing is for sure. Esports for me was more about specific  individuals who I found entertaining.  Bubble pop or not it makes no difference to me.
Imagine watching the 4th best basketball league in the world compared to watching 2 good NBA teams play. That's why you should watch LPL
I've been watching both EU and NA since both leagues started. I remember when Bjerg was able to rejoin Copenhagen Wolves because before he was too young for EU LCS. Kind of nuts that in NA the teams that can most claim being "old guard" are TL, Dig, C9 and EG. Crazy times. Truly a legend.
I'd be willing to bet Doublelift goes at the end of the year
Doublelift is the Felipe Massa of lol. He will retire but he has said a lot of times in the last year that he gets an itch whenever tournaments start or he sees ADCs playing bad.   If he retires again i am 100% sure he will be willing to come back for a hype team. The reality for most pros is though that after retirement your offers are likely not good.
Honestly, I hope Doublelift treats League like Mang0 and just plays for as long as he can. Love the character.
Brother DL has had motivation issues his entire career. I give him less than a year when he doesn’t make worlds
DL also looked in better form than Bjerg this split
Hell nah DL is the kind of person who can only compete because no offense to him, he's not the smartest cookie. He sat on the sidelines for two years and I think there's no way DL is gone before 2025 earliest.
I highly doubt it. Even when Doublelift retired, he spent all his time streaming, costreaming, engaging in many ways with League. Bjergsen hasn’t engaged in the community the way DL has for a long time. I think Doublelift really just lives and breathes LoL, and the whole online gaming culture, while Bjergsen was really just someone who enjoyed LoL at its core, but has drifted away from it over time.   Bjergsen has never really enjoyed the limelight of being a pro the way Doublelift has.
you know, the people that pick on you do not care at all what so ever.  even if you call them out on it on the spot  even its brought up years later when they "matured"
I read this right before I got to that point in the video.  As someone who in the pass struggled with suicide it hit me pretty hard as well.
He always had haters since he joined TSM. That didnt stop him from being the best LCS player before. I think he just got burnt out. I cant play same game more than a month before taking a break. I cant imagine playing LoL 10+ years and be still sane.
What do I even have to root for in LCS as a TSM fan since 2013. Sadly this seems to be the end of my fandom. It was a fun ride, so many disappointments and heartbreaks but I'll look back on the time fondly. At least we had the final ride in 2020, too bad worlds was cancelled that year or Bjerg might have gotten his championship.
Bjergsen may not be the best player there is, but he was a model player. The type of player you'd still support even he's losing and playing like shit, simply because he's not just a lol player, but also a pretty damn great guy.
He'll need 4-6 years of education/certifications to get into mental health. It's not exactly an easy space to transition into. He definitely seems smart enough and compassionate enough if that's something he wants to get into. Whatever he ends up doing I wish him the best of look.
Bro imagine if Bjerg became a psychologist for the eSports scene. Being a former pro player gives him all sorts of insights on the pro player dynamic that few people know.  I think that would such a nice place for him to work in.
Yea, it's a new era. Feels the same way as when Sneaky was dropped from C9 as the last OG member. C9 survived and I believe LCS can as well.
its cinders at this point, but i wanna enjoy it while we still have it.
Their academy mid is 'Pretty'. Journeyman midlaner who bounced around a lot of EU second division teams from 2015-2020 (notables: VIT academy, MAD during Superliga era, Giants) who played for IMT academy until this last split when he joined 100T academy.
From what I remember, TSM fans had a lot of respect for him still, but since he was gone, they would have to pray he loses when he plays TSM.
I don't think so, DL still seems very motivated
Nope. Watched LCS only for doublelift and when he was gone I didn’t watch it.  None of the new guys interest me because they really don’t have any personalities. It’s hard to like a player when that’s the case.
He says in the video he didn't really consider retiring from Pro Play a real retirement because he was still grinding, putting in time to win, just not as a player - he's retiring from it all entirely now.  Little different but yeah I get what you mean.
>What do you mean 'leave lane and do something'? I got a 20CS lead over here! Sure, I never show up for objective fights, sure I show up late or don't even Ult when I do, but I've got a lane to tidy up man.
The e-sports bubble (LoL at least) is bursting.
This is hotter than a Hotline League take.
Or maybe it's because orgs come and go all the time and Bjerg has been a shadow of himself competitively for years. He was easily the weakest link on 100T besides maybe Tenacity. Even if your team is winning it's not fun getting owned in mid lane to middle-tier teams when you used to be the best.
He would have faded into irrelevance even earlier there.
What do you want? More lux skins?
that's just advertisement for lcs views
I felt the same. Basically, he didn't prove it. Don't wanna take the blame, so retiring is another way of moving forward.  To me, a person who doesn't win doesn't get motivated to play further. Imagine he won the 2 splits, pretty sure he would still be playing by now. Even though he hates the game.  The video says it's not about his win/performance. To my understanding it is...  No hate, just personal opinion.
He wants to spend time away from the game. You can't do that playing and planning for League 24/7.
- Retired as a player  - Return as a coach  - Retired as a coach  - Returned as a player  - Retired retired  So, kinda 3rd retirement.
1st
No
Difference between retiring as a player and retiring from the scene completely...
Bjerg never learned that League changed from the game he was good at where getting a 20CS lead and playing for late game was 90% of wins.
yeah u right
\- quote from someone who never watched the game before 2018
In b4 "Welcome Back TL Bjergsen!"
When I posted my "I quit LoL" video.. they called it shit posting
If TSM and Bjergsen are both out of the LCS, I'm not even sure who to cheer for anymore :(
yeah, I mean Riot kinda showed the path with how they rescheduled the whole LCS
Amazing what happens when Riot decides to not give a shit about changing anything, and NA orgs throw away money in what can only be justified as a nepotistic get richer friends strategy
Let's be real, we've already had splits w/o Bjergsen, and have had many splits with more than 1 team leaving/joining the LCS.  The CLG one hits harder than the TSM one, because it has felt like TSM was gone years ago when they just sat at the bottom of the standings
Jack confirmed on the C9 subreddit that C9 is going nowhere in the League of Legends scene. I wouldn't sweat it but it cannot hurt to stay clenched.  Edit: [Jack's Statement.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cloud9/comments/12b3iys/org_update/jevg3l0/)
Kinda sad to watch all the old highlights, I feel like honestly the happiest period of my life was from 2014-2016 when league was at its peak and seeing those moments just reminds me of how I felt back then too.
All my fondest league memories are 2013 and earlier so I don't really agree with that part.
DL is playing well I don’t see him retiring already
All stars 2013 was great until gambit leaked c9 drafts against fnatic
If Doublelift follows suit, LCS is just done.
Doublelift isn't gonna leave the scene.  Bjergsen strikes me as a guy who could be an adult and do a normal job, like sell insurance or something.  Doublelift, and I say this as a huge fan, has no place in this world outside of eSports. I can't imagine him working in an office or doing any kind of normal job.  In fact I can't imagine him doing anything with his life other than playing video games and being on camera.
LCS kinda killed international League besides worlds, so "greatest era of LCS" is a big fish in a small pond situation.
So like 70% of its existence?
Will never forget all the memories you've provided me with all over the years Soren. Thank you for providing all of us the many years of entertainment and I will always remember your first official game in LCS playing Gragas vs Hai's Teemo.
DoubleLift is connected. He probably knew all this was coming and took one more ride for old times sake.
DoubleLift will permanently flip between streaming and LCS.
>MSI 2019  The fastest BO5 in history kneecapped LCS?
Maybe I'm crazy, but I think Leena will push Doublelift to play and put out content as long as possible just to get the money before LCS shuts down, if it does eventually.  Honestly, he could cast games with Sneaky and Meteos forever and I'd be happy and watch them do that. Even if it's Europe or something lol
Haven't watched LCS live since. I've caught games over the years on vods though cause some are hella good, but damn I don't feel the urgency anymore.
LCS has been relying on people like us who have been watching for literal years. It's been a long time needed for the new generation players to take the spotlight. Ones that can attract new fans instead of older players that are seen as Internet boomers.  LCS is also at fault too tbh. They should have been pushing these new, interesting players into the spotlight earlier by giving them minidocs and promoting their personal streams.
Lec salaries aren't inflated to the moon though
>The same will happen to the LEC in a few years too.  Nah LEC will be fine. Europe got a decent talent pool unlike NA (was already having a decent pool but they now added even more regions into LEC which we call EMEA now. For example Turkey was a region themselves with a worlds spot but now their whole scene is under LEC) with really good production and also good viewership as well. By the time LEC would be done, the whole league scene would be done as well
That was a sad day
Back then pro league still felt like a bunch of dudes that got together, made a team, and got all the way up to the big leagues by working hard. Then came franchising.
As long as C9 is in the LCS, I'll be there.  Personally cannot blame any TSM/CLG fan if they leave.
it’s already sinking, xQc is about to pull more viewers reacting to TikToks than LCS gets next split. Half of this sub is in denial about it though
You can speak for yourself on that one. The Huhi Xmithie Darshan Aphro Stixxay roster was amazing, and didn't hate each other like the first rosters. The 4/5s NAtive crew has been a blast to follow too - they've competed in such a scrappy way.   The beauty of CLG is that they've always been such a compelling underdog, and they kept coming back despite rarely having the most money or biggest roster. It's a culture.
Lol trying to talk old school CLG but using Aphro instead of Chauster.
aphro? you mean chauster   and what about jiji man
So CLG was created for the first ever LCS split and disbanded right after? Because that's the only time these 3 players played together.
yea sold their LCS slot and is out of esports
Yes it's being absorbed by NRG but the CLG brand is not going to be used for anything, so yes the org is gone.
Just imagine playing the same game. 80hours a week. Every week. For what... 8 years?  It sounds fun, but im sure most of us, even if we do like LoL, would want out of it by the end of year 1
Can't blame him if you came from seasons 2-4 back in the day. The game has changed an incredible amount and not really for the better between absurd character kits and near -0 ttk.
idk about that, he always hated streaming when he was with TSM - he even got it written out of his contract
Xpeke burned out and he just left, he came back for a few minecraft series with Ibai and co, but then just radio silence.  People close to him say that he is just living and he is happy, and he is probably set for life, so power to him, but something similar might happen to Bjersen if he doesn't feel like being a public person.
I think being a league content creator could be likely, it's really the grinding needed to stay in the esports scene that he wants to leave it feels.
He said he's leaving esports. Streaming would probably be a maybe but he's definitely not coaching.
I think you severely underestimate how much money Bjergsen has acquired through 10 years of pro play and being part owner of TSM. He'll be fine for a while.
You guys realize that retired pros can still go back to school after playing right?
WOOOWWW!!! WOW! LEAGUE OF LEGENDS, WOOWW!!
Humanoid neither from what I've heard. Looking at his Twitter also pretty much indicates that.  Edit: If anyone in the LoL scene happens to read this thread, please remember to not take random reddit comments into account when making roster decisions, even subconsciously. Don't let us randoms shitposting about players influence careers. This is a trend that needs to stop. Thanks.
Excuse me the circlejerk, but it really just goes to show how dedicated Faker is. I dont necessarily think he is in love with the game, but his performance level over his career is just absolutely unreal.  Messi level goat for sure.
the late Kobe Bryant played basketball because he thought of basketball all the time, 24/7 even in his sleep  he retired when one day, he realized he never think of basketball anymore. i can see showmaker still having fun (kinda) playing league in his streams, but once he thinks of league as a chore/job and not passion anymore, thats when he should think of stepping away
I'll probably get downvoted for this but here goes.   Playing and watching league these days makes me sad. I've played the game on and off for 9 years and never have I felt like the game wouldn't be around for much longer. But this season I can see the writing on the wall.   I started noticing it with that disaster of a cinematic. Now, I didn't think it was that big of a deal when it came out. People make mistakes, and I appreciated how quickly brightmoon and meddler responded. But it's just indicative of a greater trend.   The balance and design decisions over the years have been a *mess*. Riot had a strong design philosophy that they completely abandoned. Healing and the entire jungle role get buffed and nerfed over and over again, leaving them in horrid states to play and to play against.   Now it's come to a head. EUW ranked playerbase is down 30% this year - almost a third of ranked players quit. NA shows a similar trend, along with their pro league dying. I don't know how CN or KR are doing, but legacy players such as Faker and Showmaker have voiced their discontent with the game.   I realise that at the end of the day it's only a game, and that we'll move on and find another game or hobby to fill our free time. But fuck man I love this game and watching Riot allow it to rot while spewing worthless promises like that of the 'biggest budget ever!' just make me feel sentimental about it.   Anyway, rant over. Thanks to anyone who read what little I had to say.
The biggest reason people are getting over it is because it feels like there is so many times where you have no control if you win or not.
Especially in a game like League that changes so much. It's bound to alienate a lot of people.  Especially considering someone like Bjerg played and fell in love with the game all the way back in 2012. League in that time is such a fundamentally different time. I think it's completely natural to lose your drive in such a changing game.  If Bjergsen was a footballer or something, the game you fall in love with as a kid stays the same. League just doesn't at all.   I think this is a super underrated aspect of why League pro careers are so much shorter than other games. Especially compared to something like CSGO where pros are often in their 30s.  Maybe one day, years from now, when League Classic is inevitably a thing, we can see a tournament with all the boomer pro players. Imagine 35 year old Deft and Faker playing Season 3 League again :) Lmao
I think it's not unreasonable to expect some players to really think about life fully away from ESports. Just because they've had long careers in esports doesn't mean they don't have other pursuits and interests and nearly all of them didn't go to college and some even quit HS.
Same here.  13 years as a software developer. Now in med school at 33 :)
I definitely agree. Solo Queue quality has deteriorated so much over the years. There were always trolls and inters, but it's a whole new breed nowadays.   When League of Legends was a new and fresh game, everyone just had a different approach to it.  The real doom for Solo Queue is people who are burned out League keep playing it because it's their "main hobby" growing up. I've been through these periods myself. I only played because I usually play it in my free time.  When a game is new and fresh, no one is burned out like that. In many ways, I am so happy I got to play League in the first few seasons. What a blast I had as we all learned the game. Great memories.
Absolutely. It must rewarding for him to not only be improving personally recently but also being able to mentor these young prodigies into being the best players in the world.
Oh for sure. If my team was one of the favorites to win worlds every year I’d play til i got fired.
A few of those years with SKT, Faker had a dogshit team around him
Not even the end of an era. It just feels like an end to LCS as a whole.
Same...and now eventually we'll have to see DL retire for a second time again as well...
bruh no
That's probably the day LoL dies as an esport all together.
Thought this was going to be the FMA Hughes meme but this was just as effective
What do you mean? It's not raining.
I will NEVER forgive Hai for that Teemo pick lmfao
That entire playoffs run was incredibly sick. TSM was treated as underdogs against Dig, and then the 5 game series against LMQ, followed by the 5 game series victory against the undefeated C9. Holy fuck never been so hyped in esports at that run. Probably C9's gauntlet run the next year could have done it for me, but as a TSM fan, that S4 summer playoffs is simply unforgettable.
Last time he left was half because Bjerg retired. From watching him play this split though, he clearly still has it and I hope he can do well in summer cause if he leaves idk if I would care about LCS again.
Would palafox be a potential option as well?
They have an open import spot, no way they waste than one on Maple instead of someone from EU / ERL.
Looks like it is the year of the duck after all 😎
Yea Jensen is the best player who is likely open to joining.
Impact is still around and has been playing longer than Faker.
Doublelift as well, and tbh I think he's shown he has a lot left in the tank.
maybe nukeduck can sub himself in now, also around since s3
Odoamne
Hey rookie is still playing in the LPL
Whiteknight from s3 alternate as a sub!
Impact is one of them
He still streams regularly if you enjoy strategy games or more Indie stuff.
now theres a name i havent heard in a long long time  the general the goat
I still have my signed general poster
The General is an all timer
You’ve heard this a million times but league in the past had so much entertainment, memes and storylines. We would be able to see the player’s personality etc etc.  There was the Dyaus microwave incident. Jack who once worked for TSM said he wouldn’t shave his head until we beat curse. Dignitas had imaqtpie who was really entertaining—he’s the reason why heimerdinger says “raise your what?!” Xpecial had the legendary “I like girls, girls are cool” Scarra once said “up until they lose the game, they’re winning” The faith memes from clg are from back in the day when hotshotgg said it on a Reddit post lol. The win one game to give fans false hope was also from the past.  League used to be really fun and entertaining. So many great and fun moments. That sadly don’t happen today. Like we don’t hear or see anything cool.   Also things are different when you grow up with player. He’s been in the league for ten years some people started watching him in high-school and now have kids or just finished graduate school.  At his peak he was something special. He was a kid that captivated the enter NA scene and that can’t be replicated.
Because what made league popular in the first place wasn't how good the players were, it was their personality. League as a game holds little interest which is why the competitive scene in NA is collapsing. Also younger players are from a completely different generation as the OG league playerbase and fanbase. The original league players were millennials and now its zoomers and younger.
Don't know why people are so stuck in the past. I watch basketball as much as I watch league. I rooted for MJ. I rooted for Kobe and Shaq. I root for Lebron and Giannis. I'm a C9 fan. I rooted for Hai, Meteos, Sneaky, Balls and Lemon back then. I rooted for Fudge, Blaber, Berserker, Zven, Emenes now. And everyone in-between.  Be honest people, how many people expected Bjergsen to return to 100T next split after the end of FLY vs 100T if 100T was serious about making worlds? Where would he go if he was off? So im not shocked or sad he's stepping away on his terms. I'll just be here celebrate what he's given to the NA league scene (minus the times he defeated C9 in the finals because god fucking damn Bjerg's Akali was a menace).  Everyone is gonna step away eventually (unless you're named Faker). 10 years is a long time and it's fair to eventually lose your passion for the game (unless you're named Faker). One day, players are going to recognize their skills arent as good as the next generation of players (unless you're named Faker) and that's okay. Once fans understand that, we can move on and support newer players who have that passion for the game (except when you're named Faker).
because most new players don't provide a reason to.     og streamers basically you had everything if you were looking for the cocky obnoxious type of players that was doublelift, the "dormat" you had dyrus, wild turtle as the grinder etc..
There's plenty of new players that I like but I think (I'm sure its similar for other old heads) they just "don't hit the same".   Like, for me personally, I grew up watching players like Doublelift on Epik Gamer (I mained old Poppy because of him) going all the way through to today. I think it was different because I was the same age as those guys, I could relate more.   Players now like Spica, Blabber, Jojo are legit zoomers lmao. Yeah they are funny outside of the game and talented but I can't really build that same connection as I did with DL, Aphromoo, Dyrus, Imaqtpie, Meteos, Bjerg, etc.   When DL retired the first time, it really made me think about how my dad feels about the NBA today. He grew up watching the 90s Bulls w/ Jordan and now doesn't watch nearly as much just because all the old heads are gone and "the game just isn't the same anymore". He still appreciates the game and those who play it, watches a couple games now and then but its sort of like a "passing of the torch" kind of thing I guess.
because there is no replacement for bjergsen. unless jojo can start solo carrying games and gapping like 2014 bjergsen, no one will replace him for most of his fans. the league is devoid of player personality and everyone is to blame. bjerg even mentioned a big part of this in the video, all of the players would do vlogs on the TSM youtube channel. that was great content that showed a lot more personality than anything the teams or the LCS put out these days. unless these players start making personal content through main team social outlets, get back to going on podcasts like SotL, stream regularly, and the over produced content dies down, we will never get back to that.
Was more Personal when they were streamers as well.
I feel this. I used to get really hyped for LCS every weekend. This year I can barely bring myself to watch it. The games are terrible, Dash got shafted, and *others* are hard to enjoy. Now Bjerg, CLG, and probably TSM? This shit is dead man.
I think DL is different. DL already burnt out and left, he came back when he realized that watching others play was reigniting his competitive drive. He may choose to retire again, but I don't think that he came out of retirement just to leave after a year
maybe if the split is a complete disaster. otherwise, he seems really motivated to play, at least from the outside.
I hope not, DL is still a top ADC and can still make plays that no other ADC in LCS, including Prince and Berserker, make.  The team was not great this last split but I don't think much of that falls on DL's shoulders.
LMAO ice cold mate  but yeah I remember awhile back he posted about how he drove around for two years with an expired plate and im just like   ..this is our goat huh
Yeah, while he is kinda funny to watch he isn't that knowledgable about the game itself.
Of course, it’s not a trivial thing to start. My thought was that he had the disposition/temperament necessary to do it if he wanted to
no in this league's history as in LCS history
> **this** league's history
He also less washed imo compare to bjerg. Na adc is also way more stacked than mid and yet doublelift is holding up better than bjerg. I love bjerg but I’m honestly not surprised by this retirement post. Wish him the best.
Care to shed some light on what's happening as NA's premier in-the-know definitely not a journalist content creator?
What a stupid comment.
he retired in 2020. before, then unretired into coaching, then unretired again to player.
I know Im right
I think you’d look good in blue. Join the crabbers mate.
I think I'm going to do watching. I was only watching for Bjergsen, and to some degree DL. Don't think I'll be watching much anymore.
Yeah, I had a dilemma whether to cheer for TSM or Bjergsen, now it's gone, but not in the way I wanted
That's how I felt when Doublelift retired.
Flip a coin. At this rate whoever you end up with probably leaves the league and esports in general in another 2 weeks tops, sigh
We will atill have Spica to root for i guess.
I suggest you reword to “isn’t going anywhere” because “going nowhere” implies the team is not a success and therefore worth canning
Oh! The CEO says they’re doing fine! Ah, ok. Phew! Everyone, we’re good!   See: Regi’s statement
 2013 summer C9  will always be my favorite . I remember being so angry at them for beating my favorite teams, until I just accepted they were godlike.
2014-2016 was a really exciting time, but i can assure you that Seasons 1-2 especially were really amazing as well.  That's why if we have to say goodbye to these big-time leagues with long seasons and playoffs etc and have to go back to more independant circuits with more-but-shorter tournaments I don't necessarily view it as a bad thing for fans
I keep seeing people say 2015-2016 was the best time for pro lol and I honestly have to agree. It was before all the big sponsors (honestly hate some of the things casters are forced to say cause of sponsors), the game itself was also a bit easier to understand imo. Was a bit more watchable. Also biased cause I started playing late 2015
They did say LCS, not pro league as a whole. LCS started in 2013.
I've been watching since S2 and my fav was 2016 TSM.  I'm willing to bet some time from now redditors will be saying the best LCS was Enemes vs Vicla in 2023.  Or blabers career.  There's always good and bad imo, the old guard and old fans have just been lit up recently. But there's always room for a new guard.
I agree, the streaming houses and the teams had so much personality then.  Now it’s just no charisma nameless imports.  The casters are all up themselves in their tight suits and it all became so corporate.
I mean both of these guys retired and the lcs survived
That's a little farfetched. They've both retired before and it was whatever to the league. It's more CLG and TSM leaving that's harder on the scene. But even then - they're going to get replaced by new teams who we hope to have have a hunger of building a new legacy.
This cannot be a serious post. You really think Bjergsen’s gonna go work a normal job? You think that would be the plan for either of them?
LEC also isn't as profitable though. I think NA advertising was the 2nd most profitable after LPL (despite the lower viewership), so while LEC salaries are lower, so is the money coming into the league.
Yeah but it’s viewership is declining.
Come back when caps, jankos and rekkles retires. The LEC popularity will drop as well
When Dyrus said he felt like he let down the fans made me tear up 😢
I don't usually get emotional over pro LoL but the last LCS finals when Dyrus walked out teared up after the crowd went wild, I definitely cracked.
I played professionally from 04 - 06 and there was something so magical about those early years of pro gaming. So underground, so much passion and dedications.  Just friends dreaming big and grinding like a little family. Some of my fondest memories.
I didnt mean all those 3 combined. Id consider that version of CLG in line with the CLG identity just like you.
Top fucking percentage
Fun? It sounds like hell on earth to me
Eh, sounds like work to me. A job of the more challenging type . Do it even if I don't enjoy it, because I have to get paid to provide. It is like owning a brand or business. Even when it is rest days, it is not really rest day until you are rich or powerful enough to ignore the calls or emails. And your attention is on the anything work-related even after exiting your studio and you are on the metro back home.
Really puts into perspective how tenacious players like Faker or Impact are. Playing the game for so long, still grinding every day… and at least for Faker still *improving*. It’s just crazy
Faker: pfft amateur
Faker says hi
How do you assume hes playing for 80h a week? I doubt theres more than a handful of pros in NA doing these hours and i will never believe he's the one doing so, his soloq games are miserable and he never really played cq.  And that's the exact reason why he and many others should retire, he scammed tl for over 1m and doubt his 100t salary was much lower and for what? How many players could tl try for 1.5m? Instead they spend it on dude who clearly isnt here to win.
so like other pro sports.....
I never liked him due to harassing XJ9 so whatever. He talks about being sad years ago and even admitting to being suicidal but he goes off and harasses XJ9 years ago. It just shows that people are victims to their environment, they aren't just born into things.
I do this and let me tell you, it's because pain feels better than boredom. Not because it's fun.
Then imagine that game is League of Legends and has the player base that it does…..
I did pro gaming very briefly way in the early days of halo3 mlg.  I never started to hate a game I used to love so quick. I could never imagine making a long time career out of it.
in the end its a job? sure i don't clock in 80hrs but lets not pretend that there aren't people working 20+years in one job/field and still staying.  i guess its just a high pressure job and he is so rich to have the luxury to simply not do it anymore.
I did it for like 2 years and got sick of it, I wasn't even getting paid I was just a high schooler with a problem.
Even when I played the most league ever after like 4 ranked games i was done
A hobby is fun until it becomes a job.    And let's be honest e/sports aren't a career, they're just lucrative contract jobs which unfortunately can leave you woefully unprepared if you don't have a post-retirement plan.
i can guarantee you it has infinitely more to do with the culture and landscape shifting in regards to pro, not the meta lmafo. he started before franchising and its only become more of a corporate circlejerk
Ttk?
tbf streaming on top of grinding regular practice requirements while being on the team is different from just no pressure streaming while being completely separate from the esports scene. It's not impossible he'd be okay being a streamer now but not as a player.
Sure, but that was Bjerg who was a notorious grindlord and only wanted to focus on the game.   Who knows how he'll feel after an extended break away where he no longer has to engage with league in that way. It wouldn't surprise me if he never returns to the scene, but I could also see him returning as a broadcast analyst or content creator eventually.   The man no doubt has more than enough money to retire and do whatever he wants at this point.
He disliked streaming because it would take focus away from the game for him. He wanted to be 100% focused on the game and improving.
There's no way, Bjerg has hated content creation and streaming for so long. He only did it when he grinded the game in the off season and when he needed to for his contract. Just seeing how he has grown if he does come back to esports it won't be in a direct way. He's the type that hyper fixates on things and is hyper curious on those things. If he doesn't enjoy the game anymore, he won't do anything directly related to the game.
Would love for him to casually try costreaming, I think he'd provide some incredible insight and also a lot of current costreamers tend to be a bit too negative for my taste and I don't think that's how Bjergsen would do it.  Whatever he decides to do, hope he enjoys his much-deserved retirement. So glad I got to see him last year at Worlds. I've been a fan of his since Copenhagen Wolves and had always wanted to tell him in person. Such a great dude.
Yeah, definitely. At that level of success you have the money and freedom to figure out what you want to do. For some it might be living a life out of the spotlight, for others they'll have the desire to be part of the scene again and do things like content creation. Who knows. That's for Bjerg to figure out. Even if he never comes back, as a huge LCS fan i'll always appreciate his legacy.
I think its strange Xpeke left with all the fanbase he got
Hmm, xPeke left really early on, before much money was invested in the esports. How much money do you think they made during that time? (''set for life'' seems like a massive amount of money)     And I'm not trying to question your comment, I'm just asking because I'm interested in your viewpoint.
I think it's not unreasonable to expect some players to really think about life fully away from ESports. Just because they've had long careers in esports doesn't mean they don't have other pursuits and interests and nearly all of them didn't go to college and some even quit HS.
He did say for the time being and he didn't know if he would return. It's more an indefinite break where he can come back if he wants, but we shouldn't expect it.
Of course.  Honestly he could probably live somewhat modestly off of investments for the rest of his life and never work again.  But he doesn't really seem like that kind of guy to me, I'd think that he'll want to do something.
That was the moment in his brain he said "fuck this shit"
ksante release single handledly will make showmaker retire
I love rewatching that clip. He’s just like me fr
bro snapped 😭
> I dont necessarily think he is in love with the game  I'm not sure if it changed in the last few years, but he used to emphasize how much he loved the game as of 2019 or so. The man lives and breathes League.
Nah, Messi had competition for GOAT status. Nobody else in league has any argument over Faker.
That's what ultimately makes Faker the absolute goat. There have been players at his level, such as Showmaker, Rookie, DoinB, Uzi, Pawn, and more... But nobody gets even close to his consistency.  Having 3 worlds titles helps a bit too.
Kobe retired because he was old and insanely beat up.
He retired because he was getting too old lol
Dawg Kobe tore his Achilles and retired at 37 when is body couldn't perform the moves he wanted it to. I do think that there are parallels between sports and esports, but there are also very obvious differences and it's naïve to ignore them.
where did you hear this?  the guy was chasing a ring hard until the end. the lakers made some trades with aging big names that seemed good on paper but bad in reality.  the guy pretty played a buckload of minutes, tore his achillies, and that was pretty much the end.   he retired because he had no choice. his body was gone.
It's sad cause he had alot of plans for more great things after he retired too. Too young.
And he did think of basketball still. He was actively involved in his daughters basketball development.
You said it perfectly.   Riot keeps releasing new champions and game mechanics to "keep things fresh." However, many times, pros dislike the changes but are forced to constantly learn and adapt in order to stay relevant.
That’s a transition lol. Good luck with it. I just went back to college at 30 for a new degree. Idk where I’m going with it but doors are open lol
legit Faker and his 3 difficult to kill demon children + support Faker lmao
I agree things look a bit gloom & doom, but I don't think LCS is at it's end. Just gonna be entering a new era that may be a bit shaky at first. This split in LCS has been very good for the region, competitive, new storylines, other teams having come ups. There's a lot to be excited about, even if many things we've known to love are leaving/gone.
Okay chill. Y’all are doing this to yourselves.
Nah, I'm of the mindset that this is paving the way for a new beginning. Yes, it sucks to see these legacy orgs and players leave, but there's still plenty of orgs left to cheer for and reason to be hopeful for the scene. Not even just the old orgs, 100t and EG both have respective fan bases, and FLY and GG are both looking hot this year. Players are starting to get their personalities out there a bit more, viewership and engagement are starting to look better, I think LCS still has reasons to be excited for it.
Blows my mind LCS hasn't really made any big statements or tried to get the other orgs to step up with something to hype them up. This feels like a negative PR Tsunami that they're just letting wash over the fanbases'.
Yes. It is.
That was in Spring 2014 wasn’t it, literally the first game of the split too, man I felt like it was so troll but he bodied TSM with it lmao
Hai didn't pick Teemo in that series. He picked Teemo in the first game against Bjerg in the spring and rekt TSM with it.
Never forget Lustboy and Turtle 2v2 in game 5. Dyrus going on a rampage and absolutely stomping that game.
last time he was supposed to be on that swordart roster but got kicked.
> Last time he left was half because Bjerg retired.  Nah last time he left was cause TSM dropped him after he made his playing contingent on them getting SwordArt. If they had guarunteed SA from the start and not blown up the Lost for Huni trade then DL would have been starting for TSM in 2021.   We had a whole controversy about Reginald over this last year, we know exactly what happened.
NRG seems pretty set on keeping everything together for summer, so probably not.
Nah Maple was much better than Diplex, and honestly had a pretty good split in general   Can't think of any EU prospects worth investing in mid-year with Vetheo's performance falling off a cliff. If you're gonna gamble on a rookie you might as well go for a cheaper native rookie
impact is the great equalizer he is always just good enough to be top 4  tops in the LCS regardless of who is playing  Just whelming
Ah yes, of course. DL too. For some reason I forget sometimes that he's back.  We also have some legendary names as coaches. Especially in Korea and China.
I’ve never cared for DL honestly, but I’m really impressed with his performance this split. He’s definitely got the goods to keep going.
Yeah, I actually felt like he looked very competitive in this split, far better than I was expecting. I think the base skill level is still there for him if he wants to keep competing. He still has potential to compete as a top ADC in LCS.
I remember when the absolute legend counterpicked Faker's Ahri with Swain.
Odoamne joined in like Season 5, I think.  Jankos is from Season 4 technically with KMT, but to me that's still too new for the old guard.
Rookie is a season 4 baby :)  In general, I think even Faker, Deft and Impact are still not the total old guard.  People who were playing in the 2012 open circuit are the real OGs.
Or are a turbo weeb AYAYA
Fully agreed, LCS was so much more fun ~8 years ago.
When Dyrus said "The only NA team I'm worried is Cloud9. The rest are non-existent, especially CLG"
All the money invested into it made it soulless.
This one is a slight contradiction because Bjergsen was hardly a personality. Personality-wise, all you can say is that he's zero bullshit and very mature. But he was on top because he was solo killing everyone and completely dumpstered mid every single game. That's why he's so remembered. Not his personality.
A lot of modern LCS feels very without the personality a lot of the older players do. You used to get really fun streams with older players doing dumb shit, Saint and Nyjacky getting drunk together, hotshot and others queue sniping team siren, and all of the stuff streamed from the old TSM house. It also just felt more homegrown and that made it more fun.  In the current teams, half of the players are imports; the other half seem to just not interact with the community on the same level, if at all. I really like the current CLG roster, but still who the fuck knows anything about like Palafox or Poome. I'll gladly support players I'm given a reason to support.
Unironically this. I get having a favorite team/player, but some of these comments make it seem like these people cannot fathom appreciating/watching LCS/etc if that one special person/org isn’t playing. Kinda weird, no?   I watch golf and it’s almost more exciting watching some of these young guys come in guns’ blazing and giving the old guard a run for their money.
Some people stuck around because they were fans of Bjerg. They would just cheer for whatever team he was on. He's leaving so they feel as though League has no identity. (not that I agree)  Some people were fans of CLG regardless of who was on the team. Now their team is gone. They feel like League has no place for them now. Hard to care about teams you've been cheering against for a long time. (again, not that I agree)  In order to care about something, you have to have a connection in some way. If you lose that connection then it's harder to care. I think that's what they mean when they say they have "nothing left to root for".  It's all about perspective.
I blame a lot of it on the pace increase of the game. Back then even upper-middle level players had place to show off because fights lasted longer and CDs were higher. Nowadays unless you're a tank player you're either THE new upcoming assdestroyer69xxx or you're a dirty fucking inter because you do not get any second chance if you misposition/misplay as a upper-middle level player.
Also DL took a real retirement before coming back, he rested for 2 years  Bjerg went straight into coaching, which is almost as much a grind as playing and with less recognition and control, less satisfying, so he was never really done until now
DL is legit a player that seemingly just has motivational issues and needs to take extended breaks. Surprised his break was 2 years recently, figured it would have made him come back earlier.
DL still likes the game, he just loses the competitive drive. So while he might retire there is always a chance he might unretire if he finds that drive again and thinks he can catch back up to whatever level NA ADCs is at the time.
Bro that's hilarious 😂
He covers this maybe 2 minutes and 30 seconds into the video btw
Not really, he made it clear in this video that people thought he was retiring but he said he thought of it as just moving into coaching.
 Cloud 9 absolutely feasting new fans with all these announcements and rumours floating.
Not interested in fanning a c9 without hai nor sneaky  This is just a sign I am too old to keep following lcs
Hmmm, cheering for the 'NA' LCS team with only 1 NA player... I think I'll pass.
I can never see myself being a c9 fan idk why just never gravitated to it but I always cheer them on at worlds etc.   At this point doublelift is my only anchor to watching Lcs now and he's on borrowed time unless he hits another level in summer.
such a doomer take lol
Spica and impact
It's funny, in the literal sense they're the same thing, but the way we use the phrases, you're right. There's a certain connotation
You don't love the Red bull Baron Power Play? *Barf*
The metas were way shittier back then IMO, although the personalities were great and that's honestly what creates the most fanfare and it makes the games so much more fun to watch.
Yeah, I never had more faith in a team or more fun watching than 2016 tsm. I’ve been watching since the first season and that’s by far my favorite team too.
Moscow 5, I’ll never forget the shit Diamondprox pulled with Lee Sin. The guy basically invented jungling. GosuPepper basically invented support. Genja was the ADC master. And you know what, tell me Alex and Darien weren’t masters of their roles as well. Truly the foundation of League as we knew it.
> lcs survived  Did it though? We're still seeing the repercussions of that today.
You're calling the current state of the LCS survival? More like on life support.
Yeah it's a bit of a hyperbole but if he does retire, theres nothing much for us oldheads to hold onto. I've been following the scene since LCS started and no longer play the game so I should've said it'd be done for me.
He explicitly said he's done with eSports in general, at least for a while.  What do you think he's gonna do?
There's a difference between talking about the league and the orgs. LCS was probably profitable finessing State Farm Verizon and Samsung but a lot of them pulled out after not getting the returns they wanted.  Meanwhile a lot of LEC's sponsors have stayed on, and the orgs aren't overspending while giving their sponsors deliverables. Astralis is public and they are profittable, so they clearly have an idea what they are doing for example.
Isnt that the point though... LCS was only profitable because they fucked duped everyone into thinking it was worth ridiculous money and now its collapsing as the sponsors etc realise theyve been massively overpaying.  I dont think the LEC will have this problem, at least not to nearly the same degree.
100K average viewers is still plenty to keep a franchised league up. Viewership declining could frankly be completely out of the hands of the LCS/esports orgs. The LCS production this year is better than ever. There are so many players and narratives to cheer for. So many of the orgs are finally putting out good content. It feels like the LCS has made it much easier to care about a lot of the new players too. Everything about the LCS itself as a product this split hit an all time high for me this year. It just sucks that this coincides with lower viewership. The LEC struggled just as hard at one point and bounced back. Hopefully NA can do the same.
Not really agreed. LCS kept stealing big EU players (Edward, Alex Ich, Bjergsen, Svenskeren, YellowStar, Zven, Jensen etc...) and yet LEC still performs internatationally and with viewers for regular season.  However, it is certain that LoL is coming to a decline point but my 2 cents is more about the longevity of the game rather than the players.  I've been a hardcore fan of the game since end of season 1 when I watch the final and since 3 years I dont care much, mostly because its been a hell of a time Im watching this game. I guess it is the same case for many viewers as well.
At least Caps and Jankos still got it, I can't see either retiring in the near future.
It seemed like that sentiment haunted him for so many years, only for him to feel vindicated when he showed up for the LCS 10 and the crowd erupted in TSM chants.
Man I remember that moment like it was yesterday
It was so powerful. It was a good reminder to me how much these guys care and truly want to perform, while also showing the very human side of it all.
His last game wasn’t really LCS, it was worlds where he basically cried and alluded to being burnt out after they knew they wouldn’t advance   Later he did challenger series with Delta Fox but pretty sure there was no public crying moment there
Maybe not fun but it certainly sounds more “fun” than doing a ton of absolutely soul sucking jobs out there
Lol if you would tell me that instead of my regular job i could play lol 40hrs and be paid; it would be a quick decision.  Its more the do it day in day out and needing to perform at the highest level that will fuck you up.  And for sure even in my imaginary scenario, after 8 years id probably want to die instead of playing another game
Yeah since when is LCS players known for putting in the hours anyway?
Time to kill.  And the guy is spitting nonsense, Leblanc Rengar and old Gragas had faster TTKs than almost any modern champion.
It is, yet it happened. Bjergsen can do the same just as easily
Despite all the later failures of Origen and shit, the spaniard fanbase for him was **absoluutely masssiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiive**. On one alternate reality where he just turned all that early LoL success into a content creation thing and variety thing he could've become just like Ibai is for the hispanic world
eSports is new. In the future we will have many articles online talking about extremely famous pro players that vanished and are just living life.
> nearly all of them didn't go to college and some even quit HS.  That both is an argument for an against a life away from league. I mean they might be done with league for the rest of their life and step away. But on the other hand they literally don't have many skills other than playing league considering they left their education for it, so they'd be more likely to stay streaming or something. They could theoretically go back to school ig, or just retire if they made a ton of cash and managed their funds well.
I think there's a serious argument for Bjerg taking his money and just going to college and taking it slow for a few years. Even if he doesn't end up finishing it's just a good way to step away.
I think I remember Faker saying if he wasn’t a professional gamer he wouldn’t be playing this game anymore. That may been in reference to just solo queue though.
Dude had 100 ice packs on him during that farewell tour lol
i was basing my comment [on this](https://youtu.be/Ya8hY0S-8t0?t=55)     but yeah yall were right he probably said that to sugarcoat that his body cant do it anymore
It's a competition which is the guys point.
Dogshit take
it's only gem, why you hev to be med
u cant read
What? It’s something you dedicate every waking breathing hour to
And I hate people that can’t read text properly and fill in the blanks with their own delusions
Burnout from spending your whole life on your passion absolutely relates to both. But go off on a topic that nobody is discussing
Is it really that far fetched? I bet Ben Simmons can relate to a couple of the guys listed here.
Looks like you’ve upset the basement dwellers that have never played a physical sport before
Even being a fan can be tough. I don't watch much pro league nowadays except for international events.    Cause I no longer play and keep up with the game, I don't understand half the stuff that's happening on screen.
Thing is there is no way to please everyone if they didnt keep game fresh it would stagnate very hard and would be an absolute slog to play and watch.    For example imagine if we were stuck in many coaches and some pros "best" pro meta- ardent cancer(becasue it was a more measured and "chess like game"). It would be pure pain to watch and even bigger pain to play for 99.9% of players.   Rito does fuck up, but in general they do a decent enough job at balancing both pro and normal play.
My personal opinion here is also that for the past few years, every time a new champion was added to the game, more often than not, the game became worse.  The main reason I don't play much anymore is I despise the new champion designs so much.  I have 0 interest in every playing the new champions and they are often frustrating to play against, so my personal experience with the game just goes down.  I'm over it nowadays mostly, but it still makes me sad.   I know it's just me being a dinosaur and lots of people love it, but my experience is still my experience.
Man, both of y'all give me a bit of hope. Going back to finish out a physics degree and getting out of fitness at 30. Cheers to all of us!
LCS is going to shrink due to the lost of old fans and gaining less new fans, but I think that as long as the league is still there, the popularity of the game itself should keep a dedicated audience to the LCS.
Actually I think VIDEOGAMES IN GENERAL are going to cease to exist
Right?  Some banger games this split from teams that aren't 100t/tsm/clg.  No doubt lcs is taking a punch to the face right now, but if you truly like watching league, there is still league to watch.
Finals needs to gain 200k people that haven’t watched LCS so far this split to match last year. It’s already started hemorrhaging and it’s not going to stop soon.
Oh, so it is.
I am fully aware of when Hai picked Teemo. Wasn't talking about any series at all.
Yeah, who exactly is available from EU that's better than Maple? EU isn't the huge gap in talent it was years ago, and Maple looked solid this split. If they had a Chinese or Korean player they could snag I'm sure they could find someone better than Maple but it's hard finding someone to import that speaks enough English to play on an LCS team.
And always seems to show up decently in international games.   Honestly feels like the dude stopped declining for a few years which is a rarity among pros.
What  &#x200B;  Impact is still top notch, maybe not top 5 in the world like he used to but still consistently top 3 in NA
I would say Impact has always been top 3, saying top 4 cuts him short
Can't believe Bengi's coaching the team he's played in for so long. But so far, at least, he's proven to be good at his job.  Maybe it's because they got there first, but there really is just something different with SKT1 and Korean gaming in general. What did NA miss?
LCS players used to stream regularly because it was enough to make them not broke. Now they are sometimes prohibited from it due to "perception" issues via their contracts.
I remember even seeing players on reddit after games, cannot remember last time I saw that (tbf if I just got shat on in game I would not go look at reddit threads LOL).
For anyone reading this that misses the home grown feeling, fighting games definitely hit the spot on that mark.
Modern LCS content showing players is just too over-produced and doesn't stick to me. it doesn't feel like the old days of dumb memes and donezo manifestos etc etc. News comes from journalists instead of reddit comments or some dude getting angry on stream.
It’s hard to say, but personally I watched Bjerg during the time where he’s in his prime and I’m the most invested in league (playing wise), so I just feel a stronger emotional tie to him than most players.  Not that I can’t support newer players, but I just don’t quite feel the same way about them, even if I can’t point my finger as to why.
He did say he was planning to come earlier after taking a break but couldn’t find a contender team he wanted to play on.
I don't get how people can do that personally. I've been supporting Liverpool for \~20 years, if they went bankrupt and didn't exist any more I'm not going out to buy a Man United top which is what supporting C9 would feel like.  I've been losing interest in LCS ever since TSM visibly gave up on putting competitive rosters together. This year I was just supporting TSM, wanting Chime and Solo to do well, and I wanted Bjerg to get back to his peak on 100T because of how long I supported him personally. Now he's gone I will probably just lose interest in the LCS completely.
I'd rather choke on my own vomit in my sleep
did you mean "announcements and rumours" about C9-related stuff or about CLG/TSM/other orgs?    can't even be sure I've caught all the big stories anymore
wait hai and sneaky are out?
Very dramatic
I am obviously not serious, but it does feel sad to see long standing orgs and players announce they are perma leaving all at once. Retire was one thing but Bjerg now fully gone, CLG gone, TSM probably gone (and more probably following suit in both Na and Eu) all comming out at once just ain't leaving a good feeling to witness right now.
nah bro saying that he stated "C9 is going nowhere" kinda implies he's going to start hiring the most clueless and aimless managers to drive C9 into the ground, whereas saying "it's not going anywhere" means it's not going away any time soon
Was a shame they flamed out so hard internationally that year.     That team looked poised to absolutely take names with the form they had domestically.     Still a great year though. Also biased as it was my first LCS split LOL
I respect that, man. It really is hard to see these players leave after what they’ve done for the LCS. Here’s hoping DL keeps on going for another split or two.
Whatever he wants? Dude has been a top pro for 10 years now. He should be set for life. As long as he invested his money smart and safely he should be set to never have to work again.
I mean, it's not too far removed from esports but he could be a content creator just doing other stuff. Alternatively, he's almost assuredly made enough money off of League to sit on it and figure out what he wants to do for a while.
Not sell insurance when he's a millionaire for sure.
Not the other commenter but I would wager he... doesn't get a regular job for some time or at all? Bjerg is set for life monetarily speaking so he has no reason to rush out and get a job. Frankly I expect him to do what most people with plenty of money do when they step away from what made them all the money: Enjoy life whether that be through traveling, exploring hobbies, find a business venture to invest in, spending time with friends and family, or just relaxing. For someone that has been grinding for 10+ years trying to be the best and is now finally stepping away, I don't think Bjerg is worried about getting another job unless it is something he really loves doing.
> Astralis is public and they are profittable  Their result for 2022 was a loss of ca 1.3 million Euro.
I think they have way more than 100k. People misses out that LEC has multiple official streams with different languages not just the main english ones. And they added even more since more regions belongs to LEC now
> yet LEC still performs internatationally  We're talking about the current situation lmao.
I damn near cried when that happened. Dyrus is one of the first names in the League hall of fame for sure.
They are talking about last year when all the old pros came for the finala ceremony thing
Oh you are 100% right, was his intro at worlds when they were introducing the NA greats. That makes it even more emotional knowing there were a lot of international fans too.
not at 80 hour a week  I don't love my job or anything but I clock out at 5PM and do my personal shit afterwards. I don't work more than 40 hours a week.   At 80 hours your job becomes your life. I enjoy my league games but if you force me to do league related stuff for 80 hours a week I will go insane.
I unironically would prefer to do my actual day job than play lol 40 hours, especially if you said it had to be soloQ. Even if I could do ARAM for 40 hours that'd be brutal.
In no reality can you play any sport (e-sport or otherwise) for only 40 hours. Sports are 80+ hour commitments. Even your sleep is so giga important for your performance. I've had a glimpse of that lifestyle as a semi-pro tennis player (college D1 level) and it's nutty. To be that good in LoL requires the exact same time if not more.
When doing something that you do for fun becomes a job, your perception of the thing might change very quickly from having fun playing  I'm thinking more in the amateur to professional chefs, I've had a few friends make the job and they both soured pretty quickly. Your passion becomes a chore.
It can suck to do your hobby as a job. I love gaming and probably game far more than I really should (like 20\~ hours a week minimum), but one of the best things about gaming is that it's an escape from my work. Not to mention they were often doing way more than 40 hour weeks during the LCS season/worlds between practice/setup/game time/interviews/sponsor events. They did have longer vacations than most people got (even for those who went to worlds) but it was definitely more than 40 hour weeks for most of his career.  And out of all the games to play 40 hours a week the one that would drive me insane the fastest is league. Despite how much I game I can only ever get like two ranked games of league in before I get burnt out win or lose.
>And the guy is spitting nonsense, Leblanc Rengar and old Gragas had faster TTKs than almost any modern champion.  This is definitely true but it's also kind of an unfair statement. It's a bit more nuanced than what you are saying here.  You are taking the most bursty champions and then you are generalizing to the game as a whole. This is unfair because most champions were not like Gragas or LeBlanc at all.  Back in the old days, champions were much more different in terms of strengths and weaknesses. There were not many "jack of all trade" champions. Most were super specialized in some thing.  LeBlanc or Annie were obviously super bursters. LeBlanc in old League fell off a cliff late game and had to snowball hard.  If you take the average champion in 2012 and compare it with the average champion in 2023, the TTK is *very* different.  But you are correct that the most bursty champions were even more bursty in the old game. Champion identity was much more of a key part of the game in those days.
Old kayle just swatting you off the map vibes.   Yeah people who say shit like this either didn't play then, are trolling, or maybe both.
> They could theoretically go back to school  Tbh the life of a student while being fully financially independent and not having to worry about money sounds pretty sweet.
That's basically what I'm saying. I think a lot of people kinda take it for granted that retired players will stream, etc. but I think too often we forget about the paths not taken for a lot of these players. Bjerg crosses me as someone who is pretty smart and have a genuine interest in going to school or something else.
Yea it was soloQ in particular. Ge still loves proplay according to him
I'm pretty sure that was solo queue, and IIRC it was also part of him being absolutely fed up with the literal inters in his games for betting sites and the fact that Riot wasn't doing (or wasn't able to do) anything about it.
Yeah that's just solo q. In his recent interviews, he talked about how all the things he had to do as a pro aligned very well with what he wants to do  rn.
Yeah idk what that guy is talking about. Kobe was obsessed with basketball even when he retired
ah that's a fair point. i guess it's expected to say it like that on national tv
Even being a casual player is tough. I play since S2 and nowadays half of the skins they release make the game unreadable for my boomer eyes. Nothing like new Lux skin where Q is invisible and so is E while R is half the size of actual hitbox for some reason.
Yup, I played regularly and watched lcs for a good 6 years, but after my son was born I complete lost touch with it and now 5 years have past and it feels like to much work to reintegrate myself in.
It's hard to argue with the success of the modernization of the game. League is still big over a decade later. Clearly Riot did a good job with it all even if they obviously made huge blunders along the way.  It's just important to realize that the modernization will not be better to some people. This doesn't mean they are stuck in the past necessarily. It could also just mean that they prefer a different type of game. Nothing wrong with that.  Game designers in 2012 had totally different ideas and values than game designers in 2023. Gaming is much more "business" than it was back in the day. If you go back 10-15 years, gaming industry was just a bunch of nerds doing what they think is fun.   Nowadays, the suits and their business strategies are directly influencing game design - for better and for worse.
Hang in there. It's tough but it's worth it.
I went back to college to get a trade diploma (albeit an unusual one) at 35. I thought it would be awkward (I was the oldest one in the program) but honestly it wasn't. And that was more than a decade ago, it's even less so now. It's normal to go back to school, much more normal than it used to be, if you want to change your life up.  Whether or not you can afford to live without a job or handle both job and full time student is another story these days...
aww man this decline of entertainement media is really awful :( what are we gonna do now ?
Seriously, ALL MEDIA is just done at this point, no?
Actually i think JOBS IN GENERAL are going to cease to exist. Praise our AI overlords
Nah - but we're all gonna die tomorrow
NA missed being into things like MOBA and RTS games in general. Like NA looks better in Valorant than they ever did in LoL, and it's at least partly because NA zoomers actually play Valorant. Honestly just a gaming culture diff tbh. Same thing as why Japan never got big in LoL either, they were never really into PC gaming so unlike their neighbours in SK and CN, they just didn't have much of a LoL scene.
I'd love to get into fighting games but the only one I was ever any decent at was smash bros, might try Tekken 8 when that releases, I enjoyed 7, but every time I tried it online I just got fucked lmao.
I think you answered your own question. When you were most invested in League, you were most invested in the players as well and the top dog at the time was Bjerg. Now that you're not as invested, the newer players arent as interesting. And that's okay, you do you. For me, I'm as invested in League eSports from S2 when I went to my first worlds as I am now. To validate that passion, I need to keep moving forward and looking forward, even when my favorite players are no longer playing.  I just hate the fucking doomer comments saying no Bjerg, no CLG TSM DL Dash sponsors Saturday/Sunday games international wins means LCS is dead. Does it need a reset? Yes, but at least LCS is trying and I can appreciate that. But hearing comments saying LCS should just die is the most asinine thing.
same bjerg was the only reason I followed the LCS and ever since that season 10 offseason I havent been interested in watching the LCS whatsoever. With the time I have I’d rather just watch LEC and big LCK matches
Same. If TSM is out, then I'm just done watching LCS, I don't really care about any other org/player. I tried watching other teams but it's just not the same.
>I don't get how people can do that personally.  It just takes one cute player for me...
Conversely I don't understand fans like you. I like individual players, I fucking LOVE the game. I'm here to see the game get played to perfection. I'm here for the hype and the stories. I'm not here to simp for a corporation. I don't give a shit what jersey the players wear and frankly I think it's pretty weird to do. I give a shit about how they play.
Idk man, esports teams aren't really tied to a city, they haven't been around long enough for it to be like "well it's the family tradition to support them" so to me it's like eh whatever orgs can come and go
You use Internet Explorer for your LCS news?
They were one Viktor ult from leaving first place in their group with two of the best teams in the tournament in the group. I to this day think they were one of the best teams at that tournament.
Bjergsen really doesnt seem like that kinda guy to me.  He seems like a person who needs something to work for.  I could be wrong of course, don't know the guy.
That was just an example of a normal job.
Idk, maybe.  Yet he might find that he needed the sense of direction that those 10+ years of grinding towards a clear goal gave him.  That grinder mindset will not just evaporate.  He always struck me as a serious sort of guy.  I cannot picture him drinking margaritas on the beach for very long.  Figuring out what he wants to do will not be easy for him.
Oh woops I misread the convo. Thought it was about LCS.
Not on this particular discussion I replied of.
Definitely.     During his time, who else was there in NA that has the same longevity, impact, and consistence?      I mean he was the NA top lane standard for years..     There's the obvious Doublelift and Aphromoo, both of which were around the scene for a fucking decade, but who else?      Most of the old guard just withered down, and even in Dyrus' case I think he still had a season or two in him, just had to go to a different team where top lane wasn't completely neglected.      I'll admit to straight up crying like a baby when he talked about letting his fans down, while being impressed at how well Sjokz handled such an unpleasant moment.      Dyrus is definitely up there in the hall of fame. Can't believe it's already been like 7 years  O\_O
I can almost hear the "get the fuck out off my lane" against Ackerman. What a great time
For me, members from TSM, CLG, Dignitas, M5, Cloud 9 and CLG.EU from like S2 deserve hall of fames. Maybe not all of them but there's so many characters that helped shape league as we all know it. Get fit with krepo, snoopeh stare, Genja botlane. Darien. Rush hour (not quite s2 but still). Those teams combined with deman & jatt casting was peak LoL for me. Maybe i'm just wearing some nostalgia goggles.
Holy crap, I just watched it now.      I'm absolutely shocked.    I've watched the competitive scene since s2, and I just now realized that until now, 90% of NA history is just TSM, C9 and CLG dominating the scene.      Until the blooming of TL, there really were no other teams.    And with the recent news of CLG and TSM probably leaving the league, holy crap.      My mind is in absolute shambles.
Yeah I think this is what some people don't get. Being a pro in esports isn't the same as being a streamer or something where you can make your own schedule and only "work" for like 20-30 hours a week when you get big, yeah playing a video game is more fun than a traditional job but having to play the same one for twice as much time as people put into their jobs? That's pretty brutal, making way more money than normal jobs does help to make up for it but I think people underestimate just how draining having little to no free time for such a big chunk of the year can be
Depends on your age.  At 18? 20? Yeah I could've totally done that. 25? No shot
Yamato did say this on his podcast featuring Romain Bigeard, even as a coach League and coaching the team wasn't just a job, it was a lifestyle, there was no work/life balance, work was just life because that's what staying on top requires from all the competitors at the top level of their region.
I've been working 60-70 bussing tables at a couple spots on the vegas strip the last year or so.  You definitely wear down and lose some of yourself after a while.
Every person I know who starts putting "serious" hours into league gets there a lot faster than 80 hours, I'll say that much
Please stop feeling sorry for millionaires playing video games
a lot of it is looking back with rose tinted glasses, when people were first getting into league it was new and exciting to learn and get better at the game, after years they get frustrated with it not being their favourite meta of the past.
Nah - see the thing is that at their most absurd, xin and Leblanc were really strong and had insane ttk but overall if you watch old league there was a lot more point and click CC, and a lot longer time to kill in lane etc.  Like I've played this game for a long time, and getting one shot at level 2 by half the roster is pretty unheard of. Certain champions **at their worst** had insane ttk, but not the roster as a whole.  It's very obvious playing ADC when time to kill changes, and it's gotten faster and faster.  The worst change riot ever made was pushing for 40% CDR > Ability Haste without repercussions. There's no downtime anymore. Bruisers / mages / assassins just having permanent uptime abilities, runes are significantly more higher damage than the defensive counterparts, sunderer and botrk literally turn champs that should never kill tanks into tank shredders idk the game is broken right now.
I actually knew a dude who was in my year in my major but was like 10 years older. The issue was though he was kinda alone in school related things, it's just hard for like a 27/28 year old to hang out with a bunch of 17/18 year olds.  From a finance perspective it sounds amazing, but from a social life perspective, it seems a little isolating. But that's only for a bachelor's, in grad school it's pretty chill with people of all ages.
We had a 34 year old mom in our mechanical engineering classes. She had kids a couple years younger than us. She still fit in well, she was on my design team. Didn't seem awkward at all.
TBF many pro players have said they love the competition but not grinding soloq. IDK about faker but it seems like for many players, the main thing that keeps them going is professional play and the thrill of competition (and money for some ofc). I recall bang and wolf specifically said the entire SKT team was on the verge of madness when they won worlds twice in a row, then they had like a 1 week break before having to practice again for kespa cup. They kept going because it was their job and they still had the drive to win, but getting dropped by T1 after worlds that year seems to have been the back-breaker for the botlane.  It's worth noting that showmaker also went to the finals of almost every tournament he could in the span of 2 years before the roster swap, including a kespa cup right after winning worlds, and that was mainly during covid where they had to quarantine after flying to every new location. Not many people could probably handle that.
If you watch Faker 2023 soloq highlights he’s playing ridiculously well and making so many sick outplays, he’s actually peak form atm
Not surprising in pro play you don't get degens stream sniping him and then inting or trolling his matches or permacamping him just so they can say "I killed Faker"
>It's just important to realize that the modernization will not be better to some people.     Yeah you cant please everyone, people leave people come back, new people pour into the game.      >Game designers in 2012 had totally different ideas and values than game designers in 2023.     Also why league has changed a lot- Players, they have gotten miles better. So mechanical skill and overall difficulty of the game and variance had to increase.   Because a silver 2023 is objectively better than a silver in 2014.    It is not only business decision, there is a big part of that. But also game health decision.      >If you go back 10-15 years, gaming industry was just a bunch of nerds doing what they think is fun.    Not really majority big games were still made by the same few publishers, with like 1-2 exceptions.
Back to throwing rocks at buildings and vehicles, I guess  *sigh*
Nah man them 'Prompt Engineers' are still gonna live!!!!
To copy my own comments:   > LCS is going to shrink due to the lost of old fans and gaining less new fans, but I think that as long as the league is still there, the popularity of the game itself should keep a dedicated audience to the LCS.  I don’t think it’s dying and it probably won’t as long as the game is alive, but it’s definitely past its prime as a league. I’m sure there will be new players, new teams, new supporters, even if I’m not sure I’ll be around for it (I barely watched LCS tbh aside from TSM games, and I pretty much skipped playoffs). I think that as long as there are people finding joy in league there will be supporters.
Sneaky hasn’t played in years.
I understand your perspective, and I'm not saying it's wrong. I was doing the same thing when I wanted Bjerg to get back to his peak level on 100T. Just as someone who has followed football my whole life, it's weird for me to consider supporting a different team. There's a different experience you get supporting a team when they're absolutely shit, and then the good times come back around. TSM winning S10 Summer, Bjerg going god mode every series, having  5 bans used against him then getting counterpicked, reverse sweeps, etc. is one of the most insane things I've ever seen in any sport, and it felt even better after the last few years of having to watch us being awful to mediocre.
That's definitely a logical way to follow the game. It sounds like how I follow the LCK. There's amazing gameplay and really incredible players. But that's not how I follow LCS or any other sports league. Like, if the Dodgers stopped existing I would watch some of the MLB playoffs and that's it. I like baseball, but I LOVE the Dodgers. Caring about players or an organization might be a more "traditional" way of following a sport and, to me, it has much more heart.  > I don't give a shit what jersey the players wear and frankly I think it's pretty weird to do  Out of curiosity, do you follow any traditional sports teams? I feel like this might be the cause of the disconnect.
Regardless, I've been supporting this team for over 10 years now. Supporting one of our biggest rivals is just not an option for me personally.
Yeah I just don't think he'll go to a normal job, when he could live off his millions. If he works it will be something that interests him.
I get what you mean. Some people don't like having free time or not having some type of structure day to day/clear goal to work towards. The good news is he has plenty of time to figure it out and honestly we have seen multiple pro players "retire" only to come back later. He seems quite serious about stepping away but only time will tell.
Yes it was, it was a discussion about the current state of pro league.
Dyrus just wanted to play league of legends
I think that moment with dyrus was one of sjokz career moments as an interviewer.   She couldn't do anything when (se)xPeke hit on her, or some of the other early league moments, but she handled the dyrus situation so well
Impact?
+ the pressure and stress of actually competing, and constant worry about your next contract, most people simply wouldn't be able to handle this.
Depends. They're making well into 6 figures for those 80 hours.
 If it really was that fun do you honestly think he would've retired? It's depressing as shit, especially such a high stress game for 12 to 16 hours a day for 10-13 years.
Yeah, millionaires shouldn't have feelings or emotions!
Who's one shooting you *at lvl 2.*
You just hang out with grad students.
One of my friends in college and I met a guy in our EE classes sophomore year who was 30 and was in the Navy (technically still was just not active).  We became friends and even went on a vacation together after graduation.  The age gap never felt particularly weird to me.
Where was this? When I was doing an undergrad we had a 50+ year old who seemed to get along with the rest of us pretty well. About 20% of the whole class were 20+
That's been generally my experience as well which is why I'm kinda surprised at the replies to my comment. I'm a 26 year old grad student and I'm friends with grad student in their 30s and undergrads in their early 20s. I don't really think age is such a big deal for friendships.
>Because a silver 2023 is objectively better than a silver in 2014.  I needed to hear this.
At what now?
Same, I get why esports and traditional sports have different supporter cultures, but growing up with traditional sports I could never just "switch teams" even if it makes more sense logically
This is literally the comment I replied to : "Come back when caps, jankos and rekkles retires. The LEC popularity will drop as well"  Are we done with this childish play now....
As long as a routine is demanding, there is always a tipping point for everything. Especially when one already reached a point that they can fuck it all and still be fine.  That is always why the likes of Faker and Deft are just simply out of this world.
You need some perspective.
But saying they are living "hell on earth" is a little exaggerated.
Only within the gaming community can one find the gullible fools who feel sorry even for the 0.0001% :D astonishing, next you'll say someone born into the royal family of England has a tough time because they have to make so many public appearances.
Want another motivation?  Being hardstuck is not bad, it doesnt mean you are not improving it means you are improving at the pace that everyone is improving. If you hit lets say silver 2 every year you are better than you were last year.
They are still just employees. Just because they have money doesn't mean they don't depend on shitty employers. If they don't like it they have to find someone else to pay them that doesn't require them to play as much as some people do for free.Those employers are the 0.0001% not the players.
I don't even play League of Legends. It's just funny to me that people have so much hate and vitriol in them that they really dehumanize people just because they're rich.
Counterpoint, if your team is up 20-0 in kills and you lose you were doing something fundamentally wrong to not convert a win. Something like acing them and recalling instead of pushing etc.
Balancing comebacks is hard.  - On one extreme: the game is so snowball that the enemy team should just give up because one mistake = GG.  - On the other extreme: dying once with a lead basically means you should just throw your early game, because more meaningful fights later will swing, elastic rubber band-style, all the way to you.
You're the "exception". Basically what happen was a game that the enemy had to FF15, they decided to play it out for the 5% chance to win. You basically throw so hard you gave them that 5% and handed out the other 95%. At that point is not on them anymore, is on you. You did all you could to make them win, therefore you deserve to lose.  I like early game, i'm convinced almost every game can last 15/20m if properly executed, because games can be decided the very first minutes of the game. From there on is all a matter of leveraging that lead to close out the game as soon as possible. The sooner you end the less chance there are for the enemies to close out the gap.
https://imgur.com/a/5rGde9C
 no way u can't close out 20-0
Yes, that thing is being in low Elo with people who are worth shutdown gold.
>Balancing comebacks is hard.   >   >On one extreme: the game is so snowball that the enemy team should just give up because one mistake = GG.On the other extreme: dying once with a lead basically means you should just throw your early game, because more meaningful fights later will swing, elastic rubber band-style, all the way to you.  Don't think we are at either extremes at the moment, but I do think bounty falloff needs some looking into, I feel like the bounties on objectives and champions last for longer than they should
We are currently at the second one. There is no world where an Asol should be even in items after two shutdowns when they go like 0/5 early.
You mean my team fed the Asol several shutdowns and lost us the game?
why do you think you should not be punished for being bad.
I tend to agree with the original post that the shutdown mechanics give the team down too much of a rebound - but   >  that thing is being in low Elo with people who are worth shutdown gold.  is completely wrong. that is not what you did wrong.
We aren't. Two shutdowns won't bridge the gap in gold unless your team is really bad
Yes. Is still a team game, you can't control the other 4 people
I agree. Which is exactly why comeback mechanics need to be a lot weaker.
2k gold will bridge most gaps.
Seems like giving garbage teammates leads is bad because they will just feed the Asol 2k+ gold with one mistake. Playing support in low Elo is truly pointless.
you punting your lead is a larger mistake than getting behind in the first place. Stop fucking up and whining about it.
If you're giving up 2k in shutdowns it's deserved tbh.
No it’s not. If someone makes of the same mistake 10 times, it shouldn’t be off set by the other person making that same mistake once.
I’m not, my team is.
🥉 bronzie crying 😭😂
Low ELO mentality. ' it's never my fault'
The only retort you can think of because you know I’m right.
So it’s my fault if my teammate with a 1k shutdown dies on their own?
Learn to close games instead of trying to flex your ego muh 20 kills
Idk? Did you do your job as a support?
Be on the other side of the map over extended to save my 1k bounty teammates vs 4 players when objectives are up?
He did patch notes far before he joined balance team. I think thats why he joined it. Dont think he will do it after however
The Valve approach is to add no commentary and let the community figures do their own lengthy review of "why" these changes were made. Ranges from nerfs of the highest win-rate/most complained about characters to more esoteric ones and their impact on the meta (or expected impact).
He's certainly got a lot of experience. I think he's been at Riot since the very beginning? Certainly I don't remember a time before him, and I remember the old dodge mechanic.
Either this or the ryze flash one i would say. Though considering how big of a meme "he doesnt do anything" and "this kids too cocky he built sheen" became in this sub, this video would be more popular in here.
Nidalee is too tanky  https://youtu.be/rrgCoWBl4r8
I can never fully watch this one, that guy actually tilts me.   Second-hand tilt.    But for me I'd say it's the "fuck man, she's too tanky" from lord and saviour xPeke
I've never seen this one before, what a gem.   I need more of this.
I knew what it was going to be before clicking, so yes.
The master yi guide, or 420 maokai probably.
YOU HAVE NO MANA!  its more of a clip but i would say that  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGqNFH0atfc
It's not even close baby
Nah, some of the most well known ones that have stood the test of time are  xPeke - Too tanky  Aphromoo - Support is so easy  Dunkey - Not even close baby  HotshotGG - Why Nunu why  Best Ryze flash ever  -----  The Malphite meme has just gained a ton of traction lately with Malphite making a splash in meta after being absent for a long time.
And this is why voice chat doesn't exist.
Hahaha, it reminds me of the old days when I used to play with my friends, and we all rage quit after losing a ranked after a friend had to leave because his mom entered his room at 2 AM cursing.
https://youtu.be/w5BHjSGCj1o   https://youtu.be/UVFbs_hAJrc
it would probably depend on how long the person you're asking has been playing, for me it would've be WHY NUNU WHY, nidalee being too tanky, pro as heck guide to master yi, or xerath big play

Cannot play Lee without quoting R Kelly at least once
It's kinda funny that this clips is from 2016 and that it is still considered new age of league. That clip is as close to the beginning of league as it is to the current season.   Changing the map was a very big cutoff point but atm it has been 5 years with the old map and next year it will be 10 with the new one.
its a pro player but it's not from pro play
I'm interested to see whether Geekay will continue performing in the next stage. They looked very strong in play-ins.
Personally every single Ivern pick the first thing that goes to my mind is "Is he trying to make me dodge?" and then I remember the only people still playing Ivern are Ivern's one-trick so he probably knows what he is doing so I get more comfy.
People keep forgetting top karma can be a thing again with roa, poke the shit out of people tower bait with ult w and just be a general cancer to the ranged vs melee matchup
Taliyah sup, I get a lot of gold just from the runes and the sup item. I get my mythic before all of my teammates
Malphite Support against non mage supporters. You poke till lvl 6 and then you insta kill them with your adc. Low skill pick if you wanna support a premade when you dont play support usually.
I have a 60% wr with ap twitch support. A significant portion of my losses are from my adc’s trolling/afk because they are tilted (Gold 2).
I play Sion mid to great success, hard cucks most assassins between W shield and Q base damage, better wave clear, infinite scaling, demolish for if they try to ditch waves.
Zilean TOP : Useless early, cannot even harass enemy laner, can push correctly tho (that is what makes this pick work). But after laning phase enemy has a 0/0/0 Camille and your team has 0/0/0 Zilean. In good hands it's in my opinion a "super support". I use Ghost and TP so I can lane safely. Then in teamfight I ghost and boost two mates with E. If your adc is ahead it's game over. Any fed Zeri/Samira/Vayne you just E R them and wait for their pentakill. But Zilean top is turbo boring to play.  &#x200B;  ....Zoe TOP : My newest creation. I have a very good normal game MMR so I don't doubt of the efficiency of this. It's a special strat I created and didnt see anyone playing it like this.  My strat is simple : Harass the enemy laner until he gives me early prio, then when he s under turret poke him. Force him to back. Most of them greed and die under turret because I stack huge waves.  Aery is the best rune for toplane. Just auto the enemy level 1 and bait his all in. With ghost and Ignite (and Nimbus Cloak) you are the spacing god. Any all in by the melee champ is also punished by E. Add the random drops from W. It's hard to predict. Please try Zoe Aery/Nimbus/Transcendance/Scorch/Biscuits/Cosmic/Attackspeed/AP/armor against melee.
Love me some Kindred ADC.  Long as you get 7+ stacks and scale into late. HOB and E gives some good lil poke patterns in lane. Ult makes for some hilarious tower interactions
I was in champ select for a ranked, internet went out momentarily and once it was back I had like 3 seconds to choose a champ and panic-picked Sejuani support and found her to be quite enjoyable. Ticks most of the boxes that tank support champs offer and if your jungler is melee (added bonus if this applies to your mid/top laners) then the ganks feel even sweeter.
Mid Singed always pops off in my games.
Teemo jg >:)
J4 Support
Rammus in every role, No, not even joking.
Teemo support
Samira mid, rlly good
sona soraka bot
i get flamed or have my opgg demanded basically any time i lock topplesticks or middlesticks  i play a lot of kalista, kindred, soraka and draven top too, which always gets friendly reactions
Braum top, you can trade somewhat easily in the laning phase because of your passive and W for resistances. Then, in the late game you can slowly switch to  a more peel focused support playstyle. I normally play it when I 5 queue with friends, they play some really weird combos in bot lane, so we can sort of role swap the support and top in the late game.
Honestly I’m pretty sure you can play Karthas anywhere and be useful lol, people get kind of nervous seeing him top though
Singed jungle. It’s so damn fun and very easy to get your adc fed early if they bait and clear wards regularly
I’m still a fan of Illaoi Support and always will be. It’s the same logic as stuff like Veigar/Seraphine/Swain bot, that you just have more people to hit with your stuff. Having a second ally to help damage the spirit just makes sense and melee ADC’s besides like, Yasuo and Nilah aren’t a thing really.  Anyway, if the enemy lane doesn’t expect it and you hit E’s, it’s great. You just fall off a cliff after laning phase or if the enemy is smart enough to play back and not feed you. Basically you can build AD support stuff like Cleaver and Umbral and be paper or you can build tanky like Locket and Vow and do nothing after laning phase. I find at that point it’s most effective to just sit on top of your ADC and threaten dives with Pull-Ult and just try and make assassins think twice.
Shaco... anywhere except jg.
J4 mid
A long time ago when adc kennen was getting popular
Unless they're actually trying to make you dodge
wait is taliyah support still good? i used to main support taliyah before her changes
I do this when I’m tilted but always win. So now when I’m tilted I run Malphite APC. LOL. And still win cuz AP one shotting is too fun.
Just play adc or Jung. Tilting averted.
I love playing tanks mid. Idk why but it just feels good
One of my favorite duos when I can get a friend to play it is Kindred ADC with Taric.
It has always been high up in winrate but it is a very small group of players that play this, which also kinda explains the winrate. Quite recently actually it somewhat almost got meta but not sure what the changes were that made it go away again.
Those are nunu picks for me
What changes? :0 I play her everytime I get auto filled, you get a lot of gold from first strike after your first item
Nah let him cook
predator nerfs iirc
i was talking about her rework. u used to be able to oneshot enemy bot lane at lvl 3 if u landed w. her rework took away all her early game power
Overall she is a worse support than pre-rework, especially in lane but she is still quite good. She lost quite a bit of early power but kept her roaming and is way less feast-or-famine because of her utility buffs (E, Q slow) that don't scale with gold/lvls.
oh yeah it doesn't burst like that, you poke a lot with q hit the item mission early on and usually that would get you to the mythic, then you roam an get kills everywhere
I used to play competitively in college and it was so much fun! I wish more people tuned into Collegiate LoL
Yeah, I figured these writeups are a great place to practice some of my writing skills while bringing some attention to a fun little corner of esports, especially with some of the attention lower-level ERLs or female teams have been getting on this sub recently.
Brazil smurfing.
[Here is a video drill showing how to improve your skills in practice](https://youtu.be/buZw8c-MwHo)
Practising Lee Sin and Riven combo's in the practise tool might help you out here.  Maybe somehing like Osu would work as well but that's more for mouse movements.
- In general, truly reacting to unseen projectiles/spells _is_ hard. You have to have really good reflexes for it. If you anticipate it or are expecting it, then you are going to react quicker.  - Using the wrong hotkey for spells is "skill issue" - just keep practicing. It's like in fighting games, where you mess up a button input. It does happen but enough practice and you get consistent.  - In regards to not using every ability (active items or 3 spells and summoner spells), that's also just a matter of practice and awareness. If you are able to expand your capacity/bandwidth to remember what tools you have (and what tools enemy have), you will remember to use an item/spell. It kind of becomes a flow-chart once you have enough experience.  My personal recommendation would be develop understanding of what enemy is trying to do - that will aide you in figuring out to react. Of course, sometimes the game is so visually messy that it's harder. In which case, button mashing 👌
Do you usually look on the keyboard while pressing?
That stuff will come with reps. If you want to have huge bang for your buck I'd wager there's 0% chance you look at your minimap enough being in iron. Turn a metronome on (they are on the web) to 12-15 BPM. That's once every 4-5 seconds. Everytime it goes off no matter what is happening in the game look at the minimap. Do that for a while and you'll: 1. naturally look at the minimap more even without the metronome; 2. notice way way way more happening on the game map because you look at the minimap more (this will let you see ganks coming, be aware of skirmishes, see teammates in trouble, etc.); and 3. up your game knowledge and play from those factors.
And remember, when you feel like you wanna punch the screen, tap Alt+F4
A good idea IMO is to pick a champion you enjoy to one-trick for a while. Once you've gotten comfortable with them, by not having to think about how to pilot your champion, you'll leave more mental bandwidth for thinking about tactics and stuff like that.
Do you have any thumb-buttons on your mouse? If you do, you can rebind flash to that, and while you'd still need to work on the muscle memory at least you wouldn't be blowing your flash as much in the meantime. Another option might be to rebind your qwer to asdf; since f has a raised bump to make it easy to find/reset to, this should help but would require rebinding a lot of buttons.
Thanks, that is something I was looking for and I like how he makes it fun!
Thank you! I will give it a shot. I usually play Annie if that matters.
No, for the most part I try to go for the feeling of where my fingers are. From time to time o do look down to make sure they are where I think they are.
Thanks! Yeah, I do have to improve on many other aspects, is just that clicking the wrong button or not clicking it at all is so frustrating.
One thing that might help is blocking out the steps of your combos ahead of time, and choosing key binds based on that. So for example annie players typically put their flash on d instead of f because that makes their r + flash play smoother (r into flash makes tibbers come out faster than flash into r btw). Another advantage of this is if your e is on cd, you can rest your e finger on flash until it's back off cd which speeds up your reaction to enemy plays. If you go rocketbelt/shurelya's for gapclosing, then putting it on a similar 'off' finger would make sense. So for example if your full combo is something like r +flash -> w -> q; your q finger isn't doing anything until the end of the combo, so you can put the active item on 1 and rest your pinky up there at the start of the combo before dragging it back for the end of the combo. If you go Zhonya's it makes sense to put it on 4 for similar reasons, since either your e or r finger can reach it easily and rest there while the skill is on cd.
This episode had me in my feels man. Hauntzer joking with Santorin and the hug from Bjerg especially
Too much above lcs minimum wage. Shut it down.
damn beat me to it
I know everyone is disappointed about this being motw, but I recommend you still watch the video. it's really well made.
Possibly the worst matchup of the weekend
Another G2 MotW, what a surprise
The least hype match being a MOTW? Why?
And people said the same about FNC G2, either way the game will get more viewership than all/ almost all others.
In terms of viewing numbers it is the most followed team against the winners from last split so it makes sense. KOI did also win the BO1, but I would agree tbf. Feel like the banger games will be SK vs BDS which sounds very weird to say.
Hmm when have I heard this sentiment repeated
but the video is really great though
At this point it should be clear that match of the week isn't decided through game quality and it's not even about the most important matches, it's about viewership and historical rivalries. KOI vs G2 will bring in people interested about G2 and it will bring the Ibai crowd.
cause G21
It would be cool to have friends on my friends list
Agreed - any time I've went to gift a skin as a surprise to a friend it's only been on the basis of knowing which champs they play and seeing what skins of theirs they don't own and then choosing one at random. A wishlist would be a neat idea.
they have this in wild rift, but unfortunately we won't ever get it on pc because the client is held together with a slurry formed from hand sweat and dorito dust
It would also be nice if the wishlist could notify you when a skin goes on sale. There are some skins I wouldn't necessarily buy full price but may buy if it gets discounted but if you aren't checking the store every week it refreshes you might miss a sale. Seems like it would be in Riot's interest to notify you so you are more tempted to buy it. I feel like even just having items lingering on a wishlist and then getting some extra money would remind you, hey I did want that skin.
Or a random skin button in champ select, or being able to see what chromas your team is picking, or being able to order skins by owned in champ select, or...
be carfull what you wish for. with how the Client is working right now it will break if this get implimentes
It would work for females tbh :p As a male my friends would not gift me anything haha.
It would be cool if gifting would actually show the receiver that they got something, rather than being in the little notification icon and you ask 1 month later if a friend received a gift, only to learn they did but they didn't even realise because there was absolutely no notification.
E-girls be profiting a lot from this idea.
Wishlist would be helpful, not long ago i met someone learning Samira while i was learning Rell, teamed up for a few games got them a penta. Sent a friend request, they didn't login for a few days, after 24 hours client still let me gift them the highnoon skin.
If u want, i'm on EUW.
Right? We used to have dozens of people online at one time. Now the only time anyone is on is when we're playing ARAM.  Also it could just be anecdotal, but do people not add each other as friends anymore? And not just in league
I usually gift RP for my friend's birthdays which I think is normal? Would be nice to gift them skins.
NA *sighs*
Riot has made it their mission to do everything they possibly can to discourage interacting with other players. Every patch there's a new way to NOT talk to anyone. How would you ever know who is worth adding and who isn't when 90% of players are perma mute and 9 out of the other 10% only type to flame?
There is a bug where people of any elo can duo with somebody who is on their first game of placements. He is duoing with olaf.
Turn off duos until placements are completed. Problem solved.
Ita a bug, can only be done on the first game.
Edit: over the past 7 days,   you've won 21 games with an average gain of 22.19LP  you've lost 23 games with an average loss of 20.96LP  ---  TL;DR: you lost low amounts of LP in many recent games, including 12, 13, 9, 4, 3. You never gained that little in 1 go. Hence the game is accounting for that. Edit: when you lose a game and lose 9LP, you really have another -13LP 'stored' which you won't lose immediately (so you don't get demoted etc.) but you will lose more over the next few games.  note I only took care to only look at ranked solo matches  ----  There are a few reasons this can happen:  Playing with a duo: if your duo is some distance from you in terms of rank, sometimes LP gains get a bit odd like this. I don't know the details really.  Badly matched teams: If the average LP of your team is significantly above the average of your opponents', you will gain less for winning and lose more for losing. You'd only expect to notice this if you're playing at very odd times.  Most common (and what seems to happen to you) is that you've recently had games where you haven't lost the normal amount of LP - you've lost less. (in every single case where I've seen someone complaining about it on reddit, this has seemingly been the reason)  https://u.gg/lol/profile/eun1/remus%20wins/overview  If you lose less LP than expected (either due to hitting 0LP, having a leaver (unfortunately, this doesn't protect your MMR, only your LP - temporarily) or for another reason) you can expect to gain less/lose more LP over the next games. It makes sense, imagine losing a game at 0LP silver 4, you still deserve to lose LP but you won't be demoted. So the game makes up for that by making you gain less until it evens out. The same principle is happening here.  ---  Edit: over the past 7 days,   you've won 21 games with an average gain of 22.19LP  you've lost 23 games with an average loss of 20.96LP  There is nothing peculiar to see here.  (note i can't include a few games, because u.gg doesn't show LP gain/loss. But even if I assume 4 more losses with 30LP loss each, the average loss is 22.30LP).
You fucked your MMR by having a 48% winrate against Silver players.
Local League player finds out that he has to have more wins than losses to rank up, more at 5
Your actual MMR is below the MMR attached to your shown rank and division. The system is designed to make you lose more than you win in this case to correct that disparity. If you've played a significant amount of games already this season then you're essentially stuck because individual games will give increasingly smaller changes to your MMR. You would have to play consistently way above your current level to break out of this. You've been plateaud and the only way out is to wait for the next season.
Team dif 😭😭
It's Riot's system trying to lower your rank.
Get good kid
Because you are really bad at the video game. Consider getting good at video game
U have to make a new account or play 1000s of games to fix ur mmr, u can thank riot for their shitty system.
Untrue, I have a 57% over 300 games in ranked solo and I've been bronze 2 or 1 for the entire time. I started realizing you wipe out like 5 wins of LP in 2 losses.   Also the sheer amount of people complaining about LP gains exactly the same as OP this season shows that there is definitely a problem there that wasn't there last year.  Riot: just play 2000 games a season bro it'll average out
Op.gg?
It's because last season I had a 38% 🤣 I know how MMR works it just doesn't feel good lol. One bad season ever and it doesn't compensate for all the seasons I were playing good. Just had the first terrible season ever last year because I'm a wagey and would play ranked while drinking. Season before that I didn't play (for the first time since season 2) outside of placement so I lost gold+ then.  I'm on a pretty good winstreak now, and a high winrate on role. I stopped taking LoL seriously and realized I'm never going to be a pro or challenger, so just play for fun. So all up I honestly enjoy it more these days.
No i meant the link to your op.gg, what is your account name
I know you meant that lol that's why I explained the reasoning behind my LP gains personally, and others experiencing the same probably have a similar experience to mine.   I would imagine people who have this issue had a bad season last year.
youre saying its Riot's bad system but youre bringing up how you fucked your account over with a 38% wr last year lol you griefed yourself and your teammates playing drunk and now youre mad bc you have to fix it?
Not just me, my case is personal and OP's might not be the same, but this thread is posted a lot basically daily.  See your attitude and salt, exactly why I didn't link op.gg to redditors 🤣 unbelievable how angry you are over nothing I've done to you.   Someone pissed in your cereal, or maybe no one did, puzzle and dragons boy is alone and seething at reddit anons.
Game is in a better state. It still has issues but feels like it’s easier to balance instead of everyone doing 100-0 after 6 min into the game.
Way better now. The game before was just to see who could one shot the other the fastest. While that still exists for mages and assassins. It is much better now.
It's better post patch. The game is just more interesting when tanks work, when small mistakes don't mean insta-death and big ones still do. Where cc matters as much as burst. Teamfights are more nuanced, and people might actually plan around using an ability twice or three times per fight, instead of once or twice.
Game is still 100% in a better state than it was before durability patch.
way too far removed by now. IMO it was kinda dogshit made melee supports next to useless and turned bot lane into ranged v ranged shitfest for a year. thankfully we are past that now
The durability update was a bandaid of a greater problem of powercreep. There's too much free damage and power in the game from runes, items have gotten way more powerful (compare mythics and legendaries to items of the past) and kits  in general have become more powerful. For example amumu has charges on q and annie has a lot of stuff she didnt have in the past.  Durability patch was just a dent on this overarching powercreep that's been going on for years.  Changes I'd like to see: Items generally nerfed. For example mythics that grant movement is a cool idea, should they also do a bunch of active damage at the same time? Gore drinker heals you, should it also deal damage? Everfrost CCs, should it also do a burst of damage?  Less power in runes, less choices in runes. Riot stated rune choices before rework felt like micro optimizations that you can't feel in the game, in that case how about players select less runes, instead of the full 6 runes it can be reduced to 3 or 4  Nerfs to base damage. More power in scaling ratios and spell levels. This again is another case of free damage.   I think these suggestions would help the health of the game. If all 3 ideas would be applied, we would get what durability patch was supposed to be.   For example, supports would return to being a supportive role instead of being able to oneshot carries in midgame, junglers ganking would need the help of their laner to kill, and minions would have meaning as one of the game fundamentals of minion advantage is almost gone at this point as their relative damage is low and they are killed off too easily (durability patch actually made minions even weaker as they deal even less damage to champions than before). These are just some examples of the benefits we can have with an actual reduction of power across the board
Made the game less fun for me and some of my favorite streamers sadly. In my opinion game was more skilled before this update.  Before everyone could kinda oneshot, but this annoying oneshoting is still in the game. Just that its now limited to fewer champions, and if you dont play those you are gonna have a bad time.  So yeah and im not a huge fan of the high base armor and mr champions got. Wish we could half that value, i.e not completly revert the stat package, but split it in half since i think it went too far.  Still cool that riot still makes big changes to keep game interesting, but i think this experiment should be over by now.  Edit: Forgot to mention, bigger picture is gold income is too high, and items are too slot efficent now after s10 rework (specially ad caster and bruiser items) . Which is why i think durability patch failed because we still havent tackled these 2 problems at all.
Durability patch was an L. Makes it harder to punish positional errors from people. Of course Reddit likes it cuz it favors low elo players.
I’d like to get back to the early seasons 2 tanks could fight for minutes late game and maybe longer, a tank would lose 1v1 full build to most adcs also at full build even if they could stick to them, a tank was there to cause disruption and if ignored he cced the back line(engaged and disrupted) but the tank wasn’t going to kill people he was going to get them killed…there was far less true damage I think it’s nuts just how much there is and I believe there was only 1 source of % max health true damage…at this point I kinda think there should be items that reduce true damage. And healing/sustain should be hard to get on champs that aren’t designed to heal/sustain. I like to see tanks not getting one shot in one spell rotation but I don’t like that they are competitive with some of the duelists in duels. (Que the argument “if tanks don’t deal damage they are ignored” if they are ignored your carry’s will die in cc the tanks will get them killed)
Other way around, there is still far, far too much damage in the game, especially from runes and items. Very little counterplay. Supports and tanks absolutely melt squishies with just a bit of CC. That's why old league was better
All the patch did was nerf assassins and tanks while buffing adc and enchanters for no reason, awful patch.
i'm down for another one honestly, maybe one where they actually nerf all healing and not just adc healing this time as well
They didn't solve anything because they added back more damage to counter durability. And damage was the reason durability was introduced. They just had to tone down damage and healing and they didn't.
half the roster deals true damage, who cares about durability
Why don’t you actually give your reasons about why gameplay hasn’t improved?  The overall consensus is that the game is far more enjoyable now then it was pre update.
Mages and assassins now need to invest in full damage items to oneshot and they need to hit their whole combos to do so, before you had mages building utility like everfrost into hourglass and still oneshotting people or assassins building goredrinker into deathdance and still oneshotting you, now mages need to go luden into shadowflame with penboots to oneshot while assasins have to go full lethality.
Small mistakes still mean insta death for a lot of us, just not for tanks/bruisers who astonishingly do a ton of damage despite not building it.
and yet tanks and bruisers can be quite unkillable
22 = 80.
Ignoring hp increase ignores true damage(except for 2 characters who got nerfedcause of it)
tbh if your going full lethality in this meta you are completely trolling cause u aint onetapping a 1k shield adc with peel
Because if they're not damage threats ADC's will literally ignore them, having CC is not enough of a threat.
I know the point of a tank is to soak up damage, but Heartsteel seems impossible to deal with as a solo laner in top.
lets ignore that items give true damage
It is, because your teammates get to do dmg when you cc somebody (now dont say "you cant rely on teammates", cause if somebody is cc'd even silver or below players kill them).   In the first place, tanks are supposed to be countered by adc's. So it's actually healthy if tanks lose to them in a 1v1.
2 items, one of them is only bought on like 3 people, one of them already has true damage in her kit.  Roughly half the marksmen prefer to go galeforce or shieldbow instead.

Damn the smaller ERLs have stepped up massively this year
ESUBA <3 Ins't this the best result of Hitpoint Masters representant ever?
Got clapped by Gary fockin Clarke
Imagine the turkish league has been getting international spots all these years. Should have given it to ERL teams then...
Where do you guy watch it ? I simply don’t see the English broadcast anywhere ?
MAD actually lost to Serin, HolyPhoenix and Farfetch at MSI 2021 too
Farfetch is so bad he turned TCL from a minor region into a meme ERL
Ahmet Kaya?
Except The Netherlands. We have great individual talent but our teams just fking suck.
Not Balkan
They got to this stage before. If they win 1 more game then it's the best result for Hitpoint Masters.
They were better than Entropiq thats for sure
It used to deserve the wildcard spot however over the time the region regressed because other regions leeched the talent and coaching never really improved
They also brought in results at IWC and Play-Ins though, let's not rewrite history
well, this is a 3rd seed team...
It was on EUniverse channel in twitch.
Yeah and they pulled a smart one to not lose to Armut again
You speak english too well, every good player just goes to the bigger ERLs.
Thanks man ! Is there also a YouTube stream ? I couldn’t find one either
It also feels like our ERL is just a fucking retirement home. All the good players don't even debute here, they go straight to Spain/France.
[https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/EMEA\_Masters/2023\_Season/Spring\_Play-In](https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/EMEA_Masters/2023_Season/Spring_Play-In)  Scroll down, you have list of every stream of Emea Masters.
i dont know if there is an english stream on youtube, sorry
Thanks man
What a shitty clicbait thumbnail
It would be neat, but this would be way too difficult to judge and be accurate. For instance, the only active members from 2013 are Doublelift, Darshan, and Wildturtle (3 out of 50). It's been a decade since and memories would be hazy.
Well, who do you think should get these awards then?
It'd be cool to get a community poll going, but I bet fan favorites would likely win.  This is going down memory lane, so take my choices with a grain of salt:  Spring 2013 is hard to remember. TSM was the leading team in a lot of roles, but had good competition. Standout players include: Mancloud, Bloodwater, Cop, Turtle, Oddone, but lining them all up for all-pro is hard.   Summer 2013 all pro should be full C9. They dominated that split so hard. Other standouts may include DL and Mancloud. MVP maybe Meteos or Hai, they were both incredibly dominant IIRC  Spring 2014 all pro maybe C9, but with Bjergsen instead. Hai was still super good but Bjergsen really brought TSM up that split. Other mentions include Dexter, Scarra, Aphro, DL, Shiphtur  Summer 2014 All pro: Balls | Meteos or Noname | XWX or Bjergsen | Vasili | Lemonnation. This one's hard because it was a pretty competitive split between 3-4 teams. It was also the split that CLG went to korea for the last 4 games, which screwed up the rest of their season. Honorable mentions include Altec, DL, Amazing, Lustboy, Dexter, Aphromoo.
Thank you. There are some names there I don't really recognize, so this was helpful!
2013 summer is Meteos hands down MVP, Hai was great, but Meteos was gigasmurfing the whole split.
To add to that, I started in season 3 worlds and xmithie was pretty clean on Vulcan and for lmq's run Ackerman was pretty fuckin good. All of lmq's players had standout moments. Krepo was good. Sheep stood out on a lower tier team. Quas was a beast.
Lol these other commenters hating are classic league players.  Great site, always good to have more and unique projects. Can you allow non-members to guess rank? It doesn't have to save progress, but it would allow newer people who visit to try it out.
Nice idea ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|money_face)
[it already exists](https://rankdle.com/games/lol)
Thanks for the kind words! The rank functionalities are unfortunately built around having a login \*because\* we have the leaderboard and scoring system and the fairness it requires. That being said, we've thought about it even before the release, and we think we might have a solution for people that simply want to check out what our users are voting, without actually showing the rank answer. We will most certainly announce it on our discord and add it in our FAQ page whenever that happens, however I unfortunately cannot offer a timeline for this feature. Looking forward for your feedback if this solution would be satisfactory
We realize that you might feel that way, however we feel that allowing anyone to upload their own highlights in a simple and convenient way, and have other users vote on their rank brings more variety to the user experience. Come give us a try, you might enjoy it just as much :)
I have not even looked at the site yet, but something already existing is not a reason to not make something. Plenty of products are better the second, third, fourth time around.
Not when you represent yourselves with throwaway auto-generated usernames lmao
Did you forget to log out of your alt? 😂😂😂😂
We are not a corporation to "be represented" and we don't sell anything. We created something because we felt like it and want people to use it because we think it's a cool idea. I don't really understand why my username would matter, especially since Spooky posted on his account, and if you would've watched the demo, you would've noticed it's his username on our app as well . But here, I'll change my "Throwaway" username just to make you happy
Not really. I'm the second guy that works on this project. Notice the "my friend and i" bit in the title :)
It screams "I want no formal association with my project".
You scream why the hell are you so invested into that random guy promoting his for fun page, lol
This is weird behavior
Nice alt
wow... the same "alt" comeback as the other guy :Thinking: :clown:
Yeah bro pure coincidence that blocking someone leads to a response by two alt accounts who either have not been active on reddit over multiple months or don't regularly frequent the sub yet find their way on an obscure thread.      Oh wowee, look. You're exactly one of those, and two months ago you shilled this exact website.     Nice alt again. Make more.
Sejiani, Sion, K'Sante, Maokai, and Cho'gath are top tier currently in pro. Some of those picks are multiple lane-flexes.  No one plays Trundle.  That basically sums up his current strength.
He’s been horrible since they gutted his AS
used putting 2 points into q before levelling up e to increase clear speed, but that makes it harder to gank/go for all ins without cc, its not good, but as an otp, its playable, just need to make up for it with matchup knowledge, etc., but hes in a really tough spot
Both his jungle and toplane feel weak as fuck. I definitely believe he needs a buff, but given the state of the game atm, I highly doubt it will happen. Malph is strong as fuck after 2 consecutive buffs(no changes), olaf was ignored until his winrate skyrocketed...it is what it is.
They should make his Q give him a Hydra effect like Nilah. Then he can at least clear.
Unlike the popular opinion I think that trundle jungle is still viable. If enemy team has a tank or bruisers you can make him work. I'm also good at countering abilities with E, and in general the correct usage of E is really important! The trades are mostly in favor of trundle so you will be fine if you invade or get invaded or in a counter gank situation.
ass
E is fine. Its just not his meta.
Thank god too.    Trundle metas are honestly aids and people don't bitch enough about the champion tbh.    If you're a melee bruiser or assassin and you're not 9/0 you might aswell just give up every objective and not go near him or he'll 100/0 you in 2 seconds while stealing your stats and slowing you to hell.   Fuuuuuuck trundle.
Trundle is basically being kneecapped by traditional Trundle who's slow effects are impossible to see.   Sorry, that you missed out on his exclusive cheater skin that only veterans are allowed to have.
exactly hes completely useless at even the one thing he's supposed to be good at, who do I need to tweet at so that they buff him? since twitter seems to be the only place they actually answer
The W nerf was disgusting. I was surprised when I saw that in the patch notes. He lost like what 40% attack speed at max w?
yeah he got violated with 3 nerfs in a row and now he's useless, he is never a good pick over other champions, he needs a buff YESTERDAY
Isn't e the pillar?
I honestly think his sole issue right now after falling out of the meta isn’t his AS speed, it’s his tankiness being nonexistent. Even when I build DS + pure tank items, I still feel like paper during during fights unless I had the luxury of a true tank on the enemy team to ult. I know he’s a fighter and isn’t meant to be a tank but when I see champs like graves or kayn build basically pure damage and still soak more damage than me with full tank itemization, it sucks.   Riot just needs to give him some more base defensive stats or some better defensive stat growth so that he can fill the same role as other beefy bruisers again. Or if they want to play into it thematically, give him some extra defensive stats when standing on W so he’s thicker when he’s in his “domain”.
Yeah it’s an unpopular opinion cause he is actually really weak lol, his ult doesn’t affect tanks as noticeably as before, sure his E can be disruptive but not worth choosing the champ for, and he’s both too squishy and doesn’t deal enough damage to stand out in any field, he’s never a good option over other junglers atm
well yeah in a meta where every champ has mobility, CC and even tanks brush off his ult like its nothing then he's useless, but its also cause he was violated with 3 nerfs in a row and now he's useless
Maybe it's just you..but I never had a problem playing against Trundle, even when he was meta.  There's worst offenders in the jungle that I hate playing against and Trundle's not one of them.
Legit one of the biggest stat checks in the game, right up there with Nasus and Yi.  But now we’re stuck with tanks in the meta and junglers have no pick to kill tanks with
he is extremely easy to counter lmao, his W doesnt even have a ghosting effect, also what slows? his Q slows for 0.1 seconds which is literally nothing and the tiny area around his pillar, I think youre just bad lol
I have that skin, it doesn’t change the fact that his stats suck and he’s never a good pick over another Jungler, and again what slowing effects LMAO, the tiny zone around his pillar? That’s it?
yeah, skip pillar for higher clear speed if u dont expect to gank/run into enemy jungler, but its a high risk
Then just don't play it until things change. I make him work still. I prefer J4 over him but trundle isn't useless.
No. Definitely not just me. Pretty much any high elo bruiser or melee assassin player.   Really depends what you play.
Yep. If you can't 1 shot him don't go near him.
Man reading this comment really does make me understand why people who are genuinely good at this game avoid this subreddit.    Ok I'm gonna break it down for you despite the fact i should probably save my breath because it'll go over your head anyways.     I said AS a melee bruiser or assassin. It's hard to play into him. Which... if you're capable of common sense would mean I'd need to be close to him to do damage.  Now slow down. I know I'm going too fast here.  Take a deep breath. Ok so basically if I'm within range of him he can land an easy pillar right? Thus slowing me longer and more efficiently.  Woah! That's whacky! He'll also speed up through w, idk why you mentioned ghosting like that matters in the jungle. So I'm slowed. And he's fast.  And he's reduced my attack damage so with my only options being to run (I'm slowed)  or fight (my stats get stolen so i lose this fight)  i have to just ignore him the entire game.     Fun stuff man.  Let's have this chat saying when you finish your silver promos.
yeah he's not useless but he is weak af, he desperately needs a buff just so he can be in even standing with other junglers, he's like the bottom of the bottom percent atm
To me it just seems like you can’t handle a champion that you can’t easily beat as a bruiser just cause you want to do so lol, so yeah I guess if you’re a bruiser you’d have to play around him, kind of how players usually play around enemy champions all the time but maybe that’s too much effort for you and would prefer to just run in head first without having to strategize lmao
How can a champ be overpowered if you can counterpick him? -phreak
Riot: just pick rumble. Counterpick the counterpick.
That's what happens when Riot gigabuff an underplayed champion. He already was a great answer into AD matchups and team compositions.   Then...then Riot started to buff him to increase the pcikrate. Instead of making him a real interesting champion, balance team made him just op. They chose the easiest solution.
Shen counters him too
 He literally doesn’t do anything, he’s useless.
Everyone: then ban it.   You: but I have to ban Fiora to blind pick ksante.  Everyone: you’re an idiot.
I agree that Malphite is boring AF and way too strong right now, but claiming he only has a single Counterpick is BS. He gets Countered by every Tank except K'sante and Poppy, all AP tops except Gwen and Kennen, and also Olaf, but to be fair he is broken too.
Shen, ornn, cho maokai, sylas counter him hard and are easy to play
Yeah I just perma ban it’s not worth the headache but then that leaves other picks like riven illaoi up that are also quite strong. One day he will get nerfed (copium)
Bro, pick Cho’Gath, enjoy the most free lane of your life.
Everyone saying "just counter pick him bro 🤓" you know youll pick before enemy top half the time right?
Rumble
Jax tech with Grasp+Dorans Ring start, get a significant advantage early
I use mordekaiser to counter malp so somehow it works. I just try to zone malp before clash.  Also, sion and yorick works (for me) too if you don't mind learning them.
Morde takes a huge dump on him. Sylas on him is pretty good too. I stomped on him hard with fizz too once, but the sample size is just too small (1 game)
I recommend picking Jax into him to train stoicism
This rhetoric around malphite is so funny to me  Malphite is literally counter picked by every single champion in his class archetype. He’s a champion designed to counter “fun top lane champs” riven jax etc  Try picking anything like sion, sej, ornn, Shen, chogath, etc into him  You’ll quickly realize every fucking tank top is the freest lane for other tanks. Particularly, full tank sion is literally Free LP into malphite it’s a joke
I watched a K’sante rip a new hole in his ass yesterday, try that out.
Dodge E and back off when he has his W on. Keep poking to keep his shield off if you want to trade vs him. Learn to flash his ult
I love how the malphs always stand off screen and spam laugh and dance then the moment you walk in radius you get ctrl alt deleted
Sylas is freelo against malphite
Morde is his only counter? Lol, so many champions do well into him.
You have a ban...use it
go proxy
u know you have bans right
Just counterpick the champion only played as a counterpick, it's not like he's oppressive to 90% of the cast and forces you to blind pick a boring ass tank you don't want to play or force a ban :). I don't understand why riot keeps on pushing counterpick meta for top like this, rps but you can see your opponent's hand lol.
this is the guy this subreddit worships...
they just want more malphite oneshot clips in the next few pro play matches
But he just killed you.
Ah yes "just ban him" great counterplay right there. I guess a champ can never be broken because you can just ban him
I just blind Cho, I can deal with the counterpicks.
Then pick him first, if he's so op.
Malph is a super hard Jax counter wym 🤣
Main problem with fizz is you're playing fizz top
im literally a ksante otp, once malph has first item + steelcaps u cant do anything against him anymroe
I mean if I were an adc main I would also
No he didn’t
…man this fuck cost me a ranked match…
Ekko ult in a nutshell
The transition from the 2016 stixxay tristana play to the one last weekend against EG was so well done.
Berserker: Everywhere i go people ask me what i think about Prince. How many more times do I gotta beat this guy for y’all to stop asking this question?  Everyone looked NICE in their outfits too.   Great video.
Stixxay finally potentially be able to be back in the finals after 7 years, Prince getting his first shot at a title in his career, and Berserker waiting for them at the top completely disregarding them, what a video
This video is a turbo banger wtf
The Blaber 4 trophies part was really cool
Berserker and Blaber are the perfect fucking pairing for Cloud9
The moment when blaber raised one of his fingers and it cut to his wins was fucking fantastic.
The Blaber sections are always so good. I'm so so happy that the LCS is finally pushing the guy more. The countdown and showing his first title to the one last summer was executed perfectly, and in a lot of ways felt like a COVID recap. Indoor, to social distancing, to back to normal.
After the magazine cover promos and this... looks like lcs is tryna expand the women audience
The Berserker line at the end holyyyy
Disappointed we didn't get to see Licorice whip out his massive cock in this teaser but I'm ready for it on Sunday nonetheless.
Glad to know LCS hype videos are still GOATED
Whoever directs these needs a raise. The sound track ending on the four and the build up with Blabbers fingers too after they all told their stories was tight. Also helps there’s four of them there too
its kinda insane that blaber already has 3 titles and is well on his way to his fourth. he's definitely building his own legacy right now.
pure distilled banger
Holy fucking hell, this made me feel more than any promo video I've ever watched aside from the amazing LCK videos. It looks so good!
another certified banger from the LCS
Need a Stixxay vs SKT at MSI finals redemption arc
I like how everyone sounds so longing and reflective in the video, they play way more into the players’ emotions than just hype. it’s really well-done.   Also NC looking beautiful as usual :)
I unironically got chills. Great teaser.
Man, I'd forgotten how funny the 2020 spring championship win was when Zven just broke the trophy against the ceiling
Man I don't know who I want to cheer for tomorrow now. Prince and Stixxay both have compelling story lines, honestly I can't be disappointed no matter who wins it in GG vs FLY. I just hope it's not a 3-0 stomp for either team.  Also Berserker's cold af, he got that dawg in him for sure.
I'm so hyped for this finals man. The defending champs, the new hotness, and the underdogs.   I really hope this weekend delivers
Berzerker is a fucking savage !
why is stixxay so hot
I teared up, watching the CLG vs TSM clip. I remember seeing it live... it makes me so grateful to be witnessing such an amazing esport!!
Foo Fighters :( ugh... I'm still not over Taylor's death.
LETS GO STIXXAY!!!
Someone is going to take the shot of blaber holding his fingers into just the middle finger, I guarantee it
damn. tingles
NA production has had the best hype videos recently. LCS 2022 spring was pretty good, and then Summer 2022 and Worlds were some if the best hype videos in LOL history and this is just continuing on from that improvement.
The video was fantastic, but to see and recognize spots from around Raleigh sent an extra set of chills down my spine. CAN'T WAIT FOR THE GAMES, LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOO!
I think I’d feel cheated if I were a Flyquest fan, but as someone rooting to send Stixxay back to MSI, I’m very happy with this video.
Fuck, man. I really want Stixxay to get his redemption, but I can't help but cheer on Prince
Music choice was awful
That’s a good hype video
kinda cool that C9 get two reps but the other teams get 1 in this vid. makes sense considering they are in GFs alr.
Amazing video, it's so easy to cheer for players when you see how much they care. I'm torn because I don't know if I'd rather see Prince or Stixxay go to MSI  FINALS WEEKEND!
shaping to be a great finals weekend; I'll be happy regardless of who wins at the end
That and the Blaber counting bit were absolutely incredible
LCS video editors have always smurfed
Those back-to-back CLG vs TSM finals series were peak LCS.
Straight up OGN vibes with that line
that line went really hard wtf
"I don't think about him at all"
Stixxay this season like John Wick  >	Yeah, I think I’m back!!
i feel like i'm watching an anime
I have been firmly on the train that Stixxay is being carried by Gori and River and when you put resources on stixxay he fails to deliver and he proved me right all regular split by not ulting, using flash, and etc. in critical moments.   However, after that game 5 play, he is forgiven. He is forever Big Dixxay and no one can tell me otherwise.
straight into my veins
I get the arguments for Xmithie, but at this point, Blaber really is the GOAT NA jungler.
GOAT in a making… fiting for this hype vidéo to be dropped same day Sorn announce his retirement!!!
Blaber should be the face of the LCS, Riot putting Core in the worlds video last year was straight up criminal.
I'm a woman who's been watching both NA and EU LCS on-and-off since i was 13 in S4, but I have to say...the boys are looking especially cute in this video (and it helps that LCS styling has been really on point lately! Clothes and hair make a huge difference imo).
Big Dicorice
its always amazing when they show the emotions of the players rather than just hype plays montage
Berserker *
Cheated how so bud?
IMO it was a nice Flyquest thing, especially since Prince also got his Drive Video this week, it felt like they have been set up as underdogs.
The three teams in Raleigh all have nice stories to going into the weekend.
Shut your mouth Dave Grohl is a king
yeah the music cut was perfectly timed with that moment
[removed]
*”How many times do I gotta teach you this lesson old man”*
If they win Sunday, it will be his 4th with 4 different mid-laners.
Im sorry but the argument Xmithie at this point are people without eyes doing results based analysis, his peak play/skill level does not touch Blabers, not to mention Blaber has accomplished all his feats with a revolving door around him on the team and always been a driving factor on his teams.
nah, Xmithie way outperformed blaber internationally
No way, Xmithie made plays that no one currently playing in LCS can make.
Inb4 jojo is in the worlds hype video and blaber/C9 once again get represented as a sticker on a parking meter
TBH C9 should be the face of the LCS in every worlds video. Only team with worlds success from the region, and have made all but one worlds.
I'm still salty af about that. Blaber is NA.
Right? The video sets up a great emotional arc for Prince.
Karma bot
The Xmithie arguments basically boil down to: longevity, number of titles and 2 MSI finals appearances  Really the only thing he has over Blaber is just the MSI performances
If C9 win a Bo5 against a Korean/LPL team then it goes to blaber internationally.
People are living in some revisionist shit with Xmithie. Xmithie never had made it out of groups at worlds and Blaber has, 2016 MSI run doesn't happen if SKT didn't tank groups and took out RNG. If CLG had to play SKT or RNG and not FW they were out and we never talk about that MSI again.   The only accomplishment that is even worth talking about was the 2019 IG one, which was amazing but then they followed that up with the most embarrassing BO5 in history of all international events.   In LCS, missing a sej ult or gragas ult was called the xmithie. He was always one of the first ones replaced after a successful run because anytime he won anything on CLG or TL, they thought in order to compete internationally he had to go. After 2016 he got replaced by Omargod in middle of the split in 2017 and then after winning 4 LCS titles back to back and reaching MSI finals and once again failing to make it out of groups in 2019, he got replaced by broxah.   Blaber is a key contributor on why C9 is good, xmithie was always the first one replaced and was a serviceable member on top teams that needed a resident jungler.
What are you talking about? I've seen so many whiffed Sej ults when she was prio pick
C9 leaves the LCS not because of Financial Reason but from lack of respect.
Plus they literally just did Drive for Prince. C9 should be a bit more of the focus for this video considering they're defending champs & already in finals.
Yeah I love Blaber and I’m also still on the Xmithie train because of the 2 MSI appearances.   Blaber is flashier for sure, and has the worlds quarters appearance, but he needs one more international thing (or a few more domestic) to put him over Xmithie. Xmithie was just a rock he brought teams together
I’d love to see it as an NA fan, but a hypothetical bo5 win over a KR/CN team is a massive “what-if”
I feel like people forget that Xmithie whiffing Sej ults was a meme at the Crabber level.
That guy is exaggerating, but there is one xmithie play that I had not seeing before in pro play until he made it, then it became some what of a normal thing,[ the play in question was when he kindred ulted the dragon to steal it from RNG at MSI](https://youtu.be/KZrVzxJt3Bc?t=25). I think that is the play xmithie should be remembered for and that should have his name as he made it popular internationally, other than whiffing sej ults ofc.
Stuff like the flash Body Slam here to peel for Doublelift.  It might seem like a simple play in retrospect but he always knew where the priority in teamfights was, and there were really very few better teamfighting junglers in the history of the LCS.  I don't think Blaber is a better teamfighter than prime Xmithie.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_CPvOlkilk
True, just saying what it would take. This C9 team might have a chance.
2018 C9 won just as many Bo5s as Xmithie did against KR/CN teams... is Zeyzal the greatest NA support of all time for being the only one to beat a KR team in a Bo5?
One of the greatest most hype plays of all time and I was watching that shit at 4 am while pooping. Pure coincidence.
[Here is a clip from literally last week from Blaber peeling for his carries](https://twitter.com/C9LoL/status/1641556505555259393)
thats just one decent flash body slam, nothing extraordinary here
I'm so glad this year's MSI format is basically nothing but BO5.
Chance against who exactly?
That was not intentional.  Maokai starts the Q animation before Wukong's flash engage.  It was an amazing result and just unfortunate for the Wukong, but not some kind of god peel by Blaber.
It's not all Bo5, there are Bo3 now in the play-in stage. But MUCH better than Bo1
For an upset Bo5 against LCK/LPL? Did anyone think C9 would beat Afreeca 3-0 or Liquid beat 3-0 IG before it happened? Upsets happen you just need the right pieces and C9 has them.
No point in this conversation when you are obviously not gonna be swayed by anything. Have a good one.
I mean it also only has happened like twice the whole time league of legends has existed, the reason we talk about 2018 and 2019 so much is because it didn't happen before then and hasn't happened since then.   If C9 or NA in general wants to actually beat a KR/CN team which are getting better every year, they really need to stop dwelling on the "He is good in NA and not a problem so we shouldn't replace him" approach. Fudge is good in NA but he is just another top laner at international events. Also Zven is just painful to watch as he sits in lane 24/7.
Blaber haters are a different breed, you won't get anywhere trying to convince them.
My brother in christ, I refuted your point with logic.  I'm not disagreeing just to disagree.  Blaber's play was not intentional.  If you want to show me some recent peel that was as good as that Xmithie play, I'll certainly take it into account.
>I mean it also only has happened like twice the whole time league of legends has existed  That's generally because NA has been unable to pass to Bo5 stage. If C9 win finals they are automatically in Bo5s at MSI.  >"He is good in NA and not a problem so we shouldn't replace him" approach  This is a really dumb argument since there have been teams that have tried this and end up failing even more in NA. Look at TSM in 2018 dropping DL. 2020 TL dropping Xmithie. These were teams who tried to focus internationally and where unable to even win NA until they fixed their mistake. It also doesn't make sense. How are you going to make roster moves to make your team better if they aren't the best in the region?   > Fudge is good in NA but he is just another top laner at international events  You're entirely wrong about this and the problem yourself. Fudge was incredibly good internationally in 2021, but you hyper focus on 6 Bo1s in 2022 and say he can never be good. He was playing better than Korean & Chinese tops in 2021, and the decline seems to come from his stint in mid, which he has clearly recovered from at this point.  >Also Zven is just painful to watch as he sits in lane 24/7.  No he doesn't, he's constantly making moves with Blaber when needed. C9 usually puts Zven on strong laners to help Berserker as Blaber focuses on topside, but his Rakan game this split was insanely good. He's also dramatically improved this split.
Lack of appreciation of our regional talent is exactly why our league goes down in viewership. Here you are complaining about great players because you have some affinity towards the eastern teams and we  are here defending our guys since they are great players. CBLOL doesn’t care about international results and Seiya is considered their version of Faker. Just wish we could appreciate our people more before it’s too late.
I swear to god recency bias makes everyone forget Fudge at MSI/Worlds 2021 because of a bad Worlds 2022.
I usually do my best to avoid the conversations but sometimes I can't help myself.
I don't hate Blaber.  In fact, I think he's a great player and the best jungler currently in the LCS.  But no one with eyes and a brain can look at that play and say he intentionally peeled the Wukong flash engage that clearly began AFTER he started his Q.
I showed you a peel clip from literally last week and it wasn't good enough, but that's fine. Do you want me to show you how many pop-off plays he's had compared to Xmithie?
It’s just another word for joy, which is a thematic element of that champ
On a similar note, why does Ekko always say "Tahm Kench!" when he does stuff? Are they lovers? An unrequited crush?
Thank you!
This was driving me fucking insane thanks!
This is like when I hear Fizz say “Mating time!” when he hits ult
Tahm Kench is just Ekko in a fedora.  “The Boy Who Shattered Time?”  *Ekko puts on fedora*  “TAHM KENCH THE BOY WHO SHATTERED TIME?!?”
He says time snap in W
Excel really managed to ruin this roster. Must be something seriously wrong with this org, so it makes sense
The way the Vetheo benching was announced struck me as quite odd, and this video explains that situation a lot more.  If these claims are true, and XL are breaking German contract and labour laws to try to terminate employee/player/staff contracts, then that is a fucked situation, and Riot has to conduct an investigation into this.
Aside from the main point of this video, which is almost standard shady esports contract fuckery at this point, Thorin mentions towards the end that Excel did the Astralis tactic of asking players to take a paycut to be able to get Vetheo, and that those players might not have even wanted to have Vetheo on in the first place.  Now, firstly, that is majorly fucked up. Secondly, the only player XL retained from last year is Patrik, so, unless XL asked people they signed in this very off season to take a paycut, Patrik is the player in question. Thirdly, if Patrik or whichever other player in question wasn't on board with getting Vetheo, that also might explain some of XL's flaws and their failure to ever get rolling as a team.
Very nice org.. didnt they even hire that cringe socials guy who loved hitler?
You just can't keep the clowns out of esports.
And just like with EG, absolutely nothing will happen.
Thorin on a 3 kill streak
Least shady Excel moment
Very worrying revelations. Esports winter here to stay.
Esports orgs 🤝 shady buisness name more iconic duo.   Seriously tho more and more people should lawyer up/ consultant lawer for contacts. I remember how Rekkless was saying on stream how his lawer pointed out the 6% salary thing in G2 contract but still didn't take it seriously.
To think we wouldn't know about this if ButtPounder420 hadn't donated to Thorin's patreon.
Thorin 🤝Exposing shitty orgs
Thorin teased this recently on Summoning Insight. Stuff like this going on behind the scenes makes a lot of sense, it seems so unlikely the underperformance was purely because of bad gameplay.  Hopefully Riot do their due diligence and investigate these stories properly (LOL).
If even half of this is true this should be grounds for Riot to force Tim to step down at LEAST, if not kick XL outright
X~~L~~D
how can the lec orgs be so shady and supposedly break laws and we hear nothing about this from riot?
Insert Ba Sing Se meme.
[LMAO](https://youtu.be/s4R9FkZIH9U?t=1951)  Thorin just must have an entire library of the receipts he keeps.
Honestly wondering what orgs *haven't* had shady business practices with one of their players at this point.
Well Riot you had the option of getting a H2K with financial support by PSG into the Lec but I guess we cannot have people who talk about financial stability in esports. So now we are stuck with clown orgs like astralis and excel who pressure their Players into paycuts.
this would be top of the sub if Travis made the video, this sub is so dumb
Excel Employees lala lala la?
Common Thorin W
About the social media guy. idk what happened in this discord but when there was anything about denying the holocoust or other things which happen at this time. hes in deep trouble with german law.
Sad about Vetheo and Targamas. In any other team they would be top players. But now both of them may end up in LFL .
Now we know where Karmine will get a spot from lol
Could anyone provide a TLDW?
Damn i love companies fucking with people
It’s heart wrenching to see. They showed such promise for a period last year, and now they want to run it down and int themselves to oblivion.
Very nice org.. didnt they even hire that cringe socials guy who loved hitler
The German authorities should conduct an investigation about this if it's true.
XL being a dogshit org that treats its employees like shit? Who would've guessed.
Interesting.. i haven't watched yet  But one of the major things for me (and others) was Excel dropping Markoon for Xerxe.. both had good splits (summer 22).. but Markoon looked far more like the modern/aggressive jungler u want for pro league + u don't really know how good he could get.. meanwhile we kinda know Xerxe ceiling  A few People had speculated it was a money issue.
Not only did they hire that guy, but, in this video, Thorin claims that XL knew about his discord and still kept him on because his posts generated decent engagement.   And this also tracks from what all the twitter people who originally exposed him claimed, which was that they had privately messaged XL and higher ups at XL with photos of his questionable comments and it was ignored until they made it public and it got traction.
He was also grooming minors and now he is spreading "tips" about tax fraud in Carlos' discord server
Now it all makes sense.
Going to be hard for the mainstream to take esports seriously when we have fiesta ringmasters running orgs like this.
Not completely. Richard Lewis has report that EG lost half of their sponsors, including Monster. They are not doing well.
In this case it is a bit different, since in europe this is a contract violation and a player could actually sue. In the US you are free to just fire people, not in EU though.  So this is problematic if a player decides to act on it. And if that happens Riot might actually be forced to do something, since an actual law suit would hurt a lot, even if Riot for once is not the target.
Lil bro got a uav
Because Riot themselves are shady?
They'll only act if this becomes big enough on social media. Unfortunately Thorin is a source, so lots of people will downvote/ignore it.
Well thats easy to answer. Even if they know, Riot surely doesnt like the idea of exposing the orgs they chose for franchising as shady as long as they can keep it under the rock. Orgs like XL might or might not be the pinacle of shadyness in LEC but without a doubt not the exception.      And the last thing riot wants is to see LEC orgs come and go and devalue the LEC and its franchise-spots. There is a reason its Thorin uncovering this and not anyone somewhat connected to Riot or teams.
>Riot you had the option of getting a H2K with financial support by PSG into the Lec  Was this ever a thing? I'm pretty sure both H2K Rich and H2K Susan said that when they saw the exact structure of the franchising agreement and the cost of buying in, H2k wasn't interested in buying a franchise anymore. But I may be completely mistaken.
H2K with Dardo!
Clown take and you don't want PSG anywhere near LEC
Sub only takes the word of the guy who is always reluctant to report on anything that might endanger his standing as a corporate mouth piece.
Victim complex.
I doubt you can get in trouble over a private discord convo. (in that case)
LFL is not bad you know. The leading ERL in Europe and a lot of rookies comes from these teams.
LFL wouldn't be bad for either of them tbh. They'll be back by next year anyway. (If they play how I'd expect them to.)
If Vetheo wants to play, theres no way Heretics doesnt get him (and Wunder) for summer split
Basically, XL has been trying to coerce or indirectly intimidate their employees into unfavorable early terminations of contracts, in a manner which contravenes German labour laws. (Maybe insufficient notice of termination, or termination without payout, etc)  They have tried this with multiple employees including players/staff this year, and in the past, one employee took them to court and won the case. Now, at present, others have lawyered up to fight them as well.  Thorin implies that the guy running XL, Tim Reichert (formerly of Schalke) is one of the main figures responsible for these tactics by XL, and his speculation is that - A) because of the competitive failures and the expensive lineup, XL is getting pressured by investors and B) they are trying this contract fuckery with people hoping they don't know German law and won't realise that they are getting fucked in an illegal way, and there is no way XL doesn't know what they are doing is illegal since Reichert is German and has labour lawyers in his family.
Lmao totally forgot about that. Super funny coincidence that they lost their next game right after that happened
There is no criminal statute that is broken here, but contract laws. Which means that the party negatively affected would need to sue.  So if you unlawfully terminate contracts this is a contract thing and the player whos contract is terminated would have to sue. If they pressure people into signing a termination of their contract it could be criminal if they blackmailed a player (like if you don't sign that we make sure you will never find a spot on another team), this could be investigated.  If Thorin has information hinting at such behavior it would actually be his duty to report on it as well.
German authorities still trying to figure out how the internet works, I don't think they know what e-sports is.
I hate them so much it's unreal
That was related to the Elyoya shuffle where he was supposed to be in G2 and all the other junglers were meant to move around the teams until MAD fucked up the transfer, as far as I know. I can't imagine SK pay significantly more than XL.
Story?
If mainstream can take sports, with much more heinous shit going on, seriously then they can take esports seriously too.
Pretty sure Rich talked about it in 2019 or something that they had gotten denied entry despite partnering up with PSG.
FNC lucked out with that one!
And always hides behind the words "I'm not a journalist" but somehow will report on stuff that won't affect his access.
aaah i thought it was openly in the discord group, cause thoorin said that the CEO joined and looked into that, but u are right.
> There is no criminal statute that is broken here, but contract laws. Which means that the party negatively affected would need to sue.  Well, this is not entirely true, threatening an employee with unlawful termination of a contract is sometimes concidered coercion, wich is a criminal offense in germany and doesn't require the victim to sue, but the authorities to have knowledge of it (and then obviously testamonies/proves for a conviction).  If any of those ppl who had their contracts unlawfully terminated applies for unemployment benefits in germany authorities will look into why the contract was terminated and pretty much allways ask you to sue, if they see a chance of winning, wich would be pretty much guaranteed, if things are as Thorin stated.
Most braindead take in this topic, since we're talking about contracts and german authorities take these kinds of accusitions seriously, cuz they are printed on paper, just like their emails.
XL being e-sport org does not matter here, i think. There is a company, it has contracts, it is (maybe) unlawfuly terminating contracts. German authorities should not care much about what kind of company this is.
>I can't imagine SK pay significantly more than XL.  Well, SK was supposedly opening up their coffers and trying to go big this off season. For a cheapskate org like them, trying to get Markoon might be "going big."
Hans Sama caused the domino effect not Elyoya. SK got their hands on Irrelevant and Markoon super early in the off-season then tried to get Hans like everyone else. Decided to get Exa Doss after that didn't happen.
No, SK had somehow gotten money prior to the 2022 off season and were able to afford some good players and are reportedly paying well.
[the full grooming thread ](https://twitter.com/kamenyurisen/status/1554879812824612867?t=6meVzYWKCkFeg5p5Tvh1vw&s=19)  [carlos discord screenshot](https://twitter.com/DeadindHead/status/1605509548843978753?t=5z6NvPV0WvTu-qMTOVDw2A&s=19)
Frosty was basically a hitlar supporter . Said hitlar did good for the German economy. Groomed minors. Excel knew about this and still didn't do anything until all of this was made public and he was fired.  Dick riding Carlos in his discord telling "tips" on how to avoid taxes (Carlos rosted him lol)
They ought to I agree. But there’s still barriers to break through before acceptance. Clown management like at XL aren’t helping the cause.
I don't get why people hate Travis. He has his niche and thorin has his. This type of stuff is definitely thorins thing
> wich is a criminal offense in germany and doesn't require the victim to sue, but the authorities to have knowledge of it (and then obviously testamonies/proves for a conviction).  and how would the authorities know of any of this if Vetheos doesnt sue Excel with evidence? Its not like companies are under surveillance and the state knows everything about each company.
According to rumors, SK wanted to go "big, big", but couldn't attract some star players. Also they offered Exakick more than Fnatic
Ah I didn't know about that, interesting.
That Carlos discord convo is so cringe from literally both Fosty and Carlos. "My will is to conquer the world. Cash is a byproduct of this, and a tool to experience increased freedom" who actually talks like that past like 15 years old.
wtf, i feel bad for ever supporting ocelotes org, the guy has gone completely crazy
Isn’t age of consent 14 in Germany?
Also, regardless of the morality of it all, that the Nazis actually had a very strong economy is a common misconception but it's not really true.   While Germany had a very strong industrial base and labor force (which it already had before 1933), it's post-1929 economic resurgence was based on massive internal debt that, without WW2 would have led to another major financial crisis. The nazis means to prevent that from happening by repaying their debt through plundering all of Europe and winning the war, but they ultimately failed and their economy was totally unsustainable. But you can't expect an idiot like Fosty to know.
and for those who dont know, fosty became a thing in esports because he was spamming at every g2 tweet and being so fcking annoying, at some point Carlos saw him as a bofoon he could milk for interactions and hired him
By a third person providing credible testamony, that that happend.
Can't complain about what they've built though, they've gone big in that regard I guess?  Still impressed by how well they got pieces that work together, same with AST.
Not just FNC. According to Wooloo FNC,MAD,VIT,SK all wanted him. The contract must be pretty expensive if they can outbid VIT's offer.
Both of them can bond over being kicked out of org for being a reactionary dick
Sounds like a certain *Top G*
This is what cancel culture does, they never reflect, they always double down. Im not saying they should keep their platforms but rather these people don't learn the lessons that created their downfalls they just blame everyone else and carry on.
I don't care if it's legal in what country, if you are over 20 and want to date/have sex with a teenager you are fucking weird
Pretty sure the guy had no clue what he was talking about and was just trying to be super edgy to look cool.  Nobody liked him, he was annoying as fuck and that’s why people exaggerate when calling him a pedo and a hitler lover.   No cap everyone just wanted to find a reason to ostracize him.
I dont think he ever worked for G2. He was handling NIP’s and XL’s socials.
Especially Irrelevant was a great find. Sertuss isn't terrible, but mid is probably obvious upgrade next season.
Yet again people confuse taking accountability with "cancel culture"
[removed]
Thing is Sertuss can be really great, he has some banger games. If he can gain consistency? He'll be a real force to be reckoned with and if they think they can bring that out it'd be really cool.  There's also team synergy to take into account, if Sertuss is the glue holding people together I'd be wary about replacing him.   I can see it depending on playoffs performance too, if they can keep up with the big boys it would be interesting to know what their ceiling is.
Then again, who would you even replace him with when he is already like 5th best mid in LEC?
Thank you!
It was changed ages ago, now the pass works like TFT pass, you level up the same, but buying it allows taking more rewards.
I would say 1800. I think the pass adds 400 automatically the moment you buy it. Not sure though, if the amount shown in the event page counts the pass points as well.
Without spending any tokens you just need pass level 60, nothing else
would just be abused, bad idea  mute people yourself
What is the difference between not letting someone chat and all four people muting?
Being toxic makes you lose your ability to chat, fine; but to be taken from you just because others simply dont want you to chat..? I would literally grief for that
Yeah that won’t be abused at all…  Just use the mute button, and if you think your teammates typing and “not focusing on the game” is the reason you aren’t climbing, then you’re wrong.  If that’s not the intention of the post, then use the mute button.
Or just click one button and mute them?
Horrible idea, let them talk more so they can get banned
The person not being able to chat. Not only does the person not know if people actually read what he says but him getting a notification "you can no longer write messages" and not being able to hit send might help his mental honestly
you should try csgo
It would be like asking you to stop posting on Reddit for the sake of your mental. Does it sounds right?
Unfortunately I know how it is. Yet ppl want team-wide voice chat on League 💀
I could handle Caps leaving  I could handle Bwipo leaving  I could handle Broxah leaving  I could handle Nemesis, Selfmade, Nisqy leaving  I could even handle Rekkles leaving  But lord I can't bring myself to imagine. Please lord. I ask you for one thing only.  Don't you EVER let Pete leave.
Pete is a fucking genius
Banger content as always! All hail content genius Pete. Everything going all according to keikaku (keikaku means plan in Japanese).
I have to admit, it's the bangerest and most ballzy LoL video I've seen this year.
Pete smurfing on content in LEC even when the team is struggling.
I almost cried when peke/soaz/cyanide/rekkles left in the same year.  If I could make it through that I can make it through anything
It gave us Yellowstar rebuilding the team from scratch and going for one of the best resurrection arcs ever seen
I think they are meant to serve at a categorical level and not really explain the nuances of each character. Especially with different items / builds becoming popular over time.   Like ap malphite one shotting isn’t what anyone would expect for a tank that scales with armor. So keeping it broad and appropriate to the general idea of characters makes sense to me. Like keeping malphite in the tank class dépité knowing someone could make a 600 ap death mountain
Mage items having HP was the attempt at giving them “durability” before the durability patch happened IIRC. It was a bandaid fix that needs to get looked at again. They also need to actually rework AP items to not have AP Bruisers and non-battlemages build similar items.   Tanks don’t really one shot in my experience. You can get like perfectly Ornn brittle combo’d or eat an entire spell rotation from Sion + Heartsteel proc to get hurt quite a bit, but they’re not one-shotting with super high damage (unless they build towards it maybe?) in which case they lose defenses to do so.
I think its obvious but i really like games where everyone has to do his Part and not everyone 1v9ning
I could not understand the title for the life of me   DISTINCTION
I feel like role/class is already prevalent.      Top - low impact meat shield that only really gets strong with stacked resistances, gets out-ranged by every role except jungler. Possibly a sidelane threat but will get flamed for doing that 90% of the time.      JNG- giga-ultra-omega high impact role, overstepping by 2 inches in lane allows them to get kills/sums/lane priority. Can also serve as a meat shield but this one has a smite and generally more tools to setup kills.      Mid- also high impact, winning lane here is most beneficial. Taking outer turret opens up the map and incentivizes roaming. probably more flexible than top since all kinds of champs have boasted decent winrates in this role and even ADCs are picked here in pro play.      Bot- should be bane of existence for top laner. Literally have 4-5x the range of most of them, lots of tools for disengage, itemization to maintain damage is more advantageous.       Support- either babysitting ADC or being a second jungler
Well i can see your point, but i felt lile any class should have to choose for example between defensive and offensive stats, so when you build ap and nuke someone, you shouldnt be tanky, or as a tank you should not be able to ignore peel and kill the adc instantly with heartsteel
Thanks for your answer! I just felt like a lot of classes deviate from typical forms in like mmos, especially draintanks.
Oh nono somebody has not eaten actuall ornn combo that actually oneshots -> learned it the hard way yesterday
Well im sorry my autocorrect doesnt like english
r/boneappletea
So just balance individual champs. There is no reason to change entire classes just because some outliers are too strong.
I don’t believe there were any changes to normal draft in 13.7 unless you are in eune or oce or ru region.
I queue for top, and keep getting support like 80% of the time I’m on EUNE. Only allows adc or supp as secondary.
it's almost like you can look up patch changes. Crazy right?
Good , now you get to actually learn how to play league of legends , instead of otp simulator
NA, this is soo strange. I never played soo many 2nd roles in a row. Just has another games and it was jungle again... gonna select mid and adc now
I'm 90% sure something was changed, I looked at last 3 patch notes and nothing mentioned
There is soo much changes in there and I like to use reddit to also discuss this. By typing this you might as well just tell me what's going on, proper hater like...
Well I am open for other lanes, but iv been grinning aram for 2 week so I can play some kata with new skin. 3 days soo far only have 1 game with her. I'm lvl 400 so nothing new for me playing other roles
OTP is the best way to learn LoL 😂 plus the dudes playing normals so doubt he cares about improving/learning.
You’ll always get adc if you queue mid/adc
Nothing should have been changed for NA, I believe it was just OCE, and EUNE as someone mentioned. Idk they could be tinkering with the queue system.   It kinda sucks because I want to practice more on top, but instead I’m forced to practice support.
Your name is reddit name Lazyness. Checks out.
Here you go, you got it 😂
Yes and no
I dont have all the time to my self, Limited how many games I can play. Gutted can't even enjoy a skin
their name says Lawless
Always was, you need the exact client version to watch old replays. Support can't help you, as you need that old client on your own pc.
Have you tried the third party re-players? I’m on mobile so don’t remember the name of the one I use, but it lets you have multiple executables for different patches. I can edit this with the name later if you haven’t found it.
You can use [replays.xyz](https://replays.xyz) and download the specific patch that the replay file was played on, that's currently the only way IIRC
I did download a 13.6 Client and dragged the replay file onto it (which was what the instructions were) and it didn't work. It seems like replays were changed recently and have yet to find a way that works now.
None of the ones I found looked very recent, if you have any suggestions I'm down to hear!
Tried that, didn't work for me last night.
I was going to mention I use replaybook, but seems someone else also commented on that.
Just to make sure, you don't mean what you tried is dragging the file like you mentioned in the other comment. Cuz you are supposed to use ReplayBook to properly implement the replay file
I didn't see anything about ReplayBook on the tutorial I was following, what am I supposed to do?
Nah nah this is good. This is great actually
thank you :)
