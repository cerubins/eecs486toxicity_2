"And I took that personally." - The Marine Layer on the west coast
Sounds like I should start rolling coal because I like dingers
Im always down for a good drag bunt
Last year, dependent on the hitter, yes. But with the lack of shifts this year I don't think you can rely on last year's data to form a plan for the future
This post is not made by smart people
Padres need help. Soto hitting under .140 through 7 games. Oof.  Padres front office is not run by smart people.
Its not like Drury, Renfroe, and Rendon are bad hitters. It has just been less than 10 games
> Angels front office is not run by smart people.  I mean, yes, but having three players hitting under .170 after 7 games is not unusual, especially when one of those players is Jake Lamb.
Yeah Lamb is pretty ass, bummer that he's gotta play. I wouldnt have batted him 5th, that's for sure. Would bat o hoppe and urshela above him. And Drury. Looks like Angels don't want to rush Ohoppe higher in the lineup yet.   Renfroe is a super streaky HR and doubles hitter with a career .300 OBP. I've never been a big fan of him.  And sadly, truly abysmal hitter David Fletcher got a start tonight.
Tonight ends differently if Rendon and Walsh are hitting behind Ohtani. Renfroe will see better pitches as the 6th hitter.   Lamb will not start many more games.
Good Lord, Renfroe, Drury, and Lamb just batted under .170 perfectly normally. They said they ‚Äúneeded help.‚Äù Too busy leaving 40 on base, evidently.
ok
Fantastic stat
how the hell do people even track this
Pain dayo
Surely they Yankees were also bad and had the longest playoff drought in the MLB at the time like the Angels
Winning in ways I hadn't thought possible.
I'm already dead why
This is gonna make me rich on Jeopardy! some day.
The Angels won't be outdone by the legends of the game and they're out to prove it
...As the Tigers defeated the Angels 8-3.
Tungsten Arm O‚ÄôDoyle
talk about a reach
You‚Äôve gotta be a sick bastard to go out of your way to find these stats.
They don‚Äôt, but bots do.
5 walks, 0 hits, in 27 PA‚Äôs for a whopping OBP of .185. Wow
This does not spark joy.  Also, fuck Phil Nevin.  He keeps making the same mistakes.
Something something Tungsten Arm
.-.
Now thats Angelsing
He
2022 Angels rear their ugly head
The power of Tungsten Arm is a mighty thing
i'm sick of this  trout and ohtani for the entire dodgers farm system, just do it
If there was anyone needing convincing to free Mike Trout and Shohei Ohtani, show them this.  Edit: I‚Äôll be honest, I got fucking burnt.
Oof those averages
Ward ohoppe and Urshela and renfroe all got on base with good AB‚Äôs. Not too worried but the meme lives on
The two best players in the world and a AAA team around them.
Never forget that Nevin was only supposed to be around this year and not shitcanned because the teams ownership status was in limbo with Arte selling and that not being a position to commit to a new manager long term.   Then Arte took the team down for sale and Nevin still is the coach, the coach we are going with to give us our best possible season and convince shohei to stay in his last year on his angels contract. This wasn‚Äôt supposed to happen.  It makes me angry. And I want to like him. Had his mom for geometry in high school and I graduated from CSUF as well. He just flat out sucks as a big league manager.  It‚Äôs just typical Moreno bullshit the way the managerial situation was handled. Appears we are gonna have to wait until he croaks to be rid of this.
Mate, we have like 7 hitters hitting sub .200. Pot, meet kettle
That‚Äôs an aggressive self-burn.
Dafuq, you got gilded within minutes, also yeah I get high blood pressure watching my team
It gets too much hate. I personally don‚Äôt notice the commentary that much throughout the game.
It certainly is a unique broadcast. Good for Apple!
I think it‚Äôs mostly because it‚Äôs a separate subscription we have to pay when we already have MLBTV. I‚Äôm lucky have T-Mobile and they cover MLBTV and Apple TV for me, but I totally get peoples frustration when they find out some games aren‚Äôt included in a service they paid $150 for.

1-5-6-5, that's a weird double play, I guess I need to see this.  Yup, that sure was a weird double play.
Producer in the truck was a little slow on the kill switch there.
The most shocking thing about this video is that she‚Äôs the one drinking water.
No nipple makes me sad
Happy Easter kids!
she couldn‚Äôt even get em out they‚Äôre so big god
Her nipples are by her waist
So glad somebody posted this here. Was there no nipple? What? I have so many questions. One of them may or may not be what‚Äôs her IG
Would
This used to be a family show!
Let me talk to her.
The OC: 20 years later.   Mischa Barton needs to get some serious help.
Pop one ferda
üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
Jesus she looks hammered
I don‚Äôt understand why it was blurred when there is no nipple
My brother casual said a woman flashed her tit while I was on a work email. I didn‚Äôt think anything of it until now
Someone in the production truck just lost their job
Nick Markakis takes strike one ü§£
No he did his job‚Ä¶
I mean good on her knowing exactly the cut off point before it went from PG-13 to R.
Or is it a clear liquor in a water bottle?
Trying to sober up lol
Physically it seems impossible, but there was somehow no nipple in all that boob.
There is a world full of nipples at your fingertips right now.
Likely a post mastectomy reconstruction AKA a breast cancer survivor. She probably did it as a joke because there ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt anything to show.‚Äù
@motorboatmom
Professional timing on their part
Ah the ole vodka/water bottle trick.
But the intention is still the same, that's all that really mattersüëç
This shit made me literally laugh out loud I was thinking the same thing
But i want to see THAT one specifically.
This something I‚Äôve learned about men recently. They don‚Äôt want to just *see* boobs, they want to be *shown* boobs.   I don‚Äôt really get it, personally.
Insane assumption to make imo, some people just have lower nipples. But maybe!
Put an ad in the Missed Connections section of the LA Times.
If you've seen one set of nipples...you wanna see the rest.
You just pin pointed OnlyFans success
Do you?
Enthusiastic consent
Buying or making self a sandwich is nice, someone giving you a sandwich out of the kindness of their heart is special
Not entirely an assumption‚ÄîI‚Äôm a physician and see post reconstruction breasts fairly regularly‚Äîbut you are right. It could just be too little boob displayed.
You were getting weird and releasing your inhibitions at an Angels game while only drinking water.   I was glued to my pirate stream of the game while stuffing my face with Totinos Pizza roles with such voracity that the remnants got stuck in my neckbeard.
I understand that, but that‚Äôs not what‚Äôs happening here?
You can't see the entire left half, likely the nipple didn't escape the bra
You may be an expert in post reconstruction breasts, but he‚Äôs an expert in ‚Äútrashy women who flash television cameras‚Äù breasts soooo
If a person is openly flashing a Public broadcasting camera...is that not enthusiastic consent?
This is the kind of analysis Reddit was made for.
Lol definitely not an expert. Just see them sometimes. But slowing it down it does look like she doesn‚Äôt get the whole booby out.
Dude might be a physician, but clearly he's never tried to help titties escape from a bra ü§£
That was all Phil Nevin's fault.  He makes the weirdest pitching changes.  Moore was fine..but NOOOOO Phil had to get phancy and phuck it up.
something something buds
All my buds from r/torontobluejays are coming over
Nevin hates Matt Moore or something
Looked like a golf swing. My goodness, that's a moonshot
Taking out Moore to play the matchups was a mistake.
I for one, forgive your error Bo
Home run calls by Dan Shulman never get old. It's too bad he will no longer call postseason games for ESPN Radio.
I do not like that.
NEPO BABY DOMINANCE CONTINUES
Violent ass swing. Somehow he makes it work
Respect to the Oilers fans who invaded their turf.
I most definitely did not slander our lord and savior Bo Bichette at all today. Blessed be Bo Bichette.
Bo has a 350 yard carry golf swing for sure
Bo knows baseball.
wtf i love bo bichette now
Angels fans be like: same ol, same ol, huh?
That‚Äôs what sons do!

Well damn
The exact thing happened against the Mariners and it almost cost us that game too
He has a smol phenis
how the hell did you guys not get a real manager
I‚Äôm frustrated because I‚Äôve been a fan of his bullpen management in some games- specifically using some of our swingmen to piggyback and riding them to the end of games I‚Äôm a big fan of. Saves our better bullpen pieces. But clearly that isn‚Äôt working
I'd actually blame the pitch calling there, Bo was behind on the FB, so naturally they come back with an off-speed one... Made zero sense.
arrived from Anaheim. cause
Checking in
it's what buds do
Masters weekend is coming up after all.
shades of devon whites swing back in the day for sure
It was a mistake on Wednesday. Phil didn‚Äôt learn anything smh
Hopefully he‚Äôll still have the opportunity to call a bunch of postseason games for Sportsnet.
I miss him on SNB so much
We are so lucky to have Dan & Buck
3R HR down by 2 to win the game, if that's booooring you don't like baseball. Don't blame you as an M's fan though
a 3 run go ahead homerun late in a game isnt worthy of being posted?? I know you dont get to see many highlights watching the Royals but come on lol
Said the 11 fans in attendance last series to watch the Royals get pumped 3-1.
Bro. It‚Äôs a baseball subreddit. What‚Äôs the issue?
Thanks for all the wins this week by the way
Americans so big
They signed him to a one year because Arte was supposed to sell‚Ä¶.
that's what buds do
I‚Äôm not booing or saying it‚Äôs boring‚Ä¶.. I‚Äôm saying Bo‚Äôs name
Also I‚Äôm more of a fan of 3r base clearing doubles when down 8-1;) but that‚Äôs just not relevant
Remember that like 8-1 lead you blew in the playoffs? Or the 2015 ALCS?
it's what buds do
You‚Äôre welcome. You‚Äôll need them come the 2nd round of the NHL playoffs  Have a good night
This where we write fuck Arte
lol I'm sorry. Opened Reddit to see lots of antagonistic comments and misread yours
That never happened, why do you know the details of my nightmares last fall though?
That young child with the fake beard caught that ball below the home run line, we all know it
I‚Äôm not surprised a Royals fan can only talk about the past.
if they feel bad about 2015 does that means there was more than 11 fans at the games last weekend?
You know your team is destitute when you gotta refer to other sports I don't care about lmao
Its funny when people say this because a shit ton of jays fans are canadians that cheer for other teams and cant stand the leafs
Fuck Arte, all my homies hate Arte.
Oh no you‚Äôre good. That was an Anti-Angels post
Those were my dreams so I‚Äôm sorry
Also KC hasn‚Äôt had an NHL team in like 50 years, so you know this guy isn‚Äôt cheering for their hometown team, but still assumes everyone with a Jays flair is from the GTA.

There's 141 and 2/3% chance he's played at least high school level ball.
Impressive. Good tv show also.

That pitch was more impressive than anything Daniel Day-Lewis has done.

right before this he actually made an error by throwing a ball over Cronenworth's head. So he made up for it.
Damn that slowmo, Xander jumping over the dudes head and then cronenworth all stretched out. WOOF üò∞üßéüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Wack, good baseball
My boy
Underpaid!
Why are the Apple TV announcers horrible?
How did the Sox let this guy go?
Please get fucking Ozuna off this fucking team. He has been hitting sub .200 since like August of last year. What dirt does he have on AA to keep him on the roster?   He's also fucking awful in the field
I read that as ‚Äúthrowing a ball at Cronenworth‚Äôs head‚Äù and thought it was too early in the season for the Padres to implode.
Hosmer let‚Äôs it get past him 100%
They lack from emotion
So glad they have the option this year to listen to your own teams radio broadcast over the apple one. Made the game far more enjoyable
They were awful tonight
I thought they were fine.
My first thought watching this tbh. God I hate how that man still haunts our nightmares. Maybe a full year of Cronenworth there will be enough therapy.
I would settle for knowing the number of outs
We are just having a blast at the stadium tonight. What a show.
The Angels are one of the most exciting teams to watch
This fucking team.  Please don‚Äôt suck please don‚Äôt suck
Backup third baseman makes routine play to backup first baseman.

It didn‚Äôt rain today but there was just a breathtaking rainbow
Wayne is a treasure
If I had a nickel for every insane Angels defensive highlight in the first week of the season, I‚Äôd have two nickels, which isn‚Äôt that many but it‚Äôs weird that it happened twice.
Gio: ‚ÄúTony who?!‚Äù
Great throw, great catch
I was hoping it took him off the bag, but that's some stretch
BABY COME BACK
Someone go hogtie Donaldson and Cashman together in the janitorial closet and send Gio and massive bag of cash and apology letter.
Rendon doesn't make that play
Don't worry we have Josh Donaldson instead...
I‚Äôm still surprised every time I see Jake Lamb pop up on a random new team. He was such a Giant killer for the Snakes. What happened to him?
I actually miss Gio.
Until they aren‚Äôt
*in the months of April and May
I have a serious question.  Do you believe in angels?
Oops
With how often Rendon is out, he's a starter. The Yankees would prob take him back in a heartbeat and have him start at 3B every day.
I was wondering why Lamb wasn't on third for this but I'm getting the vibe that he's not viewed as a 3B anymore is that right?
Rendon is bad vibes man. I'd rather just stick with Gio
Yeah, he'd just slap the ball away
Let's not talk about that.
Spring is a Holy Season, that makes sense.
They are team version of Eric hosmer
Always.
I do believe I see three in the outfield, though one appears to be a trout with a halo. Catholics really will make anybody a saint.
I still don‚Äôt get why you guys traded him, he was a solid above average starter with team control.
I think he‚Äôs been 1B and corner outfield for most of his recent teams.
Nah, Rendon has bad vibes if you‚Äôre opposing but when he‚Äôs your guy you know the intensity is being channeled *for* our team not against ourselves. Weaver had the same vibes and we loved him for it. Josh Hamilton was toxic vibes.
Yeah but I think our defense is way better with Gio and Tony out there.
Like I said
Ive never understood why the angels don't embrace it more.  Id have the whole stadium flapping their arms if I ran pr.  Fuck it bring out Tony Danza
Bro, we got Josh Donaldson. If that doesn't answer your question,  you're a logical baseball fan. idk either, this team would be way more fun with Gio.
Gio was hurt most of his entire last year with the Yankees, and they gambled that they could get more production out of Donaldson. How could they know he'd be pretty terrible? Even decent Donaldson would be an upgrade, esp defensively. At least JD is still good at that.
Seems like a missed opportunity to sell a fuck ton a halos people can clip to their heads
The replacement of Gio with Donaldson was the most zero-brain-cell move I think I've ever seen from this team.
I don't see the fan...
Now that kid is classy
That kid was like a heat-seeking missile, jeez
That guy goes to games like its a full time job to catch homeruns. Even pushed over a kid to get one last year. Just sits there with a glove on his head like a hat till its time to shine
Was that Hample? Or just another guy in the same vein?
Jinkies!
He's done SpongeBob before
It was like when you're controlling an outfielder and hit the wrong button.
Looks like he‚Äôs right-handed and trying to throw lefty for the first time ever

I pride myself on baseball knowledge and being able to answer pretty much any question my friends have about the game. Sure glad none of them have sent me this because I‚Äôm absolutely clueless as to what the hell just happened.
‚ÄúLook what I can do!‚Äù
It doesn't look like he caught his cleat or anything. Maybe he just felt the spirit of Jeets deep in his heart.
I can't figure this out for the life of me
H'what now?
Kersh was huffing some of that Gorilla Glue they‚Äôre advertising there.   For real though, right after he pointed to his eyes. Joe was guessing that maybe he didn‚Äôt see Moreno looking at him and therefore didn‚Äôt want to get a pitch clock violation. But I don‚Äôt know because seeing this again it sure looks like Moreno is ready.
Reminds me in little league I tried to submarine pitch once randomly after like 4 IP since I had pretty good accuracy when practicing with it  I threw behind the batter and even the ump laughed
I've watched this no less than 20 times and it's made me laugh so hard I'm crying now. The "what was that?" from the announcer is sending me. Thanks for this, Kershaw. I needed it.

Looks like how I play beer pong.
When you‚Äôre a fan of Nestor but you didn‚Äôt ask for instructions.
That was cool. And by cool, I mean hilarious.
I can't stop laughing.
Was he trying a knuckle ball?
That's my HOF'er!
Uh
Lmao the announcer almost sounds offended.
"Ah shit I forgot how to pitch"
This is some Zack Greinke shit lmao

I'm honestly super impressed the batter, catcher, and umpire are all so professional here they chose to exist together within the obvious lie that nothing out of the ordinary just happened.
Back looks fixed
Shit looked like a glitch lol
Seems like something Grienke will do
‚ÄúWhat was that?????‚Äù

Y‚Äôall seriously never heard of [the Eephus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eephus_pitch)?  EDIT: This isn‚Äôt the first time Kershaw has used this pitch https://www.mlb.com/cut4/watch-clayton-kershaw-throw-an-eephus-c173648358
Wtf?!?
I like that even the Umpire put out his arms a bit like "what the hell man?"

When mom says she forgot to buy cheese strings at the store and you involuntarily heave your body and stomp your foot. ‚ÄúUhgg‚Äù
I‚Äôve tried all three options and I hate them all!
>I pride myself  Are you a man of faith too?
Right after this, the broadcast showed Kershaw doing the two fingers to his eyes and shaking his head.  They suspected he thought the hitter wasn‚Äôt looking and tried to bail awkwardly on the pitch. Maybe he was referencing Barnes not making eye contact.  Whatever it was, it wasn‚Äôt him trying to quick pitch or do a Nestor/Cueto thing.
I think he saw the catchers glove position and realized the signs were mixed up. That's my best guess.
My guess is that he lost balance a bit, he seemed to be falling backwards and then compensated by just dropping and throwing.   I could be way off though.
I‚Äôm assuming he lost his footing or something.
‚ÄúStuuuuuuuart, what does mama say about throwing funky pitches?‚Äù
Dammit. Take the Braves flair off before you start making MadTV references lol
Even if he got a violation, it's the same outcome without the meme.
He looks right immediately after throwing the pitch. Anyone know if that's where the pitch clock is? This makes the most sense.
I did this in college. I was a reliever and one practice I threw submarine as a joke but my pitching coach liked the movement and accuracy and asked me to try it the next time I came out of the pen. I hit 3 batters in a row on 3 pitches.
I'm like the opposite as I could only pitch sidearm for strikes back in Little League. I decided to try throwing overhand for next hitter and promptly hit the batter in the helmet.
The ol' 12 to 1 curveball.
you chuck the ball 10 feet past the table?
Might need to go back to the drawing board with that one
Looks like an Eephus he threw too hard.
That would be me on the mound, I would be in my motion an last second forget what to do next

Verlander is the best, but don't expect unbiased opinions in a thread that will have a lot of Dodger fans

When somebody calls string cheese "cheese strings"
Tf you guys call it cheese strings in maple syrup land?
Nothing quite like an AA ball player hitting +.400 with 43 home runs in 150 at bats and 18 errors
As there's a drive into deep left field by Castellanos
Pros can still throw heat when off balance. They've been doing this for decades.
Yeah pretty much. Would‚Äôve been better to just eat it, though we wouldn‚Äôt have gotten this wonderful clip had he done that lol.
Unless he throws it in the zone. Might as well get a pitch off honestly, maybe he'll swing at it.
Low accuracy, high precision. I like it
Got ‚Äòem with the ol‚Äô Bull Durham trick. Now the batters will all be scared to hit.
Give me peak Kershaw over any pitcher of this generation...and like 98% of the past ones as well.
Actually the best is in the video.  And this is coming from a padres fan. Kershaw fucks
Verlander has pitched 200+ innings 12 times in his career, thats more times than Kershaw and Scherzer combined! He's done it entirely against the DH his entire career too, and he was practically unhittable even at age 39!  He's a fucking workhorse who has Cy Young caliber stuff in the modern game of baseball. He's so underrated on the all time pitcher conversations.
Sorry ‚Äúcheestrings‚Ñ¢Ô∏è‚Äù. Maybe this is just a Canadian brand/product?
So that'll make it a 4-0 ballgame
Maybe his awful pitch baits an awful swing. Honestly with the bases empty there's no real downside, right?  As long as he doesn't throw anything vaguely hitable, the worst that happens is a ball anyways, might as well toss something.
Yeah what's the worst that can happen?
Too bad coach yanked me immediately lol
If peak is all that matters, then Johan Santana would be in the Hall of Fame right now  A career is more than just peak.
Yeah, I know, Kershaw is better, but I'm a big scherzer fan .
With one ring to show for it. I‚Äôll take tim lincecum anyday.
I mean if we're being honest Kershaw is better than both max and verlander but verlander isn't better than either imo
He was my bet a few years ago to hit the elusive 300 wins. Now it looks like he‚Äôll barely miss out.
Stupid argument when we all know Ryan Vogelsong is better than all three
I've only seen string cheese no cheese string down here
*frantically searches to make sure WW3 didn't start*
Uhhh Johan Santana has zero seasons below 2.50 ERA.  Kershaw has 8.
Damn good thing Kershaw has both then.
Fair enough
Big time Timmy Jim! Also known as Mr. "I fucking no-hit the Padres twice" Lincecum
I mean, Verlander just last year was so much better than either Kershaw or Scherzer.   He's a fucking freak of nature and I wouldn't put it past him to keep pitching at an elite level into his 40s.
Wait, you guys actually don‚Äôt have [these in the states??](https://images.app.goo.gl/UU9LSYFDGXoAEYVU8)
Pull n' Peel?
Good thing Kershaw has so much post season success. Wait....
That doesn‚Äôt do anything to diminish or be above a single stat Kershaw has put up in his career. People try their hardest to put injured and old Kershaw down when he‚Äôd still be the #1 starter every single time on the lie creator‚Äôs team of choice in 2023.  It‚Äôs getting old. There‚Äôs not a single living pitcher better than Kershaw. No peak that‚Äôs better. No career that‚Äôs better. It‚Äôs not even a discussion. Scherzer and Verlander are generational talents. Everyone compares them to who? Kershaw. Kershaw is an undisputed all-time talent. Not comparable.
1 whole year woo
We have them in various brands but I've always seen them called "string cheese" or "cheese sticks," definitely never that brand in my area at least
Good thing postseason isn‚Äôt the only things that matters. As much as you want that to be the case to get Madison (a boy with a girls name lol)  in the Hall of Fame it just won‚Äôt happen.
3 out of the last 5 years he's been better, and that's including the 2 whole years he missed.  Woo
2013-2017 scherzer was better, and scherzer didn't miss 2 whole seasons
So basically Kershaw and Scherzer are past their prime while Verlander is currently in his prime despite adversity.

Preseason I picked AZ as a comfortable 3rd place finisher, and I also had Sneks finishing 2nd in the division as my ‚Äúhot take‚Äù.   I don‚Äôt think this AZ team is a fluke; they‚Äôre going to continue to be a thorn in the side of some good teams, and they may find themselves competing for a WC spot.
As soon as he leaves AZ üò§
How could you hate him he's so cute

We sure do have one attractive outfield, don't we?
little league day at angel stadium walking around the infield and getting to say hi to trout as we passed by was always the best
Seeing my team win the World Series in person
It was my first game.  The Brewers were playing the Angels at County Stadium, and the game was delayed by rain.  Had my first major league hot dog, and it was the best tasting dog I ever had.  We never had much money as a kid, and I had  been gifted the tickets from school for being on the high honor roll so dad drove me the 40 miles to the game.  It was just us and we had to leave around the 6th inning because of the delay and it being a school night...but just having that time with him made 10 year old me feel like the luckiest girl in the world.  Even more special to look back on now that he's gone.
My favorite memory is also [Mickey Mantle‚Äôs favorite baseball memory](https://twitter.com/darrenrovell/status/1593658369834876930)
My first game I went to where I bought the tickets with my own money was Roy Halladay‚Äôs perfect game in 2010.   It made burning through my measly minimum wage paycheck from Publix worth it after wasting it all on parking and old soggy Cuban sandwiches.
Jeff Francour walk off grand slam against the nats in 06!
I‚Äôm 2003, 7 year old me watched the Cubs clinch the division, and Sammy Sosa sprayed champagne into the stands to celebrate.
Dodger Stadium seat colors 80s-2000ish.  So much brighter than they are now.
I was at PNC Park one year right after the Penguins won the Stanley Cup and the team showed up at PNC to show off the Stanley Cup in person, freaking awesome
Core memory unlocked, I used to do this with the Orioles when I was young
Oh I remember doing that in Milwaukee! That was sick :)
Which year?
2012! Sat in section 216 at Comerica Park.
Nobody show this to Matt Olson
I would like to see it
Brokeback MOUNDtain
Typical blue jays fan.  Keep the garbage memes and mediocrity on your sub
No u
I smell your neck beard from here.  Get some fresh air
Uno reverse card! So now you‚Äôre the smelly one
THAT'S HOW THE BREW CREW DO
And the weirdest part, the only pitcher responsible for those runs is Burnes
Other teams should try having the heaviest roster
I am having fun again.
The Brewers, the largest team, have simply eaten the other teams
Offense? ‚úÖ  Defense? ‚úÖ  Pitching not named Corbin Burnes? ‚úÖ  Heaviest lineup in the MLB? ‚úÖ  Once Burnes gets his timing down with the pitch clock and starts throwing darts it‚Äôs *ova* for you bitches.
https://youtu.be/TVkSedRS9J4
What is losing? Never heard of it
A buncha bona fide aces and also certified schmuck Corbin Burnes
We may never lose again
World series confirmed
I‚Äôm having fun with this while it‚Äôs here. Forgive my skepticism but as someone who watched a good amount of both dominant pitching be wasted and runners being left stranded at second or third to close out innings for the past few years, I‚Äôm not ready to fully buy into the team yet. These rookies and general hitting improvements do give me some hope, but as a Brewers fan I will always be wary of any expectation.
Mets have a solid lineup but cardinals have a cupcake lineup so it‚Äôs not really impressive against them
And then we‚Äôll trade two studs at the deadline
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs back up a minute‚Äù
I still don't even understand that. Who else is really tipping the scale besides Rowdy and Bryse Wilson?
I honestly haven't enjoyed watching baseball this much since 2019. It's been so long since the games aren't a complete grind, trying to come back down 0-2 in the eighth inning or some shit
I mean we have Rowdy....
Thicc Bois
Its that thing you only do on opening day.
This shit is 100% unsustainable and we've had some insane luck (especially today). Enjoying the ride and dreading the fall back to earth lol
Corbin, Woody, Houser are all over 240. Voit is nearly 260. Winker, Mitchell, Weiner are all over 220
Voit is a big boy as well
The young guys are just bringing way more excitement to the lineup than we've had for a while.  Their approach and speed have really brought a different kind of style to the lineup.
‚ÄúWhat are you?‚Ä¶‚Äù -Vogey  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm you, but better.‚Äù -Rowdy
The rookies are going to fall victim to major league scouting at some point.  You can't expect them to keep doing this.
Can we count the Mets series as all luck please?‚Ä¶ ü•∫
> Corbin, Woody, Houser are all over 240.   Bro what? Damn people look smaller on TV
That‚Äôs a big wiener.
Forgot* about Voit. But damn guess I didn't realize how thick those other dudes are.
Is Weimer the most enjoyable autocorrect casualty in baseball?
Woodruff is a fucking unit. He‚Äôs 6‚Äô4 240.

Goddamn it.  I hate how cool that looks.
Would like more frontal shots of Mike Trout
Didn‚Äôt know I needed this in my life üòç

before looking at the photo my dumbasss thought he was wearing something like [this](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/File:0140Kabuto.png) in his head
next Topps Short Print for sure
*Oda Nobunaga leads his forces at the Battle of Nagashino*
So sick
Would cool to be something like a league batting champ type award
That's cold AF.
He looks like he hates it
Nothing against Trout, but I think that is really cool - if they were in 3rd grade
Take it all in now boys. Tomorrow this is gonna be cultural appropriation and bitches will be crying everywhere

Seriously. That chain is why Manny needed to renegotiate.
Same & [Mike Trout has had quite a few good ones in the past.](https://youtu.be/cEnCJixeLI8)  I loved the [Jordan Walker one from Opening Day](https://youtu.be/wFL_dg_K__Q) where he does the Key & Peele Obama sketch with Cardinals hall of famers.
I‚Äôm aware. I‚Äôm saying somebody somewhere who does not watch baseball and doesn‚Äôt even care about the sport will jump at the opportunity to try and spin this as culture appropriation and ruin it for everyone.
Damn. Just gave me flashbacks to when the CAD crashed in 2015 and Canada became the 'cheap' vacation spot for a minute
Ok
Sometimes you just have a bad week
I cannot believe how short that window was, if they don't pull it together from here.
Come play the Royals pls
well that's certainly a statistic.
They should keep it up for a few more days
Sometimes you‚Äôre just bad
It‚Äôs over, man. The window slammed shut on all of our fingers. The slide started in 2021, with the second half going pretty poorly. There is no ‚Äúpulling it together,‚Äù this is what they are.
Agreed. They should be sellers at the deadline. Their pitching is much worse than advertised. So many constant injuries. Not sure how Rick and Kenny still have jobs, but here we are.
It was done the day they hired an 80 year old with onset dementia to try and develop a culture with one of the youngest teams in the league
2020 in the Covid year was our best chance but we blew games 2 and 3 in the 3 game set against Oakland. 2021 we were rightfully heavy underdogs in the ALDS. The window is shut but maybe Robert, Cease, and Moncada/the boys will take a sledgehammer and crack it open again
Marcel Ozuna for Bobby Bonilla.  At least this way we free up the roster spot.
Mauricio Dubon for Ohtani they both have a ton of heart.
I guess Franco for Rutschman would be the closest thing to fair value?
Aaron Loup for the Astros‚Äô trash can
It probably isn't the smartest move, but I just want Davy Peralta back. The dodgers can have, uh, Diego Castillo I guess.
Paul Goldschmidt for Burnes or Woodruff.
Adam Duval for Aaron Judge.  It's a drop in production but Judge is locked into a much longer deal (sorry Duval üòû)
Paul DeJong for some cheese curds and a 6 pack of Spotted Cow  We can skip the cheese curds if that trade is too lop-sided.
Gimme Jeff McNeil for Ozzie Albies  Ozzie has more pop and speed (and can switch hit, debatably) but I love McNeil's grit and I think his ability to put the ball in play would probably make the Braves RBI machine unstoppable
I mean Julioooooooo for Oooooooohtani
I'll do a blockbuster, send Manoah to the Rays for Franco and stick Bichette at 2nd base.
Nuke Raley for Judge
Dugie and all his chainz for Trevino
Would Peraza for Varsho count as equal value or no
Edman for Swanson?
Uhhh Marcell Ozuna fooooor Clayton Kershaw lets go
I‚Äôll take 1 Will Smith please.   Nola clearly not equal value, but just take him.
It‚Äôs so weird that my favorite player on the mariners is tommy la stella. Well I guess that‚Äôs the sacrifice I‚Äôm willing to make for adding Ohtani to the team.
James Outman for Juan Soto
Judge for Othani. Probably get downvoted by Angels and Yankees fans lol
Any rangers bullpen guy plus a couple for Ryan pressley
Paul Dejong for Craig Counsell
Rogers for Verlander seems like a very fair trade imo
I'd trade Tyler Oneill for Graham Ashcraft
‚Ä¶it was in this moment it hit me that the Mariners really screwed up their own season.
Do any Guardians division rivals have someone equal to Jos√©?
The entire whitesox pitching staff besides cease for Clase
Feel like this is kind of a one sided trade but I‚Äôm not a GM.
The trash can helped them win games though‚Ä¶
They said equal‚Ä¶
counterpoint, Ozzie gives Ronald +1 to all stats when equipped.
This is probably the closest you will get. McNeil would fit in perfectly with this Braves lineup. As much as I like Ozzie tonight was kind of a good example of some of his issues. He is almost TOO aggressive with men on base and results in weak contact
Plus you get to watch him use his old timey bat!
I wouldn‚Äôt trade Franco for anyone on the Jays straight up.
We need Trevi. You can have Hicks. Or JD.   Or both and free clubhouse soda for a year.
I would say you're close, but baseballtradesimulator.com has Varsho valued twice what they've got Peraza valued at.   If I were the Jays, I'd want Peraza and maybe Michael King.
You failed the assignment
everyone else here had the same joke of "my team's mediocre player for their best player", I don't know why you got singled out
Give me mookie for Soto and we have a deal
People downvoting this haven't yet been forced to recognize the unstoppable force that is James Outman.
Reading isn‚Äôt your strong suit.
That would be pretty stupid for y'all. Young, cheap, controllable pitching for an incredibly expensive and old pitcher who'll be gone by the time you're good
This is just about as close to equal as any answer in this thread.
We just treaded Gabby and LGJ for varsho we ain‚Äôt movin Varsho for a worse prospect and a bullpen arm
Yeah, what a bad deal. Outman‚Äôs OPS is almost triple Soto‚Äôs.
I was early
There‚Äôs no division rival player worth what Judge is.
Then pick a different player
Ok Hicks for Story
all lines up with them signing Bellinger
Take me out to the dispensary
Marijuana moment
Y'all thought we were really growing Ivy out there?
Oh, man, the sponsored guided meditation with Pat Hughes is a thing of beauty.
Shocked it wasn‚Äôt Toronto or Seattle who beat them to it. Completely legal in Canada, and Seattle is one of the weediest cities I‚Äôve been to.
Pro tip from an actual chronic pain sufferer: if you can't obtain CBD in your area, you can get an equivalent amount of pain relief by gently licking a regular-strength Tylenol exactly once. I really don't see a future for the CBD industry after recreational marijuana inevitably becomes legal.
This will probably go at least a bit better than all the crypto partnerships just because marijuana actually has value, unlike crypto
 But when can you get cannabis at the ballpark is the real question
Sign me up for the bong giveaways.
The Ivy will be replaced by hemp.
The 7th inning stretch and snack run.
It'll be interesting if he only sings places with legal
Take me out to the weed store Take me out to smoke pot Light the bong and take some dabs I don‚Äôt care if we never come back from the Moon
Hits ~~that are dongs~~ from the bong
tbh having a marijuana moment while watching baseball can be a great time   watched dustin may pitch while stoned earlier and it‚Äôs a trip and a half.
As a Canadian living in Seattle, you aren‚Äôt wrong. Everyone I know smokes regularly.  On the other hand, I‚Äôm very much someone who will gladly puff weed passed to me but I actually don‚Äôt have any weed of my own lmao.
Colorado or SF as well
The whole kayfabe around CBD is so ridiculous. They had to cultivate weed that doesn't get you high or seemingly do anything to legitimize it in the eyes of people who would never approve of it anyway.
Move over ice cream hemlets here come the bat bongs.
Yep, basically most West Coast cities. Weed (and also hard drugs, unfortunately) seem to be much bigger in the West. Both in the US and Canada.
Eh, there is some evidence showing that CBD isn‚Äôt entirely snake oil, but no it‚Äôs not some kind of wonder drug the industry promotes it as.
Little late posting this but it was a real slick play
At least there was one highlight for the Cardinals tonight.
He has 5 years of service time, so can't be optioned without his consent anyway even if he does have options.
You can check that information out using Fangraphs‚Äô Roster resource.  https://www.fangraphs.com/roster-resource/depth-charts/cardinals
That's what fangraphs says
Sounds right to me. [This thread](https://twitter.com/johnjf125/status/1642261841681293315?cxt=HHwWhoC92bScvsotAAAA) pretty much summarizes the last several years.
I could've sworn he still has rookie status, wtf
Mike Trout commits to Team Japan for 2026
They said on the Japanese broadcast that Ohtani chose the samurai helm for the celebration, and even ordered it himself. Couldn't bring it on the road against the Mariners because they couldn't figure out how to carry it lol. The team gave Ohtani the right to choose because he won the WBC.  Edit: may have been Oakland, was only half listening. Makes sense considering Angels had their home opener today.
With the coca cola ad looking like the Japanese flag in the background
Perfect for Ohtani/O'Hoppe copying Quijada's chop/slice towards the bullpen during their homeruns
No way a GOOD ball doesn't come Shohei's way tonight
It's Kabuto Time!

Anyone have a link to the Japanese announcers calling that HR?
As a Japanese I was anxious seeing this live because I thought American baseball fans don't like their Captain America wearing a Japanese thing, I'm relieved people on here seem to be enjoying itüòÇ
Man the Angels being good would be amazing for baseball
So cool
Trying to re-sign Shohei so bad
His strikeout sealed Team Japan's win...this has to sting a little, right?
r/guysbeingdudes
I heard that Shohei got it for the team!
Cheese üßÄ  vs samurai helmet
Please be the year again!
I‚Äôm disappointed, not a single ‚ÄúFuck mike trout‚Äù in this entire thread.
They need to get a katana now
I think I'm an Angels fan now? It has been a gradual process...but yeah.
This is just going to lead to someone getting hurt. Never trust baseball players with heavy things around their neck

Mike "Tom Cruise The Last Samurai" Trout ‚öæ üó°Ô∏è
Interesting I guess‚Ä¶
I'm waiting for someone to complain about cultural appropriation. Only ohtani can wear it right?
The thing they didn't tell him, is that he has to commit seppuku if he gets a golden sombrero
Act like you been there before.  This sort of thing worked so well for the Blue Jays.
Am I the only one who finds shit like this cringe?     I love trout and the angels, but putting on some goofy hat/helmet or putting on a cape just because you hit a home run is a bit much.     Imagine every time someone hit a home run they straddled their bat like a horse and rounded the bases or something.
DELAY OF GAME! NO FUN ALLOWED!
That will get cancelled.  No fun for you!!
Alright that's it.  The trend is over.  Yall couldn't have a nice thing snd not ruin it.
What other team has had a helmet based off samurai‚Äôs‚Ä¶. Hmmmm. Maybe one that has a very very famous Japanese player in their organization.  Edit: yeah I know this will get downvoted to hell, but seriously stop biting. Swing a monkey around or something.
Where are all the cultural appropriation angry Reddit comments?
Uh oh, I can hear the SJW coming‚Ä¶
ONE OF US  ONE OF US
Seems to me like they are ripping off the Mariners and their Darth Vader helmet. The Darth Vader helmet design was of course heavily inspired by the samurai helmet.
Ok
Can we return him?
Welcome to 2018!
They've got to get the rest of the armor suit as well and do a round of dugout high fives wearing the whole shabang
Yeah why we running this Luplow guy over Varsho in LF? DH whit? Like wtf lol
Angels picked the Dome Fossil confirmed.
Haha death poem time
Is this because Otani is Japanese?
Good! Because if I were to see them put on a cowboy hat backwards one more time...
Looks dangerous.

I need to know what Trout would have done if he had chosen the hat
I love these new home run celebrations. It may seem goofy, but I like teams making home runs into a team event instead of a single player feat. Enjoy the moment as a whole!
Someone needs to make these guys a custom carrying case for this stat.
>The team gave Ohtani the right to choose because he won the WBC.  Also because they need every arrow in their quiver to try and keep him
Now they need the sound of someone blowing a [conch shell battle horn after home runs](https://youtu.be/jrcrrNKIOTM)
Had to scroll back up because I just thought it was the Japanese flag to begin with.
I think that's exactly what they're going for considering Ohtani's stardom in Anaheim.
It's called Product Placement for a reason.
Feeling some amazing team Chemistry this year
üî•
I mean I don't always cum, but when I do, it's to trout as a ronin
The marble race predicted it
Shohei Ohtani-sama back-to-back 2023 World Baseball Classic and 2023 World Series champion in the same year, yes please.
160-2 season starts now
Got dammit I'll agree cause it's Trouhtani.
This will be their Baby Shark
Sashimi Trout?
It was Shohei's idea. 100% already signed the extension  *snorts hopium*
Are you kidding, we love crossovers. I'm just happy it sounds like there was thought behind this, and it wasn't just some clueless person appropriating.
> I thought American baseball fans don't like their Captain America wearing a Japanese thing  Americans fucking love wearing shit like this. It's like our thing.
The Angels did a cowboy hat last year
Excuse me but also the Kings stole the light the beam gimmick from us.  Our Halo lit up first
First of all it's not a gimmick. And it's 'light that baby up' or 'light up that halo'
But it‚Äôs gonna be some ignorant white chick thinking they need to speak up for all Japanese people, when, in fact, it was a Japanese player that chose to use it.
BASEBALL IS FUN
I think straddling one's bat like a horse and rounding the bases would be legendary if one hit a walk-off HR off of Edwin Diaz, but context is crucial.
>I the only one who finds shit like this cringe?    Yes
Doing the bull dance, feeling the flow. Working it, working it.
It‚Äôs obviously unpopular, but planned celebrations are always lame to me.
Na didn‚Äôt know this was a thing until now but it‚Äôs super lame. Surprised by this thread.
It's fun I like fun
???
oh yeah, that‚Äôs gotta be it. not cuz they have shohei ohtani, who played for the Samurai just recently or anything

If they do go 160-2, shohei should be personally offended that one of the two losses he gave them 6 innings of shutout pitching.
If they‚Äôre not serving trout sashimi at the ballpark, they need to fire someone lol.
>snorts hopium at the idea of Shoehei staying with the Angels  Me too
I was thinking Othani wanted to get the goofiness out of his system before becoming a Yankee.
He's referring to the kings in basketball
Damn you guys just conjured your own antagonist and got mad over it
He‚Äôs a fan of Samurai Japan‚Ä¶ I guess
Both can be true. A Bokken would have arguably made more sense if you wanted to equate baseball and samurai.
Imagine a team with him and Shohei. It would be unstoppable! Guaranteed world champs right there.
Lmao I was thinking either this or a full on Uncle Sam 3 foot tall red white and blue abomination
I was thinking the singing fish on a hat
So he's an Early Cuyler fan
Oh god
Not unless it's a perfectly level surface.
Just like 12 yr old Shohei drew it up.
The world should be offended on his behalf
Which was inspired by the angels
Yeah I know
We‚Äôre all not douche bags like this, just a good amount.
Go on‚Ä¶.I like this idea
Reminds me of Don Mattingly and Ricky Henderson. Those 80s Yankees rosters were dynamite!
I sense some sarcasm here.
Trevor Bauer is somehow on the team as well lmao
Hahahahahahahahahahaha
Glad that great minds think alike.
https://youtu.be/f071AfSf9rE
Nah, 12 yr old Shohei was too humble
Not disagreeing with you. But have you seen the goals he lined up for himself when he was younger?
When dad says he‚Äôs going out to get some cigarettes
That pitch was better than 50% of the ones he swung at.
So, here is my hypothesis, Vlad's mom's cooking is the reason for playoff success.   Playoff appearances with his mom's cooking:5/6 seasons. Since? 1, and no wins in that series.   Blue Jays made the playoffs and guess what? Vlad jr's grandma is feeding them, coincidence?
Boy he's gotten chunky, could come back and pull off a Bartolo
One of my favorite non-Sox player watching growing up. It‚Äôs so cool seeing the former 27 throwing to the current 27. Both Angels legends!
Imagine reaching across Vladimir Guerrero Sr... you're standing next to him while he's watching his son at the plate, and you're reaching across Vladimir Guerrero Sr.'s chest to put your hand on his far shoulder, to turn Vladimir Guerrero Sr. around so he can pose for a photo with you, while his son bats in the background, behind his back.
I've never thought about this before, but is Vlad most remembered as an Angel by the general MLB audience at this point? Obviously his most recent seasons were there, and maybe his two most noteworthy seasons. But that would also seem kind of crazy to me.
Lest we ever forget that Vlad Jr. was primed to be an Angel but Dipoto spent all the money on Roberto Baldoquin previously. Baldoquin never sniffed past AA with Anaheim.
It's... beautiful!
Always great to see my favorite Expo smiling
My only question is why wasn't he farther back. I know he is old but I've seen his arm he has thrown strikes from the warning track.
27 club
Love that guy. Great to see him back.
2 of the Angel's Mt Rushmore
Good One
>Said Greg Maddux: ‚ÄúHe was hard to pitch to because he hit everything. I remember one night Smoltzie bounced him a slider and he hit a double. You talk about a good bad-ball hitter ‚Äî that was him. He hit pitches out of the strike zone more than anybody.‚Äù  Might as well throw it down the middle and hoped he missed
I believe he attributed it to growing up with a field that had no backstop. So they learned to hit EVERYTHING because no one wanted to chase after the ball.
Strike Zones!? WE DON'T NEED NO STINKING STRIKE ZONES!
He was thick as a brick on his way out of the league. Saw him in his last year with the Orioles. You could set three drinks on that wagon he was dragging.
He is eating his mom's food without working it off
I usually think of him as an expo. But that might only be because my first ever baseball game was MVP 2002
among fans in canada he‚Äôs definitely remembered most as an expo but it could be totally different in the states
Was born in the mid 90s. I am aware of the player he was in Montreal and how good he was, but I grew up with him as a slugger in Anaheim.
He's a ranger dammit
Also incurred a penalty that kept the team out of IFA entirely for some time, thanks Dipoto!
Thanks for the reminder pal lol
It‚Äôs true , I see kids have BP and just stare as the ball goes by, no attempt at all. Sure enjoy the backstop but you lose in the game of pepper.
And still batted a solid .290
wonderful comment, thank you
Thanks Dipoto!
I‚Äôve tried but I‚Äôm drawing a blank. I can offer two suggestions:  1.	Caroll County, VA has a historical society and museum. I would suggest reaching out to them to see if they have any archived photos.  2.	I think it‚Äôs against the rules to link it here directly, but you can find a small picture of Eddie Morgan (their best player) on a certain auction site. Just throwing it out there.
I will definitely check those out. Thank you!
Mamma mia pizzeria
First swing at home
*Let me give the greatest hitter of our generation a 90 mile an hour fastball down the middle. What‚Äôs the worst that could happen?*
Samurai Japan beat Mike Trout and then made him wear their helmet  EDIT: it was Shohei's idea lmaaaoooo
Chris Bassitt is absolutely shook with the pitch clock this year
the samurai hat though
i actually got chills watching that. this year means so much to angels fans haha.
Michael Nelson Trout is an above average ballplayer.
I feel like he could get 60 homers a season if he wanted to
Now that‚Äôs a spicy meatball
Bassitt might be in hot water before he even steps foot in the SkyDome
tickets will sell like hot cakes if Angels cook up a giveaway for a samurai hat
That ball was tattoed
that samurai helmet is awesome. this team got something special brewing
THATS WHY HES THE MVP. THATS WHY HES THE GOAT. THE GOOOAAAATTT
What a fucking bomb!
Every time I watch him, I‚Äôm amazed at how fast his hands are through the zone. Just freakin crushed it.
Bassitt cannot handle the pitch clock at all
Chris Bassitt has a 29.70 ERA. He has completely forgotten how to pitch.
Saw it live. Place was pumpedüè°
MIKE TRUCK
OMG That Sound!  ABSOLUTELY CRUSHED!!
Bruh
Lmao what a fucking nuke
Mother of all meatballs
God his swing is so pretty
That‚Äôs probably in the top 10 dumbest pitches I‚Äôve seen thrown at Mike Trout ever.

oh baby that sound
Mike Truk
Mike Truk
an absolute nuke
MVP
My kingdom for a fish
You think it‚Äôs insured?
I mean, that was a nuke.  That truck is lucky to be in one piece.
holy CHRIST
BANG! BANG!
Fish man good, but makes me sad tonight üòï
Washed. Couldn‚Äôt even get it to the parking lot.
The legend of mike truck continues
Seriously, what was that pitch‚Ä¶.
Did someone win the truck?
What‚Äôs the call here?  It bounced and hit the truck.   Is that a legit truck shot or does he have to hit the truck clean?
Mike Truk
Throwing one of the greatest fastball hitters in the game....that.   That 90 MPH was prob near Bassitt's max velo at this point.  He needs to slow it WAY down and start throwing junk and hope Trout doesn't hit it square.
Would that have gone into the paint can if it was still there
Sometimes Trout's home runs are so smooth it almost seems like he didn't even try to hit it that hard. This was not one of those. Very violent collision with the ball goddamn
‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs one pitch he won‚Äôt expect, it‚Äôs 90 belt high middle third‚Äù
Mike Trout trucks a 2 run bomb with a sick ass samurai helmet .. as the Angels lose to the Jays 3-4
üé§üöö
Goofymeatball.gif
Instead of these commercials showing a truck towing a shipping container up an opening drawbridge, or scooting through the desert jumping sand dunes while carrying a load of bricks in the bed, just show me a Tundra surviving a Trout bomb and that‚Äôll be enough to sell me on it
Imagine how many replays of this we would have seen last year. Kind of hate that‚Äôs one of the things we lose with the pitch clock.
Can't wait for a ball to go right through the windshield lol. Perfect advertising for them
That thing was fucking cranked
90mph meatball right down the middle. Great approach by Bassitt
Mike ‚Äúhits the‚Äù Truk
That was smick-smacked clip-clapped! Sheeeeesh!
Samurai Mike Trout
They just let anybody park anywhere in Anaheim these days. Wild.
What a beautiful noise ü§§
Idk what Bassit thought would happen pitching that pitch to Trout.
Instead of a steak, he gets free gas.
(Dismissive Homer Simpson voice) Psshhh, on the bounce.
It‚Äôs a Toyota, Trout hates Japan confirmed. Strife between the two Angels megastars will surely force the Angels to trade one of the other for Pennie‚Äôs on the dollar.
Is this one of those things where they'll give away a free truck if it gets hit
Throwing a 90 mph pitch middle middle to trout has to be in most pitchers top 10 nightmares
This is the year of Mike Truk
Bassitt still looking good.
Mike...................................................... truck.
Man that highlight was disappointing. I was expecting a broken windshield or the alarm system going off.  It bounced into the truck.  Still sounded nice though.
damn and the angels still lost. The tungsten arm tweet lives on
What a fuckin meatball lmao
‚ÄúLet me just sneak a 90 mph fastball middle middle passed Mike Trout‚Äù
That's the biggest meatball I ever saw
90 mph fastball middle middle, delicious
https://streamable.com/259mo
welcome back to the AL west mr. bassitt
First pitch at home
"He never swings first pitch."  * Bassitt probably
*‚Ä¶oh*
I never get tired of seeing him crush dongs.  There's something just primal in his swing, like a caveman swinging a club lol.  I mean that in a good way, it's just so powerful and satisfying to watch.
the could lose the game
"The best player in baseball plays for the Angels and wears a Samurai Helmet, and that person is me." - Mike Truck
He bin bad
He looked pretty good apart from this kerfuffle to start the game
Iconic
Plz be good üòÇüò≠üò≠
I think most baseball fans want the Angels to be good. Y‚Äôall have two of the best players baseball has ever seen, and I for one would like to see both of them playing in high stakes games like they did in March. Plus, it would just be a great underdog story.
False.  Black bear.
Big if true
I dunno, he doesn't really pass the eye test
Considering he hit 40 last year in only 119 games, you‚Äôre probably right
He already has changed his approach in recent seasons to be a bit more of a power hitter than he was previously.   He will absolutely hit 60 homers if he stays healthy. I feel it in my bones.
he'll be fine
It can just be a cap with a cool design that mimics the actual hat and it would prob sell.
Seems like the same thing happened to Berrios
You were saying?
MIKE TRUK
Mike "the all new 2023 Ford F-150 truck" Truck
I miss him so much but I'm so proud of him.
I feel like it should hit the truck clean, but I don't know the usual regulations for stuff like this.  For example: for the splash hits in San Fran, does it count if it hits the ground and then bounces into the water?
What‚Äôs he gonna do? Hit it?
Right down the middle worked for Ohtani lol so not too crazy
You beat me and 35 other people to this. Well done.
‚Äúthe AL West sends its regards‚Äù
He‚Äôs on track for 400 homers at home this season.
Somewhere, Zach Britton waits
Mike Trout may hate Bassitt more than we do
"well...I will if it's THAT pitch"
Breaking this one down too: almost uppercuts the hell out of it, not to no follow through like he knew that was the killing blow to the jaw. Primal is right.
Mike Truk is real.
Since that homer he‚Äôs been dealing.
Beats eat beets.
Also injured for like 30 of those game lol. He had an 0-30something stretch at one point
Please 62 or 63, please. Nothing at all against Judge, I just want Roger Maris Jr. to be as irrelevant as possible.
YuCy Kikuchi take the wheel
the blue jays are trying so hard to be good but it's just not happening lmao
Pitch clock be ruthless for some
He remembered
-Man who just had his pitch crushed for a home run
Ohtani throws a little harder
there's a big difference between blowing past a good hitter with 100+ mph heat and just lobbing a big juicy meatball over the plate
‚ÄúTell ‚Äòem Mr. Bassitt‚Äôs meatball sleeps with the gabagool.‚Äù ü§åü§å
I'm no baseball historian but I believe that would be some sort of record
Truck-on-Truck violence in this video smh
Truth, he really turned it around
Hey uh, we won and Bassitt looked great. Cubs alright?
That‚Äôs rich coming from you
ü´∞ he remembered
That record was set by Tungsten Arm O‚ÄôDoyle right after he returned from World War I.
And the Angels lose again, while anyone not named Trout or Ohtani goes 0/22
We also had J.K. Simmons in the booth with our announcers tonight. Pretty cool stuff!
Russell Wilson in shambles rn
Fantastic
Lol, love it.  Baseball can be fun!
He was also Marshall‚Äôs dad on How I Met Your Mother.
Everybody loved Dauber on Coach.
Ohhhhh that Patrick Star, not the other Patrick Starr.
Heartbreaking: the worst franchise you know just did something really fun
Mr Unlimited taking shots from a sport he‚Äôd be even worse at
That's World's Greatest Football Color Commentator Patrick Star to you!
Was at the game, they also had JK Simmons there. Anyone know why these two were in attendance?? My friends and I could not figure it out
Did he want pictures of the Cleveland Spiders?
Those two on a tour of Midwest baseball it seems, they were in our booth not too long ago
I tuned into the game towards the end of my work day and that was such a treat to see. JK Simmons is awesome
That's not what he wanted to cook
Sorry you got downvoted, I thought it was funny
This ain't Busch Stadium
Bring me pictures of the Spiders, man!
I thought it was funny too. All their peers are focused on the Cards and this person is like ‚Äúthose motherfucking Brewers.‚Äù
My two favorite ideas for team names are Cleveland Spider-Men and Portland Platypuses and neither will happen because we can't have nice things
the 2023 nats are scrappy as hell as i‚Äôm here for it   and then every fifth game we get to Corb all over the other team? wonderful
LFG Abrams
ü•≤ he‚Äôs arrived
Trade ya a ^^^^^^slightly ^^^^^^broken Juan Soto for CJ Abrams
Atta boy CJ!!!
He started off the season like 0-8. Starting to hit better.  I imagine the Nats will see a lot of streakiness with their young players.
Seeing him and Gore succeeding so far makes me very happy
love that for him ü•≤
That‚Äôs my former top prospect
Fuck yeah. Has he broken a smile? CJ shows no emotion.
*nice*
GO CJ GO
that's our old slapdick prospect
Love to see it, get it kid
All of 22 and not even filled out yet. He's just getting started.
He had a hell of a day today, inches away from the second half of what would have been a SICK double play too, just fumbled the transfer ;(
Oh God oh fuck i'm gonna Corb
Throw in Machado and Tatis and maybe a couple prospects
That‚Äôs our ROTY
They were right that an NL West Outfielder was going to win ROTY but they picked the wrong one
on the one hand, it's against Dbacks Madbum so it doesn't count  on the other hand, I'm going to explode
They can't keep getting away with it.
it hadn't even landed before the Dbacks guy turned around.
Bumgarner used to be so good, man
7th rounder from the 2018 draft class, but the Dodger meme is actually happening so naturally this guy is going to be an all star
Wow he hit that out, man
My wife has put me in a straight-jacket and Pulp-Fiction-Gimp-Suit mask to vehemently deny me the right to continue to pour money into James Outman stock. I‚Äôve taken out a second mortgage and committed insurance fraud. I need more capital to invest.
Becoming one of my favorites
Who is James? That's Roy Outman
He‚Äôs him, a lot riding on him and he‚Äôs impressing. Hope this isn‚Äôt just Mckinstry balling out in April 2021 just to completely fall off.
Such a compact but powerful swing wow
MOTHERFUCKER
They should call him James Runman after this one quite frankly
The Dodgers are never going to lose 70 games again. Him and Miggy Vargas terrify me
Sure it's not going to be Vargas? 2 more walks tonight for 11 on the season already?
Yeah as a dbacks fan I'm not convinced about Carroll. He's fast but the bat just isn't consistent enough to justify a RoY just yet.
All my homies ~~love~~ ~~hate~~ cautiously respect motorcycles
Maybe two or three more years at the majors and he could snag RoY
I don‚Äôt feel like that bodes well for us  That or we may be the greatest team of all time you decide
No need to play the rest of the season.  Stop the count and give us that piece of metal.
The Rays have been unbeatable the past seven games
Ji man choi died for this. Rip.
7-0 with every win having 4+ run differential
Getting rid of the shift and the balls being juiced by climate change has made us unbeatable
Welcome to Cigar City, baby‚Ä¶
Slampa Bay lives!  [TIL that Slampa is Swedish for Slut](https://old.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/12f3w3j/the_tampa_bay_rays_have_so_far_hit_17_home_runs/jfdsryo/)
Glad Eflin is doing well
I for one welcome our new flappy overlords
Local stingray has kicked into maximum flappydrive
Their schedule has been the biggest soft toss to start the season.  BUT. You still gotta win those games, and they have, dominantly. Props to them.
holy fuck this week has been a joyride. i don‚Äôt care if we played easy teams, so did the astros and they lost the series to the tigers. in 7 games (TO START THE FUCKING SEASON) the best you can do is win all 7 games. we did that, and it‚Äôs only happened so many times in history. stop downplaying their success and appreciate the rays already üòÇ
The Jays need to sign Edwin back immediately if this is the case
WE MAY NEVER
Legend has it Britton is still standing in the Rogers Center bullpen
Admittely they've had an easy schedule so far but still impressive to win all of those games
My favorite part of this off-season was everybody doubting the rays for what feels like the 10th year in a row before they inevitably storm out to the lead in the east
Almost 5% of the way to 162-0
Known big market teams Royals, Orioles, and Rays
They‚Äôll lose a game against Boston next week and watch it be the game their best pitcher pitches
Can‚Äôt wait to lose in the playoffs!
Incoming Wild Card loss to the Blue Jays?  Then six years and counting with no playoffs?
 The end of the Rays is near it seems then
That rotation is flat nasty
162-0 season will be real come september
What do you mean you're never going to lose again
2016 O‚Äôs started our rebuild. That‚Äôs not a team you want to parallel.
The Royals did it in 2015 and we all know how that turned out
You don't have a manager that has mismanaged elimination games for three different teams you'll be fine
You‚Äôve been dicking people too, 7-0 run line
That‚Äôs how I felt when we started 13-2  in 2019 üòî
The Lombardi trophy is in the Mail boys!
I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôve lost either, really impressive.
It helps that they have played the Tigers, Nats and As.
The Pirates are actually doing ok right now lol
Don't worry he's probably chugging beers with Wade Boggs.
+35 total
Step 1: popularize defensive shifting  Step 2: mlb teams warp their rosters around three true outcomes players and get the shift banned  Step 3: RAKE
There's only one stadium in baseball where the climate doesn't change... Wait till the Rays get outdoors!!
Duh! Mercury is in retrograde.
Go Devil Rays!
Throwing slutters in slampa bay
He got a bag from the Rays, they must love him. They never do that
These are the Rays. Even if they didn‚Äôt have the easy schedule they‚Äôd still somehow bullshit their way to this record.   Fear it. Run from it. The Flappy bois come all the same
You really gonna say strength of schedule this early lol?
Yea. Easy soft schedule. But it‚Äôs a new year anyone can beat anyone this early on. Pirates just swept Red Sox. Detroit beat Houston twice. They played seven games and they just about did the best you can possibly do in those 7 games.
What do people want the Rays to do? They didn't set their schedule. Should the entire team have ran out during wrestlmania, grabbed the mic out of some jabroni's hands, and called out the Astros to come play them?
Can only play the teams they put in front of you.
Acknowledge us
Dont remind me lol, we have a worse record versus -.500 teams than +.500 teams...
"You know they've turned a lot of double plays..."
He can‚Äôt be worse than our non-existent second LHRP
This hurts.
Bro what the fuck did we do to you?
I was going to make an Edwin Encarnacion reference but this will do.
They've also won every game by four runs. Yeah the opponents aren't great, but you don't have seven four-run wins on accident.
This made me do math. 12-0 would put at 7.4% of the way through the season.  That‚Äôs the same exact equivalent as a pitcher getting their first 2 out of 27 outs in a perfect game
Nah if anything it would probably be because of Fleming but if anything I have faith in our offense at this point in time.
who is treating it like that lol. lighten up
Nope just celebrating a winning streak and great start to the season
You win the games you‚Äôre supposed to like Game 1 of the ALDS
Our 7 wins are still worth more than your 3. 7-0 is impressive, doesn‚Äôt matter who it‚Äôs against so can we just have a little fun?
Imagine your team only having one more win than the Tigers or the A's...
Being treated like we‚Äôre the only undefeated team and have rolled through every game. Chill little bro.  All the fans of upstarts like Seattle and Toronto are real salty about our start. Makes it taste a little sweeter.
Awe is someone sad they didn‚Äôt start 7-0 :/
Of course this would never in a million years happen, but imagine the amount of pressure and eyeballs on a 162-0 team to not choke in the playoffs lmao
[Wait..... 162-0?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE0E-GtuWKw)
don‚Äôt give me hope
Hey hey hey. Don‚Äôt you know that Ubaldo was clearly the right choice. Why would you want Zach Britton in when you could end the game quicker. Just trying to help with game times. Man ahead of his time.  /s (if it wasn‚Äôt obvious)
Friend, dont be fooled, our manager is completely capable of mismanaging things.
10 more games for an undefeated season, 17-0. I love baseball!
Not only that, they‚Äôve also won each game they‚Äôve played!
Just wait until their next series against the... Red Sox.   Their first 9 games are against opponents that averaged 101.66 losses last year.  Their first 13 games are against opponents that averaged 97.25 loses last year
Gone but never 4gotten üò¢
RIP
Somewhere up in the clouds Joey Gallo is smiling down upon us
Just wait until they found out why we invented the opener.
Dirty fuckin dangles, boys
Largest FA contract we‚Äôve ever given out.
Local kid too
Respect this comment after seeing the flair.
It's so annoying. I just know every time we play them that something stupid is going to happen because only they would have tried it. Maybe they'll call up some random dude to hit a double to win the game and I'll never see him again. Maybe they'll use a lefty bullpen arm to strike out three righties in a row.
That would be kinda cool ngl
Your worst starter could be a bonafide stud on 8-10 bottom feeders
üçª
And I‚Äôm happy for ya - I will always like the rays as long as they have the touch tank. This came off more like I was attacking the team than I intended. I just got into a back and forth with another Mariners fan who refused to acknowledge that the teams the Rays were beating were not quite playoff caliber. I let that carry over for some reason instead of blowing them off.
Sure, I agree with that. I wasn‚Äôt trying to attack the Rays, who I think could take the division and never quite understood why people were willing to write them off as a possible team to miss the playoffs.
I mean, I don‚Äôt think the current 2023 Mariners are a playoff team either.
I‚Äôm not salty at all - this wasn‚Äôt meant to be an attack on the Rays, who I like.
Nope - the Mariners have played terribly and earned that bad record.
Game 162 might be more watched than the world series
PTSD from the Lightning getting swept out of the 1st round after tying the record for most wins in a season.
Imagine the pressure in game 162 after you won the last 161 games.
Suffering from success for sure
Like 73-9 Warriors losing the Finals
If there weren't video of this conversation, I would not have believed it.  The dude actually digs in and starts naming players.
I wonder if Ubaldo, Matt Mantei, and Jack McDowell get together.   "It wasn't our fault really, the coach asked us to pitch so we did"
I think it was the right call
The Rays have outscored their opponents in seven straight games.
Also, while the Jays are a good team, they routinely get their shit kicked in by the Rays.
Yea I mean they have literally played 3 of the worst 4 or 5 worst teams in baseball. It doesnt really get any easier than that.
I‚Äôm sure he somewhere else by the trade deadline. Probably my Mariners when the realize having a DH batting below the Mendoza line is bad. Or we‚Äôll trade for Santana for a third time lol
Game recognize game. You guys may be in the division but at least you‚Äôre not the Yankees or Sox
Hey don‚Äôt give us any ideas.
That might be a stretch.  Fleming is ass.
Swept by a team that had never even won a playoff series.
I can't tell if that was IRL trolling or the caller is just that dumb.
Not to mention none of those games have ended with the opposing team having more runs than them.
Good teams beat the teams they‚Äôre supposed to beat
Mets have their own DH problems..
Two things Toronto, Baltimore, and Tampa fans can agree on.   Fuck the Jankees.  Fuck the Red Sux.
Don‚Äôt be narrow minded. You know how bad we are? Angels? Pirates and Cubs? Rockies too. He‚Äôd be better than half our starters.   Just cause you have one player doesn‚Äôt mean we don‚Äôt have 10 of them
At least it motivated them for a few years.
I can't find the link but I remember reading somewhere that the guy who did this was a know troll of Francesa
It‚Äôs great trolling on the same level as, ‚ÄúDo the baseball Giants and football Giants ever get together for dinner when they‚Äôre playing in the same city?‚Äù
Actually, if you look at the total runs each opposing team scored in each game, it was less than the Rays scored in each game
Sure never said the rays weren't very good but you do deny that the schedule has made a difference?
100%  I do hate the Blue Jays too, and I find you guys really really annoying, but Yankees and Red Sox hate is above all other hatred in sports for me.
Straight facts
He could probably be a serviceable starter on a lot of bad teams, but ‚Äústud‚Äù is the last thing that comes to mind when I watch him pitch.
Honestly, I respect the hell out of that. Using the Virginia loss to the 16-seed as motivation was genius.  Also, I was happy you went back-to-back so that my friend who's a Pens would stop saying "only team to go back-to-back in the salary cap era." He's a good friend. The only real negative about being friends with him is his Pens fandom lol
And somehow they rays won each game . Crazy. That‚Äôs baseball for ya!
No denial there. To be fair the season just started and these records could mean nothing. We could easily end up being terrible and the Tigers end up being amazing. Still 155 games left lol
But, but‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt hate you guys‚Ä¶
You are allowed to have filler players on your team. That‚Äôs how baseball works
It feels like the argument this guy is making is ‚ÄúJosh Fleming would fit in really well on a team that‚Äôs good at losing games‚Äù and I‚Äôm inclined to agree
The Rays simultaneously did NOT lose any of the past 7 games.
Tigers and Nats I dont know enough about their rosters to say how good they could end up being but I think its safe to say the As are dogshit.
Hopefully some day you will
I don't think we've ever been given a reason to
Nobody said you couldn‚Äôt.  You‚Äôre the one saying he‚Äôd be a ‚Äúbonafide stud on 8-10 teams‚Äù and I‚Äôm just telling you he‚Äôs not good enough to be a stud on any team.  Serviceable? Yes.  Stud? No.
Sure.  I agree with that, too.  But he ain‚Äôt a stud.  Lmao
In a row, even
By proxy, stud yes. Have you seen these bad teams and their staffs?  Don‚Äôt have tunnel vision just cause you get upset a player plays bad on your team. Don‚Äôt be a Yankee fan
Consecutively, dare I say
Yet, consecutively
K
I love that he kept his hand on the underside of the base even after it popped up.   Once he had it in his hands he should‚Äôve taken off. Can‚Äôt be tagged out if you‚Äôre always on base. That‚Äôs just science.
40/40 incoming  Thank god Santa saved the day.
You‚Äôre not actually supposed to _steal_ it Ronnie
New strategy. Hand can't come off the bag if the bag is on top of your hand
Manfred is fuming that his new bases slowed pace of play
And then Santa came out to help, pretty fun.
Dude shoudn't quit his day job, he's terrible at putting bags back.
This series has everything
Wtf is the Apple TV commentator talking about. Base pops out and Acu√±a grabs it. "He can't have too much fun, because he still has to get ready for Matt Olson..." Like bro you realize the umps aren't going to start the pitch clock if he's literally holding the bag in his hands
[McClendon](https://youtu.be/rhnoCkp2QUo), [Martinez](https://youtu.be/4dPIOmEI30w), Acu√±a, wow.
Just hold onto 2nd base while running towards 3rd üòÇ
What's the rule if the bag were to somehow pop out really far away from where it's supposed to be?
Acu√±a and I are so alike...we both don't know how to put shit back together when it breaks.
This may have saved the out, I thought he was gonna pop off the bag but instead he kept contact the whole ~~why~~ way, granted it was under the bag, but still, never left the bag.
He‚Äôs holding onto that bag for dear life
Literally stole it.
Apple doesn't have a PiP of the runner taking the lead? Poverty broadcast.
A. This happened a fair amount when I played baseball as a kid.   B. This could‚Äôve only been funnier if it happened to Albies.
I hate that i like players from that stupid team
"The new rules are to protect the players"
Love that action!
Me fighting my brother over left-over pizza
That‚Äôs right, it goes in the square hole.
Run to third and then home while holding the base! Easy run scored!
I always love how he‚Äôs trying to figure out how to put it back in and the ump is just like ‚Äúgrounds crew coming man‚Äù
I actually tried this in T ball.
Ben Ingram made a comment like that on the radio too. lol
now even if he does a bad job, he gets 2 mil
Julio too   Also, TIL Vladdy Sr was 1 HR off of a 40/40 season in 2002. He had 39 HRs & 40 SBs. He also led the league being caught stealing 20 times lol
He gave it back!
On the other hand, good guy Acu√±a out here creating grounds crew jobs.
On the contrary he's probably excited to introduce new moveable bases to lively up the game.
So since the braves were the home team was it a strike on the batter every 20 seconds until it was fixed?
Unprofessional Bullshit!
Came here to say this
It‚Äôs literally putting a square peg into a square hole. Baseball players are something else.
Love Ronnie and Xander trying to fix it with the energy of a dad and father in law trying to do their kid‚Äôs home repairs
My thought exactly. What an inane thing to say. And then I saw it was an Apple TV game.
It's like getting a star in super mario world
> APPROVED RULING: If the impact of a runner breaks a base loose from its position, no play can be made on that runner at that base if he had reached the base safely.
Santa will be passing over your house this year
Relatable
I think you'd have to drop 2nd right before touching 3rd, otherwise you'd go from 3rd back to 2nd and then home, skipping 3rd.
He gave it back to Santa, that‚Äôs what you love to see!
Loose base fallacy
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I thought it made things more interesting, lol
I wonder how good he'd be at using a cylindrical object to make contact with a spherical object.
Probably got filled with dirt and became uneven
There's a reason why Ronald Acuna has no kids
Interesting. Is there a reason that wouldn't encourage trying to do it? Maybe it would increase the chance of injury too much to be worth it?
Touch third, rip it out of the ground, carry it home, drop third.
You gotta frisbee it back to the second baseman before you can take third.
Spherical!
Gotta get the metal scooper
He has a kid tho
I think it's actually hard to do. It's just a freak occurrence.
Time to start fucking these bags up.
then take home plate and head back to first to finish the job
Triple run score of it lands in the hole back in place
damnit.
Even then what is the benefit? It's says if the runner is safe. If it's and arrant throw and the runner tries for 3rd what does 2nd base matter.
Infinite run hack.
https://i.imgur.com/IN29XhQ.jpg
Cleveland's absurd surplus of good talent turned into a great thing for the Nats. I think Call can turn into a Jayson Werth like player.
What pitching at Coors does to a mf
‚ÄúWhen do I next see Acu√±a‚Äù
Nice comp, I've been searching for a comp for his very relaxed setup in the box, it's also almost Rendon-y although that's unfair

Alex Call is the GOAT btw
[First homer](https://bdata-producedclips.mlb.com/03eef0b9-73fe-4a9e-82ff-00699856fcf4.mp4), via Alex Call
I have no statistics to prove this but Nationals players that get moved into the lead-in spot are just magically better.
Now the Nats have the bases loaded with no outs in the second
Had to shake the power the Rays held over then off first.
Urena got a bit unlucky there, grounder that's usually a DP ball slipped through. As opposed to here where he threw two very hittable pitches
http://tangotiger.com/index.php/site/article/statcast-lab-swing-take-and-a-primer-on-run-value
Each column under the "runs" header is a part of the strike zone shown [here](http://tangotiger.net/strikezone/zone%20chart.png). The numbers in the grid are run values on all of the pitcher's pitches in those zones. Per savant "Every pitch is assigned a run value based on its outcome (ball, strike, homerun, etc)."
Thanks this explained it well
Thanks appreciate it
Don‚Äôt fuck with that guy. He eats the past.
an absolute piss missile
His name is hella fun to say
That's a sexy dong
I need the exit velo on that thing
shea area represent
Somehow *only* 111.6
Acu√±a completely different player this year. You can tell he was timid last year coming off the injury.
~~October~~ April baseball baby!
Baseball is more fun when Acuna is healthy.
That was Jordan pose-esk
He hit the Jordan logo, lol.
rude
Hes in legit MVP form this year, you love to see it
Two teams stacked with some of the best young talent in the game.  MLB: Let's put this game on AppleTV so fewer people can see our product.
Kinda rude tbh, y‚Äôall know Soto‚Äôs trying to find his groove right now
I love him so much
If he does end up going 40/40 and plays this great defense he might end up with an 8+ WAR season when it's all said and done
God I‚Äôm so glad he‚Äôs back
Whenever I see people in Below The Chop not even looking at the game when something crazy happens right in front of them, I think ‚Äúwhy did you even pay for that area?‚Äù
I love those Braves jerseys!
‚úãtools, baby. ‚úã tools. üôå
Now that‚Äôs art.
√ëVP
He‚Äôs so good, he‚Äôs so good, he‚Äôs so good
Air Acu√±a
Cards fan - watching those three games I‚Äôm convinced he‚Äôs the best all around player in the game. Legging out routine ground balls for singles, jacking homers, tossing out people at home‚Ä¶dudes a beast
He is back in every way, and it‚Äôs so glorious to see!
not cool
Has to be sports center top ten
This series has been some King Kong vs Godzilla shit.
Air Acu√±a
Twitter/FaceBook Braves' fans in shambles this first week of the season.
[In the immortal words of Dr. Cox](https://media.tenor.com/gvT1r7OHXbEAAAAC/karmasabitch-karmaisabitch.gif)
Air Acu√±a
From a different angle, you can see he actually just barely robbed a HR on the catch.
Dudes an animal this season!!
Out of the loop....why isn't he in center??
Jumpman.
Another amazing game with the two teams. Excited for the rest!
wanted Soto to go yard just to shut up the commentator
How has he not poked an eye out running around with that chain on?
[Air Acu√±a](https://i.imgur.com/yFrwqqA.jpg)
A healthy Acuna is great for the league!
They ain‚Äôt ready.
He‚Äôs actually just back to being himself, he was a completely different player last year
Coming into this year I was expecting him to either be the unfortunate result of early career injuries (a real what could have been) or the best player in baseball.
√±
This play actually made me wince as he tracked the ball into deep right.. flashbacks to him getting carted off the field...   Then he did THAT!
I mean I don't even want to give ~~Pam~~ Rob a compliment because she's so blehhh, but she did a good job.
I would rather watch Acu√±a do shit like this to my team because he‚Äôs healthy than not have him get to play baseball because he‚Äôs hurt. As you said, it‚Äôs good for the game, and very fun to watch.
press √± for respect
Who's Acuna?
Acuna matata
How we felt about Soto‚Äôs catch yesterday!   In all seriousness, these have seriously felt like playoff games with all these big hits and defensive plays both teams have made so far in this series.
Aren‚Äôt we like a week into the season?
Jokes on you I'm a pirate and this is such a great series it's super easy to find streams. The braves cardinals was actually kinda annoying considering both franchises are massive. This one has been super easy.
6$ booo hooo
He can find it against the Mets/Phillies/Dodgers.
fWAR still hates his defense this season, fwiw
ALT + 164 = √±
Them and the blue throwbacks are my favorites
My tools!! I need my tools!
Surely we have t-shirts for sale with this on it
Baby, he's so good. Yeah-eah-eah!
I really don't get why any Braves fans would hate on Acuna. He is so fun to watch and seems cool.
Nah, it would‚Äôve had to clear the bricks to be a homer.
Typically we have Michael Harris in center, and he‚Äôs one of the best, if not the best, defensive center fielders in the majors. Ronalds offense is also a lot better when he doesn‚Äôt have the strain of playing center field every day.
He looks supercharged in real life rn
Yeah that was my thought.   Also the person who said we don't even know.  Pretty fucking sure we know about kid who was a goddamn superstar at 22.  We know.
Love this mofo don't care what team he's on üò§
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Acu√±a‚Äù  -Bryce Harper
Here, but forgotten
And a well-timed bullpen meltdown! Can‚Äôt forget that!
Ah yeah, I guess the games don't matter then.
Yeah, and the Phillies have won two games.  Quite impressive.
shouldn't have to subscribe to multiple streaming services to watch your team play.
In fact, we sincerely hope he DOES find it against the Mets/Phillies/Dodgers
fWAR is the sound that comes out of my butt after I eat chili.
If he does e√±d up goi√±g 40/40 a√±d plays this great defe√±se he might e√±d up with a√± 8+ WAR seaso√± whe√± it's all said a√±d do√±e
His ‚Äúnatural tan‚Äù may be an issue in some‚Äôs eyes.
Bad attempt at a joke lol
Never knew Harris was that good. Thanks for the reply!
ü§åüèº
Not saying that but how can you be ‚Äúin MVP‚Äù form in that short of a time span? Is any player that gets hot for a week suddenly in MVP form?
Yes and the fact we‚Äôre 1 week in to the season is why I‚Äôm not saying our season is over lol.
Something we can agree on!
Hey, I didn't bring up WAR or your butt.
There it is
Did you just admit that Braves fans and their "chop"'might be racist after all? ü§Ø
Of course!   Harris really shines defensively. Everything he gave us with the bat last year was icing on the cake. But he‚Äôs an absolute superstar on the defensive side.
It‚Äôs not that he‚Äôs played a week in MVP form, it‚Äôs that we‚Äôre a week into the season and Acu√±a has been one of the better performers amongst all players so far. It‚Äôs really not that hard to understand
If you think this is just him being hot for a week you are coping hard lol
It's because he wasn't healthy last year, but he looks to be healthy now. When he's healthy, he's always going to be a top MVP candidate
Some fans are, undoubtedly, just like I'm for damn sure there are *some* racist Padres fans out there
??? We‚Äôre a week into the season lmao. I never said he wasn‚Äôt an mvp candidate or he can‚Äôt keep it up. That Atlanta education is showing hard
Absolutely, every team 100% had racist.  But considering Padres fans have a big Latino and Hispanic fan base/culture, and Atlanta had a big southern/white pride culture, I think Braves fans are a wee bit more racist.  And a wee bit is underselling it.
It's not the Atlanta education that's failing here. Last year Acu√±a's swing was worse (he couldn't get his knee down far enough) and his running was much more timid. Braves fans are saying that he's back to playing like he used to. Not his statistics. He won MVP when he playing like he used to. Hopefully that was a simple enough breakdown xoxo
And here you are making sweeping generalizations of people based on the color of their skin.
That‚Äôs nice
It's a fact you'll see tons of confederate flags in Georgia.  The shoe fits buddy.

Ozuna hits one no doubt bomb a week and then strikes out in every other at bat
Braves lineup is so disgusting.
Ozuna is 2-18 this year and both hits have been home runs.
Heartbreaking: The worst person you know just hit a ball 440 feet.
Friendly reminder that the arresting officer falsified details of Ozuna's arrest and his wife has a history of domestic dispute calls against her as well.
wife beater hits a home run *
Damn hit it as hard as he hit his wife.
Cool now get him off the fucking team please
Best Left Fielder in this game certainly
Why is Ozuna still playing but Bauer was blacklisted?  Bunch of mom's basement dwellers can only downvoted because they know they have no legitimate response/argument.
His trajectory is so low. He never hits towering fly balls. Even his long homeruns are line drives.
He has 2 hits this season, both for HRs lol
Funny thing is that's easily the worst hitter in the lineup.
You get nothing from defending a domestic abuser lol. 2 wrongs don‚Äôt make a right. It‚Äôs better to just not comment on it
Wife beater drunk driver hits a home run *
He literally didn‚Äôt hit his wife.
Better than Rosario.
Is it wrong to state facts?
I'm saying that as far as my knowledge goes, I'm not defending a domestic abuser, because the police falsified the arrest record.
Wife beater drunk driver from the Braves hits a home run*
Sorry, he choked her   ü§ì  Crazy the cop came the only time he ever did it
There is body cam footage with his hands on his wife's neck  https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/north-fulton-county/body-camera-footage-braves-outfielder-marcell-ozunas-domestic-violence-arrest-released/UJ6CUYFHZ5DTNNLAZNX7PWU6VQ/  What do you think he does when cops aren't around?
He literally is not.
a) There is body cam footage of him pushing his wife away with his hand holding two phones.  b) Even if he did have his hand around her neck, that isn‚Äôt hitting her so the ‚Äújoke‚Äù doesn‚Äôt work.
The Georgia public school system is not the pride of this country
Rosario 2022 wrc+: 61, projected 2023 wrc+: 89 Ozuna 2022 wrc+: 88, projected 2023 wrc+: 106  Believe what you want though
This is pathetic my dude, stop defending domestic abusers.
oh my god are you being that pedantic? Would you be satisfied with "abused that ball as hard as he abused his wife"? Putting your hands on someone is not okay or defensible. A mod should be better than that.   awwww handlit33 blocked me because of his defense of Ozuna. sad  Because handlit blocked me I have to respond here.   To u/CKT5 :  It‚Äôs so weird that there was a very highly upvoted post yesterday about ~~tatis~~ cheater* hits a homerun yet people try to look away when there‚Äôs an abuser on their team.
Is it 2022? No.  Rosario current OPS+: 86 Ozuna current OPS+: 16  Also Rosario literally couldn't see to start the year.
That‚Äôs your only stat? I don‚Äôt care about 2022 rn, I care about 2023. And Ozuna has literally been butts
>projected wrc+  Stopped reading right there. Opinion discarded
There‚Äôs sadly still a lot of people in the baseball community that defend or make light of domestic violence
Lmao
delete this fam. You‚Äôre gonna ruin it
Dominant numbers to start the year regardless of the offenses they've faced
Bailey Ober is kicking rocks in the parking lot right now
Things can and will regress obviously. But at least we‚Äôre not throwing archer, bundy, and smeltzer out there every week anymore.
Climate change intensifies
Smeltzer gets way to much hate for having a 3.71 ERA last year and a career 3.99 ERA/105ERA+
Love Smeltzer and his story, but yeah‚Ä¶ they ain‚Äôt it.
I disagree that pitch count needs to be on screen at all times.  And Bally‚Äôs base arrows aren‚Äôt confusing at all to me.  Sticking the clock in there is a clever use of space.  One you missed, I just saw today, some Bally stations have the clock as some kind of 3-d element on the field, with a shadow.
I like the Bally solution best
fox comes in at :06 and goes red at :03
Just wanna say thank you for criticizing the Bally solution, I saw some praise for it here a few days ago. I hate it, it's awful like the rest of the Bally bug and everything else they do.
Because violations are so infrequent there is really no need to display the clock on the screen. It just become distracting to the eye and disrupts the leisurely feel of watching a ballgame. If there‚Äôs a violation they can show a replay with the clock. The moving clock naturally draws the eye, and I just wish it wasn‚Äôt shown.
Excellent gathering work.  I personally think NBC has the best implementation.
I love this. This is the analysis I never needed, but read every word of. I admire the dedication to the minutiae. Really well done write up.
Jesus aren‚Äôt there other things to be mad about

I just watched a man have a full argument with a glove and honestly, he had some good points.
Unrelated to the play but Apple's broadcast is crispy af.
This is a very unfun game.
Man, Shuster is having terrible luck right now. Feel bad for the guy.
Glove really didn‚Äôt have to resort to personal attacks though
Video feed and design is crispy AF but what are the announcers smoking? Having trouble completing sentences.
matter of perspective
He‚Äôs walked 4 guys already, he‚Äôs just not good
No glove, no love.
switch it to the radio feed if you prefer that. At least they give us the option.
Found out today you can switch over to radio broadcast.
They‚Äôre embracing the tradition of quality production + horrid announcing
7 innings in the big leagues is all we need now to say that a prospect is no good?  He just isn‚Äôt quite ready yet. Which is fine. Not everyone can come up and be elite as quickly as Strider.
Oh yeah, he definitely has contributed a lot to all the runs scoring. But in the first 2 innings alone he has had 3 outs (this and what should have been a double play) lost due to poor fielding. That's pretty rough.
Same. It‚Äôs game-changing; I love it.
Not as ready as Strider? Believe it or not, down to AAA.
I mean his stuff just isn‚Äôt impressive. With his command a 90 mph fastball isn‚Äôt ever going to get it done
To be fair‚Ä¶ Arcia steps on the bag and those two runs don‚Äôt score. Ball doesn‚Äôt get stuck, neither does the third. Defense has just been weird
He hasn‚Äôt really had command issues in the minors, had ~2.45 IP. And the stuff looked pretty good in spring.  Again, he‚Äôs not ready, but you‚Äôre basing your opinion off of a handful of innings over two starts at the MLB level. Both against good lineups, and the most recent where the defense was no help at all.
That is... very surprising considering how quickly A Rod became a superstar.
No offense but this is just a kid that hasn't learned to protect the strike zone. None of those called strikes really looked that egregious. I'm guessing this is just Jerry Dipoto trying to save face for bringing the kid up before he was ready and starting his service time clock for nothing.  You can't be rocking a .190 BA with no power for very long. Also woof that 61 ops+
Ken Griffey Whonior
Him and Ronald are easily my two favorite players. And then Brendan Donovan
Until I read the article, I was pretty sure it was Alvin Davis whom he topped.   Davis had 116 RBI and put up 6 bWAR in his age-23 rookie season.
A Rod played 65 games in his first two seasons where he hit only 5 home runs before having his breakout season
How many games in was this posted? Lol
To be fair he wasn't rocking a .190 BA and 61  OPS+ for very long
Wtf happened to davis? Looked like a fantastic player and then just couldnt hit after his age 29 season and then disappeared
Yea and he was 18-19 years old which is insane lol.
I think it was posted at the end of April.
Sports medicine has come along way since when Davis played. He didn‚Äôt recover from minor injuries like many do and the nagged him his entire career and ended it super early
I just remember him always having a hell of a time against lefties, so once he slowed down after age thirty, he really hit the wall. I think he finished his career in Japan.
It‚Äôs about the rays baby love the rays let‚Äôs go get 17 home runs baby love the rays let‚Äôs go rays
In 4% of their 2023 season, the Rays have hit 12% of their 2022 season total
This baseball shit easy
More useless facts yay
A Rays team that can hit is very scary.
Just as long as you don't win 116.
I thought this was BP though.
Game ain't over yet y'all just settle down lol
It helps that our starters with the exception of Fleming have been good to dominant in all of their starts thus far.
The Nationals would have more home runs if they were hitting against Nationals pitching.
A's have scored 33% of the runs the rays have given up, so that means they're an offensive juggernaut
Tbf it was Detroit, nationals, and As
Lol
Always neat when a small sample size adds to the stat
Im ok with a cool 115 ü§ùü§ùü§ù
Nah, just the A's
How much wall can a Waldichuk chuck?         A grand slam apparently
Bro, didn't you lose to Detroit twice? lol
Who did the Astros just lose their last series to?
Lmao the list is just going to keep getting longer and longer for these types looking for excuses. Let me guess, no win will be legitimate until we face Houston, yeah? I look forward to the 24th.
I heard some women actually prefer smaller sample sizes
We can win the ALCS though right?
Just Astros things, we suck in April and play worse to bad teams for some reason
Read my comment to the other guy who said the same shit
No, just any good team will suffice. Aka the blue jays
Do you have sources so I can show my wife?
Ummmmmmmmmmm
So it's good when you beat bad teams but it's not good when we do it? Ok fam.
3-5 though. Bummer.
Nah, it‚Äôs good when you beat good teams. Bad teams are pretty meaningless
It‚Äôs April lol  I‚Äôm sure the best team in the 1st week always wins the World Series right
A win is a win. They're all big leaguers. You're giving me the same energy that Jays did when they complained we played, and beat the shit out of, the O's at the end of the year.
Yeah man you are probably right. Try not to cheat this season though*
Os last year we‚Äôre actually a decent team
We didn‚Äôt last season
https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/orioles/rays-win-over-orioles-completes-historical-dominance  This year.   You beat the teams you‚Äôre scheduled to play. Coming from a fan who roots for an AL West team, you should understand that.
Cool*
How‚Äôs the seduction subreddit working out for you? Not great I‚Äôm guessing.
If he wasn't one of the all times biggest scam artists I might really like this guy.
I am of the opinion that the term ‚Äúsuperfan‚Äù is exceptionally stupid
It‚Äôs too bad he‚Äôs a piece of shit who should be in prison. Seems like an ideal owner
Well that's a fuckin day at the park ain't it?!
Doing this at any level above tee ball is insanely impressive.
Brady ‚Äúshoehei ohtani‚Äù ware
Don't see the big deal? I did this several times playing one on one whiffle ball with my friend Robert when I was 8
Ohtani: ‚ÄúChallenge accepted.‚Äù
Can we give him 1 WAR?
Best single game performance of all time?
I don't think even Tungsten Arm O'Doyle ever did that
I'm the Sports Information Director for UIndy Baseball. His words after the game were of pure shock and awe. Couldn't have happened to a better kid.
College baseball is distilled chaos.
I did a triple take just now. Atta boy Brady!!! Back to class now kid.
#YOUR TURN, OHTANI
MLB The Show type beat
Yeah but today I finished my KPI spreadsheets by 3 PM so let‚Äôs see him do that
Reminds me of when Alex Robles of Austin Peay went 5-for-5, hit for the cycle, and got the win in the same game back in 2017. He‚Äôs the only player in NCAA history to achieve all three.
Yeah well Happy Gilmore accomplished that feat no more than a hour ago!
There is another‚Ä¶
D2 is something else. I went to a game my cousin in law was coaching in earlier this year and both teams had double digit runs in the 5th inning lol
Whotani?
Dude had himself a day
I knew I should have taken in a game at the alma mater on my off day.  Damnit so much.
One Brady dies so the next Brady can live
He save a cat from a tree, too?
7 inning game. Still tremendously impressive
Ohtani could never
Ohtani who?
Yeah but did he break a fake home run record?
I hope he was the player of the game, although it'll be kinda funny if he wasn't because a teammate hit 5 homers or something ridiculous.... although even if a guy hit 5 homers, I would give the player of the game to the guy who threw a no-hitter and hit for the cycle...
You know how Steph Curry basically inspired a generation of kids that shoot an insane ammiunt of three pointers and hit them at a high rate? We are starting to see the same effect with Ohtani!
And to think, I spent my night watching the Pacers get smoked by the Pistons
What's his draft status and profile
You've been called out, Shohei.
Great day of honkball if you ask me
It‚Äôd be the most impressive in coach pitch tbh
I dunno, I've never thrown a no hitter in tee ball
Nah, ohtani never pulled that off. More like Shohei "Brady Ware" Ohtani
Yea get fucked Rob
I‚Äôm still waiting for the game where Ohtani goes 9-9, hits 5 home runs, the cycle, throws a no-hitter, but because nobody on the Angels can field and Trout is hurt he somehow loses the game 15-14
Gotta be
Idk man, how many grand slams did this scrub hit in one inning? ^^/s
That depends on what you value more, a cycle or two home runs. Obviously a cycle is rarer. Rick Wise pitched a no-hitter and hit two homers in the same game. I‚Äôd go with Ware‚Äôs performance.
I appreciate you sharing that insight! What an awesome story.
What did he say?
Yet you still haven‚Äôt submitted your tps reports. Curious
I love that honkball is an actual name of baseball. They call it that in The Netherlands.
And therefore the world
You just don't see enough coaches throwing junk. Strikeouts build a child's character.
My very first game of coach pitch, our opponents were no-hit. Every out except for one groundout to shortstop was either a strikeout or hit back to me (fielding the pitcher position). Alas, I was a HR short of the cycle in that game.
Shohei ‚ÄúBabe ‚ÄòBrady Ware‚Äô Ruth‚Äù Ohtani of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim
This seems appropriate. He's a Yankee fan
A cycle is 10 total bases and 2 HRs is 8. And the HRs may guarantee you an extra run over the cycle there is still a good chance of scoring from the triple or double or picking up RBIs.
If you could though, that'd be greeeeeat
Would‚Äôve strengthened my game if my coach was throwing 90 mph sliders down the zone
Legendary.
Of California
Right? None of this fastballs down the middle garbage.
If DeGrom goes down this year again, we should make his rehab little league games, but only against 1st-5th graders.
If you don‚Äôt like that, you don‚Äôt like A‚Äôs baseball
God I love these unis
It may say 6-1, but we‚Äôre on our way to 7-0
If you doubt the Rays STILL, you probably can‚Äôt count to 20 without taking off your socks
Back to back Ks to Yandy and Wander and it seemed like he was going to get out of it
I LOVE BEING A FUCKING RAYS FAN!!!!! LAST YEAR SUCKED BUT AGHHHH ITS BEEN A LONG TIME COMING LOL
Rumors are that the A's Leftfielder is still looking for the ball.
Bring back the Devil Rays unis full time, cowards
He got Yandy Diaz and Wander Franco looking foolish on those strikeouts right before and I thought he was getting out of it
I choose to believe our bats are due to returning to the rainbows.
Local stingray in a great mood
Terrible pitch
I can't believe they've left this dude in there pitching
So who gives the Rays their first loss?
Paredes >>> Meadows  Thanks Al Avila
üß¶üß¶üß¶üß¶
god I miss him
Tigers, Nationals and As. Jeeze, talk about a nice easy warmup to start the season
i'm more surprised about how many people there are in the bleachers
It feels like adding insult to injury that Seth Brown was running around not being able to find the ball as it made its way into the stands
Oh no, I do I do
I'm so happy they're leaning into it more
Just make them our everyday kit again. Our normal kit is so boring.
Yet still behind the 3-5 Astros in the power rankings
I‚Äôll give you Austin Meadows for Paredes, straight up. You in?
More like Tampa Bay ScaRays am I right :(
I mean we haven't played nobody pawl.  In all seriousness though, winning 7 games in a row is hard regardless of the competition.
Super uncharacteristic at bats by the two of them. Paredes is clutch.
That 95 invisible fastball right above the zone looks unhittable. The problem is that he doesn‚Äôt seem to be able locate anything. He seems like he‚Äôll be good some day though once he gets more control
This is Ken Waldisuck we're talking about
You made the playoffs last year and THAT sucked?!
I wish! I picked up a black Devil Rays jersey that they released during the 20th anniversary season and it's my absolute favorite.
They were definitely itching to be the one to clear the bases
Them boys fight like they got the devil in them
I liked it
Lol look at this guy thinking we'll lose
Josh Fleming
The As will pull off some nonsense, they always do.
I may have to step in
Don't trade with the Rays
And the sox next ü§£
This must be what it feels like to play in the AL Central.
you played the marlins dog and lost the series what‚Äôre you talking ab
The Rays don‚Äôt make the schedule, they just play it.  Great teams win the games they‚Äôre supposed to win.
An AL Central team should really not be the one to talk about strength of schedule
Some teams win series against bad teams. Some teams lose series to the Marlins. I know which one I‚Äôd rather see.
I thought he was about to catch it on the warning track and I was bummed out.
Honestly thought he might have been able to catch it for a second. Yeah, it was a no-doubter, but the way Brownie was looking up made it seem like he had a chance at a play.
Make it Auston Matthews and you‚Äôve got a deal ü§ùüèº
*flaps with malicious intent*
I never abided by ‚Äúyou have to beat good teams to be good‚Äù  Winners are good
playoffs was great lol but we were the second most injured team in the league and 1 run in 25 innings isn‚Äôt optional lmao. i‚Äôm very happy we made the playoffs last year but it could‚Äôve gone much better (and worse)
Making the playoffs is always nice but with the injuries and the way they hit all year it sucked to watch sometimes. Especially with the high expectations coming off a 100win season
I wore mine to the game tonight. It's getting worn out :(
As did I, it looked like a delicious meatball
\*upvotes angrily\*
You sunova bitch
He's out of line, but he's right.
Y'all quite literally just lost a series to the tigers
they're at least mid
I audibly groaned because I thought it was going to be just short of going out based on his positioning. Totally sold me on it.
Dude. I was at the game but sitting under like a ledge. Off the bat, it seemed like a bomb. UT the way the left fielder was reacting I was doubting it.
Or optimal!
Speak for yourself
I hear you. I'm still holding out hope they put out another one this year for the 25th anniversary, especially since they seem to be embracing the old name more this year than they have in the past.
üçùü§å
You have me confused with the Houston Astros. I personally, may have to stop the Rays
At least you have a World Series in your lifetime. I hope to see that one day.
Lol
Two actually but still. Sustained playoff relevancy in baseball is tough
It turns out the real World Series trophy was the playoffs we made along the way
What is that CF?  508?
"what a great catch," he said, barely registering emotion.
Great catch, horrible call.
Minor league commentary is so bad lol.
Hat came off and everything
Dude makes an incredible play.   Announcer ü•±
From [@FarmToFame_](https://twitter.com/FarmToFame_/status/1644314811658911745?s=20) on Twitter. Ignore the unimpressed announcer
Just a terrific play
Wait is he playing again? I thought he got hurt? Or am I a year off..
All 5 people there are stoked.
The only difference between that catch and Willie Mays is that this one would have actually been a homer at Polo Grounds
Lol is this stadium used in The Show? That grassy hill thing on the 1b line looks familiar.
Couldn't be a Willie Mays-esque catch if it didn't at least somewhat resemble the Polo Grounds right?
[Looks like 425 to left center](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Elsinore_Diamond)
Right? Crazy dimensions and on top of that the wall is pretty high too
‚ÄúByyyyyy‚Äù‚Ä¶ *double checks notes* ‚ÄúDruw Jones‚Äù
Yeah probably the reason he‚Äôs calling games where the audio equipment sounds like he‚Äôs calling the game via speaker phone.
He‚Äôs a minor league announcer for a reason lol
To be fair to the guy announcing I‚Äôm not even sure he could see what happened, why does he appear to be at field level 20 yards away from the game being played?
He had a really quick recovery. It's definitely easy to get confused though, all three of our top prospects (Carroll, Jones, and Lawlar) have had major shoulder injuries in the last year and a half
None of the minor league parks in the show are real
MiLB game audio is so unbelievably bad. It sounds like they‚Äôre calling the game through two cans attached by string
Glad to see he‚Äôs out there! How‚Äôs he look at the plate?
What is JIP?
Freeüò≥  Edit: Nvm probably blacked out lol
I don't want to be on national TV right now.
the broadcast will join the game in progress
It is legally required to preface every Bryan Reynolds stat with ‚ÄúBryan Reynolds requested a trade from the Pirates this past offseason.‚Äù
Keep this up and fans might start offering TWO top 30 prospects in their trade proposals
There were really dumbass fans in the off-season who thought they could trade for Reynolds without giving up their best prospects
Yesterday's price ain't today's price
He should request a trade every week.
Impressive to do all of this while also acting and being a part-owner of a Welsh football team
Give him back
Reynolds first Pirates' 40 HR hitter since Stargell?
Yeah, I guess that‚Äôs decent company to be in.
PAY THE MAN
I mean they are far away from competing though. Might not be until his 5th year.
Yet none of them seem to mention that Reynolds has since rescinded the trade request.
Slow down there, buddy! Our best prospect is untouchable, but you can take this prospect that all the fans and the organization have given up on and maybe we'll throw in a 27 year old reliever who has struggled so far at the MLB level. That's my offer, take it or leave it.
Marlins should‚Äôve went all in and traded for him
I‚Äôm still hoping against hope we somehow keep him.  Yes I‚Äôm a bit delusional, why do you ask?
His team control makes the Soto trade comp very fair. It would be something similar.
While there were some fans like that, there were way more laughing at how much the pirates were asking for compared to the extension they pffered
B-Ryan Reynolds = Backup Ryan Reynolds
Well he sold his stake in Mint Mobile so all he has to worry about is hitting dinger. Easy game easy life bby
Stargell and Kiner are the only ones to do it.  Kiner 1947-1951  Stargell 1971, 1973
Man I thought Bay had done it for some reason...nope 35
Or that he clearly would have signed an extension of the pirates weren‚Äôt being cheap about it
I‚Äôll hang up and listen
That would've showed him
I don't think it's unrealistic to say we are likely to keep him at this point. They agreed to the money but the issue is the opt out. I'm optimistic that they will eventually make that work. I highly doubt they will just completely scrap the entire deal over this opt out, rather than just swallowing your pride and agreeing to it.
Mets legend
Has nothing to do with money actually. The hold up is a disagreement about an opt out clause.
They agreed to the money. The issue is an opt out.
Money has literally nothing to do with it. They agreed on money and term
Oh shit really? That‚Äôs on me for not being as up to date as I could be.  That makes me a lot more optimistic.
I would consider any contract stipulations to be ‚Äúabout money‚Äù
Well the opt out is about money lmfao
Right, the reason Reynold‚Äôs wants the opt out is because the guaranteed money is less than he is willing to accept to give up a potential contract.   A players desire for an opt outs can really only be avoided by guaranteeing more money.
I was 1000% hoping we'd win on nothing but wild pitches
We were robbed (of a great walk-off call by Dick Bremer). But I certainly don't mind Provus as a stand-in. Get well soon Dick!
The call sounds like an excited Twins' fan's YouTube search history immediately after this game  > twins win >  > twins win on opening day >  > minnesota twins walk off win
#WIN FOR DICK
Twins stacked, league fucked
FARM DOG BABY WOOF WOOF  those twins jerseys are slick
Maldonado had absolutely no idea what Stanek was throwing all inning
So the Twins are pretty damn good  Also, who know, with the new shift restrictions, maybe that‚Äôs a double play last season, wild to think about
Would have preferred the walk-off wild pitch/passed ball, but a hit up the middle that might have been a double play in the shift last season is also cool
Sort of non-related but Trevor Larnach looks like the most Twins player ever
FARMER STRONG
The Twins didn‚Äôt need Arraez
Tis the April Astros üò≠
Miss the farm dawg
bro that oxy tag is HUGE. Mother of God I hate them.
Twins new unis looking good
We take those!
He's done it since his first at bat
Angelbros thank you and wish you a great season.
Anyone who says there‚Äôs no drama with the clock can fuck right off
The shift died for this.
https://imgur.com/a/5bf7mdO
Man that OXY patch is ugly as hell. It stands out so much on the uniform it looks like it's CGI'ed in
Those are nice uniforms and helmets
What's with the giant OXY badge
I am a simple man I see Houston lose, I upvote (they have been owning us lately)
Love Farm Dawg
Win for the game.  Go twins!
*Fuck*  (And may I emphasize)   **THE ASTROS**
Anytime Houston loses, we win.
**THE GREATER GOOD**
Those Twins jerseys are so clean.
Fuck the asterisks
Good shit
Well hello there Kyle Farmer
‚Äî I thought Rod Beck was dead.   ‚Äî He is.   ‚Äî Oh, then I‚Äôm not surprised he lost the game.
So beautiful. I wish this would happen every day.
Miss you farmdog
Kyle Farmer is the man. Miss having him on the squad.
Man Correa sucked today
Cheaters go down! Gj Twins!
Eff the astros they look so dumb here
I graduated high school with Kyle Farmer, crazy to see how successful he‚Äôs been.
So glad baseball is back
Farmdawg
Whoaaaaa, this was awesome!
Through Stanek anything is possible, so jot that down
I‚Äôm an Astros fan and approve this comment.
Provus is also very good at his job
mn twins final score   did the twins win today   twins new scoreboard mistakes   did dick bremer die   byron buxton wife
He used ChatGPT to generate game-winning calls.
That's his standard Twins win call. It's one of the very few things i don't like about his announcing.
**I miss Dick**
For fans who don't know, this is hilarious out of context
I of course, love dick, but man Cory provus has such great calls.
I am completely floored at how elite our SP has been this year. Thought they would be solid, but it‚Äôs 7 straight elite starts from these guys.   It‚Äôll regress, but it‚Äôs fun to watch
You get it!!
Then they'll get swept by the Yankees in the first round
The Cincinnati -> Minnesota pipeline won us this game. Sonny pitched an absolute gem of a game again
I feel like they may have been having pitch comm issues, I noticed Stanek messing with it early in the inning and then it seemed like he kept throwing stuff that just wasn‚Äôt what Maldy called.
Was so confused. Dude is a rock back there but straight biffed it all inning
We‚Äôve hit like shit outside of two games, but damn does our rotation look good. And we have 3 guys who could be mid rotation starters in AAA.
Don't jinx, plz
They're very good but honestly we're pretty bad rn
There are going to be so many of these instances this year. Lefties are going to rake.
We‚Äôre not that good
He‚Äôs got a very generic handsome joe mauer cornfed type face. You‚Äôre right.
I don't know what to make of this comment and what looking like "the most Twins player ever" even means but I agree 100%  Maybe it's him nailing the Morneau stare?
like dansby when he was on the braves
#WE ARE FARMERS
With all the LOB we def still missed him üò≠
https://i.redd.it/kav4sfcwc9da1.png
That dude could slap a ball over the infielders gloves seemingly at will. Every team needs that guy.
He‚Äôs on a big farm up north, running around and winning games.
Colors on it are wrong too. I‚Äôm dreading the inevitable CHS/Cargill logo on the Twins jerseys.
Okay but also why does it look like it's animated onto his sleeve
*Kyle Farmer's a walk-off hero in the first at bat of his career!*
SanFran-killing Dodger legend Kyle Farmer!
Farmer do be like that. I'll never forget that walk off against the Giants.
Yankeebros also thank them and wish them a good season
Hard agree. I hate the ads, but the least they could have done was match them with our team's colors. Would still look terrible, but that would be moderately better I guess.
Must be sad hounding any post involving the Astros. Rent free.  Logan Morrison "I know from first hand accounts that the Yankees, Dodgers, Astros, and Red Sox all have used film to pick signs,"  Dallas Keuchel "during the course of the playoffs in `17, everybody was using multiple signs,‚Äù  Joey Votto "The idea that they (the Astros) were the only one doing something wrong just baffles me."  Lucas Giolito ‚ÄúBased on everything I‚Äôve heard, it was like all the teams that were in the postseason that year were doing the same shit"  Chris Sale "If the Astros were the only team doing it, then yeah. Give it back. Take it back. I know for a fact they weren‚Äôt,‚Äù  Steven Souza ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to get into to all that but you should know that if you think Houston was the only team with a sign stealing system you‚Äôre dead wrong.‚Äù  Chris Bassitt "...Houston was not the only team doing stuff... one team essentially got caught doing it -- or was the guinea pig of doing it to clean the whole entire league up"  Josh Reddick "I was there, so theres my proof"  Kris Bryant  "Absolutely not. I definitely think others were."  Josh Donaldson "Please don‚Äôt forget if you were a Yankees/Red Sox fan, none of your guys are (Hall of Famers) because both of them got caught using Apple watches before the Astros got caught.‚Äù  Erik Kratz ‚ÄúI can tell you that a team that has been to the World Series often recently, we caught them doing something almost similar. The Colorado Rockies were doing the exact same thing in 2018‚Ä¶They used to take a Theragun and bang it on their metal bench. They were doing the exact same thing.‚Äù  Will Clark ‚ÄúHow can I put this mildly? They got caught. All the rest of us, we didn‚Äôt get caught."
Science is a liar‚Ä¶sometimes.
Maldy too
Jotted
Sorry but gotta downvote you. The fact you still find it okay to go for the asterisks.
It‚Äôs strange having him do TV calls. He‚Äôs constantly reminding us of the count and score, stuff we can see because of the scorebug. But that‚Äôs what makes him such a great radio guy! I wonder if he‚Äôll take over the telecast when Dick retires in the next 5-10 years, I hope so.
Well...this was a different TV announcer than usual as Dick has COVID and this was the radio guy filling in, Cory.
I guess that Dick was really good.  Satisfying af
**I'd do anything for Dick**
Shh... don't tell 'em.
Big fan of Provus, as I listen to day games on the radio. But Dick is also very good
Enjoy him while he's here, he's bound for Chicago before long.
Smh Sonny heard people saying the pitching only looked good against the Royals and Marlins and took that personally
Twins have like 5 #2 pitchers. Averaged out that‚Äôs a #2 staff, whereas 1-5 averaged is a #3 staff. Far better staff construction than the Johan era where you usually had Cy Young and a menagerie of old guys, so so guys, guys at the wrong point of their development, and some straight up lousy pitchers.
Nah, this is the regression.  Only 13Ks and allowed ~~4~~ 5 runners?  This is gonna be up there with one of Sonny's worst starts on the year  Edit: he was worse than I thought, disgusting
The really crazy part is that Bailey Ober didn‚Äôt even make the cut despite a 3.21 ERA last year and a great spring training.
Don‚Äôt forget Solano as well with a stop in SF
I just might have to root for the Twins to win the ALC with all the former Reds there.
Man Sony is great. I hope him and Mahle treat y'all we'll. I want to see Minnesota and Seattle in the CS
Yeah we were losing to bad teams. No surprise we‚Äôre losing to a good team
Strong Morneau vibes too
I think it‚Äôs that he‚Äôs a big beefy stoic white boy. Which is funny because the majority of Minnesota‚Äôs biggest stars have been Latino, black center fielders, and oddball white guy pitchers.
Have no worry, Edouard is coming soon
I miss watching him but after Pablo‚Äôs performance yesterday and opening day I‚Äôd say it was absolutely the right call.
Baby come back
Honestly if it‚Äôs inevitable I think the Target logo would be the cleanest option
Speaking of colors, what's up with that dirt?
Lol @ acting like you‚Äôd quit watching the Dodgers if they cheated
L
I hope Dick doesn't retire and keeps doing games until he is 100
Yeah, i listen to radio call for the Twins often.
Dick was really good. Still is too.
**And we can build this dream together**
It's no secret we all love Dick, what's there to tell? ;)
What makes you say that
Kyle Farmer  Sonny Gray  Tyler Mahle  Look at our boys go. :')
Just two seasons ago we rolled out a starting rotation with Michael Pineda, J.A. Happ, and Matt Shoemaker. And then suffered half a season of John Gant
The ‚Äúeveryone is a number two‚Äù narrative was accurate this offseason, but from what we‚Äôve seen the only think keeping Pablo out of the elite/number one category for me are health question marks (and even with those he threw 180 innings last year)
Based on stuff, Pablo looks like a #1 so far.
Was having this convo last earlier this week. Easily the best rotation since 2006. Santana, Liriano, Radke, Silva, Baker, and Bonser and we *labored* through Silva and Bonser that year. Baler wasn‚Äôt that much better.  Side note, just remembered how much I love Scott Baker and I wish he got his perfect game.
Sonny Gray, Tyler Mahle, Kyle Farmer, and Donnie mf BARRELS. I'm probably forgetting one too.  Hoping that Spencer Steer returns the favor and creates a MSP -> Cincinnati pipeline
Can you say that again about my team? Just one more time?
What the hell is up with Pe√±a
A young Cuddy
The absolute disrespekt to Mauer, Morneau, Hrbek, Killebrew, Knoblauch, Radke, Cuddyer, Kaat, Thome
I wasn‚Äôt old enough for Puckett era so I remember mainly Cuddyer, Mauer and Mourneau
I need Edouard at first!
You can blame it all on me
So true lol.
Seriously, I‚Äôm 29 and I don‚Äôt know a Twins team without Dick Bremer. We need to assign him a number so we have something to retire. It‚Äôs silly to say about someone I‚Äôve never met, but I‚Äôll be genuinely heartbroken when he leaves the game.
It's an open secret that if a Cubs job comes open he would take it. He's a Chicago guy and grew up with that being his dream.
Take care of CES and Spencer Steer for us!
Emilio Pagan is the biggest number two pitcher but I get what you mean.
I think he gets lumped into number #2 because he was in Alcantaras shadow.
That stretch with Santana and pre-injury Liriano. Man. That was the most exciting the Twins have been after 91. If they could have time traveled forward to the playoffs they would have won it all.
Other than Arraez, Spencer Steer is the non-Twin I am following most this season. I really wanted him to do well with us, but now I hope he does great with the Reds
Chase Petty too.
Your team is good, your jerseys are good, and you should feel good, too.
I just dont think hes meant for the leadoff spot but his pitch selection has been horrendous. Theres been quite a few times where he has a call go against him and he just crumbles at the plate. Hes got a tall zone for someone his size getting pitches low consistently called and as soon as it happens he wont stop swinging and pitchers know it
Hope it‚Äôs just a slump
Jeremy Pena started off hot last season, but after the injury really slowed down as well. He rocked a .280 OBP last year and is a bit of a free swinger.
With just a dash of Punto
Okay, Knoblauch definitely doesn‚Äôt belong on the stoic list and he‚Äôs only on The List because they won in 91. I would also put Hrbek in the goofy white guy category because he‚Äôs more of a personality.  Edit: Also, we all love Radke and Cuddy, but they‚Äôre for Twins HOFers they are a step down, star power wise. I would maybe put perhaps the most underrated Twin, Koske, in their tier. Stoic white guy, too.
And I‚Äôm not old enough for the stuff before Puckett. Those first Twins teams had a huge Latino presence. Kaat tells a story about people asking him what the TC on the hats stood for, and he‚Äôd say ‚Äútwenty Cubans.‚Äù Carew is top 2 or 3 Twin ever, and Tony Oliva is basically Mr. Twin.
The CFs have been Hunter, Gomez, Hicks, Revere, and Buxton though
If Gallo goes to the IL, he'll be the guy.
Steer has become an instant fan favorite. Dude is just a gamer.
2006 irrationally triggers me. I remember being in middle school watching us flip vs Oakland.  That Twins team is easily the best we‚Äôve had this century. World Series was definitely within reach. We‚Äôd have had to stretch Santana, Liriano, and Radke, but we‚Äôd have made it. Our bullpen was god status and we had the batting champ, MVP, and Cy Young winners in three different bodies. It‚Äôs an absolute travesty that we didn‚Äôt make the World Series that year.
Alright...can you now pay for my dry cleaning?
He fell for the slider all last year, he‚Äôs gonna fall for it this year until he adjusts. I agree, I think lead off is messing with him
I know but that boy thick
Better be a microphone next to all of our retired numbers. Not even remotely joking.
He‚Äôs gonna be a stud! I hope you all enjoy him!
Yup, the recent early playoff exits and losing streak don‚Äôt even phase me. 2006 was the one that hurt.
Facts. People think 2020 was bad since we didn‚Äôt have the Yankees in the first round, but Oakland was the dagger in the heart.  We win that series and the ‚ÄúYankee curse‚Äù isn‚Äôt real.
white Sox pitching died for this
If it makes you feel any better, he must've absorbed all of our offense today as revenge
Did everyone on the White Sox forget how to pitch besides Cease
Save some of that pitching for the twins pls!!
That‚Äôs one big boy.
Yes lol
Yes :(
yes
Unironically yeah. Every single pitcher. Starters and bullpen.
You'll get one game from Cease but see plenty of awful pitching don't worry.
At least mustache man is still out there killing it
Yes :)
That‚Äôs like the attendance of a dozen A‚Äôs games
Feel bad for the people that got screwed yesterday and couldn‚Äôt make it today
I definitely read that guys name wrong.
Is Edwin Diaz counted in that number? ^sorry^I^had^to
local man discovers Twitter
You would think baseball fans would have more patience being baseball fans and all
He's so wholesome tho. Aww. Check out his replies in that thread.  > Come back after 30 games. We could be 16-14.  ü•≤
Lol, Jazz is fantastic: "Do I look like an actual cleanup hitter ??"
Telling fans not to panic now but that they CAN panic 30 games in if they still suck.  Surely there's no way this comes back to bite him, let's see how this plays out.
Eventually 8 turns to 9 turns to 10 turns to 162. The wheel of time is vicious
Oof. Don't engage with them, Jazz
There's Marlin's fans to panic?
because I always panic
Well, it‚Äôs also the Marlins.
Cus it's already game number 8 and we haven't made the ALCS yet.
Chris Coghlan walked so Jazz Chisholm can run
Because we‚Äôve given up like 60 hits and 40 runs in 3 of the last 4 games
we're not panicking, just giving up
Cause Marlins?
He‚Äôs right but he also plays with Miami who‚Äôs fans see the same shit happen year after year after year no matter who is playing there.
You‚Äôd think baseball players would know sooner than anyone else that they‚Äôre on a bad team
Surprised he‚Äôs seeing marlins fans that are in a panic. They don‚Äôt exist.
The real question ir did anyone think the Marlins would be good?
100% Yup. Wanna know why, Jazz? Because social media rewards attention-seeking behavior and disincentivizes nuance.  The irony is self-reflection may solve the, "Look at me!," problem but it's awful for getting others to do it for you.  And the greater irony is, after I step off the soapbox, I'm gonna reddit some more.
*the internet
Did you see the reaction to him getting The Show cover? Dude definitely can handle a little pushback on Twitter lol
how you not gonna say Florida Man
*florida man
*loses one series*  Season‚Äôs over, wrap it up.
One of my friends tried to talk to me about the MVP race after game 4.  I had to shut it down real quick, this isn't the NBA.
Have you ever met baseball fans?
Another pitch clock casualty smh
Some of our fans overreactions are insane lol
‚ÄúWhen can we panic?‚Äù  ‚ÄúAt 30 games you can panic.‚Äù   Lol it‚Äôs cute.
I really hope they're going well after 30 games.  The keyboard warriors have already circled that date on their calendar to dunk on Jazz if they're not üòî
* 2022: 13-17 * 2021: 14-16 * 2020: 15-15 * 2019: 9-21 * 2018: 11-19  I guess anything is possible, including being...2 games above .509
I mean, you don't usually see the 4th hitter bunting, especially when they're a star, one of the few guys who can hit on the team, and has historically hit the pitcher very well.  I do get his POV that if he got one down it was a guaranteed hit. He probably thought bunting was a lot easier than it is.
Guys it‚Äôs only game number 161 why is everyone panicking?
Mets fans know this one
Jazz jinxed himself before the season when he said he‚Äôd play all 162
There‚Äôs dozens and we‚Äôre running around like chickens with our heads cut off
Don‚Äôt worry you just caught the giants on an even game twice.
Social media doesn't reward attention seeking behavior, see? #CAL RALEIGH IS WASHED WHERE SIR HARRY FORD
I swear to God this is my brother. The Mets had a rough series to what right now is a good Brewers team. You'd think they're winless from the way he rants about the lineup. Right now the bottom of it isn't playing well. But I do imagine that if those players don't perform the issue will be addressed.
Oh, you‚Äôve been on our game threads?
r/Torontobluejays in a nutshell
https://youtu.be/okXhAC78d4Q
Well if he was talking about Duvall then he has a good point
I Don't recommend dunking on Jazz. Friend tried that last year and didn't end well.
I like that his "doing well" is *what if we are a .500 team after 30 games, then what??*
Guys, we‚Äôre already eliminated why is everyone still panicking?
You guys should just get 5 Luzardos and 9 Arraez-es, imo.
::Begruding, muttering upvote::  ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The way a subsection of our sub talks about Harry Ford now you would think he's a 65 FV prospect ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I had friends of mine saying we should get Alonso and Lindor on the block to get some talent while they still have value. Fucking insanity.
This is every subreddit for every team. You would‚Äôve thought the Rays were eliminated from the post season when McClanahan gave up _two_ runs in a shaky start on Wednesday.
Baseball is all about failure, too. Not only just the ".300 hitter fails 70% of the time thing" but a baseball season is 162 games. We know winning 100 games is special. But you know what it means if you won 100 games? That you had to watch your team lose that year 62 different times. Baseball should remind us we're all failures, some of us just fail slightly less. And, even if you failed, you can always get out there try to not fail the next day
We've also gone 4-1 against the Marlins who can be sneaky good and beat the twins 2 out of three, IIRC. And the Phillies have only won one game.
my brother isn't a big baseball fan but came over and watched the game with me earlier today. he was genuinely surprised when he found out this wasn't our first win of the year. the way his coworkers had been talking about the mets' season so far, he assumed they were like 0-10 at least
That is "doing well" for the Marlins. They're in a stacked division and there are expanded playoffs this year. Go .500 till September and you could easily make the playoffs with a hot streak to end the regular season
I‚Äôd prefer 4 Sandy‚Äôs and 1 Luzardo and 9 Arraez-es but that‚Äôs just me being picky
Said brother (my twin to be specific) does not like Pete at all, didn't like Jake, and hates Nimmo. Thinks the team is doomed to fail because of the bullpen and the lineup.
Two games. They beat Cincy earlier today. But I agree with your overall point.
My brother is basically a more eloquent and (somewhat) reasonable Frank Flemming. Ready to press the panic button immediately about who sucks. If the other team puts up a crooked number in the inning it's practically game over.
Oh lord I forgot about Sandy, forgive me, for I have sinned.
Does he like any homegrown Met
I think your brother might be stupid.
Honestly that's a good question. He hated Noah too (though that one he may've been right about).
Just a catcher who's also an outfielder playing the outfield then coming in to play catcher because the other catcher's arm imploded.
Giants are seriously doing the zero offense thing again. Tomorrow they are hitting 3 balls into the bay for sure.
One of those frames of Sabol juggling the ball would be perfect for the sidebar, just sayin' :D.
> Tomorrow they are hitting 3 balls into the bay for sure  What about the other 8 innings?
I'm partial to [this one](https://imgur.com/GakCk46.jpg) before he even starts juggling it lmao  Although [this one works too](https://imgur.com/Mb0k1Cn.jpg)
The other 5 won‚Äôt land in the bay
omg that first one is amazing
Oh he ate them up!!  Too bad twins love LOBster so much.
>7.0 IP, 1 ER, 4 H, 1 BB, 13 SO on 98 pitches  I sleep  >vs. Astros  Real shit?
I still miss him so much. I'll never forget when he went toe to toe against Verlander in the playoffs as a rookie.
Honestly shocked that‚Äôs his career high. Glad he‚Äôs made such a comeback from what the Yankees did to him
Larry Rothschild needs to be tried for war crimes
He was dealing today, looked good. That breaking ball was sexual.
a great pitching duel, helped by winds knocking down a lot of hard hit balls on both sides
I miss him.
[Apparently, he's only the 5th pitcher to get at least 12 K in a game against the Astros since 2017, the year the Astros won their first WS.](https://twitter.com/dohyoungpark/status/1644456650214981635)
I remember when he had Yankee rumors I was refreshing Twitter like every minute cause I was so excited to get him cause I always really liked him. His Yankee tenure didn‚Äôt go as expected but he‚Äôs still a favorite of mine.
Let‚Äôs go Sonny! Always rooting for ya!
Revenge game for 2017.
Didn't even think about touching him on the waiver wire, and won't. Cy Young incuming
Kinda easy to win with no trash can
I told him to be me ERA/WHIP guy in fantasy and he just saved me K/9 for the week lol
i had a chance to pick him up today and i grabbed urqidy instead... didnt do bad but its no 13K 7IP
This is awesome!  I loved watching Sonny Gray pitch while with the Athletic and I'm a Jays fan. That team was super fun to watch during his time.  Coco Crisp, Matt Chapman, Markus Semien, Jed Lawrie and Liam Hendricks just to name a few.   Side note: I have his action figure still in package hanging on my wall surrounded by predominantly Jays and Expos paraphernalia.
I was a huge Sonny fan in Oakland and was excited when we traded for him. To this day it hurts that it didn‚Äôt work out but I‚Äôm happy he‚Äôs doing better elsewhere
His breaking ball was superb today. He froze a couple of batters on called third strikes today.
I‚Äôll show you LOBster
His breaking stuff was great today
Lol Astros have been total ass so far don‚Äôt get too excited.
We suck right now, so you can go back to sleep.
He's been a favorite of mine ever since that game. Happy to see him doing well after he looked pretty washed.
Game 2 might be the best game I‚Äôve ever listened to, and I‚Äôll always have a soft spot for Sonny because of it. Also I like his name because I love the song Obvious Child by Paul Simon
The Twins special
I was a huge fan of him from his Oakland days and was ecstatic when we got him. The entire time I knew it was somehow the Yankees' fault that he struggled and I'm happy to see him back in form elsewhere. Fuck Larry Rothschild.
Nuremberg when?
Can fucking confirm
50 shades of gray
Don't forget the shadows and the incredibly wide zone to start
Won*
Why are you taking shots at Sonny Gray for that?
No one cares about your fantasy team
That's nothing I almost picked up Punto today but napped Eckstein instead
Nah bro, YOU suck right now.
Maybe one could say... Garbage?
üò¥ üí§
People like you are why I hate my own teams fanbase
They* not we. You‚Äôre not on the team (at least I‚Äôm assuming)
You are accused of fuckery and ruining good pitchers, the court finds you guilty and sentences you to be shot.
Nice
A full ball's width was granted to the outside of the box to both teams. Was consistent but generally ridiculous, if it ain't a strike it ain't a strike.
Sometimes I am also haunted by the shadows and the winds
It's surprisingly difficult to strikeout hitters with prophetic trashcans.
Not taking a shot at sunny. Its a dig at the astros
i think i got that when 33 people downvoted  but someone cared enough to tell me that no one cares
Could be worse, I passed on Eckstein for Orlando Hudson
Who calls it garbage and not trash? You‚Äôre trash vs. you‚Äôre garbage and a‚Ä¶. Garbage bin?
Bruh they won the World Series yesterday
Now you know. Sports subs absolutely lose it when someone mentions fantasy of said sport on that sub haha.
Those are all remarkably normal things to say
He had some filthy stuff today. What an insane start to the season for the Starting staff
Sonny was nasty all day. Didn't need help from the shadows and got it anyway.
Who the hell designed Target Field?
You say this like there‚Äôs a problem
Shadows
I feel like this happens at most outdoor stadiums occasionally but I could be wrong
Are you new to life on this earth?
Who designed the sun!
Yeah this is just why games are usually middle of the day or evening, I think. Guessing they schedule them differently early in the season due to weather
Well no, I've been here a couple decades now.
Yeah it's really strange there's something on the stadium that makes it so (during the day) the pitcher releases the ball from a shadow (with a dark batters eye behind him), the ball goes through a patch of sunlight, then goes back into a shadow right in front of the plate.
Its a sunny April game. Sun is low in the sky compared to a June game so the awning gap is between the pitchers mound and the pate. Happens one or two times a year. Not an excuse for striking out 15 times in 7 innings though
That‚Äôs not unique to Target field whatsoever‚Ä¶ plenty of stadiums have similar shadow issues this time of year
Oh no, the strikeouts are on us- I just thought the lighting was strange.
Oh that's interesting, I had just never seen that particular combination before.
The lighting? You mean the sun?
Since the beginning of time, man has yearned to destroy the sun.
Well obviously in all (open) stadiums there's going to be times where the ball goes from shadow to sunlight or from sunlight to shadow, this was just the first time I had seen the   shadow -> sunlight -> shadow  combo
Dear Adley, I feel like I can call you Adley because you and me are so alike. I'd like to meet you one day, it would be great to draw a picture together. I know I can't draw as good as you but I think you'd be impressed with my butts. I love your hair, you run fast. Did you have a good relationship with your father? Me neither. These are all things we can talk about and more. I know you have not been getting my drawings because I know you would draw back if you did. I hope you draw back this time, and we can become good friends. I am sure our relationship would be a real home run!
Was Adley u/diditforthestory all along?
Looks just like him
Gotta get Rutschman in here next offseason to draw a picture of Gunnar Henderson every day till opening day.
He tried his best ü•∫
the real take away here - is adley ACTUALLY left handed?? he drew this with his left hand!!
Oh shit, there‚Äôs stickers!
My tee's gone cold, I'm wondering why I   Got out at first at all   The morning rain clouds up my window (window)   And I can't see at all   And even if I could it'll all be gray   But your pitchers on my wall   It reminds me, that it's not so bad   It's not so bad
Its u/DidItForTheStory all the way down.
Of any MLB player‚Ä¶ honestly he‚Äôd be the one
The absolute disrespect to the Northwest Angle
Better than the new scoreboard, which was buggier than the Last of Us PC port. We've been making fun of it in the stands the whole game. At one point it had Alvarez highlighted in the box score, Abreu's picture, Tucker's name, and Hensley was up.
For an embarrassingly long time I used to think St. Paul was supposed to be a Sox jersey and it symbolized the Twins and Sox were like divisional chums from opposite sides of the Mississippi river
It looks more retro which makes it cooler
It's new but I wouldn't say improved.
It‚Äôs Okay
I was skeptical of the new look but now I‚Äôm really digging it. The Twins are doing a great job remaking themselves
They ruined Paul and Minnie's faces
That‚Äôs nice and all, but where‚Äôs the Twins-O-Gram?  (Grandpa took me to my first Twins game in 1964 - became a rabid fan - explains why I hate the Dodgers to this day for beating my ‚Äò65 Twins in the WS)
Well it‚Äôs a grower not a shower
It‚Äôs cold up there, okay?
They tried to secede. They don't deserve respect
[Comparison](https://i.imgur.com/Ec61Lty.jpg). We got some Wisconsin in us too. Ick.
Yea wtf, doesn‚Äôt even look like our state. How does that happen
Apparently Micheal A Taylor is half our lineup now lmao
Being a kid and thinking the Twins were originally from Chicago or something because their logo is the bears, and they have the white sox logo on a mascot.
I would say we're far from chums lol
the hand actually shakes
Does it? I‚Äôve been waiting but they didn‚Äôt really show it on the telecast. And on the video I saw on Twitter, they were shaking hands paaaaaaainfully slow. Might need to crank the motor up a bit.
Yeah it definitely could be sped up a little, but I believe it only plays for Home Runs, so it wasn't on the telecast. Maybe it's supposed to play after a win too, but it didn't look like it today.
It would be weird if they didn‚Äôt do it after a win, right?

Holy hell the White Sox are getting their teeth kicked in day after day this season
BOB PAY THIS MAN NOW!!!!!
Forget the brinks truck. We need the brinks blimp.
Just give bro his bread already
This man deserves all the money
my optimism is already gone
When I'm in a hate life contest and my opponent is a White Sox fan
Gm Bucco Nation
Imagine not wanting to pay this guy to stay.  edit: I guess the reports/rumors are that he wants the money AND an opt out in case the Pirates stop trying so he can leave. In that case, give him that too and then make sure he never wants to leave by actually building around him. Don't Rockies-Arenado him.
The Pirates are fun
‚ÄúBoy, I sure do wish to see more offense in White Sox games!‚Äù  üêµ‚úåÔ∏è‚û°Ô∏è‚òùÔ∏è
FLY THE JOLLY RODGER! BASEBALL IS ALIVE IN PITTSBURGH!
 FUCK this pitching staff, FUCK this pitching coach Ethan Katz, FUCK our owner, and FUCK THIS ENTIRE ORGANIZATION WITH A CHAINSAW
Bart, I don't want to alarm you.
this dude is white hot unreal
I'll toss in $5 to keep this man in Pittsburgh
Pirates: naw, still not worth $13MM AAV   ü§¶
Are the pirates good or are the white sox just bad
are the white sox okay?
WE ARE GOOD
This man is a menace in odd years
We're not last in team ERA anymore! Let's go
We‚Äôll miss you üò¢
Holy fuck lmao this division is either the twins or ours.
Is this not an inside-the-park grand slam?
Wtf Pirates chill
Unsubscribe.
In some hospital the Pittsburgh version of Kramer is getting Bob Nutting's birthday card from a sick little boy as long as Reynolds catches a fly ball in his hat tomorrow
I remember when Paul O‚ÄôNeill did this - but then he caught a ball in his hat the next game.
#BART!
Little league grand slams! So cool
IM AT FULL MAST RN
The only thing I really got from this video is that O‚ÄôNeil Cruz is a fucking giant, literally a whole head taller than the rest of the dugout
Reynolds and Cutch is such a cool outfield for a team that's going to lose as many games as the Pirates.
Undeniable
Oh, for a second there I thought he hit 1000 triples!
Looks packed. Nice to see.
The bullpen wasn't even this bad in the dark times.  With Hendricks out every guy got pushed into marginally higher leverage situations and they have all crumbled. Lynn + Giolito regressions not helping either.  Life is pain.
Found Matt Hardy's reddit account
On the contrary! Save. Save-RES, because two is definitely better than one!

I eat meat
This division is a two team race until otherwise
The most frustrating part is that the bats have been really good. A breath of fresh air from last season. Collectively .287/.341/.434, 74 hits and 32 runs through 7 games, all around pretty solid. Everybody not named Dylan Cease has just forgotten how to pitch with even moderate effectiveness
By the Pirates!
Payload is lower so ‚Ä¶ checks out.
Gm
He currently wants the opt out 1 year after the team control is up.  I understand not wanting to give a contract like that, but ffs give him a million more per year and put it in a year later.  Hell even backload that extra money
Imagine trading this guy for not even a full season of McCutchen. I certainly don't know anyone who would make that trade.
Is it sp00ky szn in Pittsburgh????
They got 9 runs today. It was the Bucs home opener, Cutch is back and they were hot, including the middle of their batting order. The Bucs have some young guys that are looking pretty good so far.
BUT THE BUCKOS ARE BACK  I LOVE YOU BUCKO BROS
Yes
They're a young team with really solid young hitters with some good veterans sprinkled in. Hitting wise we're a good team but the pitching is a massive question mark.
Jerry Reinsdorf owned teams are an experiment to see how much fans can handle before hitting their breaking point. Actually unreal both the Bulls and White Sox are going through the exact same thing- just unbelievably mid (though '23 Sox might be straight up terrible at this rate) despite being in their 'contending window'.
AT HITTING ONLY
Error feels right, no way he would get to home if third caught that  Hell he might've been out it third catches the throw
You have subscribed to Bucco Facts.  Did you know that Bryan Reynolds is, in fact, YHWH?
So I guess you didn't watch baseball from 2013-2015 where we pretty much had a sellout every game
This division is a one team race until our offense can steal some of you guys‚Äô devil magic lol
I mean the white sox have the 2nd best offense next to whoever gets to play the white sox on any given day
Gio has massively regressed out of nowhere. Lynn hasn‚Äôt looked right since coming back from injury. Even Kopech looks beatable.   The price you pay when giving up on Vince Velasquez
Gm
Only for McCutchen to eventually re-sign with the Pirates
I was thinking today about how that trade is maybe the most franchise altering trade we‚Äôve had in decades. Imagine where our team would have been the last couple years if we had this guy in center field. 2021? 110 games? More? I‚Äôd bet we‚Äôd have some more marquee free agent interest too.
It wasn‚Äôt the middle. 7-8-9 had 10 of the Pirates 19 hits
I like to think I‚Äôm very in tune with baseball but then I peak over at the Pirates rotation and I‚Äôm just like ‚Äúthere are pictures so they must be real people.‚Äù
Damn, are we NL central bros?
Honestly I just want McCutchen to have fun.  Your owner is shit but McCutchen deserves fun baseball.
I don‚Äôt want to be around anymore
UNSUBSCRIBE
Bro somehow never seen the Cueto highlight
No way man give it some time, I really feel like this could be an exciting race this summer.  White Sox are a mess though lol, but who knows
I mean that‚Äôs not true about either thing. Giolito was bad last year. Really since the end of sticky tack. And literally had an ad campaign about how he was once the worst pitcher in baseball.   And Lynn was pretty good the second half of last year and did well against the Astros in his first start.   All that said, they suck
Gm
GM!
See, that‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt make deals with Pirates.
Keller and Contreras are worth knowing. But the rest, eh, I feel the same.
Luis Robert, Benetti, and Stone are the only things that keep me watching.
Gm
Hondo Ohnaka has entered the chat.
I think most people know who Rich Hill is too.
if you throw a 78 mph pitch it should probably not go straight
No offense but this is just a kid that hasn't learned to protect the strike zone. None of those called strikes really looked that egregious. I'm guessing this is just Jerry Dipoto trying to save face for bringing the kid up before he was ready and starting his service time clock for nothing.  You can't be rocking a .190 BA with no power for very long. Also woof that 61 ops+
I was flipping through the games that are on, said to myself "Oh Julio is batting", and this was the first pitch I saw  I'm not saying I made this homer, but....
40/40 tracker  Home Runs: 2/40 (1 today)  Steals: 3/40 (1 today)
I love him so much
JU-LI-
This dude is a star
Dudes so good.   Those away jerseys sure are nice too.
Umps hosing him on strike calls today, and my man is still crushing.
That fan tried to catch that hr ball like it was a football.  He is going to have a naaassty strawberry.  Hope Kwan tossed him the ball cuz wow that sucks.
That‚Äôs our guy
Julio is a perfect human being.
5 tool player right here
Classic ump ball.
such a pretty swing
JULIOOOOOO
The camera angle makes it look straighter than it actually went, I think it did have a bit of right to left break on it, but that's definitely not a pitch you want to end up in the strike-zone.
I actually think more people should throw Julio 78 mph pitches in the middle of the zone, but I'm slightly biased.
meatball alert!
I heard he‚Äôs only good in the first inning
Thank you for reminding me of this üòÇü§£
Probably my favorite pasta ever
Hey keep watching why don‚Äôt ya;)
Fishfan bad.
Thank you üôè
On track for 40/60
outstanding work!!
-OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoooOooooooOOOOOOOOO
Eh. We wear em soo much I get kinda tired of them. Not even true away jerseys, just alternates.  We could use a 5th, rarely seen one along with our sunday creamy bois. The gray was useful. I vote for that super dark black we had in the early 2000s.
I miss gray :(
They really are, the navy blue/teal/silver just work so well together while still being emblematic of the Pacific Northwest as a whole. Also love that it‚Äôs not a particularly common combo utilized by other teams (like red/white/blue).
Not as bad as last year but it has happened quite a bit already this year. He is much better at the start of this year at punishing misses though
He‚Äôs been bad both sides tbf. At least he is consistently bad.
Did you not see strike 1 at his chin?
Did you miss the first strike?
You want some üßÄ with that üç∑ ?
Ump was in the mood for Italian I guess
I've been to two games now where he's hit a homerun off the first pitch.
Honestly, kinda the plan. I've needed to watch more baseball that doesn't make me sad/mad (not Marlins), and I've been tuning into the Mariners a lot for some reason.
As the kids say ‚Äúthat‚Äôs pretty lit‚Äù
-oooOOOoooOOhhhhhhHOHOHOHOHhohoho!!!!  (üôè haha I thought no one would pick me up!)
Oh man, the black was iconic. I can envision Ichiro legging an infield single in it right now.
Did you miss the whole previous at bat?
Can‚Äôt say we are here to not make you sad and mad cuz that‚Äôs Mariner baseball. But we are trying
Fellow sea dwelling fan, we welcome you. Sailors and Marlins are essentially brothers anyway.

Hey at least nowadays we're fun and frustrating, instead of boring and frustrating
Brothers set bait and hook to catch each other so that they can taxidermy each other and end up on the wall of a dentists office??
This is the equivalent of staring down the defender after an ankle breaker then hitting the shot
The panic from Blowers lol
lmaoooo he got caught unaware but the throw was really good
"double em up, Double Em Up, DOUBLE EM UP. Oh was that it? There you go"  Poor Blowers was having flashbacks with that one
Hahaha he holds up the 2 to Julio, I‚Äôm pretty sure he thought there were 2 outs
So were Blue Jays fans just yanking our chains about Teo's defense? Because he honestly looks decent so far
Man if this guy could get an exemption to take some Adderall or Vyvanse I legitimately think he‚Äôd be viewed as slightly above average defensive outfielder
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfkdZ3tXFSs&t=13s
But I was told by Jays fans his defense was literally worse than Jesse Winker
They doubt his defense they see what happens üò§
In result yes, but Teo got caught staring at the clouds on this one, too ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ
‚ÄúOh that was it?‚Äù
When did something like this happen before? (I'm not doubting you, I just missed the reference.)
I didn't see that until you pointed it out üòÇ
This clip encapsulates what could be so frustrating with his defense. He just reacts slowly to plays and gets bad jumps because it looks like he's just not fucking paying attention out there. It made him a subpar baserunner too. Not because he lacks speed but he just makes too many airhead mistakes.  Still love the guy tho. Impossible not to.
No? Stats more or less bear it out.  2018 - 11th percentile OAA  2019 - 15th percentile OAA  2020 - 10th percentile OAA  2021 - 40th percentile OAA  2022 - 14th percentile OAA  Like, I love Teo, but he is horrendous defensively.
No he‚Äôs legitimately a butcher. He has these stretches in the early season where it looks like it gets better and then you‚Äôre suddenly in July wondering why he‚Äôs taking such awful routes and completely unable to catch anything that‚Äôs not a can of corn
His defensive metrics (for whatever they're worth) have consistently been down on him relative to how much athleticism he brings. There have been reports since the trade that he put effort into improving his defense before the season began and it's possible he has legitimately improved.
I mean maybe the trade lit a fire under him, but we definitely weren't yanking your chain, he is not great defensively
The thing is, he has a good arm and can run.  But just loses focus sometimes and one screw up snowballs into a bad couple weeks of fielding.  He definitely can be serviceable defensively but it‚Äôs probably not very likely.
This clip literally shows one of his typical brain farts. He‚Äôs just a dumb player.   Has an elite arm and he‚Äôs faster than he looks in the OF but has terrible instincts.
The season is young, my friend. You will love him for the mammoth HRs, swagger and dugout vibes, but his defense will give you fits (and the occasional baserunning blunder as well).
I mean you're defending Teoscarnandez on a play where he forgot the outs and got lucky catching Ramirez stealing with his head down.
[https://twitter.com/DownToBlack/status/1606636989629054978?s=20](https://twitter.com/DownToBlack/status/1606636989629054978?s=20)
When we told you he was a defensive liability out there it's not that he's that bad out there. I swear he just doesn't give a fuck defensively.
Not sure but the way he was speaking it just feels like he's had this experience before when he used to play First Base
I will always upvote irrefutable evidence.
Oh oh! Someone pull Jesse winkers stats from the last few years!
He hasn't *burned* us with a banana route yet, but his jumps certainly remain an opportunity for improvement.
I genuinely hope so, love the guy and hope he does well for you!
It's been more or less the opposite of that so far, aside from one game.  Including the dugout vibes. He gave Sam Haggerty a wedgie. In front of everybody.
As long as he hustles after making a mistake he‚Äôll be an improvement over Winker, who was hurt all season apparently.
That is horrendous. Mitch Haniger would never..
He has actually been really really good out there to start the year. Not just the arm, but he has had a few really good running catches into the gap and coming forward for balls.  I don‚Äôt expect it to continue all season long but it‚Äôs been a nice surprise.
Maybe he‚Äôs got ADD.
I can totally see that and not just from this play. But he has been legitimately defensively good for a week, for whatever that's worth.
But what is evidence in the face of our anecdotes?
I can only pull stats from last year, but here they are:   2022 - bad
Somehow he had 3rd percentile OAA last season, I'm surprised that it's possible to be worse
Unless he's truly changed, he is going to absolutely dog plays and baserunning at some point.   I love Teo but consistent effort was never his strongest suit
That's the big problem with Teo though is the lack of hustle. Somebody will hit it into the corner and he's just slow jogging to the ball while the runner gets to third.
Yeah, it gets worse as the year goes on
I for one always downvote evidence and let feelings lead the discussion
Sources check out
It's pretty impressive that Kyle Schwarber managed to be even worse.
monkey never cramp! mune ü•∞
News you can use
Give me a tv show hosted by her and Mr. Kim where they argue about Korea vs Japan for an hour every day.
No
The catching position is becoming more and more stacked offensively. Feels like the days of "anything offensively is bonus " are all but gone sans a few teams.
I actually really like Smith's game. I think he is the second best catcher and the best offensive. But let's be honest, when JT is no longer the best catcher, it will probably be because of that goofy ah catcher in Baltimore.
Realmuto is the clear #1  Adley #2  Smith #3  Then you got an interesting mix of Trevino/Kirk/Murphy in the 4-6 spots in any order
Offensively the best.  Overall, no.
Did they trade for Realmuto?
He's good but I'd much rather have Realmuto or Rutschman.
No disrespect to Smith, but its definitely Realmuto and then a huge power gap between 2nd.
The Phillies, then the Orioles, then the Dodgers
Offensively, I think so.   How much should that matter for catchers? Not sure. I‚Äôm biased as hell obviously because I watch him every day. Realmuto sure is good though too and probably better behind the plate.   Adley could be really good too. But let‚Äôs give it a while before we start calling him the best. So far so good but it takes time to develop a track record and a lot of young guys end up not doing it.
I think he has an okay argument for 1. He has as many 20+ HR seasons as JT in half the seasons. Realmuto definitely the better defensive catcher though.
Am I missing something? JT is obviously the best when factoring in defense, but Smith put up a better batting average than Adley last year and has actual major league experience (playoff included) under his belt. People who say Adley are on the hype train and clearly haven‚Äôt been watching Will this season who is raking harder than he ever has previously.  Adley could be better in time, and may be better defensively (I don‚Äôt watch enough O‚Äôs games to compare), but it seems far fetched to call him #2 right now.
JT/ Adley 1-2 depending on how the season goes. (I'd take Adley, but I'm biased).   (Big Gap)  Everyone else.
Nada
Smith is pretty good offensively for his position, but there‚Äôs no way he‚Äôs a better all around catcher than JTR or even Adley
You'd think the run we scored on his pass ball last night and all of the stolen bases we've had off of him would remind people why catching defense is important
Please send help our way
I'm curious how Alvarez will fare. His defense may not be great, but he has a really good arm. If his defense is bad, I wonder how good he has to be offensively to be the best, y'know? Realmuto and Adley are both very good on both sides. Does he have to be Piazza basically? Having a second bat like Alonso would be incredible for the Mets who really lack power hitters beyond Pete.
if Cal replicates his 2022 this year, he's probably up there with the 4-6 group
If Trevino was a pittsburgh pirate people are ranking him in the 20s
How dare you disrespect Victor ü•ï ini
I'd take Rutschman over him.
What about Adley?
This is the way.
Definitely better defensively. Best blocker/pitch framer in the game.  (based on the new stats) A great bat, just needs to hit lefties better. Adley had a much better OBP than Smith (.362 vs .343) and a closer average (.254 vs .260 avg). Adley stole 4 bases to Will's 1. Adley gave the Os 1.9 WPA to Smith's 0.9. Adley had 1.1 more WAR last year (5.2 vs 4.1) in almost 2 months less time.  [https://stathead.com/baseball/player-comparison.cgi?request=1&sum=0&player\_id1=rutscad01&p1yrfrom=2022&player\_id2=smithwi05&p2yrfrom=2022&type=b](https://stathead.com/baseball/player-comparison.cgi?request=1&sum=0&player_id1=rutscad01&p1yrfrom=2022&player_id2=smithwi05&p2yrfrom=2022&type=b)  A comparison of the two last year.  So the only part that you could argue would be postseason numbers. As you said Adley doesn't have any, yet. But if your looking for a better catcher for 162 games Adley is it. We'll see about the postseason later this year.
"Anything offensively is bonus" only applies when the catcher is actually good at defense
He‚Äôs not the absolute best but he‚Äôs definitely up there. The framing skills really elevate him
Any day of the week. He‚Äôs also younger and his skills and knowledge of the position will continue to grow more than Smiths. Id also take realmuto
He‚Äôll pass JT eventually
I think you meant OBP not OPS up there. .362 OPS would be uhhhhh not good
Yea might as well have Norris back at this point
I did, thx. Fixed.
Bet that guy regrets telling him to swing
ü§å
That is a sexy swing
Not quite a splash, but god damn that was a spicy meatball
Praise be the bats
Vinnie P, baby!
Dude is going to be the best 1b in the league in no time. Such a great presence at the plate
ü§åüèª
And that‚Äôs why he should be starting
***bitches love him***
When they talk about how bitches love Sosa, it's me. I'm the bitches.
Man's about to get a lot more playing time, hope he keeps raking
Trading for him was such a good move, as others have said, with our injuries going on he needs to be more than a bench bat
That pitcher just died inside lol
That bat drop gave me Vietnam flashbacks to the ball he hit in game 6 of the World Series last year
Cardinals made a crucial mistake trading him for mediocre middle reliever
First pitch of the inning home run by a pinch hitter...
I 'memba him! I hope he does get an opportunity to start.
Greatest power hitting Sosa in MLB history?
Well he‚Äôs probably gonna be starting a lot more now
TBF that time he crushed the red bull can was metal as fuck
Cards had to because he nearly killed an ump...  Edman is a better shortstop anyway.
Anytime I want to smile I just think of him beaning that ump.
Trea Turner is also a better shortstop
Luis Robert Jr chasing Reynolds‚Äôs for the home run lead
Fire Dick Mountain and VV into the sun
In the midst of my ‚Äúit‚Äôs so over‚Äù I found within me, an invincible ‚Äúwe are so fucking back‚Äù
Please baseball gods, keep Luis healthy this season
Soooo....maybe pitching a slow breaking ball to Luis Robert JR is a bad idea.
he has never been more back
A full healthy season of Luis Robert would be something üëÄ
With his defensive WAR and a hot stick through the year he could crack 7+
Cut it out, we‚Äôre trying to enjoy Cutch‚Äôs homecoming over here.
But his WAR is overblown! He just made a couple good catches!
Luis is gonna live up to the old ‚ÄúCuban Mike Trout‚Äù moniker by putting up MVP numbers in a losing season.
You guys have Sox legend Vince Velasquez??? Hell yeah.
Can we send our entire pitching staff (minus Cease) with them?
he's the type of player who has the potential to crack 10+  obviously unlikely, but the talent is there
Vinnie Velo baby
I‚Äôll never forget that one game he shut down the angels and looked like a star
I'll never forget that one game where he played left field in extra innings while Roman Quinn pitched.
Silly
Sonny Gray spinning it on a cloudy day
Man that last curveball was so nasty.
we‚Äôre gonna find a way to waste a 13 strikeout performance now aren‚Äôt we
...There were few to no clouds in the sky at all today in Minneapolis.
Thank christ we didn't. Took extras but got the job done!
Idk man April Astros are usually ass anything can happen
We tried, but Farm boy secured the W
We are so fucking back
Giolito looks cooked. Friedman definitely gonna sign him next year
PAY THIS MAN...or someone else will.
The White Sox really love giving up home runs.
The Pirates will defeat shorter game times simply by scoring -- and allowing -- double digit runs.
This team is so much fun compared to last year.   Minus Rich Hill
I'll never get over the fact that we traded him away for a less than a season rental of Cutch.
Pay the man nutgobblin.
he wants his fucking money  also rip giolito
Bednar out in the bullpen doing a Yosemite Sam celly.
This feels like a playoff game
The marbles don‚Äôt lie
As an Angels fan living in SoCal the Pirates look to be my must watch on MLB TV this year. What an exciting team.
My Barts are officially alarmed
Get that Buc his bucks
Too bad someone convinced Hill today is an off day, and he should throw bp.
This team has marbles.
Clear the deck!
Bob please pay this man what he wants so I get to see more of this over the next few years.
For fucks sake Bob pay this man!
He had 6 RBIs today.
Sign da ting
so glad I drafted the nl home run champ in fantasy
The Pirates will win the NL Central... and I called this at the end of last season and got shat on in the comments.
Either Pirates pony up an extension close to market value for him or he's gone for an almost Soto like haul.  Both teams and Pirates are probably cursing themselves for not moving faster on him. I hope Pirates extend him somehow. They are not that far to competing.
The opt out just got 3 years earlier!
White sox pitching seems suspect based on recent results
This guy is singlehandedly carrying my hitters in fantasy baseball.
This trade is gonna hurt.
I heart sank a little when I read ‚ÄúBryan Reynolds extends‚Äù
Yankees are gonna pay this man so much fucking money
As a Phillies fan I still love hearing the announcers homer call  "CLEAR THE DECK, CANNONBALL COMING!!"
Gotcha...gotcha ‚úãüòèü§ö

Gio, Lynn, Kopech, our entire bullpen (until Liam is back, I love you Liam). Cloning Cease needs to be top priority for science and the white Sox.

Reynolds in LF and Marte in RF for the Mets?   A Pirates fans nightmare.
So does Rich Hill
Most generous team in baseball.
MLB: ‚Äúwe‚Äôre trying to shorten games! Stop scoring so many runs!‚Äù  Buccos: ‚Äúi‚Äôll fuckin do it again‚Äù
It was still only 2:48!!
üçÜüèî
GM
The disrespect to dick mountain smh
Whats wrong with Ritchie boy no offense but do the pirates even have a better starting pitcher option?
Now we have both üòä
The craziest part is the other piece in that trade, Kyle Crick, had a great year the year we acquired him. So we basically already "won" the trade before Reynolds even established himself in the majors.
Still love the guy but really happy they didn‚Äôt give him a big extension after ‚Äò21
I'm out of the loop
We‚Äôd be glad to have you, great commentary team as well just as a bonus
Literally they have to keep him, improve pitching a bit and boom competitors
The Pirates just swept three games from the Red Sox, too.  So it might also have a little bit to do with a few of the Pirates young guys being hot right now (plus Bryan Reynolds, who has been good for a few season now).
Same lol
We know it won't be the cubs at least
Greg Brown is a gem
A Philadelphian with taste! I didn't think it was possible, but you're clearly a cut above the rest. GG!  (I'm going to get downvoted to oblivion, aren't I?)
Nah, Rich Hill exists.
Mets fans and trying not to make every situation about them.... impossible.
Nobody cares about the Mets
If he joined the Mets he'd get injured straight away
Can confirm
Man makes meatballs so good the Italians are ashamed of what they cook.
Keller, Contreras, and Oviedo are all better.

And punched a pervert. Pirates legend Kyle Crick
Nope
üçÜ üèîÔ∏è just wants healthcare coverage til he qualifies for Medicare.
He pitched better than Lucas did today
Nah, Rich Hill isn't going to pitch the innings that Giolito is going to, making Giolito much worse.  Crazy how much he's fallen off.
I thought that was just New Yorkers in general
You‚Äôre right. When someone brings up ‚Äúpay this man or someone else will‚Äù it was silly to mention the Mets and their broke ownership.
sorry that was poorly worded I meant more so like do Pirates have any minor league pitching that are far along? my understanding is it‚Äôs fairly position player heavy
Ha, yeah I remember he had a feud with the guy we don‚Äôt talk about anymore.
I believe that as long as you play in like 1 MLB game you get lifetime healthcare.
Not really. 4+ IP, 8 H, 7 ER vs 4 IP, 12 H, 7 ER. Both were equally bad.
Worst pitcher in baseball to ace to worst pitcher in baseball. Truly a rollercoaster
Mets Yankees dodgers
It works with Leafs fans too. So by proxy, Toronto.
It's silly that anytime a player is brought up, mets fans attempt to claim them lol
Luis Ortiz might be, and honestly I'd take Blake Ceaderlind over Hill right now. Probably 2-3 guys in AAA who are better.
They do have options in the minors. Unfortunately, since they‚Äôre paying Hill whatever they‚Äôre paying him they‚Äôll keep running him out there for at least half a season.
You are eligible for it, but you still have to pay for it. Unless they have that major league salary it's probably unaffordable.
(Astros coming soon?)
Padres fans added themselves to this list
Sorry, but I had some fun times with jay fans in the 2015 ALCS
Honestly their cap has been fucked for a while, I don‚Äôt think they can really do that.
Is cederlind highly rated? I haven‚Äôt heard much about him the past couple of years?
I have to assume it would be no different than paying your portion and the MLBPA/MLB picks up the rest, like any other job. Only in this case MLB does it after you leave.
You‚Äôre talking to the king of mess
I, for one, support throwing 93 down the pipe versus our hitters.

Legalize Franch 4-3
Then next at bat gets pinch hit for by IKF‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ certified Aaron Boone moment
He turned that poop into wine
Franchy Cordero is the greatest baseball player of all time and that's an understatement
I swear if Franchy starts mashing for the Yankees I'm out
And he gets rewarded by getting IKF to pinch hit for him?
The US Supreme Court has made a groundbreaking decision in favor of baseball lovers across the country. In a 4-3 vote, the Court has ruled to legalize the use of Franch in all 30 ballparks. This decision marks a significant shift in American culture and sets a new precedent for the use of utility outfielders in the American sport.  Franch, which is a portmanteau of the words "Fuckin'" and "ranch," has been a popular outfielder for years, especially among reddit users. However, its status as an above replacement level player has been a contentious issue, with some arguing that it detracts from the purity of the game. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court has now spoken, and it seems that Franch is here to stay. So, grab your peanuts, cracker jacks and get ready to drizzle them in the newfound freedom of Franch!  The Associated Press reached out for comment from the eponymous Cordero but has not recieved as response as of the time of publication
They had a runner on 3rd and needed contact.   Cordero hits nice long dingers, but dude strikes out a ton. He's basically another Gallo.  I understand wanting somebody like IKF there, who at least sorta makes contact.
Codero has a 174 avg and 306 slugging against lefties
his real name is Franchy Hoyabembe!
I mean, it is unlikely he's actually good now/they made him good, but for this reason it would be extra funny.
Yeah because he strikes out too much. He's just another Gallo.
IKF doesn‚Äôt have a hit this year
IKF is awful against lefties and they are supposed to be using Hicks against lefties according to Boone's own interviews
> but for this reason it would be extra funny.  hard disagree
Fly ball, ground ball, anything like that might have scored the run. Not another strikeout from Cordero, even if he hit it far earlier in the game.  Also the Orioles brought in a lefty reliever.  You can maybe argue Hicks could have been in there, but he's also bad.
Sure but that says less about IKF and more about how little they trust Hicks.
Ozzie Ozzie Ozzie!
Eh, looks like they‚Äôre both making light of it now
Anderson's twitter timeline is certainly interesting.

Yikes
I know you‚Äôre just trying to be edgy and talk shit, but the whole DHCMT fiasco was really dumb. I‚Äôm glad mlb doesn‚Äôt test for it anymore (edit: changed their testing thresholds, possibly?), but a lot of minor leaguers probably had their careers arbitrarily fucked up because of bad tests.
It's just how people talk in real life?

Jomboy posted a breakdown of TA getting ejected because he was mad that Webb quick pitched him, jawing from the dugout, etc. Webb responded to the Jomboy video (which basically said TA had a right to throw a fit) with just ‚Äúlol‚Äù.

Might be the year we see a Robert MVP
...Are we allowed to hit home runs? I thought we only liked to hand them out
the JR has given him power
Starts?
Well he just hit another one 28 minutes later, so he's making a case for it.
We can dish em and hit em
Holy shit. No wonder he re-signed there
The MVP chants were just ü•≤
I was wondering if/hoping umps would allow these types of moments to still happen with the new pitch clock. Love to see it
Cutch wearing a Pirates uni is just... correct.
I love these moments in sports! I'm sure Pirates fans are thrilled to have him back and the ovation was fantastic.
Awesome! He's a classic great dude. And you love seeing one of the most fun & beautiful parks packed like that.
And his mom sang the national anthem - very nice welcome home
That Pirates uni looks so good
I know this point is made ad nauseum but the Pirates are such a waste of potential thanks to their dog shit owner.   - Rabid sports town with great fans  - Beautiful park   - By all accounts a lovely city to live in and raise your kids  - One of the oldest franchises in North American sports   And that greedy dickhead just fucks it all up.
Damn that makes ME emotional.
Incredible moment for someone who means so much to the City! Also thanks to the umps, pitcher and catcher for making it happen!
pirates fans are awesome
Pittsburgh has such a beautiful park. One day we‚Äôll get to watch some playoff ball there again‚Ä¶   Hopefully
He just never really looked right wearing a different jersey. Good to see him back in Pittsburgh
MLB‚Äôs [highlight clip](https://mlb-cuts-diamond.mlb.com/FORGE/2023/2023-04/07/6401e592-5e681aa2-cc596eea-csvm-diamondx64-asset_1280x720_59_16000K.mp4) from the broadcast.
Man this gave me goosebumps
He's back, baby! Got a single while looking like he was fighting back tears too.
Bro with that crowd how can they be cheap??
I love seeing PNC park packed like that to greet Cutch returning. What an ovation, I think Cutch got a bit emotional with how much support/excitement they greeted him with.
Haven‚Äôt seen a pop like that since Triple H returned from injury in 2002
There‚Äôs no crying in baseball
This transcends a game
AJ Burnett in the house as well, cheering Cutch.
He deserves every bit of that
That‚Äôs just awesome right there. Can‚Äôt even imagine how that feels.
Who‚Äôs cutting onions
furries
Pirates fans are good and deserve good things.
Can't wait for the furry tweet this year
That gave me the feels.   Not the same but when Freddie Freeman came back to Truist last year w/LA and he got a nearly 2 min.standing ovation.
38 WAR and MVP by age 28.  He looked to be on the HoF track.  Still a great career.
He looks so frickin cool in that jersey.
Man, you love to see it. Cutch has always been one of my favorite players, I‚Äôll always be happy he got to wear the orange and black for a little bit.
I will always love Cutch on the Pirates.
Brings back memories of last year when Albert came back. I hope every fan gets to experience this feeling one day
The furry man himself
this is awesome. i also genuinely think the pirates could have a decent year which would be awesome
Damn that place was electric. Love Cutch so much
Ok random thought but this got me thinking how much i love the Pirates branding as a franchise. It's just so iconically MLB. Which got me thinking about what a shame it is that so many of the franchises like that are generally down in the mud with shit owners. Pirates, Orioles, Reds, White Sox. Those franchises just feel so baseball. Unlike the Astros, Rays(though they do have shit owners, at least it's a good FO) Rangers, Angels, Blue Jays, Mariners, etc. that often are more relevant and/or good owners nowadays. Those teams feel so much less iconic and traditionally baseball than the newer, lamer feeling ones
Witnessing this live was special.
That was so cool!  White Sox team/catcher extremely graceful moving out from behind the plate too and letting the moment breath.  All around a classy, touching, and enjoyable.  Beautiful park too!
Those jerseys are ice cold
Being at this game was something really fucking special today man.
retire 22
Just like Jason Kendall, Cutch was almost the only reason to watch the Pirates for serveral years.
Furries
Dude. Chills. Pittsburgh really loves this guy. It‚Äôs so cool to see him in black and yellow again
Yinz are happy to see him in black and gold again.
This is fucking cool
Love shit like this. Albert last year, Cutch this year. Good on the umps letting this play out
Fans should‚Äôve all dressed up like furries for Cutch.
i haven't seen pnc this packed in a decade
Furries
I love baseball
He just looks so right in the black and yellow.
I love baseball
Ahhh, the baseball feels. Cutch was fun in pinstripes and we'd gladly welcome him in retirement to an old timers game, but seeing him in a Pirates uni feels just so right. What a dude
That‚Äôs a strike
That's a pitch clock violation.
That's at least three pitch clock violations
Legend
Some great fans over in Pittsburgh, good for Cutch he deserves it.
He better not have gotten called for delay of game
that's what i wished for Correa very jealous and for once great job Pittsburgh
:)
Seeing Cutch in Black and Yellow again is just fantastic.   So glad he got to go home
‚ÄúNothing has changed‚Äù
This makes me feel better
How was his at bat?
Tuck that back pocket in bro
Shitty management should have never traded that man away. Then they get to cash in on nostalgia signing him to a lesser contract at the end of his career
Yeah man, I was there when he returned to PNC for the first time after being traded to the giants and it was almost identical to this. Packed crowd, emotional tribute, and a looong ovation when he came to the plate. Pittsburgh sports fans do extremely well by their beloved athletes
ü•≤ü•≤ü•≤
Plus you get to play in that ballpark for most the games
Was at this game and everyone was excited for him to come up to bat. His mom sang the anthem and got huge cheers
This and the furries
I wish he had been on SF longer than he was. He wasn‚Äôt here that long but he was a bright spot when he was here. His walk off game against LA will always be legendary here
for real.
In an early broadcast Greg Brown mentioned that there is a rule in place to allow these moments to happen, it‚Äôs called the ‚ÄúMcCutchen Rule‚Äù
I‚Äôd wager they‚Äôll probably just let it slide. ‚ÄúSpirit of the game‚Äù exception or whatnot.
‚ÄúHe comes to the plate with a full count, as the pitcher has 3 violations and Cutch has 2 after the emotional tribute‚Äù
Romo started his inning with two automatic balls‚Ä¶ in a spring training game one-day sign send off
Agreed. Hate to say it but seeing him in pinstripes just seemed..off.  Cutch belongs in the black and gold, just like Jeter belonged in pinstripes and Ortiz belonged in the Boston grays.
It is. Thanks for noticing. Hope you get Ruth back
I loved having him on the brew crew, but he absolutely belongs in Pittsburgh
We are, he's our only light since Bonds
That backdrop........‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è  My home.
So glad he‚Äôs not on the Brewers anymore ü•≤
WOW really?  That's super great.
Yes she‚Äôs sung it before at PNC Park. Always a treat
And goddamn did she own it
Some of the best uniforms in baseball for my money. With the Brewers getting the revamp a couple years ago, it's a division of nice uniforms
Not only all you said but he got to have a taste of what being in the playoffs was like with the three Wild Card berths then decided to flush it down the toilet and strip payroll.
It's a shame. I was watching the game with my father in law today and he was just going on and on about how bad the ownership is. And he's right it is a shame. But I said to him, there's nothing we can do about it. Let's just enjoy what we can. And I'm super excited for this next hopefully window of young guys that can help us bring a championship back to the Burgh!
This is 100% correct and every single fan here knows it and says it. It‚Äôs such a waste.
Phenomenal history too. The Pirates won a shitload back in the day
I hate these hot takes especially from fans of teams like the dodgers that really have no clue.  1. Bob nutting sucks. But even if the pirates maxed out their payroll they‚Äôd still be 100 million behind what the Mets or dodgers can spend..and have no margin for error. One bad signing and you‚Äôve basically destroyed the franchise for ten years.   2. The fanbase is small. We are in a unique situation of being really boxed in by other teams with no real secondary markets. Where Cincy has Dayton and Louisville, Cleveland has Columbus, and St. Louis had the Midwest, we have Youngstown and Morgantown. Our closest comparable is probably oakland.  I mean there is more I don‚Äôt want to go into but ultimately the baseball financial system is broken. Owners could spend more in some of these smaller markets but we‚Äôve seen so many times teams try to buy a bit of success, like Cincinnati did the last several years, and it doesn‚Äôt work within the budgetary constraints of the franchise
Great city, just watch out if you hit up a women's room and you hear a guy with a walking boot come in
The whole city is sports crazy....if the bucs would only put a good product on the field consistently this scene would be all the time.
Pirate fans intimidating Cueto until he dropped the ball is an all time playoff moment
>Absolutely beautiful.
Bob Nutting
BIG pop
He [threw the first pitch](https://mlb-cuts-diamond.mlb.com/FORGE/2023/2023-04/07/d4a1cc28-250c3ebf-7d7776a7-csvm-diamondx64-asset_1280x720_59_16000K.mp4) to Russell Martin!
The best AJ moment...  https://youtu.be/_o-m0lhBh08
aaah you beat me to it
Awww shucks, I loved our rivalry with the Cards too. Great knowledgeable fanbase. And one of my favorite caps in baseball.
Series against the Brewers, June 30-July 2.
Shows how absolutely difficult it is to be a Hall of Famer. Either be great for ten years and very good for another 6-10 years or be a white hot inferno and don't fall off a cliff.
Same here. I was quite bummed when we traded him
Hated seeing him leave, but getting Reynolds was a pretty good consolation in the mean time
You‚Äôre right, send Goldy back!
Except Kendall was a royal asshole not worth rooting for.
He played 25 games with the Yankees. He‚Äôs not going to be invited to that. Lol.
He's been worth 6.7 bWAR since 2018.  Bryan Reynolds has been worth 14 in one year less.  I love Cutch as much as the next guy, but the real problem is that Huntington didn't tear it down to the studs in 2017.
When he walked during warm ups and the crowd just didn‚Äôt stop. My eyes were not dry.
My wife is a huge Giants fan. She hates that it‚Äôs the only Giants jersey that I have.
Forgot about them til now. Let's try it again
Named after the Pirate legend himself, Daniel McCutcheon
Hard to play with cameras on the field
He only needed one pitch
Him in those Phillies throwbacks tho...my goodness
Or Longoria wearing the Blue   ~~Please sign him back Stu~~
Not only the pinstripes but totally clean shaven with a face like a baby's butt. Looked so weird.
I swear he's been on the IL for years now
Same with the Phils. I like to think they lent him to us for a few years.
I‚Äôd argue that Pittsburgh, as a city, Al has the best uniforms in sports. If the Pats would go back to the Pat Patriot style, Boston would be close.
I remember being terrified that the Giants would have to face Gerrit Cole in the one game playoff, and wishing we were playing anyone but the Pirates because they were the other team I wanted to win. It obviously worked out for us, but to see that team get stripped for parts was sad.
The "Cue-to" chants into him dropping the ball into the Martin HR is one of the coolest things I've ever seen in baseball.
We had higher payrolls in 16 and 17 I believe. Lots of revisionist history around what happened in that timeframe, not the least of which was cutch going from mvp caliber to below replacement level in 2016
People forget about this part, but you‚Äôre absolutely right. They been bad pretty much for thirty years now, but up until then, they won a fair amount.
No one's asking for them to be a top spender. We're asking for good faith in the pursuit of competitive play.  And one bad signing sinks us for 10 years? It wouldn't, but if so, where would we be? The current Pirates?
The city is broken up to in 3 categories. Non-fan (indifferent), team-haters (lock him up!), and rabid-fans/old timers. We are trying to get more into that 3rd category!
Them trying to do it to a rookie Wacha with the opposite effect was also great.
I would vote for almost any player with 50 WAR in a consecutive decade (assuming otherwise suitable.)  Hall of famers almost always have that.    That's a player who averaged an all-star performance over enough time to leave a legacy.    Dick Allen, Kenny Lofton, Johan Santana, David Cone?  Yes.  Ian Kinsler, Norm Cash, Dwight Gooden, David Wells?  No.
Only if the Marlins send Sandy back
Worthy legend. Very emotional day. Gotta love it
The only reason I know that name is because of that blown call in the 19th inning lol
Pure fire.
Try as you might, you will never be [this cool](https://assets-varnish.triblive.com/2019/07/1471855_web1_1158143522.jpg).
He's probably in Operation Shutdown with Derek Bell
I just enjoy that they have a common color theme in Pittsburgh
Toronto would be *right there* if the Raptors went blue and white.
I will never get over the fact that we had to face MadBum and then CYA Arrieta in back to back years in wild card games.
As a Pirates fan that is and may well be the greatest moment I will ever experience.
Just 16.    Won 98 games in 15, raised payroll by 4 mil then dropped it every year after. It‚Äôs not revisionist history, Nutting is a good for nothing shit bag. I hope his Wigle whiskey distillery burns to the ground when no employees are present
that is some dick allen shit
When I was a kid, it was weird to me when I realized other cities don't do that. Really more cities should.
I think the fact both pitchers were featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated within a year of our WC games says alot about our luck there.
>I hope his Wigle whiskey distillery burns to the ground when no employees are present  he would probably make out like a bandit in insurance.
And worth remembering part of the reason why it dropped in '16-  The Pirates traded Francisco Liriano (17M/yr) and two prospects (Reese McGuire and Harold Ramirez) for Drew Hutchinson. Neither guy really panned out, but still feels pretty bad to just give them away for what was basically nothing.  And what did the Jays do with Liriano the next year? Trade him for future all-star Teoscar Hern√°ndez. We lost value in both players on the ML level and in prospects to dump some contract.
DC does, techncially.
God damn. Imagine if that were a more exciting play at the plate and you just hear some dude talking about concessions or whatever.
God, he's so hot
Great commentary!
Trea literally jogged from first til he was close to 3rd and got the signal to go home.  Dudes stupidly fast
Same stadium the iconic slide went viral in too
This is obviously hilarious from a broadcasting perspective, but I will concede that Bull's BBQ is quite good.
I love how he's barely even dirty. I'd have a big ass dirt+blood stain up my thigh
He's so good x4
Pain.
I really dislike them but I respect how cool of an environment the Bank is. Place was unreal during their playoff run last year. Always love seeing people jazzed about baseball.
Dude just oozes cool
Eh kinda
Was that Harper in the hoodie congratulating him?
He can do better, make him do it again
I need a slow mo
I mean, it‚Äôs Greg Luzinski, so it‚Äôs not just some dude
Call. The. Fucking. Game.
And so cool!
And you had the Bull himself talking about it!
The same passion that gets Philly fans a lot of (sometimes deserved, sometimes undeserved) mockery does lead to pretty electric live stadium experiences.  I strongly urge anyone who happens to be in the Philly area to swallow their hatred of Philly sports teams and Philly fans and just go to a game.  Even at half capacity, it's a pretty excellent experience. If the stadium is full or close to it, it's one of the most unique and incredible experiences in sports.  (And no, there is almost zero chance that any Philly fans will do anything other than jaw at you a little if you're wearing someone else's colors... unless you're drunk and belligerent)
I can only assume he‚Äôs talking about sausages.
I assume a combination of misreading the ball knowing he‚Äôll get to 3rd regardless, and knowing if he misread the ball he was still moving quickly enough to turn it on and score if the ball went to the corner like it did
Maybe there‚Äôs something here to this‚Ä¶
MLB The Show 21 players in shambles
mlb the show legend
27 of the best, worst, but also kind of good while being bad performances.
Effectively wild is the term, I believe.
Jack had the best start of all of our pitchers so far so that confirms balls > strikes.
what are you talking about, i field worse than tee ball
Sometimes throwing a ball into the strike zone is hard. Pitchers really don't try to walk batters in those situations.
pitchers throwing outside the zone doesn't mean that they were *trying* to throw outside the zone or *trying* to walk them  at the end of the day, you're trying to get outs and end the game. lobbing a ball down the middle of the zone is typically not a great way to get outs.
A walk is still infinitely better than a home run in that spot. Any pitcher is trying to get it in the zone there, but major league hitters will blast a meatball. Maybe back when pitchers were hitting you could try it on a pitcher if one came up in that spot (very rare).
Walks can lead to double plays or pickoffs, home runs can‚Äôt
Homerun is a bigger momentum shifter for the other team than a walk  And a walk means there‚Äôs more ways to get outs on the bases. Can‚Äôt do that after a homerun
I get the sentiment, although a walk is clearly better than a homerun. I do hate, however, when pitchers with decent stuff try to paint the corner in those situations. Just aim down the middle and make them hit it.
Pitchers drew 183 walks in 2021, which gives you an idea of how hard it can be (sometimes) to throw strikes.
Not sure I believe what I‚Äôm reading here. Of course a walk is better than a home run. This a baseball thread isn‚Äôt it? üòÇ
i do personally believe that if you are a pitcher who ever throws a leadoff walk in this scenario, you should be fired and executed (particularly if it's in like 4 or 5 pitches).  blows my mind when pitchers are afraid to throw strikes in situations that they clearly should be attacking hitters.  their literal one job is to go in and pitch aggressively.  if you can't do that you don't belong in the MLB.
also, pitchers don't want to give up home runs for their stats
Why is a walk better?
everyone in this thread is treating this scenario like its binary - the pitcher will either give up a walk or a home run.  even the best hitters in the game do not make solid contact on every meatball over the plate they see, let alone hit homers on all of them.  personally i think the worst thing a relief pitcher can do with a multi-run lead is go in and walk people (especially a leadoff walk).  i'd rather them be aggressive and challenge the hitter in the zone than try to paint the corners or get them to chase and give the batter a free pass.  even if the hitter crushes it it's more likely to be a double or a single than a homer - or they could just line out directly to a fielder.  it's probably the single thing i get frustrated with the most when watching a game - a reliever comes in with a multi run lead and issues a leadoff walk.  IMO if a professional pitcher does that he should lose his game check and be sent to play for the pirates.
Because a home run is a run, a walk is not. This is not advanced analytics here.
Can get a double play.
https://gregstoll.com/~gregstoll/baseball/stats.html#H.-1.9.0.1.0.0  Historically, visiting team up by 2 going with a runner on first in the bottom of the 9th wins 83.53% of the time. Bases empty but 1 run lead means they only win 81.77% of the time. It's not much, but it's not nothing
Obviously a walk is worse than an out, but the risk of a home run vs a walk on a meatball is too high to serve up the meatball. A runner on first goes the opportunity to get a DP, pick off, and other things to help, especially when with a 2+ run lead that runner doesn't matter as much if you can get the next three out.
Cool it with your fancy sabermetrics
with a 2-run led your goal should be to prevent the tying run from ever coming to plate.  obviously a homerun brings the tying run to the plate, but no one would ever willingly throw meatballs on every pitch.  but if you're an MLB pitcher being brought into a 2-run game at the bottom of the 9th, odds are that you can at least throw a decent fastball for a strike.  i'd take my chances on the player failing to go yard over just giving them a free base because i won't throw strikes.  and even if they do go yard it's like you said - with a 2+ run lead that solo homer doesn't matter as much if you can get the next three out.
Yes, but a runner on first is still a potential run vs the home run that is an actual scored run.  MLB pitchers don't pitch to contact.
> Yes, but a runner on first is still a potential run vs the home run that is an actual scored run.  the home run itself is also potential (not actual) in this scenario though because like i said, it isn't binary where it's either a walk or a homerun.  it's either a walk or whatever the hitter can do with a pitch in the zone.  which could be a homerun.  it could also be a double or a line out or a popout.  it could also be a swing and miss and help the pitcher get into a more favorable count.  there are a lot of outcomes that are way better than just throwing stuff out of the zone that the batter doesn't bite at.  and plenty of mlb pitchers do pitch to contact (although typically not late game relievers).
Except the pitcher isn't trying to walk the batter. A pitcher is trying to pitch a strike there to get a called strike or a swing and a miss.  Just because the pitcher throws it out of the zone, doesn't mean he meant to - pitching is hard.
your logic is flawed and also getting off track of this post.  i'm not talking about what anyone is or isn't trying to do.   all i've said is that if you throw nothing but balls, you're probably going to walk the guy unless he helps you out.  if you throw nothing but strikes, you will either strike him out or force the batter to beat you (and in his efforts he may still get out).  with a multi run lead and no one on, i'd prefer the option that more often results in an out (even if it also produces solid contact some of the time).
Most pitchers in most situations are attempting to throw strikes. You seem to think every pitch is going to go exactly where the pitcher wants it to.
Steve Cohen has demanded that baseballs now use Mets orange instead of Phillies red for stitching.
Core memory unlocked for the kid that caught the ball.  Gotta love baseball.
B I G S T R O N G G U Y
Man that kid that caught that ball was loving it! Not a Mets fan at all but I like seeing stuff like that.
The SNY broadcast is so well done. I know this point is made often, but it bears repeating.
That kid is never gonna forget this day.
That is a spectacular title.
The kid who snagged it is pumped!
That was an amazing catch by the kid and will be one of the greatest memories of his life‚Ä¶ but I still don‚Äôt understand the title
I always knew he could put a ball In the hospital
I liked the Mets a lot better when they were playing Milwaukee!
That‚Äôs clearly National Car Rental
[The Lindor home run from the AB right before this one.](https://mlb-cuts-diamond.mlb.com/FORGE/2023/2023-04/07/36549817-01e528e5-5c7a7bac-csvm-diamondx64-asset_1280x720_59_4000K.mp4)
I don't understand that title. I was expecting to see a 500 ft bomb. Can someone explain what the hell "sends one to New York Presbyterian Hospital" means?
I like this idea. The Phillies and Cards bias has gone on for too long.
70 years from now "Hey, kids, did I ever tell you..." "Yes, grandpa"
"What did you do over April break?"  Funny you asked. *Queues up video*
I caught a batting practice homerun where I had to lean over the rail to snag it when I was 19. The people around me gave me a round of applause and I imagine I'll still be talking about it on my deathbed.
Only time I'll probably ever put this online. 16/17 yrs old at Camden Yards with my best friend during batting practice. Reached back, no look, barehanded grab on a home run while almost falling back over the seats, surrounded by grown men with gloves. Perfect catch that barely hurt, but that could have been adrenaline. Sounds kinda unbelievable but it's one of my favorite baseball memories. This kid caught a real one! This will live with him forever
Lucky kid with the great catch. That is Pete's 150th HR ball to boot
That Big Apple Fade into Big Pete was epic
2 jokes in 1:  The Mets new ad patch is for NYP, and last year after the fight in St.Louis Pete Alonso said "I'm a big strong guy, I can put someone in the hospital" so the title is saying he put the ball in the hospital.
Since nobody likes that huge patch for the hospital on their jersey, maybe the hospital was included in the title just to be intrusive like the patch?  Satire is my best guess lol not exactly sure
I don‚Äôt know, this definitely feels a lot better than whatever THAT was
that was honestly a really good pitch idk how he read that so well
I could get down with some orange stitching
‚ÄúShuddup! You‚Äôre gonna hear it again.‚Äù
Him having 150 already is pretty impressive given that he's only really played 3 "full" seasons(60 games in the COVID year was closer to a third of a season than half of one)
That was us getting shelled in Milwaukee, which feels like tradition at this point.
"THERE I WAS, EXHAUSTED AFTER WALKING TO CITI FIELD in 30 DEGREE SNOW WEATHER WEATHER IN EARLY APRIL"  "grandpa you took the train and it was mid 50s"
"back then we only had 2 world series, not the 40 that we currently have".
If you go by games played he's like top all time for HR in that number of games  Covid 2020 ruined it being the same for seasons
Yeah Baseball Reference has him at 45 HR/162 for his career which is obviously extremely high
Sort of surprised the Royals didn't have him out to do this
Can‚Äôt wait for Jason to give him shit on new heights. Lol
Royals fans: üòß
A bad pitch in baseball but a great bowl in cricket!
I‚Äôm always curious how some first pitches can be botched so bad, especially by athletes of others sports. Is he trying to throw his best heater and just screwed up the release or what? I can shoot a basketball no problem from distance because that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve done for 30+ years. But I‚Äôm also serviceable if you need me to toss a baseball 60ft or toss a football 30yds. The latter two aren‚Äôt no where as impressive, but it‚Äôs almost the same concept with a different object.
At least it wasn't a Baba Booey
Unintentional grounding‚Ä¶
And that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs paid to catch balls, not throw them
I need context as to why Travis Kelce is doing this for Cleveland and not KC
Newwww news is going to be great this next week .
Might be one of the least athletic things I‚Äôve ever seen someone so athletic do
He's not used to letting go of the ball
He used to play QB
That‚Äôs KC for ya
They probably will sooner or later.
I really want to see Patrick throw out a first pitch, I can imagine it would be a really good throw.
This is where they do a opening pitch with Mahomes teaching Travis how to throw the ball
Now we know why.
Alright now
Wonder if any Cricket matches have included a ceremonial first bowl
Ngl based on where he bounced it, that would be a terrible delivery in cricket too, especially if you're a right-handed batsman, since it's basically the equivalent of lobbing a meatball down the middle üòÇ.    Of course, it's a ceremonial first pitch and you're making a joke so it doesn't really matter that much, but eh, might as well add some additional context for folks passing by.
I think most don‚Äôt give a shit. This one felt like he was trying to put some extra heat on it and just fucked up the release point
Most people don't try to throw a baseball as hard as they can (or any ball for that matter) when playing catch so they aren't that used to it is my guess.
noine
He is from Cleveland
The Kelce Brothers are from Westlake, a suburb of Cleveland
I once attended a Royals/Cleveland game in KC in Diamond Club where Kelce was in the Crown Seats ahead of me. So yeah, he‚Äôs from Cleveland
John Wall's was somehow worse.
Went to Cleveland Heights
"Hey dad can I get some advice....."
New neeeeeeews   *New news*   Travis can't throw a baseball
I don't think so, well at least not in Australia. It's usually just the coin toss that they have notable figures for.       Being a British game they can be quite antsy about people on their pitch that are not playing or commentary.
TIL.
Cleveland Heights*
Brag
Didn‚Äôt know that. Okay
Would you say this was new news to you?
My mistake! I looked at place of birth on wiki because I couldn‚Äôt quite remember
It was a Sunday afternoon in the summer, so while I was in some of the best seats in the stadium, I was also in the sun. Such a tragic situation.
Love this stuff. Inject it directly into my veins.
Haven't been able to watch their broadcasts this year but if they do stuff like this and their commentators aren't a total shit show, they can be the best national broadcast just in terms of quality (lack of accessibility not counting)
Between this and the "sounds of the game" stuff they did during last years AppleTV games I actually dont mind them  Just wish they had more of that available
Why don't we have this view in every single game?
Legit thought this was MLB The Show for a moment.
The announcers are much better, too. Really was digging Dontrelle Willis.
This should be on every broadcast
Not new. They actually did it with √Ångel Hern√°ndez [last year.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ulkKKtzfgFA)
That‚Äôs a really impressive view and clarity considering it‚Äôs attached to the umpires head, which is usually located up their own ass. /s
Modern baseball, IMO, would allow us to select views like this whenever we want, even as a PIP. Sort of like how MLBTV allows you to select crowd noise as an audio stream. Would be pretty cool.
That is fucking awesome
Would be even cooler at 60fps
Common Apple TV production crew W, which still never fails to surprise me
Introducing MLB the Ump Show: Road to the Ump Show   Call balls and strikes from a realistic perspective! Make safe and out calls in real time! Eject managers and players! All new graphics, gamers say it‚Äôs so close to the real thing.
Man I‚Äôm almost considering finally getting Apple TV just for the few rangers games + MLS but I just really don‚Äôt need another streaming service lol.  Thank god for the free MLB TV from t mobile this year.
Freakin thought it was video game footage at first.
They had alternate ‚Äúump cam‚Äù broadcasts during the college World Series last year. It was great.   Even more fun was watching the broadcast in VR. You could really see the pitches coming in well.
Courtesy of /u/innermongoose69 but, You can get 2 months of Apple TV+ free by going to apple.co/mlbgift for those who don't have it and want to try it. Not sure how long the promo lasts, but can time it for when your team plays on it.
I‚Äôm happy they have baseball people announcing games now
how is bellinger doing
finally, I can act like I'd take major league pitchers deep in a close-to-first-person P.O.V
Finally, an answer to the question "what the hell was he looking at?"
We'll finally be able to see if we could do as well as the umpires do or if we're all just undeservedly giving them shit.
I personally don't like this for the live feed. This is a cool view for replay, but in realtime I want the best view for seeing the action unfold and I don't think this is it. Same reason I don't like when NFL or NBA broadcasts deviate from the normal vantage point that is tried and true.
Not cool enough to pay for Apple TV plus
Apple TV needs to become a regional sports powerhouse.
Would be awesome to have this in all games.  Seemingly obvious ball/strike gets called wrong?  Bring up ump-view to see if the ump's judgment was at all justifiable.  Might tone down the ump-hate.  Or (more likely) intensify it.  Either way, it's a win for the fans.
I want it
Thought it would just be a black screen
Really want to watch games like this in VR
We need more of this
Looks like mlb the show
Oh look it‚Äôs me playing MLB The Show! Except the batter got a hit which I am incapable of
Why was this never a thing before?  Like ..  this is what all the video game angles have been....
Wow I thought it was a video game from the movement.
If the Apple TV baseball patch notes include better commentators they may never come down from S-Tier. Very OP.
NGL. I kinda don't like it. Even those 2-4 seconds made me a little nauseous.
Is it? I don't like it, too shaky
I want this angle forever.
That‚Äôs pretty cool! Has Apple TV improved their commentators? That was very cringe last year that made me mute their baseball broadcasts. But may want to tune in for this!
Holy shit this is amazing!!! It is 2023 we should have the option to change our camera view for all sports. I remember years ago on Watch ESPN you could choose your camera for NBA/NFL  and even had one without announcers. Give me this.
This is so cool
That‚Äôs the view I want to see now
Ump cam is back? Didn't they try this like a decade ago? Everything old is new again, I guess.
Are apple TV games still region locked? Everytime I try to watch a game it redirects.
That's the main feed and not a replay? Gah, I really dislike the Apple broadcasts.
Honestly, I‚Äôd prefer to watch 9 innings of this view over any other.
IMHO, there is nothing about Apple TV and baseball that should be in the same sentence!
Apple TV does some things very well, and some things very poorly. I'd rather have your average network doing all the things fairly well.
gimme automated strike zone.. ugh
Some minor digital stabilization might make this even more awesome.  Even without it im here for it
This is really cool, more please
Love it. Would also love to see this with some stabilization added.
Vide game ahh camera angle
Yeah I'm gonna go with Apple TV has won the "who gets to broadcast MLB games" contest.  1000x better than Youtube.  And I loved the live chat feature, but still, video is more important than live chat.  I can find an MLB chatroom anywhere.
I want this for every plate appearance of every game.
Being an umpire behind the plate is hard af yo.
Too bad the mask comes off during shouting matches with managers. That first clip would be instantly viral.
It‚Äôs like a shaky cam video game
It‚Äôs good. But hope they can bump up the FPS at some point.
How are you liking Cody, Cubs fans?
Great now I can see what it looks like if I would have fulfilled my dream to become an ump. Thanks for reminding me about my failed career Apple‚Ä¶
Hate when umpires don't line themselves up directly behind the plate. This guys practically in the batters box. Wonder what his outside balls/strikes looked like
cody bellinger rbi, pretty sexy  goddamn you friedman
Btw that‚Äôs an out last year. Good for Cody!!
3 hours and not a single joke about the ump show? I am disappointed
I want to see this view on a close play at the plate.
FOX had this in the 90's, no excuse it can't be used more often with modern technology.  It's a great angle.
lowkey thought this was The Show for a sec when I was scrolling through lol
Am I the only one who feels like this views make this ball seem very hittable for us nobodies?
I am a big fan of POV videos.  Oh yeah‚Ä¶for baseball. That‚Äôs what I meant.
Why are we just now getting ump cams?
It's a neat gimmick. What I really want though is for mlb to end this black out shit. I have mlb.tv and I will have been blacked out on 6 games in the first 10 days of the season.  I'm angrier about the exclusivity than I am happy about the real crackerjack neato view I *could* have.
I wanna watch a whole game like this
rick (monday) was really not joking about that head drop. holy shit
Feels like a video game
Sick view, but how are we supposed to see the ugly ads on the players shoulders? Don't they know that's what we wanna see. Smh Apple
Apple better be prepping this when their VR set comes out
We can see how bad Angel Hernandez calls are from behind the plate
Now put this camera on hernandez and bucknor
If they invest some more money in this with wider FOV and then add in image stabilization with AI so it points in a more consistent direction, it would be absolute perfection.
Ah shit Rich Waltz does their play by play? I used to listen to Marlins broadcasts just for him.
Coolest thing I‚Äôve seen form many years
Baseball upped it's game this year. All in now.
If they can fix their commentary teams, this could be the key to improving the macro broadcast of mlb games.
I could hit that
Sees cool new camera angle :üòÆ  Also sees who it‚Äôs against: ü´†
/u/stabbot can it help
I‚Äôd watch a whole game like this
How do I get this POV on? Trying right now in the padres game
I miss Belli Belli.
I wish broadcasts would zoom out on basehits to the outfield where a running is trying to score. I want to be able to see where the runner and the ball is at the same time.
All I want is no commentators. Just someone yelling about whatever they are selling.
Seems like a good angle when the ball is put in play but an awful one to watch pitch to pitch.  Do they show the game from this perspective or just replays?
FINALLY!!  Baseball has needed a view showing how devastatingly intimidating pitches are. Thank god for this. Now let‚Äôs get rid of all shaky cameras and constant zooming!
Slower than I thought. I could hit that. Time to dust off the cleats /s  That's cool and I'm curious why it took so long. Other than the umps not liking it to second guess them
They did this with catcher cam all the way back in ‚Äò97. It‚Äôs gimmicky so it will probably keep coming in and out of fashion.  https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/12/sports/catcher-cam-gives-reasons-to-yell-action.html
I actually find this really nauseating ü§¢
Hands down the best sports-television innovation since the skycam.
Apparently I was wrong and Apple TV is the best?
Need more of this
I‚Äôm really impressed with Apple TVs mlb this year.   Did you know on the language selection you can switch to your radio broadcast of choice?
Why don‚Äôt more broadcasts do this, I would prefer watching some AB like this. It‚Äôs super cool
This was on one of the Phillies games earlier this week too. I don't remember the network but not Apple TV.
This is a really interesting idea!  Do you think if they tried this when Angel Hernandez was behind the plate we could see the entirety of his colon firsthand?
Apple has the best baseball broadcast. I wish more sports and broadcast teams took the direction a bit too.
That was fucking cool!
I guess we just subscribe to specific cameras now haha, ok then. That is a cool view should be on all broadcasts though.
It's awesome, but I also want catchers view, ball view (for when really high and want to pretend you're the ball), cat on the field view, baby about to be dropped by new dad reaching over the railing for a ball while the lizard part of his brain tries to hold onto the child view, Dusty Baker/Tony La Russa view (for every game they're put in the dugout and told they're managing whatever team is playing; I just want to hear whatever they're quietly muttering under their breath), bored younger sibling view...  There are more on my wishlist but I don't want to be greedy.
So weird to see my boy in a different Jersey.
I just learned Bellinger plays for the Cubs now
Finally they are using technologies from Cricket now
Damn how‚Äôs he turn on that lol
Japan did this years ago but with a catcher cam.  I think the catcher cam is even better.
It‚Äôs about time something like this comes along in baseball. Formula 1 Racing has had cameras inside the drivers helmets for years. You can even choose to solely watch through a drivers helmet camera if you want via F1TV.
I want to see that Dustin may sinker from this view. Why hasn't this been a thing sooner?
I want to watch an entire game from this angle.
https://youtu.be/-JdDgRDB17w?t=40
Reminds me of the Pats game years ago when it was so foggy all they could use was SkyCam. Most fun football game I ever watched.
i honestly thought it was a The Show clip because i didn't read the headline that carefully
It amazes me how much baseball and sports broadcasts improve on a year-over-year basis.   10 years ago I was watching games at 1080i on a plasma 43-in TV set but I could at least see the blades of grass in the infield.   20 years ago I was watching games on 480p  30 years ago I was watching games over the air on broadcast networks at barely 480i.   40 years ago I would run home to watch World series games being broadcast during a work day.  0 days ago I just learned about umpire cam.
Absolutely fantastic.  This is the type of stuff the game needs.
>their commentators aren't a total shit show  This is the big one. They need to not sound like three 20-something nerds making a reaction video where they never shut up. In general, I don't like the way the broadcast is so stats/probability focused, and I say that as a data analyst by trade.
Last year they did this thing where they made the announcers shut up and had surround sound on the park. It was serene and just beautiful.   Amazon does an analytics type stream for TNF and I feel like apple tv+ could do a similar stream thats dedicated to just that.  I would eat more of that up in a heartbeat.
You have Rich Waltz and Dontrelle Willis today. They sound like they're calling either a spring training game, a blowout or other-wise a completely irrelevant game.
Apple‚Äôs broadcasts just started tonight. They only have Friday Night Baseball and this is the first week.
Why isn‚Äôt it accessible? You can watch apple tv on any device.
I may be partial as an La Kings fan but Alex Faust was calling the Padres Braves game and I thought he did a good job.
didnt MLB.TV have a "stadium sound" options for games at one point?
It's not very practical for viewing purposes outside of being cool.   Like even here, I could barely tell where the ball went after he hit it
I'd rather just have it be a fixed view from behind the plate
ESPN had it for the Astros/Sox season opener. I‚Äôve only seen it on national games. It‚Äôs great!
I think TBS had this angle when I watched the Phillies last week. Hopefully it's common for national broadcasts.
Adding a ball tracker to this would make it more practical
I haven't used it in years, but for Quest VR they had an interactive 3D pitch viewer but it was only after the pitch, and there was no way to watch the game at the same time. I would watch the live game then slide the headset down to watch the pitch trajectory, take it off and repeat.
You can tell it wasnt the show because the pitch wasnt in the dirt while bellinger power swung through the top of the zone. In my experience thats how it always goes so I assume everyone does it
Who else (probably very wrongly) thought to themselves: "I could hit that."?
It was‚Ä¶
D-Train is so hype on our broadcasts. You can tell he's having fun regardless of who he's in the booth with.
Except he said he was traded for a bag of balls. Matt Clement and his goatee were really good.
Rich Waltz is a fucking pro and it was a absolutely idiotic move for the Marlins to fire him
D-Train is the reason I became a Marlins fan. Dude is a legend in my eyes.
Oh, thank god. I only watched the Red Sox games on Apple TV last year, but I literally had to turn off the game a few innings in the booth was so bad. They kept making up dramatic talking points like "the curse of Mookie", which is something no one has ever said before or after. They kept mispronouncing players' names. Like, they kept saying Vairdugo instead of Verdugo. And they were getting stats wrong. Around midseason when Eovaldi missed a few starts because of injury they tried to say he hadn't started a single game all season. He had like 10 starts by that point and had only missed like 2 or 3 starts. It was a complete shitshow. They had no idea what they were doing.
I want everyone mic'd too. I wanna hear all the shit talk (I know it'll never happen üòî)
I can‚Äôt believe he actually agreed to that.
Best comment in the thread üèÜ
It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm seeing the game through his eyes
Wow, fully immersive
Literally a GOAT comment
I like how you can clearly hear them saying "Yeahh Umps" after every pitch
Your comment is cool and all but I am really just commenting to say I fucking love your username!!
Exactly that. That's what I want. I want to be able to pip a different camera angle from the one the standard stream is choosing. That would be dope as fuck.
I remember a while ago for mlb tv it would let you select individual cameras. I think it was in the early years of mlbtv‚Ä¶ might have been only a postseason thing too. You couldnt switch fast enough for it to be useful and there was not a broadcast feed to go with it‚Ä¶ I think a PIP thing would be a lot better like you said.
Crowd noise no longer exists :(
It is on the actual broadcast, just compression when uploading to reddit
Thank god for it, but for fucks sake could Bally's just die already... I'm tired of blackouts...
When I signed up for it earlier, the end of the deal was in one of the J months. June or July. Don't remember the exact day.
Worth a try, thanks!
... I thought all the Apple TV broadcasts were free‚Äî?
lemme text him
Agreed, we need higher quality things for MLB.TV to black out of local markets.  Or, at least, then I wouldn't be blacked out of this on MLB.TV why also being blacked out of local games.
no
wouldn't do much.  the ump cam is super jittery and what you see on the stream is sub 60fps and compressed.  Not to mention the camera is well above the ump's eye level and cannot move except when his head moves.  It seems a whole lot worse than the standard angle other than the novelty of it.
Oh hell yes!
Super cool but yeah it made me kinda nauseous
it's different people.  you may or may not like them more.  you can swap the audio to the team's radio.
They also had the catchers cam on Saturday Fox baseball, the one after TWIB
Yeah, idk why everyone is acting like this is some incredible discovery and how did no one think of this before
Nope, it says no blackouts.
The games broadcast by Apple TV+ are not region locked.  But in the app you will see all games on the schedule, and clicking on those will redirect you.
It‚Äôs 60fps on the broadcast, just compression from the clip on reddit
Espn 2 did an entire inning from this view. Espn cut to the same view several tomes throughout. I like it
That thing would look bonkers from this view. He's a beast.   These views are something that we've been missing for sure though. It gives baseball an artsy feeling to me. So satisfying to watch.
It has been a thing before. The problem is you can't really see much from this angle because the ball is so small and moves so fast coming at you. So it kinda has never been more than a novelty view used for occasional major event broadcasts. Like last week on ESPN's Sunday night game they showed like a whole inning from the ump cam and I guess maybe if I wasn't watching on my phone I might have gotten more out of it but basically I couldn't tell whether anything was in the zone or out of the zone and anything that was hit I had no idea where it went. It's neat to get an idea of just how hard hitting is and how impossible calling balls and strikes is for a human, but it really is better to be used sparingly or just for replays, etc.
Oof. And all the nasty sliders and 2 seamers that guys throw out. Sign me up.
Or better yet, have a live VR contest where you can try to call the game more accurately than CB Bucknor in real time
Use the split/multi screen to give me the normal broadcast cameras on one side and these views on another. It'd be cool to see where all the umps are watching. Also let me turn off the voice channels.
That‚Äôs awesome
NBC kept that angle for a few weeks because fan response was so positive, then eventually switched back. it was harder to tell depth / distance
You can also put on teams radio station on Apple TV broadcast
Are they still doing that at-bat probability thing with the broken model? It's one thing to be stats-focused (and I really like that when it's done well), it's another to be completely wrong with the stats you're using  Edit: [Specifically this model](https://blogs.fangraphs.com/how-good-are-those-probabilities-on-the-apple-tv-broadcasts/) that's worse than a coin flip
> They need to not sound like three 20-something nerds making a reaction video where they never shut up.  Got some bad news, you‚Äôre gonna be seeing that more often on main sports broadcast. That‚Äôs how an increasingly number of people (especially young people) watch things these days. Just gotta chalk it up to getting older.
Omg I hate the exact type of person you're talking about with the burning rage of a thousand suns. I'm a lifelong fan who's attended a ton of games and went to a game a few years ago with a friend and his friend (who I liked). He proceeded to turn every single conversation into a dick measuring contest about who knew the most stats and acted like that's what a *real* fan does. It drove me nuts, and even though I know he didn't mean to be an asshole, I don't think I'd go to another game with him.
I actually don't mind their 20 something need broadcasters.
They did one inning of just ballpark noise during a game last season and I adored it
Yea it was pretty boring, but it's a 45-degree game with the wind blowing in at Wrigley, and in the beginning of April. So, there wasn't much to go on outside of the game in front of them. Which was all pitching for the most part.
There were multiple plays where Willis(not actually sure which one) kept saying in a very disinterested voice 'wow wow wow' Absolutely atrocious commentary.
That's too bad, Dontrelle was pretty good in the dodgers booth last year in his fill-in role, but I think that had a lot to do with the chemistry with Joe Davis
Thank god someone else noticed that he said that lmfao
Point being paying for another subscription when last year it was free
It's also not very accessible on Android devices. It runs well in Chrome, don't get me wrong. But I'd rather have a native app and they'll probably never do that.
Dear Lord: please make this an option for every streaming service and every sporting event. Thank you.
They did, but then covid happened and empty stadiums meant you could hear the players and coaches cussing up a storm and they stopped
Yes but then how would you have verbal gambling advertisements shoved down your throat every few minutes??
It‚Äôs like the F1 Driver helmet cam. Super cool for 5-15 seconds at a time, but any more than that and it starts to make you nauseous.
Yeah, if this view was better it would have been made the default a long time ago. Not exactly new technology.
Yeah and unfortunately they don‚Äôt turn them off during pee breaks.
Usually these unique views suck because they spend all the time and money to set it up so they want to use it regardless of the circumstance.  I remember the behind the plate view on (i think) ESPN, where every time it was used and an actual play or even just a strike/ball occurred, you had to wait for the replay to get a sense for what actually happened.
> Like even here, I could barely tell where the ball went after he hit it  That's cause it got compressed all to hell by reddit
That‚Äôs why they zoom back out. No different than a normal POV
Okay so let‚Äôs do glowpuck for baseball
Would be sick with some stabilization and ball tracker/overlay though. A boy can dream.
I feel like this isn‚Äôt new.  It‚Äôs a novelty at best.
Same with the Madden view during NFL games. Can't see the outside players but that camera angle is beautiful and can only be shown once in a while throughout the game or else it'll be problematic.
Showing this angle on a replay of a strikeout would be fantastic though.
Wow this got a lot of upvotes. Apparently people aren‚Äôt even conscious of the fact that they go to a different camera with the behind-the-pitcher view when contact is made.
I was watching live and I thought it was a hard groundout until I heard Pat Hughes getting excited
they should just have a cable cam like football  we already have the dumb roof in tampa what's the difference
Espn2 had it the other day as well.
Hello, brother.
Is he gonna be the Apple TV guy, good for him if so. Wanted to see him more after the Cubs series last year where he was great, deserves the spot that Karros sour ass is taking up.
üòÖ I missed that.
Dontrelle was my favorite but man his later years were rough.
He's a (was) sub for the Mariners radio and it was always a treat to hear him call Ms games.
Man what a short lived stud he was. üòï
I dunno if you play the Show, but he has an awesome (& beautiful) card in the game. I love his windup & pitching with him. He was so fun to watch back in the day.
They really should have everyone mic'd up. It's such a missed opportunity
Thanks. Most people think it‚Äôs a sexual reference, but actually, it‚Äôs just named after my other half‚Äôs cheeky shenanigans. Before we met she‚Äôd never tried chorizo, and now any time I‚Äôm cooking and there is chorizo, she‚Äôll appear out of nowhere like a little burglar and steal slices as I‚Äôm cutting them/putting them into a dish lol  [Alleged footage of her in action.](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowYourNose)
iirc those cameras were fixed and didn't show much of the field if it showed the field at all
It only works for me cause I‚Äôm living in a different state. I don‚Äôt think I could get rangers games if I was still living in Dallas.
Use a VPN. Works for me.
It was a day that ended in "Y"
They were last year to get you hooked or whatever. This year you have to be a subscriber.
i already did he never got back to me ü•∫
Sadly, they‚Äôd probably come up with a no-blackout subscription price.

Lots of nephews and young people on reddit.
Oh, sweet!
It shows just how hard the sport actually is. For some reason some people think it's an easy sport because it's non contact and typically slow. But hitting a tiny fast moving object with a thin long object isn't easy and this shows just how fast and unpredictable that baseball is
I think a stationary camera would be better than one attached to an umpire that will have quite a few movements right before and during a pitch. But overall I liked it. I only faced 90+ once or twice in my playing career and faced a nasty slider/curve from a D1 pitcher. So I like seeing what elite pitching looks like
Makes me appreciate the good umpires more
I think doing it once or twice an inning would be a nice supplement to the ordinary camera angles.
These are weird complaints to me. The umpire tells you if it‚Äôs in or out of the zone. And you don‚Äôt really see where the ball is hit from the typical view either. The broadcast has to change the camera after contact either way.   It gives a much more immersive view of the hitter/pitcher dynamic which is what we‚Äôre actually watching.
Better than CB Bucknor? I've got two working eyes. I'll need something more challenging.
Yeah, I could get used to Apple TV broadcasts called by Pat Hughes.
Really? That‚Äôs awesome.
You just absolutely blew my mind, in the middle of watching Braves Padres and just got it switched over. What a great feature, kudos for the heads up. And it‚Äôs synced perfectly
Yeah, it's better than the Apple TV commentary but I don't love Charlie Steiner, either.
~~And it won't be synced.~~    Edit: turns out it is
Did MLB TV stop allowing this? I thought I just had to select the audio team I wanted but it took me to the audio only.
Life changing. Thank you!
Anyone figure out how to get local feed in Canada? Apparently all we get is local feed and only for the Blue Jays
So basically Apples model overfit to Hell and back  Which makes sense if they're bragging about taking in 110 variables for so few outcomes (like 10?)
i think you're right and god i hate it
There are a lot of those folks on here, too. The second you try to compare one guy's OPS to another guy's OPS, they'll belittle you for not only ever using wRC+ or some shit.
Well there had to be someone who didn't mind. I'm particularly bothered when they go on long digressions or make bad jokes.
Oh man, I remember that. It was awesome but such a cocktease next to their regular broadcast. I'd watched entire games like that even if the alternative was announcers I like.  I think you might be able to get there by muting then center channel on a surround sound system but I rarely get to watch on my main TV these days.
https://apple.co/mlbgift
I am not paying 7$ to watch 1 game when I frickin pay mlb.tv a boatload already. It shouldn't be blacked out on mlb.tv
This and get rid of black outs, and take my money.
Is that why? That makes sense but they should bring it back
The absolute worst part about streaming sports is that they have like 2 advertisments and they show them on repeat during every single break. It makes me never want to hear of the product ever again.
Yea POV cams don't work that well in practice since your brain can't stabilise what you're seeing
I love watching the driver cams alongside the broadcast honestly
but similarly for some moments here and there it's super interesting, like an overtake or a play at the plate.
Trust me, all I need is 5-15 seconds.
Split screen?  Most pitches don‚Äôt result in hits.  So this argument strikes me as cutting off the nose to spite the face.
It was odd watching Angel Hernandez use the urinal and call it a "thirsty boy" over and over
He was disgusting in whatever year MLB the show was when he was with the Tiggers. Had insane potential stat
That‚Äôs kind of what I was thinking. Sometimes we run out of chorizo and I‚Äôm gonna start telling my kids the chorizo bandit struck again!
I live in DC and get blacked out of O‚Äôs and Nats games which sucks when the Mets play the Nats but if they‚Äôre in DC I don‚Äôt care cause I would be working those games anyway
I know he has not been getting my messages because I know he would text back if he did. I hope he texts back this time, and we can become good friends. I am sure our relationship would be a real homerun!
You know he left for Chicago, right?
That'd be an upgrade from blacking me out of 4 different games today.
I tried 10 pitches at a batting cage at some Putt Putt thingy. I managed to foul off two pitches. 8 Swing and misses. Those pitches were in the 60 MPH range and didn't have movement.
You're trying to hit a round object, with a cylinder, squarely.   It's nearly impossible to be good at it.
It looks slow but a regular at bat would leave an average person winded.
*gets 40% of calls right*
ChatGPT already called a game better than CB and it doesn‚Äôt even have eyes!
They're doing it for MLS too, though they haven't figured out multiple feeds for soccer lol, only home team is available so far. But it's very welcome, with all local tv broadcasts abolished.
every national game needs this
I‚Äôm reading your comment and learning this in the top of the 9th. Fuck me‚Ä¶
It actually is. That‚Äôs the really cool part.
Apparently it‚Äôs perfectly synched.   >	I‚Äôm happy to report that the local radio overlay feature works well. ‚Ä¶The integration is flawless. Radio announcer audio is synced up perfectly with the video. When the radio broadcast isn‚Äôt providing audio, the broadcast plays stadium background audio.  ‚Äî[Friday Night Baseball‚Äôs radio overlay really works](https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/04/friday-night-baseballs-radio-overlay-really-works/)
My app looks like this. https://imgur.com/I7HJznb.jpg  It defaulted to the Milwaukee broadcast, but I can tap on STL if I want to switch to KMOX.
I was able to switch to the radio broadcast audio on the video on MLB.tv the other day. It was very close on sync as well.
I have no idea how you can index 110 variables in a baseball game without either using a derivative of a derivative of a derivate, or some bs overfitting. I could name like a few dozen before I have to resort to things like dew point and the color of the outfield seats.
Symptom of an increasingly parasocial society.
I don‚Äôt even know what you guys are talking about but why is everybody like that nowadays. Unfunny people trying so fucking hard to be funny. Like you literally have to go out of your way to find a podcast about like serial killers that isn‚Äôt cracking terrible jokes every 10 seconds.
One of the PBP announcers from the AppleTV team is now the guy who fills in for Joe Davis when Davis is doing his Fox Sports stuff, right? Have you noticed any improvement now that he's working in a more traditional setup?
I'll actually keep that in mind, thanks!  Looks like the only met game is before that expires so it works out almost perfectly
But it sells a lot of product to others. It wasn‚Äôt made for you
Eventually the camera tech will be advanced enough to self stabilize like in flagship smartphones maybe, then it‚Äôd be even cooler.
Just gotta get the money shot and move on
I don‚Äôt need this to enjoy the game more. It already looks great on tv.
You typed Tiggers on purpose I bet üòÇ
do you think he had a good relationship with his father?
know? yes, accept? no
I‚Äôm generally okay at making contact but can never get used to the recoil(?) from hitting. Without batting gloves I just can‚Äôt and even with I just want to stop after hitting a few.
Yeah their MLS coverage has been fantastic, soccer is by far my favorite sport and this is the most invested I‚Äôve been in the MLS
You guys have great radio announcers
[MLB.tv](https://MLB.tv) does a good job with syncing the radio feed, too, in my experience.
Well, I'll be.
They have been doing home radio alternative with MLS this season, and it's been well sync'd.  They supposedly mix it with the live crowd noise though, and it is not as impressive as the main announcers mix.
Right, but that‚Äôs audio only. OP was asking for video feed with home/away audio selection
>	some bs overfitting  There‚Äôs your answer lol  (Although your note about color of the seats reminds me of how Maddux, I think, said he‚Äôd decide his next pitch by picking out a random fan behind home plate and going off the color of their shirt, or something of the sort, and I‚Äôd love to see them figure out how to put THAT in)
Well the dew point would have an effect on the travel of the ball and the outfield seat color impacts batter visibility sorta soooooo‚Ä¶
I actually really liked him alongside Orel. Not as much as Joe but a lot more than Daron Sutton who was filling in last year. I'm not sure how Dodger Nation felt about him in general as I haven't looked into it.
lots of debate in marketing circles rn about whether traditional advertising actually does sell product. it basically only exists now to keep a brand's identity in the public consciousness, and it's still not clear that that has any real value either.
They should add tracers to the ball too, to help make it clear where the pitch is going, and where the ball is hit.
[;-)](https://youtu.be/G6ozHscfyfY)
Yeah I never really appreciated what the announcers were talking about when they'd say getting jammed in the cold That shit hurts even in warm weather but man oh man when it's cold it's really nasty. Definitely enough to make most hitters conscious of it and behave differently that's for sure
That‚Äôs the shitty bats and rubber balls, if you‚Äôre talking about batting cages. Wood bats and even modern aluminum ones feel great when you make solid contact
I've played baseball my whole life and refuse to bat without gloves fuck that, thats wild boy shit. You feel it in your bones if you don't wear gloves and get it jammed up on the inside when you swing.
MLS season pass is dope af
Bring back the fake sound effects where it's just some dude pouring beans into a mixing bowl for the applause.
I work in marketing and am very aware of those convos.   It's clear that it has value. Not the inflated value they spend, nor the impact of 20/30/50 years ago, but advertising works.  One thing about marketing too is that people like you will say it makes them "hate the ad" or "ads don't work on them" until they do. (Nothing against YOU personally just making a point using you as an example)
For sure, I imagine it‚Äôs similar for dunking in basketball. Whenever we played on lowered rims to have fun with dunking someone eventually gets their hand bruised or something. Meanwhile in the NBA some players yam the ball multiple times in a game with far more power than we ever could. Always chalked it up to them just getting used to it with enough repetition but I‚Äôm sure it still hurts.
That is fair, it wasn‚Äôt as bad with a modern aluminum bat but still there. I didn‚Äôt like the wooden ones much.
I went to a batting cage last winter for the first time in a while and brought some friends who just wanted to hit some balls for fun but didn‚Äôt have baseball experience. No gloves were available and no one brought any lol. I think we left within 10 minutes. That was a mistake.
No Black Outs imagine that!
Yeah fuck that I'm not about that life and like I've said I've been playing since I was tiny.

[baseball.theater](https://baseball.theater) might be the closest, though I believe you have to click each game to see the full box score at the bottom
Ok it requires an extra step. But if you really wanted, you can get a (free!) account with the Chicago Sun-Times and check out the e-paper every day. It has all the boxes.
How have I never heard of this site before! It's freakin amazing! No fluff just the data!
Gerrit Cole should give up his Max Scherzer psycho pitcher facade on his starts and just be a goofball that throws 100 like Ohtani. He wears it well
He definitely enjoyed that more than the baby lol
Cole is weird in a very hilarious, charming way.
If the Yankees sub don't make him peeking over the dugout a react or meme they're missing out on a big opportunity
God, he's such a doofus. I love him.
The baby started crying shortly after.
"I want the real Kermit, dammit!" - The baby
Of course the baby loves Kermit
I love this man.
Why is Gerritt Cole cool all of a sudden? I could never stand him and now this is already like the 5th thing I‚Äôve seen this season that makes me like him. Ughh.
This guy dads
Peek a boo with a baby is the best! Such a simple thing.
I do believe that is the second row.
Kids sure do love Kermit. u/jaredcarrabis thoughts?
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs cute, I guess‚Äù
He‚Äôs there. He‚Äôs always been there
I like this
Oh I see, it‚Äôs cute when Cole plays peekaboo with a fan, but when Rendon does it he gets suspended.   End the double standards
oh he'll cross the audi logo if it's a baby...  <jokes, people>
I love him so much I want to cry
Reminds me of when A-Rod did the same thing but it was a woman and he was being a total creep
/r/Basebaww
It's a good thing he doesn't use Spider Tack to play peek-a-boo
Ok well now I like Cole a little bit more. Gross
For Pete's sake baby, a smile would be nice
Man Altuve can‚Äôt catch a break
Some guys need to get into that mindset to compete at their best. I had to be like that and believe me, even I didn‚Äôt like me on the field. Lol
Scherzer is actually pretty laid back when he's not on the mound.
He‚Äôs an entertainer.
how would you feel if a nice person just disappeared off the face of the earth?
why does the baby sound like vince mcmahon
He was never really that much of a douche. He has his moments and is intense but I dunno I didn't get the hate too much.
I used to hate him cause of his big contract and I didn‚Äôt think he handled the substance ban the best, but recently I‚Äôve been liking him more and I don‚Äôt know how to feel about it
Yes
wh...what?
This feels like the setup for a Tim Robinson sketch. Sweat dripping down his face as he attempts to explain his awful joke.
This kind of reads like the "I used to play like Embiid..." copy pasta haha
It's funny how sometimes you have to change your mind to do something well. I played lead trumpet in the high school jazz band, and to pull off the flashier charts, I had to act more grandiose to get into the right mindset.
Kershaw is one of the most intense competitors on start days, it's a known rule that you don't talk to him in the clubhouse on those days. Every other day, he's one of the goofiest dudes in the dugout. He's mellowed more as he's gotten older but it's still funny to see how much his personality depends on whether he's in game mode.
I'm assuming the opposing players can see right through it since they see how he acts on off days and they just have to imagine his voice to know he isn't such a tough guy. So it must be just for himself to get that mindset
wait, hold on, the nice man is back.  wait, where did he go
Playing for the Astros and Yankees, plus a big contract would that to a player.
Same dude, same.
What is this Reggie
I just got promoted to lead trumpet in my jazz band lol and I‚Äôm so nervous for the concert coming up. I can not be serious at all though so I think my thing is just relaxing and having fun in order to do my best. Do you remember what trumpet you had?
Idk if that‚Äôs it. Someone like Joe Burrow seems like a goofy dude, but when he‚Äôs locked in he‚Äôs described as being like a whole different person
That‚Äôs how it was for me. It wasn‚Äôt for anyone else, it‚Äôs for myself. It‚Äôs just a mentality thing
His attitude after the 2019 WS loss didn‚Äôt endear him to many Astros fans either.
I had a Getzen Severinsen that was a bit of a beater and slotted real weird up high, which was fun to deal with lol. But for me, finding a mouthpiece that felt good up high and made it easier to get the right sound was a bigger deal than the trumpet itself.  If you want, I can give some advice on the job of playing lead, and the things that helped me with it.
I‚Äôd love advice, thank you! All my stuff like trumpet and mouthpiece is hand me down but very high quality so I have no idea what I have, only that the mouthpiece is passed down from jazz trumpet lead to lead.
The NL East angel of death continues to claim its victims
Just another day in the IL East
All Eli did in ST and early this year has been mash and steal. Curious to see if he can do it in the bigs now.  If he does, might not lose a ton offensively.
Random Braves call up? Might as well just give him ROY now  Edit: apparently it won't be *this* random call up due to lack of eligibility
What *is* the body count up to in the NL East?
What's the best lineup you can make from the [IL East players listed here](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/12evza8/justin_toscano_news_michael_harris_ii_was_placed/jfcxfqr/?context=1)? The infield is kind of weak but the pitching and outfield is respectable.   1B Rhys Hoskins  2B Carter Kieboom (guessing if you can play SS and 3B you can learn 2B)  SS Joey Wendle  3B Darick Hall (he's young, he'll learn)  LF Corey Dickerson  CF Michael Harris II  RF Bryce Harper  C Omar Narvaez  SP1 Justin Verlander  SP2 Ranger Suarez  SP3 Kyle Wright  SP4 Max Fried  SP5 Jose Quintana  RP1 Raisel Iglesias  RP2 Tyler Matzek  RP3 Tommy Hunter  RP4 Steven Okert  CL Edwin Diaz
Hey Braves people... FYI Eli White is good.
Our injuries are minor. You always want your stars to play whenever possible, but at the same time it's great to see your guys with potential get some ABs. Hilliard was clutch last night, along with Pillar. White has been raking, and has a real shot  to be a starting fielder at some point, depending on what happens with Rosario.
It was a suspiciously good start of the season‚Ä¶
Eli White confirmed RoY
Well that sucks
How did he hurt it? Deadlifting or squats? Or while playing?
I loved White in Texas. Was kinda bummed when he was traded. Cool to see him get a call up
Everyone was talking about how loaded the NL East was so God had to nerf the entire division
We've lost so many players already lol
[Here‚Äôs](https://reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/12evza8/_/jfcxfqr/?context=1) a list of the NL East injuries
Harris has been pretty shaky offensively. This is going to be a downgrade defensively, but possibly a push on offense.
28-year-old Eli White definitely winning ROTY in his fourth MLB season.
Sam Hilliard is about to break out
[Braves](https://i.imgur.com/2sXQXy9.jpg)  [Marlins](https://i.imgur.com/EkXwDDZ.jpg)  [Mets](https://i.imgur.com/54GNkiB.jpg)  [Nationals](https://i.imgur.com/CfAviIs.jpg)  [Phillies](https://i.imgur.com/bt2VF1B.jpg)
And this doesn‚Äôt even include strasburg who was World Series MVP the last time he was healthy.
Back strains tend to nag for a while. I wouldn‚Äôt call anything back related minor. Especially when it has a 10 day IL stint
Yeah hamstring or back issues never linger
I wouldn't be shocked if it was that HR he robbed from Goldy the other day.
Smacked his back against the wall in St. Louis ehile hewas making a great catch and then aggrevated it in the hone opener on a slide.
Our collective IL is a playoff team
Yeah, and it seems like the entire mets pitching roster is on the IL
Yeah hopefully he can at least do what MH2 has done so far on offense and it won't take much to do better.
He's quite a big downgrade defensively from MHII, and frankly I'd give players more than 2 series worth of games before you start reading into stats much
Death, taxes, Eli White winning ROTY.
Oh damn, hadn't heard the name before so i just assumed he was a rookie
There ain't no rule that says a 4th year can't... oh wait no there actually is.
I am down for this
39 as of now. Holy fuck.
This is absolutely ridiculous
I mean it's what Harris said. If he had the issue in August or September he'd be able to play through it. Not a big deal to let him get back to 100% right now.
That's okay, we have Cylor MeThrill as our new ace.  He went 6 innings and pitched the first scoreless start in the season for Mets pitchers so far in our home opener today.
Isn't Eli white supposed to be elite defensively?   Edit: white's career estimated success rate added is twice as high as Harris's (4% vs. 2%)
I always take what players say with a grain of salt. We saw Acuna play through injury all last year, and while he wasnt bad it clearly affected him.   Seeing how Harris started the season, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if that was him playing through the issue the first week. I would also be surprised if this was the only time this season his back had an issue.   I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôll be a long term thing like Yelich, or even that end of season it‚Äôll be an issue. Just that people seem to see the 10 day IL and think in 10 days he‚Äôll be all better, and I think that quick of a turn around to 100% is very unlikely.
April Tylor is untouchable
ELIwhiTE, yes
It's a shame that this is prob Hoskins' biggest highlight of the year due to injury
I‚Äôm going to cry. Rhys might never play another game in a Phillies uniform‚Ä¶
The Philadelphia phILlies  I hope they both have fast recoveries their presence is sorely missed
Is it an unpopular opinion that usage of the word "champions" when describing a pennant or just a division title is really lame?
I‚Äôm out of the loop. Why is that?
I mean they got the title by winning the nlcs, aka the National League Championship Series, meaning the winner is the champion of the national league.
This is the most dodgers fan opinion ever
It's an accomplishment to be in first place in your division at the end of the year, or survive the playoff gauntlet to win the league. I think it's fine.  I think most teams that win a wild card berth but don't win the division still get a banner put up, but it might say "Wild Card Winner" instead of "champion ", because at no time were they the best at anything among any group of teams.
Yes
On reddit yes in real life no. No one knows what the ‚Äúchampionship‚Äù is. All you hear is ‚ÄúX won the pennant‚Äù
This: https://twitter.com/phillies/status/1641599388492414977?s=46&t=VXGY0Q1qC2IvfK8hVDJdVg  And it‚Äôs a contract year‚Ä¶
Because we don't celebrate second place?  Winning divisions and pennants is nice, but the World Series is what gets remembered.
I still don‚Äôt understand. I knew he would be out for the year but still not sure why he cant be re-signed. Sorry just getting back into baseball,
Right, hence the *might*. It‚Äôll be a tough negotiation :/ He‚Äôs going to want some serious $$ and not sure Phils will want to pay up given the open contracts we have and other needs‚Ä¶
It‚Äôs been a busy week when neither our game tying 9th inning homer nor the go ahead homer right after make the list
I'm guessing that Oakland and Cleveland have seen quite enough of each other for a while.  Especially considering that Oakland only won 1 of those games despite all 3 plays from that series being beneficial to the A's
So does a home team going into the bottom of the 9th tied automatically have a 63% chance of winning that then diminishes with each out?
I love these so much thanks!  Some feedback: 1) I love the addition of the summary at the bottom. Seeing the score and inning in the same place every time makes it a lot easier to follow. 2) I wish the clips started maybe  half-second earlier so I could take in the situation and then looks at the play. I feel like I'm seeing the pitch before I've gotten settled in
Padres have back to back plays on here
I can't wait for this to become the Phillies daily WPA again.
Oakland deserves to have some fun üòé
Oakland seats literally at 2% filled
11 and 12 lol
Yeah I'm surprised we missed out
Yes
I would think the ability of the pitcher and batter would have an influence on that.  Like having Barry Bonds up to bat would certainly increase those odds of winning
And there's 3 plays from that 1 game
Definitely, but I'm not sure if this accounts for that.
Three from the same *inning* of that game, in fact. Longoria in Top 9, and then Dahl and Kim back-to-back in the Bottom of the 9th.
It doesn't
Thanks.

Brazoban clearly looks bad here but seems like Cooper definitely shouldn't have gone for that ball considering Vogelbach was running
 that sound that keith made
Never understand why first basemen range halfway to 2nd to get a ball the 2B man has easily  Pisses me off when Votto does it  Not that it excuses the pitcher for not covering
Bad Fundies, Keith in ruins
What‚Äôs the point of having Locastro on the roster as our pinch runner when we have Danny Burgers
His speed warps the delicate fabricate of reality itself
Vogelbach speed? More like VogelMACH speed!
What the hell was Cooper doing?
He deserves a hot fudge sundae tonight
Known speedster Daniel Vogelbach
The peak male form. They were in awe of his greatness
People here trying to argue if its the 1B's fault or the pitcher's fault but let's be real. No one was getting Vogel out in time even if it was played perfectly. He's just too damn fast.
I‚Äôll always respect vogelbach cause he‚Äôs hefty but he runs as hard as he can every time.
Might just be this highlight, be he looks like he lost some weight compared to the last couple seasons.
Peak male performance
Oli Marmol sitting Tyler O'Neill down right now showing him Vogelbach clips to inspire more hustle.
Play of the season
This goes down in the category of ‚ÄòHeadlines I Never Thought I Would Read‚Äô
Cooper should‚Äôve just stayed on the bag, right?
Why is Vogelbach an absolute speed demon vs. the marlins
Pitcher's fault 100%. Ball hit to the right of the first baseman, you get your overpaid ass to first.
Manboobs O‚ÄôNeil should be taking notes
Looking like Ichiro out there.
Swinging at that with the bases loaded??
Nothing you can do there, just gotta top your cap and pitch to the next batter.
A T H L E T E
It looks like they still had a decent chance to get him out if the second baseman just threw the ball. It woulda been a close play, but I think a good throw beats him.
My name is Daniel Vogelbach and I am the fastest man alive. To the outside world, I am an ordinary platoon DH and first baseman, but secretly with the help of my friends at the 7 Line, I beat out infield singles and crush bud lights
1.000 xBA when the Marlins are in the field
Overall weird play, they acted like it was Trea Turner running and there wouldn‚Äôt even be a play
The play that immediately came to mind was the 27th "out" of the Armando Gallaraga game--that's the second baseman's ball, the first baseman should stay put.
The fuck would he have done if he got the ball, run back to 1st?
*oooowwwwooowwwwaaa*
Disappointing Keith has got to give so many players nightmares. He's never angry,  but he's just so disappointed by the utter lack of basic fundies.
I appreciate how unbiased he is when it comes to this stuff. If he sees bad fundies, he's gonna complain, even if the Mets are benefitting.
Right off the bat looked like a routine 4-3 putout so I can understand the pitcher for not sprinting towards first. By the time he mentally processed that Cooper left first base and he needed to cover it was too late. I'd say this is like 80% 1B's fault and should've been charged an error, but of course he wasn't even part of the play so you can't score it that way.
That wasn‚Äôt a fart, that was Vogelbach breaking the sound barrier!
I rewatched this after some comments here and I think this is on both Cooper and the 1B. He didn‚Äôt need to field that ground with 2B there so when Cooper noticed his 1B was off bag it was far too late
marlins lucky second base was occupied so he couldn't steal
[Between 20-25 lbs](https://nypost.com/2023/02/20/slimmer-daniel-vogelbach-ready-to-do-my-part-for-mets/)
Don‚Äôt know why someone downvoted you. You‚Äôre absolutely right. What‚Äôs the worst thing that happens if 1B is able to make it back to cover first? You ran 20 feet for no reason?
its the first baseman's fault 99%. why do you think keith asked "what is cooper doing"
O'Moobies
They got spooked by Vogelbach's bigger bases commercial. He's got a reputation now.
Well last thing you want to do there is throw the ball away and let a 1 run mistake turn into 2 or 3. Pitcher never looked ready for a throw until it was too late
Any ball hit to the first baseman's right he should let the second baseman get it and then sprint to cover first if they're positioned the way they were (or in the past, the shift). I remember Alonso having problems with this when he first came up and Keith hernandez basically explained every time  to the audience why that's wrong.
The fundies were bad
Kills me that mental errors aren't errors.
Well there was a slam as well
I believe Garrett Cooper is the first baseman, Luis Arr√°ez is the one at second fielding the ball but no one was covering first as Cooper ran to field the ball
He's all about that bass
There‚Äôs two outs and the pitcher beat the runner to the bag. I feel like you have to throw that ball.
No treble.
He barely beat him there and that‚Äôs because he had his head down sprinting towards the base, didn‚Äôt look ready to catch the ball until Vogelbach was already safe. I think it was the right decision by the 2B to keep the ball in his pocket
At 07: he puts his glove up for a throw, and the second basemen has already given up on the play.   I understand why he didn‚Äôt throw it, he was late to cover, but with two outs it seems like you gotta take the chance.
Pulled him out with a no-hitter in the third, inexcusable by Skip
> 87 pitches
#MARLINS ARE OUT OF MOUND VISITS.  SOMEONE ACTUALLY RAN OUT OF MOUND VISITS THIS IS NOT A DRILL.
The ninth [0 hit, 7+ walk game](https://stathead.com/tiny/VAd4E) since 2000 and second this year (Jack Flaherty).
MLB the show has LIED to us
Someone needs to tell this guy he can just underhand the ball over the plate and he'd go 7 scoreless against our offense, no need for him to keep throwing changeups/curves behind in the count
Vogelbach infield single üò≥
Impressive to be honest
SMH could've walked 10 if they had let him
He is worrying me. I saw him pitch a couple times in person last season and he looked great but these first starts have been very troubling. Hope he figures out the control because his stuff is still great.
Idk whats crazier this statline or the Mets finding a way to score 9 runs anyway
It is worth noting that he‚Äôs walked 13 batters in 6.2 innings this season. In 1994, Bret Saberhagen walked 13 batters in 177.1 innings over 24 starts.
How does this effect his MLB the Show card?
85 pitches thrown by the third inning and 0 hits. JFC this Mets team is actually worse than last years season end
28 pitches leading to BBs is something else. How deep into the count did Ks go, because,  wowsers, that'll run up your pitch count in a huge hurry.
Yikes
If couldn‚Äôt buy a strike was a person
How do mets fans put up with this team this is the first game I‚Äôve watched of them this year
Is that good?
Did he know he doesn‚Äôt have to put that many guys on the bases?
Statline had us in the first half not gonna lie
‚ÄúI hate them‚Äù (Stugotz voice)
This guys first 2 starts are interesting
Would've thrown a CGSO if we simply IBB'd the first two batters to keep the pitch count low
He was going the Nolan Ryan route.
Now SKEEEEE-UP
Real shame the bullpen couldn't hold onto it for him. They did inherit his ability to walk batters, though.
always a cardinal, didn‚Äôt want him to outshine flahertys last start
What having no sense of location does to a mf
Shoulda spammed inside sinkers smh has he ever played The Show?
You can run out?!
I remember that Morrow game. I think AJ Pierzynski hit a grand slam for us
Psh, what're you talking about? He was literally unhittable.
Mets almost got a NOBLETIGER without putting a ball in play...  Walk>Walk>Walk>K>K....
Speed demon
Garrett Cooper wants OUT
ü§£You better play heads up defense because i have seen him play and hustle his way to plays like this consistently.  He is not fast but he will run it out. Seriously
He's got Pablo Lopez syndrome  Dominates against everyone else but can't hit the zone against us to save his life
Lmao no need to swing if the dude is giving out walks like candy.. he walked 7 people in under 3 innings. If he can't find the zone my bat is staying on my shoulder till he shows me otherwise.
Are you just going to ignore the 7 walks?
If you think they have it rough, imagine us watching this
Can‚Äôt speak for all, but in my case, 35 years of being systematically groomed for disappointment.
Even when the offense isn‚Äôt clicking they get on base. Feels like they‚Äôre never out of it.
You sound like a Met fan
Marlins are a fine team for pitching development. They got Luzardo back on track.
Honestly should‚Äôve just gotten all 7 walks over with in the first so he could cruise the rest of the way
Ah so basically me in the Show when I have to deal with a pitcher‚Äôs long windup.
Mets led the league in times they made opposing pitchers throw 30 or more pitches in the first inning last season. They've already don't it twice this season.
Man Cabrera with that sinker in the show 21 was disgusting. I couldn't hit it
Also, wth was the pitcher doing? lol.
Cabrera has well documented control issues. It was manageable last season but so far he has allowed 13 walks in 6.2 innings.
Did you even watch the game, when he wasn‚Äôt walking them, The Mets were swinging and missing at everything or failing to score with runners in position. The only reason the Mets have a lead is because of Miami giving them the runs. Trust me if the Mets had to try they‚Äôd leave you in bittered tears
You've just described every woman who's ever dated me...
The real savages in the box.
I still have nightmares of that sinker
I mean, I get it, he assumed Cooper was going back to first and by the time he realized he wasn't it was way too late for him to get over there.
Both starts have been against the Mets though so my point still stands
they scored 9 runs and hit 3 hrs btw get a grip man
Lol
>he assumed Cooper was going back to first   Yea, this is his mistake, not Cooper's.
No, that ball should be left for the 2nd baseman thats all on Cooper.
Yet another in a super long list of AAAA Yankee stars.
he'll be part of the package for Ohtani at the deadline
Wait, noone wanted him?
Dombrowski, get on the horn
Interesting.  Who else will be in the package?
No one is giving up the farm for a rental
They're going to want Volpe at minimum
Nope. Sorta flies in the face of some Yankee fans who assume he's this top tier piece waiting to break out.  The league doesn't think so.
Andujar.  Clint Frazier.
brett gardner finally gets a call from the yanks
It's obviously going to depend on what other teams are offering but I seriously doubt we end up giving up Volpe.
And Jason Giambi
Don't forget about Voit.
Can we repatriate Brooks Kriske from Japan to add to the deal?
And that's exactly how the Yankees end up dramatically overvaluing their prospects based on internal hype  See: Joba Chamberlain, Miguel Andujar, Gary Sanchez, Greg Bird, Estevan Florial, Chance Adams, et al.  Go further back, you find the same thing. They've been doing this for 30+ years
There is no way in hell that the Yankees would ever sign Ohtani after this season when he becomes a FA. They have way too much money in players like Judge and Cole for years to come already. If he still had a few years of control after this year and they were able to trade Volpe and a bunch of other prospects for him that would be a no brainier. But even though Volpe hasn't yet proven himself (I'm his first week...) it would obviously not be worth it to lose him in the long term for a 2-3 month rental. Even for a player as good as Ohtani.
Drew Henson
oh the Yankees are definitely going to try to sign Ohtani
Henson, Jackson Melian, and D'Angelo Jimenez ought to get 'er done.
It would be great but is a pipe dream. He's going to be at 50mil a year for probably close to a decade. They already have Judge at 40mil/yr and Cole at $36/mil a year for the next several years plus decent contracts for plenty of other guys for years to come. I know they COULD afford it if they really wanted to but it would put them in or beyond Steve Cohen territory which is nuts. Add to that the fact that Ohtani wants to play out west (for fair reasons IMO) and that there are a few contending teams out there who could pay him what he wants. It just won't happen.  Now as far as trying to sign him... they will do their "due diligence" and look at him/make an offer as almost all teams will. But they will not sign him in the end.
Signing Ohtani puts them over the threshold by $13M+ before anybody even goes through arbitration next year. It‚Äôs not happening.  Shit, they‚Äôd have $20M left in 2026, and that‚Äôs before arbitration **and** with 10 empty roster spots. Lol.  On top of all that, it means benching Ohtani or Stanton 4/5 days, since only one of them can DH.
You can't be up there stumblin like that
That may need to be a point of clarification.  Of course if there's runners on that's a balk.
This really felt like a scenario where the ump can use judgement and not give a ball  Tough break for a guy struggling with command
So could you intentionally walk someone with 4 straight violations to get some time to rest?
couldn't you argue he started his delivery in time? which is the point of the pitch clock? not sure exactly how the rule is worded
He would've thrown a ball anyway
I feel for this man.   It had to be like when you step off the curb and misjudge the height. Or when you miss a step while walking down stairs.
I just don't get the violation here.  They say in the video that it's a pitch clock violation, and is noted as such on Gameday ("Automatic Ball 1 - 0  Pitcher Pitch Timer Violation"). But [the rule is supposed to be](https://www.mlb.com/glossary/rules/pitch-timer) "The pitcher must **begin his motion to deliver the pitch** before the expiration of the pitch timer. Pitchers who violate the timer are charged with an automatic ball." (emphasis added). Cabrera clearly began his motion to deliver his pitch before the clock was 0.  BUT in [the official rules](https://img.mlbstatic.com/mlb-images/image/upload/mlb/wqn5ah4c3qtivwx3jatm.pdf) (which actually aren't updated with the current pitch clock rules), it reads, "6.02(b) **Illegal Pitches With Bases Unoccupied** If the pitcher makes an illegal pitch with the bases unoccupied, it shall be called a ball unless the batter reaches first base on a hit, an error, a base on balls, a hit batter or otherwise." and "*Rule 6.02(b) Comment:* **A ball which slips out of a pitcher‚Äôs hand and crosses the foul line shall be called a ball; otherwise it will be called no pitch.** This would be a balk with men on base."  How was this not just ruled a "no pitch" and started over?  I need an MLB umpire to give me the exact wording/ruling.
SNY just showed a close up of Edwin taking a breathe and getting ready to throw a pitch while having a giant pitch clock count down layered over the screen like a freaking Action movie (think Speed or the TV show "24"). That shit was suspenseful ü§£ I thought it was cool  Resulted in walk #6
I fell down once on my first warm up pitch because the opposing coach just shoveled sand in the hole at the rubber. I was not thrilled.
I'm still not sure how the mechanics of that "slip" occurred. His back foot just "stumbles" side ways from being planted but his front foot didn't slide or give-out. It kind of looked intentional.... but I'll just get down voted for my flair when really I couldn't care less the team Cabrera plays for.
Still not a fan of this rule.
Was that just a really low ball lol
At the same time, it's on him for having a pretty complicated delivery and having not perfected his repeatability as well as others.
This would still be called a ball even before the pitch clock
Tired: Giving the 4 fingers to intentionally walk someone.  Wired: Giving up 4 pitch violations to intentionally walk someone.
The concern would be people starting a delivery never intending to actually deliver the ball. Pretty sure they'll be a bit less strict as time goes on but obviously this is a situation where feel and leniency would be appreciated from the umps.
But he didn't deliver. He knows how to start the delivery, he just doesn't know how to deliver. And that's really the most important part of the delivery. The delivery. Anybody can just start.
If you argue ‚Äúhe started his delivery in time‚Äù, I think you‚Äôd be therefore arguing ‚Äúhe delivered the ball‚Äù, and that didn‚Äôt look like it touched the strike zone to me.  Angel Hernandez might disagree with me on that last part, though.
Ouch, lmao.
> It had to be like when you step off the curb and misjudge the height.   *Jerry Blevins PTSD*
2 counter arguments:  1) He never began his motion to deliver the pitch because he never actually delivered the pitch. All he did was begin his motion to stumble. No one would argue that a ‚Äúpump fake‚Äù pitch should negate the clock until a real pitch is thrown.  2) Your second bolded section is irrelevant because the problem wasn‚Äôt that the ball slipped out of his hand. It was already an invalid pitch before he dropped it.
u/Ref44
Dumb q: that last bolded part   > A ball which slips out of a pitcher‚Äôs hand and crosses the foul line shall be called a ball; otherwise it will be called no pitch.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Kv8qqFBtHE  In this scenario, Putz just spikes the ball but it doesn't go past the foul line, I guess you can't argue it "slips" out his hand, but it still seems unfair to rule a ball given the circumstance of "being surprised by the stadium". Is this an illegal pitch instead?
If you watch the front camera replay at 0:20 you can see a spike from his front cleat catches on the dirt before he strides and trips him up.
pretty clear his cleat just catches the mound during his stride..
I feel like this is something that happens to every pitcher at least a few times.   He doesn‚Äôt look like he has particularly complex mechanics
If there's no runners on base, it would have been a "no pitch". It's unclear if that rule has been superseded by failing to throw a pitch within the parameters of the pitch clock.
Would it have? There is no one on base and he didn't deliver the pitch so how would it have been a balk and a ball?
I mean if runners were on, there wouldn't be a loophole as that'd be a balk anyway.  With no runners, yeah, maybe should just be up to the ump to rule if it was intentional.
I'm sorry, the umpire says there's nothing we can do.
 u/mispelling   I'm not 100 percent sure what the actual MLB rules are, but in college where we have a similar rule it's a time violation because the pitcher stops the clock by starting and fails to deliver the pitch. Wouldn't surprise me if the pro interpretation is similar
Okay I see it now- his heel kind of gets stuck on the front foot. Really looked fake as hell.
He dropped the ball so yes.
The ball has to pass the foul line which it did not. That would have been nothing without the pitch clock because no one was on base.
Not true dropping the ball on the mound with no one on results in a ball  Edit: Don‚Äôt listen to me I‚Äôm an idiot
You are incorrect. Prior to the action clock it would only be a ball if it crossed the foul line. If it didn't then it would have been nothing with the bases empty or a balk if any were occupied
I just looked it up and you are correct. I mistakenly was just assuming it was a balk therefore a ball was added to the count if no runner is on base‚Ä¶ my bad
No worries. Balks being illegal pitches with the bases empty is a common misconception
I must have been told wrong along the way and was never corrected
Glenn Danzig in the stands
You can't tell me that's not Jesse Plemons
Glad jomboy took this one on. It was really easy for people to assume Anderson was being whiny when he had a pretty legit complaint.   I'd also say it's really hard to expect the home plate umpire to be the one to keep track of when the batter is ready on top of everything else. Like is he supposed to be looking at the batters eyes instead of the pitcher then? On top of preparing to call the pitch itself. It's a lot of things on the umps plate.
How fast did Webb work before the clock?
Rule is too vague and leaves too much discrepancy to the umpire.
While I acknowledge that Jomboy is correct, he's glossing over the ambiguity that presents itself with the eye contact thing. Yeah, Webb starts his motion, but just barely and Anderson appears to be looking straight at him.
At 2:15, isn't Anderson in the box looking at the pitcher?  It seems like his eyes are up, so is the rule that the batter is engaged with the pither (which he appears to be), or is it that he's engaged, and then set?   I thought it was the former, but Jomboy seems to be arguing that its the latter.
As a casual watcher, wouldn't this problem be solved by not allowing pitcher to pitch before 8 seconds on the clock?   Batters already need to come set before 8 seconds anyway.
This whole rule is dumb and no one asked for it. Want to shorten games get rid of the four minute commercial breaks between innings.
I can appreciate an effort to bring back the devil-lock
Deek the house elf on the mound
Thought it was Doyle
I do have sympathy for the ump here because's there's a lot of moving parts but Timmy seemed to take that time out and specifically point to the ump that Logan had been working very quickly and was borderline on a few pitches.   Re-watching the pitches through the Jomboy vid, there were one or two prior to the one that caused the ruckus that I was sure were the ones Tim took offense to.  Would've hoped that taking the time to bring attention to it might've primed the ump to spot it. Then that called strike on Luis lol, glad Jomboy called that out.
> I'd also say it's really hard to expect the home plate umpire to be the one to keep track of when the batter is ready on top of everything else.  The umps aren't the ones keeping track - the pitch clock operator has a buzzer that the umps wear to let them know when there's been a violation specifically so the umpire doesn't need to be watching the clock.
Pretty fast
People keep saying ‚Äúeye contact‚Äù, but the rule doesn‚Äôt say that at all.  It says the batter must be ‚Äúalert‚Äù before the pitcher comes set.  If the batter is still swinging his bat in a circle or not looking at the pitcher, he obviously isn‚Äôt alert.  If this is too much for Umps to follow, just make it reviewable.  The ump should (and has) call the pitcher for being set when the batter isn‚Äôt even in the box.
Agreed. I love Jomboy. But this video is slowed down, making it seem more definitive than it is in real time.
The [rule](https://img.mlbstatic.com/mlb-images/image/upload/mlb/wqn5ah4c3qtivwx3jatm.pdf) is it's a quick pitch if the the batter is not "reasonably set" (which doesn't seem to be defined anywhere)  > Rule 6.02(a)(5) Comment: A quick pitch is an illegal pitch. Umpires will judge a quick pitch as one delivered before the batter is **reasonably set** in the batter‚Äôs box. With runners on base the penalty is a balk; with no runners on base, it is a ball. The quick pitch is dangerous and should not be permitted
The purpose of the rule isn't to enforce a minimum amount of time between pitches though. It's written that way to enable both players to go if they're both ready.
Commercial breaks are two minutes and they did shorten them in 2019.
Commercials weren't the reason why games were getting longer each and every year
Tim wasn't wrong, rules-wise, but he also probably shouldn't stare right at the pitcher if he's not ready yet.
That just tells them the time threshold got reached but they don't call if they see the batter is ready or pitcher started their motion right?
in 2022 he had a tempo of 13.9, good for 78th in the league out of 323 eligible pitchers. top quarter, pretty quick
Maybe Anderson should have just stepped back in and been ready instead of pointlessly spinning his bat a bunch of times. You know, the exact thing this rule is trying to get rid of.
>Umpires will judge a quick pitch as one **delivered** before the batter is **reasonably set**  At the same time that sentence refers to the pitch being "delivered." Webb starting his windup still theoretically gives TA time to get set before the pitch is delivered, but TA abandoning the pitch before getting set ensures it's a quick pitch by this rule's wording. Sort of encourages hitters to do just what TA did here and abandon the pitch rather than bear down and try to hit in case the umpire misses it. That seems like a recipe for controversy to me, and maybe the wording on the rule could be shored up a bit to avoid that.
Ah, okay. Thanks for the info.
And the players still have to warm up lol...
With the new rule he's much more likely to be caught off guard with a quick pitch, regardless of whose fault it is. If that pitch is wild he's going to be wanting to have his head up. This seems more like a problem with the rule than him looking at the pitcher when clearly not ready. There needs to be some clear indicator that both players are set for the pitch.
Part of me wonders if it'd make sense to try and adjust his stance a bit where his eyes don't come up until the bat is ready. That said, think that's much easier in theory than in practice when you've got the muscle memory in place.
I believe the clock operator is watching for those things and buzzing them down so the ump doesn't get two buzzes an at bat. The point is for the home plate ump not to need to have it in the back of their mind at all until they get a buzz.
Dawg, he is in the box. On time. This whole situation occurs with a solid 2 seconds left before Anderson is legally supposed to be "engaged." Maybe you should try being less of a douche.
I think the key word there is "umpires will judge", if the ump feels like the batter is reasonably set and then the batter backs away it'll just be a strike like the case here.
And the networks still need advertising to justify their investment in the broadcast rights. Fewer commercials would just mean more glaring advertisements during the game and on/around the field area, or much cheaper TV contracts, and some teams' \*cough\*Dodgers\*cough\* finances count on the big TV contract.
>Dawg, he is in the box. On time.  Then he should be ready to hit. Why does he step into the box, look at the ground, spin his bat. If you're in the box, its time to hit. The second he looks up, your engaged and then the pitchers motion started
Right? Like he steps out of the box, diddles around, then steps into the box, looks at the pitcher, and then needs more time to diddle around?
That's rough
He's had shoulder problems for a few years now, hope he can get healthy
Allard for Odorizzi, Allard starting season on 60 day‚Ä¶what a blockbuster
I don't forsee much of anything out of the rest of his career. I may be wrong and maybe all his struggles have been injury related, but this coming off a disappointing season doesn't inspire a lot of confidence.
I think this is a contract season for him too. That‚Äôs a bummer.
Hard trade to lose, but we managed it.
His shoulder got divorced
Poor Odo.
Who could‚Äôve predicted the most injury prone rotation in baseball would experience an injury.  Still sucks for Rangers fans, sorry guys.
A de-what?
ouchie
Its Overizzi
Sorry to hear that! I‚Äôll put some chicken bones and incense candles around my Jake Odorizzi bobble head, in the hope to speed his recovery.
Odorizzinti
that sounds horrible jeez
Yeah this is rough. Always seemed like a good guy
Jake Odorizzi wasn‚Äôt expected to be in the rotation. He was like the 8th starter
I don't know how many injuries the rangers have had to their rotation over the past 3ish years but I'll be impressed if it's beyond the Tigers.
No, that‚Äôt the name of the post-surgery pain medication.
How does it feel to only have SEVEN starters?
Oh my bad, yeesh you guys have 8 starters
Idk he was in all the "Warning to the West" posts about the Rangers rotation. Seemed like he was expected to be a starter in the mix.  EDIT: This is what I was referencing. I've since learned that apparently the Rangers had an 8 man starting rotation and because I don't follow Rangers beat writers, I was unaware of that. So I went based off what national accounts stated.   https://twitter.com/MLBONFOX/status/1608191061951905792
Much better than having 3 starters we had barely last year
Well they‚Äôve spend a lot of assets via trade or free agency on it
what are you talking about, there have been none of those this year
He was behind,   deGrom  Eovaldi   Martin Perez  Jon Gray  Andrew Heaney  Dane Dunning   And Cole Ragans took a step ahead in spring training.   Glenn Otto might have even been ahead
I feel like every time we played you last year there was a new guy on the mound.
https://twitter.com/MLBONFOX/status/1608191061951905792
https://twitter.com/MLBONFOX/status/1608191061951905792
16 different players started for us but only 5 made more than 10 starts and of those 5 only Jon Gray and Martin Perez are still in the starting rotation this year, the other 3 are bullpen guys this year
oh you mean something *not posted by the team* four months ago?
I‚Äôm sorry, what does MLB on Fox have to do with the Texas Rangers actual plans?
Gray and P√©rez are the two I remember.
Did I say "Rangers explicitly said this"?  No, I mentioned the types of posts I saw, which included Odorizzi.
Did you read my original comment?  > Idk he was in all the "Warning to the West" posts about the Rangers rotation. Seemed like he was expected to be a starter in the mix.
Well they were the only two good starters so makes sense
Was it being sarcastic? Cause if so sorry
And here I thought I was losing it in my old age.
