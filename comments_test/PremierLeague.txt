No but Haaland probably will.
Like ever? Yeah probably
Ever? 100%  In next five years? Probably
That's a dumb question to ask
Yes. Look at Arsenal last year or Liverpool a few years back. Both looked shambles for awhile, and both bounced back and won*. (Arsenal still has to finish)  It’s not like they are Tottenham…
I don't think it's a hot take that United will win a prem again before Spurs.
No, they are finished at the top level.  Man City are miles ahead of them.
If they can lure a manager with potential to bring them back to their glory days....IF. And IF that day comes,(god I fecking hope not)the reds will go back to the days of being Man Utd's bitch. 🤮
What a stupid question…of course they won’t…
Yes... United are a club in the "too big to fail" category along with Bayern, Barca, Madrid, Liverpool, Ajax etc.  These kinds of clubs may go through shit phases but they have massive fanbases, lots of history and lots of money. They'll always rebound unless something catastrophic happens.
Honestly Arsenal has impressed me the most this season. I won’t be surprised if they win the league from here. The players have insane winning mentality. Credit goes to Arteta.
Haha you are right. But I think they still have problems. Their Recruitment has been poor. Fans hate the owners so much. But if the club is sold they might hire right people and bring the club back to the glory days
Like him if he's on my team...hate him anywhere else.
You have your own sub,right? Everyone else thinks he’s a petulant child.
If he didn’t play for Man U, he would have been suspended for half the season for the shit he pulls
Absolutely despise that rat fuck
Truly a player in the prem
Eh there are better Brunos out there
Sulky rat-face.
Who?
Never heard of em
I'm not sure I've ever seen a player I've liked less, or found to be anywhere near as overrated as Penandes
We don't talk about Bruno, oh no.
I’ll tell you this.   He’s one of those players who lives life on the pitch, and lives life off the pitch.  There’s a lot to be said about that.
He's a proper whiny cunt but Jesus can we have this sub free of Bruno posts every fucking week?
Never heard of him
I don’t
Good player but he should not be wearing the armband
Imma keep my opinion to myself thank you. This ain't where I need to be.
I think he is a very good playmaker in the league with only KDB and Odegaard better. However his positioning is sometimes awkward
Wonderful player. My captain!  One thing I notice about him is he's easily discouraged and gives up. When the team are 2 down, he doesn't even try AT ALL!!!  He feels if we're going to lose the game, we might as well lose by whatever amount. He's only interested in winning or drawing... not keeping respectable score lines.  I know cos I used to be like that too. The good thing is those types of personalities are very ambitious... however you don't want them for mundane activities.
I think he carries himself well
Go back to your hole of a subreddit lol
Skillful and extremely whinny.
I wish he were more expressive. I never know what he is feeling.  I have had adult conversations about Bruno rarely, but he is creative, skilled and amusing.
Ffs
Cry baby
I don't like him...i think united deserves a better class of players
A great footballer who'll do anything to win. Doesn't try to act like a good boy and would appeal even if given an inch to do so. The only other player who's as dirty as him is Suarez who made people like you just as salty.
One of the players of all time
He’s pretty
100 G/A in 150 appearances for a club that hasn't been consistent. Is that what you call "overrated"  Just admit that you rats are just salty because he'll play dirty and give everything on the pitch for the team to win and isn't a good boy who's all smiles.
No
Obviously trolling. He carries himself worse than anyone in the league. I genuinely don't think it's even close. Surely even a Man U fan could see he doesn't carry himself well, even if you don't think he's the worst.
You are taking the piss
Ok Bruno. Put the phone down.
So he's Ozil, but with a worse attitude, worse professionalism, and more penalty shots?  That's the case you want to make for him?  If that's all you have, yes, overrated, even more so than Ozil has a reputation for.
What do you mean he is up there with one of the best in the league
Don't blame Ozil for the rest of your players around him being hot trash back then. Maybe if your team was as good as real madrid back then you wouldn't be moaning about that.   But I guess it's typical of an Arsenal fan to turn against a player and call him overrated when things didn't work out for him at arsenal.  Newsflash, he doesn't have to prove anything. He's already played great football and won multiple trophies with Germany and Real Madrid. Not winning a trophy at your tinpot club doesn't make him "overrated" because not winning is what is expected of Arsenal.
He is a complete cunt. I doubt anybody has carried themselves less well in the history of the premier League.
Someone is real upset that their favorite player is overrated, aren't they? Had to make an ass out of themselves with incorrect assumptions just because Penandes and his stats aren't as magical as they thought?   BTW  Gunner Ozil >>>> dirty Fernandez
Hilarious 😂,myopic or what …so the  jailbird scrote Adams  carried himself better …throw in some drunk driving , and smashing his car into somebody’s front garden 🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊
Congratulations to Vincent. What a guy.  One of the best footballing sides the Championship has seen.
Meanwhile the prem doesn’t even have the slightest clue which of like 7 teams are getting relegated
Burnley in good kompany this season
Peps School are flying this year. What an achievement.
Gonna be crazy to have Burnley in the PL and them *not* playing with 11 men behind the ball. They may well end up going straight back down, who can really say at this point, but they'll go down in style if they do.
Congratulations, Burnley, and welcome back
They played good football and deserve it. Another team I'd like to see promoted would be Middleborough.
Great to see a young coach (& ex great-player) doing so well. Great to see Burnley bounce back PL … good luck
I will 100% be happy with us being called "Vincent Kompany's Burnley^^TM" if he does well in the Premier League.   Let's roll on 2023/24!
Villa fan here, great to see Burnley back as one of the originals. We just need to get Darwin back now...
Well done. Bouncing back at the first attempt is no mean feat. Great work by Kompany.
Great!  If West Ham manage to stay up somehow, everyone would be playing Aston Villa thrice.  On the other hand if West Ham get relegated, it'd be like they never left.
Booooooring
Not to rain on their parade, but they are gonna go straight back down the way they are playing.
the original brexit football is returning
Meeting Burnley next season will hit different
Burnley have been steady all season. Exactly like Kompany was when he was playing. Neat, no-nonsense , matter of fact football.... Wuold be good to see them in the Prem again
Apprentices of Pep in the Prems - Arterta and Vincent Kompany next season
Welcome back Brexit Burnley!  Happy for Kompany, but not much else. Burnley for years was the shit that wouldn't flush.
My money on atleast one of them
Southampton   Leicester City  West Ham  Bournemouth will survive by something small like GD or FP
fuck the title race, relegation is the fire this season.
Leicester please so we can get Maddison for cheap 🤣
I see you.
They have a Brazilian winger!!! A BRAZILIAN WINGER FOR BURNLEY
I'd like to see them do a Fulham and come in and exceed expectations
Wonder why lol (Carrick)
That famous fella said the same about Wrecksham!
It's not Brexit football anymore.
I'd go so far as to put my money on three of them.
I think Southampton for sure but not positive who the other two will be
West Ham is the spiciest one to get relegated. Teams will be circling around Declan Rice like sharks smelling blood in the water.
With the amount of money you lot have now you can pay up
He has done a fantastic job for the team
they’ll most likely go back to it in the prem, they won’t survive playing this football.
Which three though?
Curious where JWP ends up. Crime to see him in the Championship.
I’d like to see him up just for the fact he’s a geordie and a Newcastle fan (and would also be good to have a geographically close team here in the PL)
Likely has a relegation clause in the contract to trigger either an immediate release or heavy compensation to stay
Feel like he will go to Tottenham for some reason.
Spurs probably
Yeah how would they know lol obviously assuming it’s not an adult using a child’s ticket
If you have a wheelchair ticket and are walking in they might get suspicious.
It is illegal for somebody to giuve you their ticket. It is against the law to use a ticket in somebody else's name.  Will you get caught? Probably not.  However, this law exists for a reason. Obey it.
No you won’t be allowed in.
Brighton checks, and has banned several season ticket holders for doing this.
Absolutely not. As a Chelsea fan he's incredible. Spurs would be bottom half without him, he does everything in their attack, he starts the attack, continues it and finishes it. He's an incredible striker
I mean he's been one of the best strikers in the last decade. I don't think many people rate him any more than that.
22 PL goals this season.  6th time he's scored more than 20 goals in a PL season.  Likely to be 2nd highest all-time PL scorer by the end of the season, and is only the 3rd player to score over 200.  England's all time record scorer, and Tottenham's all time record scorer with 272 goals.  32 of his 205 PL goals so far have been penalties (\~15%).  55 of Alan Shearers 260 were penalties (21%) and 23 of Rooney's (11%) were penalties.  Aguero has 27 penalties from his 184 goals (\~15%).  His 0.66 goals per match in the PL is higher than Shearer's at 0.59, Rooney's at 0.42, and only a smidge less than Aguero at (0.67).  &#x200B;  He's on target to be the highest goalscorer in the PL in maybe 2 or 3 seasons and could hit 300 goals in the league before he calls it a day (his average per season is above 20).  His penalty % is less than shearer, on par with Aguero, and could end up lower than Rooney's.  &#x200B;  Let's be honest:  why does he get treated like he's been on a purple patch for 10 seasons, and is falsely criticised for things that his peers are not?
He is world class, but this guy in the most important matches just disappears. I remember the week he played against AC Milan and Forest. He was invisible against Milan and got two goals against forest.   He is a really good player, but there is a reason why he doesn't have any trophies. If Kane was a winner he wouldn't be in spurs right now.  I don't think we can keep saying "if he had a better team, he would have x amount of trophies", good players would have left ages ago.
No, not at all.  What a silly question.
Course not. You don't score and create that many goals in a side like Spurs without being world class. He was loyal to a fault though and is now exiting his prime.  If he went to a genuinely elite side 5 years ago and won major trophies then he'd possibly be spoken of in the same breath as Lewa and Benz.
Let’s be honest: You’re a twat lol
Only knock you could put against him is he’s been a virtual no-show in finals.   Then again you could also say, so have the teams behind him, so it’s not just a Harry Kane specific problem.
If anything he’s massively underrated. To score and create that many in this spurs side shows how good he is.
No.  He's fucking incredible...  and i say this as an arsenal fan but also as someone who watches football and has a functioning set of eyes.
Nah he’s genuinely world class and has been for at least 5 years
No. Genuine world class player.
It's just the club where he decided to play, as simple as that, however, we will never know what would have been if Kane had played for a big European club.
It should be him wrapped in gold on the top of the stadium. Not a chicken.
Nah, his diving record is under talked but he’s legit World Class. His World Cup golden boot was Salenko levels of unimpressive though.
Quite over rated. Hasn't won anything, and typically goes missing in big games. He's a very good player, but the English bias makes it seem like he's prime Benzema.
I wouldn’t say he’s over rated. He is very good, very smart, but I’ve always felt he kind of got castrated or neutered, as in no fire, drive, passion nor stamina. I don’t know It’s hard to explain.
No. How?
Nah I do think he is a world class player but playing for a team that hasn't been doing well for a while.  He's scoring lots of goals with the current support he has now, and I can't imagine how much more he'd have with a more proper one.
No, just sucks for him that he plays for tottenham
Oh absolutely   Great striker and player but he has never been the best of his generation.
He's underrated
If he’s world class why has no club ever bid a ridiculous amount of money for him, he’s no Mbappe or Benzema. Besides he plays for Spurs, if he was world class he wouldn’t still be playing for them.
Can't be great without achieving greatness
Over rated.  Can never be considered world class until he actually wins something.
In comparison to Lewandowski or Benzema I think I’d know who I choose and he’s not in the same league as the two
Imagine how mny he would score if he played for Man City.
If he was THAT special, man city would have got him by now. They haven’t missed him one bit. He’s not that outstanding, but still you can’t deny he’s very good.
Coming from someone who doesn't like Harry Kane much, no he is not overrated. Kane is an excellent striker and any team would be lucky to have him leading the line. His record speaks for itself.
No, nor is Son.
He fails to be present in big games. Always.
He is the right man in the wrong team.  Spurs don't deserve him.
Thank you, I feel like 95% of users post something like ***”xxxx is overrated”*** or ***”xxxx is better than yyyy- what do you think?”*** or ***”the premier league needs this new rule”*** have only been watching the PL for like 2 years max.. google the history people! Google this stuff! It’s all statistically recorded! All the numbers and facts you need are on the internet- **look them up and then post something**
He isn’t “falsely criticized”. He generally gets a free pass from the press despite being a relatively dirty player.   To the extent people remain unconvinced it’s largely because he hasn’t won a trophy or delivered in the big international games.
How can he be both world class AND disappear in big games?
World class players drag their teams over the finish line. Messi at WC. Fat Ronaldo at WC. Greasy Ronaldo at Euros / in CL. Maradona in WC. They’ve managed to win tournaments with average or slightly above average team mates.   Kane has gone missing in the big games for whatever reason. Euro final v Italy. WC semi final v Croatia. CL final with Spurs. He’s definitely a top player but not sure he’s at the same level as truly world class players.
His only mistake is sticking with Spurs since they don't have trophy-winning aspirations
Bull shyt.
Kane's record is very comparable to Benzema's, and he did that whilst playing for Spurs.  Kane has also scored 18 more goals for England than Benzema has for France, in 15 less games. We all know which national team gets viewed as better (everyone constantly goes on about how overrated English players are), so what Kane has done at international level is outstanding, given they both have the same opportunities to play the same level of opposition.
Benzema being treated like this all timer because of one good season is hilarious.   He's a good striker but he's not one of the greats like people pretend he is.
I think the issue is a lot of people don’t understand the concept of something being under/overrated.  You could apply it to Harry Kane, The Beatles or Winston Churchill and it’s still be the same exact same issue.
Have you missed the last week where the headlines were "Kane shouldn't have reacted to his eyeballs being clawed at" rather than "Doucore tries to claw Kane's eyeballs out"?   Do you know of any other player in PL history who has had a TV wheeled out to him on a post-match interview and been asked to explain why he went over under contact in the box?
I don't know what world class is, this sub had 10k threads about what world class is. I fucked up lol.   Anyway Harry Kane really good, but he also not that good!
Name a world class player who won fuck all.
Kane has been getting away with murder for years. In particular, no major press outlet has ever called him out for that dangerous thing he does where he backs under defenders who out jump him (look it up there are whole compilations of him doing it).  This is the first time I know of that he has been held to account for any of his antics. He has benefited from being the England captain, received favorable referring decisions for years, and hasn’t faced the scrutiny he deserves (particularly for diving).
Bollocks is it.   Shearer used to elbow and kick players in the head and was never called out for it.  Salah and Fernandes are in a league of their own in immunity from both referees and media.  All you're doing is applying goonerblinkers.
Probably. But the Shearer thing proves my point about the England captain being untouchable. And as for wheeling out the TV, I remember Eduardo getting absolutely lambasted by the press for two straight weeks because of a dive (he did dive in fairness but the pearl clutching was ridiculous).
Seeing as his team are facing Spurs next there’s nothing like a bit of mind games.
City fans boutta rep their boy hard rn.
Haaland is the better striker but Kane is the better player. Kane can make things happen in a weaker team
That’s certainly an opinion one can have
Obviously not met Ivan Toney
De Zerbi knows   I think every team in the league probably takes Kane over Haaland, deep down…  Kane scores as well as Erl’s, but also creates, playmakes, and the team would concede fewer too
Kane has consistently been this good for 8 years, please don’t compare him to someone who just came into the prem
Not that hot of a take, if you replace Haaland with Kane I’d argue he’d get somewhat to a similar number. Haaland at spurs tho? Idk
I think this isn’t that hot of a take. If he played for city this would be an accepted fact. He plays for a defensive struggling team and still puts up 20 a season and around 10 assists every year. I don’t think he’s the best but to laugh at the suggestions so arrogant
De Zerbi sounds like he’s angling for the Tottenham job
He if De Zerbi said it then fair I beieve it
BHA to get top 4 and sign Harry Kane next season confirmed
It’s good to see most people agreeing with this.
And Harry Mcguire is the best defender
He's right
I’m not going to say he’s wrong
Christ there are some deluded takes here. Kane has been a consistent top striker, playmaker, and all around performer at Spurs, and with Son are almost single handedly the reason they have hit top 4 so many times in the last decade.  Almost like these deluded Kane haters have forgotten that fact.   "bUt No TrOpHiEs", I'm sure he's crying into his WC golden boot, multiple Prem golden boots, and soon to be his top scorer in the Prem record..  As a Leeds fan sure I like Haaland more because he was born here but I'm not deluded like a lot of people in the comments are. His record this year is really impressive but Kane's been doing it for 8 years, and in the Prem for 12.
Well, Kane doesn’t need robot parts so there is that.
Haaland is so clear… 9 more g/a and 3 less games played
Facts
I see no lie
That’s just nuts.  All talk of generational talents aside Haaland right now is just on a different level.  I don’t care if he’s being fed by the best system, if he ended up elsewhere and wasn’t doing as well he might not be, but he is at Citeh and it is just ridiculous.
Nope. But his consistency is awsome.
Probably
As good as haaland is with his crazy knack for being in the right place, kane is the best striker in the league. If he won a couple of trophies he would be no doubt best striker of all time in prem. He's got everything a striker needs
If you have working eyes and understand football this is really obvious
As far as goal scoring is concerned Haaland is definitely the king “this year” but Kane is a complete player. In fact, in my opinion, he will be a lot more productive if he plays attacking midfield, ala De Bruyne.
English striker
10 points on opinions your uncle says after he’s had too many to drink and has become deluded?
Maybe so but he’s got fuck all to show for it. Every season is the same
Ok, that’s factually wrong but it’s his opinion
Ok we don't know, but it is Very, Very, Very, Very unlikely he is better than KDB, because if he was   He would be playing in that position!!
Says the trophy cabinet of totanham lol
Kane is really good but barely cracks the top five prem strikers this szn
So we forgetting bout the robot in our leuge Erling Haaland?
Yeah hes not too bad is he!
He has proven himself, I would like to see him in another team.
Codswallop.
The copium is strong in this one, a lot of english people wanking off Kane for being the better player, because he would score sooo many goals in a good team. Well how about actually showing it instead of speculating? It's like saying Haaland is only 22 and will become greater than Ronaldo. It's all speculation, as for the time being Haaland is showing he is levels above Kane.
Wegost is better then both
No point with this sub. I'd rather watch people claim Kane would outscore Haaland if he were at City.
Americans just finishing work so yeah
City fan here, Calvert-Lewin is better.  Reason? He's great in my Fifa 23 Ultimate Team.
I'd even say kane is the better striker simply from experience, Haaland might be better in one very specific role but kane is the more adapt and experienced striker overall
And 18 year old Haaland didn't score for fun against Napoli and Liverpool when in Salzburg, and vs PSG for Dortmund? Nevermind the fact he has a fantastic goalscoring record for his mediocre national team. Kane being a "better" player is just a bunch of nonsense.
Haaland is true elite. He'd adapt if playing in a weaker team.
Seems like you are implying Haaland is _so_ clear
I love Haland. Him and Kane are just two completely different players. Kane is like De Bruyne and Lewandowski mixed into one while Haland is a goal-scoring alien, for whom I can’t even think of any apt comparisons. Bit of Cristiano and Zlatan maybe?
Everyone else is playing for second
I think the thing a lot of people miss in this sub is how much better Haaland can and will get. He’s so far from a finished product.
You put Kane in that same Man City team and he might have already broken the record. Unfortunately it seems like he does all that playmaking because he feels he has to, and I've yet to see him play on a team where it's not true. The closest was the England team, but by putting Sterling in the starting XI over Saka I think Southgate severely handicapped Kane.
If Man City had gotten Kane in 2021, I honestly thing they’d be unstoppable. Kane can link up, pass, and be so deadly shooting that he’d fit in perfectly with Guardiola’s system.   Also just being a bigger body in a team that usually has shorter players would help defensively. Haaland is just more one-dimensional than Kane in a system that relies on very well rounded players
How does he score as well? Are they level on goals or hattricks?   I agree he is more well rounded and better passer and general player but come Haaland is the best goal scorer in world football.  I mean city didn't choose kane so that argument doesn't mean too much.
Playmaker Kane on his *checks notes* 2 assists. Wow.   Haaland is on 5.   And scoring a goal every 118 minutes isn’t the same as every 76 minutes. In fact, Kane is closer to Ivan Toney and Marcus Rashford in terms of m/g than he is to Haaland.
Not a single team would take Kane over Haaland. One is young and one is old.
This is all just BS, Harry Kane has 3 less assists in the league than Haaland while being 6 goals ahead. Kane is an old man who the fuck takes Kane over Erling?
For a single season maybe, but the age difference should sway things longer term.
You genuinely think City would rather have Kane over Haaland when the latter has scored 42 goals this season? Including 8 goals in his last two games.....  Not to mention the fact that Haaland has more assists this season than Kane and City have conceded 15 less goals than Spurs this season so your whole statement is absolutely baseless.
Who told you Kane is a better playmaker? What do you base that on as Haaland is on 5 assists and Kane is on 2 assists?
Maybe he can get as many assists as haaland one of these years
Best striker should be based on current form though.
Lmao. Laughable kane fans at it again. Kane can never perform under pressure matches, proven that years after years. If he was that good really he would be in a bigger club.
No way Kane is getting Haaland’s number. Kane is great in the PL, Haaland is probably the best striker in the whole world now.
Has everyone forgotten Haaland's insane goalscoring record for Dortmund, Salzburg and the Norwegian NT? It's absolutely insane how everyone has stopped rating Haaland purely because he plays for City. As soon as a player signs for City people stop rating them because of the other players at the club.  Haaland is obviously the best striker in the world right now and the fact that he plays for City has nothing to do with that. How many goals do you think Haaland would get at Spurs?
We have been absolutely shit all season. He hardly touches the ball most games and has 20 goals. Hope he leaves, gets some trophies and respect
Of course a bin dipper wouldn't want City or their players getting credit.....
Even though he is?
Harry Kane has never reached the same level as Haaland who's a Ballon d'Or contender.  Peak > Longevity
In a far better team, Spurs are terrible and Kane’s still managed to get 22 goal
Except everytime Spurs (or England...) gets close to anything he always crumbles.
I see one player scoring more than the other.....
Kane is nowhere near KDB, he may be a better all round player than Haaland, but he is not as good a striker.  He is the best English/British player in the league though
No, best striker
Yeah, just shitloads of goals, personal accolades and records and millions and millions of pounds.   How does he sleep at night?
Ha. Ha. Ha, got everyone laughing at this joke that people have been throwing around every second they can, you're so creative and funny
Okay this is the worst take in the thread anyway. Name the 5? Haaland is the only other one in the conversation. For the record Haaland gets my vote, Kane second
holy fuck
Switch kane and haaland’s clubs and what do you think happens
hes not better than kane
Put Kane in that team and the record would already be broken.
Haaland has not shown that he is above Kane, or has the ability to become better than Ronaldo.  Haaland can do one thing and one thing only.
Nah Chris Wood Clear
Goals against Argentina in wc Wout:2 Parry pane and paaland:0
I want to hate on this post but I liked him at Wolfsburg..def not better than Kane or Haaland though
Humor is important especially if you’re a United fan.
Who?
Haaland has played very different roles in all the clubs he has played for, so what the hell are you talking about?
City tried for Kane because haaland was unavailable, then haaland was available and Kane was irrelevant
Way to miss the point….
Not for norway though
Would’ve said that if I wanted to say that
He might just be saying that 28 goals is more than 22 and that 5 assists is more than 2.   Especially when that’s in 3 fewer games played
Haaland is ‘so clear’ and you’re a fool to think otherwise
No, you HAVE to pick one!!!!! Both can't be world class!!!!/s
Maybe that’s true… but today, he isn’t.   De Zerbi is talking about now, today, not 2028
True but it's like comparing a Eric cantona to a ruud
People said that about Rooney at the same age, but he peaked very young. Of course, he remained a top player but was never as explosive and unpredictable. All it takes is one bad injury (like Shearer), or a series of minor ones (like Owen or Giggs), and he'll need to adapt his game.
I doubt he’s going to progress into the type of striker Kane is, his play style isn’t going to change because his strengths are so obvious.
They did choose Kane though...but Tottenham didn't want to sell
Because while Haaland had Kyle Walker and KBD feeding him, Kane had Emerson Royal and Skipp…  Put Kane in that city team, and he puts up an better number of G+A and City conceded fewer because he’s better off the ball and at keeping. Possession
This is the same question people have been saying about Messi/Ronaldo for a decade, though. And the consistent perception seems to be you would rather have Messi. As others have said as well, you can't compare the level of service the two players get either. Kane has to create his own chances where Haaland gets to pounce on them when presented to him.
Haaland doesn't have to drop deep to defend and to create chances. Also, Man City are one of the most attacking team in history. It's unfair to compare what Kane does at Tottenham to what Haaland does with Man city. One on one with the keeper, I don't know if there is as much of a difference between them both. Haaland gets to do that a lot more than Kane because of the team around him.
Yeah, because this season is the only one that counts. What is history anyway?
Well City were certainly ready to make that choice last season. This isn’t FIFA career mode.  You could argue that (despite his already ridiculous goal return) having Haaland in the team has made City less fluid in their play style, being part of the reason they’re not yet again running away with the league. They’re more predictable as the game plan is clearly some variation of “get the ball to Haaland in or around the box” every game. Having Kane in that team, with his ridiculous passing and playmaking ability, would have made them more versatile.
only thing Haaland has on Kane here is age
Immediately flag yourself as being a child who only started watching the premier league in the last 2 years…  Kane’s been at this for 8 seasons straight, and even scored the most goals and provided the most assists in a single season. Something that hadn’t been done in over 2 decades.  Haaland’s a monster and has room to get better, but context absolutely matters and if Kane was in that City team I absolutely guarantee you he’d be tearing it up and producing the same numbers if not better. He’s in the prime of his career FFS  Also lmao at old man comment like elite strikers can’t play well into their 30s these days - Lewandoski and Zlatan being 2 prime examples for you
That assumes City under Peo and Spurs are equal quality teams… They’re not
Because football exists beyond 8 months  Who is he meant to assist? Who in that team is scoring?
Watkins on top of the world
Kane has 22 goals with this dreadful spurs team, where he’s both the playmaker and goal scorer. Haaland only has 6 more despite playing on the most overpowered team this league has filled with world class passers and playmakers in almost each position, Kane has literally been slowly creeping up on Haaland’s goals lately.   and if we’re going on form you do realise the likes of Isak/wilson  & Watkins have currently been performing the best
can never perform under pressure matches yet only Mo Salah has had more G/A against the big 6 compared to Kane in the last couple of years? yeah makes a lot of sense, you expect Kane to turn into superman when no one else on the team is capable of playing good enough.  he hasn’t left spurs because of Levy, Man City wanted him badly in 2020 he would’ve been gone a long time ago.
It’s past your bedtime mate. You’ve outed yourself as a 12 year old bandwagon fan.
I mean Kane only has 6 less goals and plays for a much worse team, not saying he's miles clear but arguably the better player overall.
Mate if you were up top in that city team you’d be banging goals as well. Saying there’s no way one of the best strikers of this generation would get similar numbers in that city team is absurd
Go watch any Tottenham game and then ask yourself how Kane could possibly be on 22 goals so far this season. Dude gets like 2 half chances a game if he's lucky. To think he would bag 28 goals or more in arguably the best attacking team in Europe is not even close to controversial.
Except he’s been nominated twice. Playing for a much weaker team and was a huge part of the reason that team finished in the top 4, punching well above their financial weight multiple times over the last 6 seasons. Oh, and also played a big role in getting that team to a fucking CL final.  Clearly you haven’t been paying attention to football for long enough, because the context of what Kane has done at Spurs, a club who have historically been a mid table cup team for 3 decades prior to his emergence, compared to Haaland coming into the most stacked and gifted team in the PL, isn’t really comparable.  Kane would be putting up the same, if not better numbers if he was playing in that City team right now. He’s an incredible all-round player and is in the peak of his career right now.
Wow, your name is accurate, you really are biased!
So what? The top scorer in the PL doesn't always play for the best team.
Kane’s team being shit doesn’t change the fact that Haaland outperforms him
Normally down to the rest of the shitty spurs squad tbf
Ok…keep in mind there was two things i mentioned
Well, we don’t know if he is or not because he’s never been used in that role.
wtf is this dumb narrative of him not being a good striker, he’s in the top 3 strikers from the last generation just behind the likes of Suarez and Lewa.
He must be French then
Cry
Take out Kanes pens and he’s no more impactful than Toney, rashford, hell even isak and Wilson give him a run for his money over the past month or two.
Irrelevant because Haaland would never have signed for Spurs in the first place.
He is much better than Kane. Only delusional english fans with deny that. If he was that good big clubs would already buy him no matter what money. Never ever that guy has performed well under pressure.
Parry Pane 💀
Parry Pain being a ~~not~~ very obvious reference to his goalkeeping shenanigans after he scored that hattrick in that game years ago
You heard me wegost
I think he was talking about how Kane is a better player.
21 goals in 23 caps...
Bro he plays for Norway
Yes only top scorer in last edition of nations league, what a shit player amirite.
Sure
Playing with de Bruyne and Rodri surely is also more than playing with Skipp and a washed Son...  I am not discrediting Haaland, not even saying he may not be ahead atm, just that the gap between the 2 is not big
Right. So I dont agree with you and that makes me a fool, even though you havent provided a single reason for your argument... not sure your logic is flawless tbh
Bro Haaland now is way better than Gary Lineker now
I think if oil rich citeh wanted him they could have got him.
They chose Kane when haaland was available but once haaland was available they didn’t even consider Kane
Except he doesn't. Haaland has better positioning, better finishing and is stronger and faster. Kane is a better passer, I guess? Though it doesn't translate into assists, where haaland is also better this season.
Then why doesn't Kane look like he's at another level playing in the national team? His goal production isn't better with a more skilled team.  Or is that not his fault?
Look at xG then, Kane performs slightly worse than Haaland, so how come you actually think he would score more than Haaland?
Because Haaland clearly wasn't leaving in 2021, was he? City could of gone back in for Kane last year and Kans would of jumped at the chance of joining City just like he was trying to do back in 2021. Yet City forgot about Kane and did everything they could to sign Haaland.
and pace, and height and strength, etc. but other than THAT.         To be honest if I was Man City and got a choice I'd take both.
And height, pace and strength. You know, things that are vital to making a world class striker...  People will really say ANYTHING to discredit City and their players ffs.
Sorry I disagree, been watching since I was a boy in the 80s and I think it’s unfair to say Kane is better because he has been doing it for 8 seasons. If anything the fact that Haaland hasn’t had 8 seasons of premier league experience and is still scoring and creating more means he will only preform better in the future.   I am by no means hating on Harry Kane as he is a fantastic player but as a city fan I wouldn’t want him and didn’t want him last season when they were making a bid, we have an old team in some of the important spots. Which means we need someone like Erling who will just rise and rise through the years.   I also refuse to believe that if spurs had Haaland up front instead of Kane it would change things. Harry has a fourth of the physicality Haaland has and that is being generous.
Haaland has 9 goals in the last 3 games
Dreadful at 5th...        Kane has 24 goals for Spurs this seasons vs. Haaland's 42 in his first season at Man City....        They are simply not comparable when it comes to goalscoring.         Haaland has 197 "professional" goals to Kane's 288
If Man City wanted him that bad they would buy him. Spurs are not that bad of a team, constant top 4. Salah showed Kane how to play in high pressure in CL final 4 years ago. Just playing against so called big 6 means does not those are high pressure matches. He literally has no iconic moments in his long career so far. May be world will finally remember him after missing  the penalty against France.
12 years old, and still did not see Kane winning even a league cup on his own. But of course he is the greatest. Tragic!
Thats a stupid take. This is the first time a City striker may win the golden boot in 8 years. City has been similarly good in the last 4-5 years as well. And you never know players gonna fail in real big teams or not, where they have to play high pressure title winning or advanced CL matches.
Absolutely mental people have all of a sudden stopped rating Haaland purely because he now plays for City. People really hate City THIS much, don't they?
If you switched Haaland and Kane I can guarantee you that Haaland wouldn’t be performing nearly as well and Kane would be breaking records this season. Haaland is one of the best strikers in the world but Kane would fit Man City so well.
Hmmm I think we do.
Where did I say that, can you not read???   I said he was the best UK striker in the league!!
Doesn't matter what his nationality is, he's the best in the league
Take out ALL 4 of his pens and Kane is still 2nd top scorer in the league
Wilson?
Isak lmfao
Isak lmfao
Neither would sign to newcastle
>If he was that good big clubs would already buy him no matter what money  Several clubs have offered monster money yet had it rejected. How is that a poibt AGAINST Kane?
Haaland has gone missing in every big game this season
The 9 matches no goals and 20 games and only 2 goals for Burnley before MU, superstar??   Hmmm    Donkey!
Who?
And only 2 of those coming against any top 20 European team…
This guy literally just said he would adapt if playing in a weaker team
I’ll say it. Haaland is so clear. Haaland is a generational talent; Kane is not.
Maybe maybe  Kane’s minutes per goal is closer to Ivan Toney’s than Haaland’s though  Agree the gaps not that big. I’d certainly say that Kane is the better all round player, but in terms of an out and out striker then I think Haaland is a shade ahead  Just my 2p obviously
I mean what more evidence do you need ? Haaland is generational, will be spoken about in 50 years. Kane is a world class player but has never won a trophy, will be forgotten about in 15-20 by anyone that isn’t a Tottenham fan, I’m not trying to hate her ‘generational’ means players that only come around once every generation and Kane ain’t that.
But they did want him that’s not up for dispute it’s well documented
Imo, scoring 21 goals in this current spurs team is a better achievement than scoring 27 goals in a city team stacked with playmakers
Who can Kane assist?  Richarlison who has scored as many goals as the number of hairs on Pep’s head? Son who is washed this year? Kulu who is playing to a very mediocre standard?  Easier to get assists with Foden, Grealish, Marhez, KDB, Gundo, Alvarez and Bernardo around you than Oliver Skipp and Bentancour and Lucas Moura.
Kane won the golden boot and highest assists in the same season. Unless you have an irrational hate for him, there is no way Haaland is a better passer than Kane.
Do you even watch England play? A lot of their game revolves around Kane dropping deeper and feeding the ball off to Saka/Sterling/Rashford etc  He gets more chances in that England team but it’s nothing like the City or Norway setups where the entire game plan is basically “feed the ball to Haaland in the box”
height? what that has to do with football ability i will never know, Pace? sure though that’s most likely going to be a massive loss for Haaland in the future if he ends up sustaining a bad injury and loses it or simply because of age since he relies on it, Kane is good because he doesn’t rely on his pace but rather his technical ability and that’s why he’ll still be at this level in his mid 30s.  Strength? yeah sure, but i don’t think teams are looking at who’s stronger.
and how many of those are in the prem
remind me what spurs’ position on the table has to do with Kane as a player?  24 goals for spurs itself is an achievement, he doesn’t have the best goalkeeper in the world at distribution in goal, he doesn’t have john stones who’s arguably the best playing CB in the league in defence or the Cancelo’s and Walkers as fullbacks carrying the ball to the attack and playmaking, he definitely doesn’t have the best playmaker in the league KDB behind him to feed him crosses and balls either or Foden or Grealish or Mahrez on his wings, nah man he’s surrounded by Royale, Skipp, Hojberg, Lloris and Dier.    Kane is literally 1 goal away from hitting 300, idk where you’re getting 288 with 80 assists that’s 368 goal contributions in 505 games which is world class, all while playing for spurs he’s broken the top 3 most goals in the prem ever, spurs top goal scorer and is probably going to retire with the most ever prem goals period.
do you not understand how Contracts work? or are you too brain dead to comprehend that too.   how can you say spurs are not that bad of a team, they’ve been the epitome of relying on individual brilliance and success for more than half a decade now, they can’t win anything. You’re comparing Salah playing for a prime liverpool team to Kane who’s playing for a spurs team that had no business reaching that far to begin with 💀.   no iconic game? i checked and your an arsenal fan, that match against him in 2016 where he scored that beautiful goal against you at white hart lane, is just one of the many iconic game from him i can think about, and that was against you their biggest rivals  or what about his incredible game against liverpool in the 17/18 season?
Also first season they’re relying on a proper striker and not utilizing a false 9 system
Just complete speculation. The truth is Haaland’s first season in the prem is already above any season Kane has ever had  Bringing up the teams is just an excuse. Kane could’ve left spurs ages ago
How do we know if he’s never played in that role?
you literally said ‘he is not as good a striker’. when he’s in-fact better than Haaland
Yep, the league Wrexham are in
Yeah def not better than Kane but there was a stretch before the World Cup where he was outperforming kane
Except one Man City bid no big club proposed a real bid for Kane. Real, Barca, Bayern though all of the needed a big striker in the recent pasts but no one bothered about Kane he is that good.
and with that he somehow has 10 goals in 6 Champions League matches, lol        Admittedly half of them was when he demolished Leipzig round of 16, but I suppose that's not a big game.
The joke    _____            Your head
Show me perling paalands leauge cup medal for assistance of a PhD Holding MBE man
the man can only play what he's up against
I mean, I am not saying Kane is better, but he also has had seasons where he was both the top goalscorer AND playmaker for spurs
You’re saying Harry Kane, the future Premier League top scorer of all time, isn’t a generational talent?
Yeah I see what you are saying, but Spurs are closer to Brentford than City too. That, in my opinion, says a lot about the squad and chance creation each one of them has to live with  >I’d certainly say that Kane is the better all round player, but in terms of an out and out striker then I think Haaland is a shade ahead  Yeah, this is how I would put it too, tbf. If you have a well oiled machine and just need someone to finish the product, Haaland is your man. If you are not sure what you have, Kane has a bit of everything
Last time I checked, players alone do not win team trophies... I really doubt Kane will be forgotten, just like Shearer hasnt been forgotten, and I doubt that is due tl him winning the league w Blackburn, cause almost everybody associates him w Newcastle. Same as Le Tissier...  Its a pretty daft take honestly. Totti never won much with Roma, but is very well thought of... fuck, everybody has heard of Socrates and Valderrama and never won anything, neither with club, nor nation and they do not hold any records either.   By comparison, Kane will go down as top scorer in the prem and England, beating the likes of Rooney, and Shearer. He had the record for the fastest 25 goals in the CL until Haaland came into the pic...  I dont know what can be more generational than a player beating all time records  Just bc Tottenham never took that last step, it doesnt void Kanes ability and I am getting pretty sick of people who, like you, cannot separate Team success from individual ability. Its not like Kane is statpadding in some 3rd division club, he has been the key player in one of the strongest clubs in the world, and yes, Spurs havent won shit, and are far from the top, but they are also so above so many top flight clubs, and this is, big part, due to Kane, Poch and, a bit less, Son
I normally wouldn't waste my time, but if you think the England all-time goal scorer, 3 x Premier League Golden Boot Winner, winner of the Premier League Golden Boot AND Playmaker award in a single season, World Cup Golden Boot Winner, England National Team captain, Tottenham all-time goal scorer, and soon to be Premier League all time goal scorer is just going to be forgotten about in 15 years, you are a fucking turnip.
Do you honestly think they would swap out 28 goals in 26 games Haaland for a soon to be 30 year old Harry Kane? Harry Kane would be the safer signing but Haaland has obviously outperformed anything you can imagine, how is this even a debate? Does Haaland have to score 50 goals in the League for people to stop comparing him with the likes of Kane?
The anglo-fetish is strong with this one. Kane has been surpassed on every metric. Deal with it.
This is why City players never get the credit they deserve. It's always "they play for City, just look at the players they play with". As soon as Haaland joined City was the moment people stopped giving him the level of praise he deserves. The exact same thing will happen with Belllingham if he goes to City.
Dont bring Bentancur into this. That man's elite.
Try chained not washed
So it's Haaland's fault that he plays for a much better club? Haaland is the best striker in the world, an absolute machine and he's only going to get better the older he gets and the longer he stays at City. This is the same old argument people fall back on to avoid giving City and their players praise. "Of course they goals/assists, just look at the players they're playing with."  Just say you can't stand City and move on.
Something that hadn’t happened in 2 decades IIRC  Haaland’s incredible and may still get better too (scary prospect) but it’s like these 12 year old City fanboys have completely forgotten what Kane’s done for the past 8 seasons in a row.
I'm comparing Kane to Kane to highlight that it's not the team holding him back to that great of extent.
i agree w you on some parts esp with the pace but i think for a 9 you need someone who's tough and strong  but i think the difference isn't too substantial, kane has perfectly enough physical strength to be a fantastic 9
So that’s it? If You are comparing some league matches which had no major significance outside local rivalries to advanced stage UCL matches, or to title competing matches then all powers to you. May be he will surpass Messi, Ronaldo’s legacy in a couple of years just by doing that.
Are you actually having a laugh? He was the first player to both score the most goals and provide the most assists in a season, in nearly 2 decades.  He’s had 6 seasons scoring 20+ goals in the premier league and Spurs have never even been close to being the most talented team in the league in any of those seasons.  You’re salty you didn’t get him last season, I get it. Oil club fans always throw their toys out of the pram when they can’t get what they want.
Because if he was as good as KDB in that role someone would have played him by there by now
I didn't say he wasn't a good striker !  But better than Haaland FFS put the beer down and go to bed!   He is a great striker, but Haaland is twice as good as he was at that age.   It's like you are trying to compare Maradona with Rooney,  both fabulous players but we know who is best
Well then why did you put him in the list?
In their last games Haaland has 1 and Jesus has 2 so Jesus is obviously the better striker then right
We get it, Newcastle are having their first decent season in 2 decades so you’re feeling a bit full of yourself.  I remember when I had my first beer.
Not every champions league game is a big game
Yes but the fact norway didnt even qualify for the world cup… he didnt score when he needed to
Kane is clear by a gigantic landslide, you have to be pretty fucking stupid at understanding football to think otherwise
It wasn’t just for Spurs, he had a season where he led the entire Premier League (20/21). Didn’t win player of the year either
Generationally talented at disappearing when it’s time to win actual accolades
Harry Kane the player that’s never won anything in his whole career ? How many generational talents can you name with 0 trophies in their whole career ?
Correct. Great player, though.
You make some very valid points, I just think our definitions of 'generational' are different. Yes Kane, Totti, Le Tissier etc were world class players that played in underperforming teams, only a fool would dispute that, however not 'everybody' has heard of these players, only people who are true football fans. Haaland is generational because he is literally a player that only comes around once or twice every generation. In Le Tiss's era, those players were R9 and Zidane, in Kane's era those players were CR7 and Messi. Haaland is in THAT bracket of player for this generation (assuming he stays injury free) and that is why, as exceptional Kane is, Haaland is obviously clear.
Calls people out for being biased to their nationality.  Is Norwegian.
you’re literally from Norway buddy.
I may be English, but I’m also an Arsenal fan  Kane is the 2nd best striker to play in the Prem, behind Henry. Clear if Aguero, Shearer, Suarez (At least in the Prem) Ruud, Cantona… all of them.
He’s good, but he’s no Gundogan or Rodrigo…
He's alright but I'd say its pretty unanimous that players like KDB and Gundogan are better goalscorers than him
Right, but it is though. He’s never really been surrounded by a team whose main instruction is to feed him the ball in good goal scoring positions. Instead he has to pitch in with holding up the ball, playmaking, defensive duties and goal scoring because he’s probably the most complete player in world football right now.  Both City and Norway are set up to feed the ball to Haaland in and around the box, it’s basically the main objective for both teams. Understandably aswell as he’s an excellent poacher and probably the best finisher we have and will ever see in world football, but Kane is up there in the conversation too.  For me Kane still edges it because he’s so well rounded. You’ll never see Haaland hitting inch-perfect cross field diagonal assists at any point in his career. I also don’t think Haaland will stay at City for long enough to be a serious contender for PL all time top scorer. He’ll help City to a CL and few titles then hop to Madrid.
i mean yes and no, there’s so many world class and promising strikers right now who don’t fit the ‘big and strong’ profile that footballer like Haaland, Lukaku and Ibra etc fit in. toughness is different, you can be a short/less strong player and be tough, that’s definitely needed however.
probably because Spurs hardly make it into the UCL? and when they do they don’t usually get far except from that one season, football is a team sport. Expecting Kane to pull a 10/10 out his arse against a big European team that’s playing well during the late knockout round is very unrealistic and dumb, there’s only so much he can do, he’s only made 31 UCL appearances and has 26 goal contributions in them, he’s done his best in what little quality Spurs have.   In the league however which spurs are consistently in, there’s only ever been one man (Mo salah) who’s out performed him in big matches, he’s literally destroyed your favourite club so many times, he’s the top goal scorer in your derby, you concede a goal to him each game 😂.
Give Haaland those 6+ seasons and you'll see him with multiple 30+ goal seasons. He is at a different level get over it.
I never said he was as good as De Bruyne. In fact in my opinion De Bruyne is the best player in PL. I said to play Kane in a similar role, attacking mid fielder, “like De Bruyne”. You jumped to that conclusion all by yourself. 🤣
what makes haaland twice as good? his goal scoring ability? he’s one dimensional mate, there’s nothing else he does better than Kane, Kane can do everything Haaland does with even more to offer in his locker. Haaland’s only argument here is his age.   that Maradona and Rooney comparison makes no sense, how old are you?
Their attack wasn’t the faulty part only, Norway’s defence is not good enough and they conceded cheap goals, plus Haaland did have an injury and missed some of their games
I am of the opinion that they are just different players. Also, Haaland is a freak of nature and I am sure that the best is yet to come... I honestly think both are world class and comparing them is pretty stupid. Personally, I enjoy watching Kane more but, as a poacher you cant get better than 3RL1N6
When has he disappeared? If you’re talking about the champions league final he was injured, if you’re talking about the prem he’s had ridiculous goalscoring form for over half a decade
Well I can name Harry Kane.   Trophies are obviously very important but they're not the only metric that success is measured by.   If you try telling me Anderson is more of a generational talent than Kane is cause he won a bunch of stuff at Unite, you're having a laugh.
Kane, Defoe, Tim Cahill, Giuseppe Signori, Matt Le Tissier, Antonio Di Natale, Socrates.   There are tons of players that don’t win trophies but are still world class players
r/mancityfanlogic
It seems to me that your definition of generational includes winning trophies and has nothing to do with talent really, cause the only reason Van Nistelrooy is better known than Shearer is, IMO, that he played for more successful teams, which is what is happening to Haaland.  I'll rephrase this as a question. When Haaland went to City, there were rumours that Kane was the main option. Had that been the case, Haaland staying at Dortmund, for whatever reason imagine that he played there for his whole career (like Reus), and Kane being the City attacker. Would you still think of Haaland as 'bigger' than Kane?   Also, you should keep in mind that in this time and age everybody has access to social media and Kane plays in the most popular league itw... I find it hard to believe that he will be easily forgotten. I might be very wrong tho
And?
Fair fair, misread
Have you watched Harland play??  I am hoping you are not American, though that would explain it.  He has so much strength and ability, its just not recognised because of the quality of the service he gets   Outside of that his reaction time to chances are  better than Kane's were 8 years ago.  He is a better striker than HK, 90% of people would agree   Look if you don't agree that's fine, the world would be a much shitter place if we all agreed.   Chill  PS i am 59 and been a City fan all my life
Kane is more complete and given the opportunity a better poacher, he's just not served as royally as Erling, I do agree that his peak is yet to come, he's scary young
No I don’t think Anderson was better than Kane, and Kane is clearly a world class player. Generational to me means this sort of player only comes around once every generation. So for the upcoming gen : Musiala, Pedri, Haaland and Mbappe. Kane is a fantastic striker but he’s not a once in a generation player, in fact I’d have Benzema/lewa/Suarez over him quite surely.
We have very different definitions of generational. You’ve listed some great players there, whom I adore (particularly Cahill and di natale) but generational means once in a generation player which none of the ones you’ve listed are (possibly Socrates but that’s not my era)
You just googled a list of the top 10 players to never won a trophy lmao
Lmao far off but alright
We can only speculate as to whether he’ll be forgotten or not, by those that watched him week in week out, I doubt it. In the annuals of time however, future generations likely won’t know be aware of him in the same way they surely will be about Haaland. You can talk about individual talent but can you seriously sit there and tell me you think Kane‘s talent is comparable to Haaland’s ? I’ll phrase it with two questions :  1. How long, if ever ? Has Kane been considered the best 9 in the world ?  2. For the rest of Haaland’s career, how likely do you think it is than anyone even deposes him as the best 9 in world football ?   The answers to these questions reveal the difference.   As I’ve posed two questions it would be incredibly rude to not answer yours, and I think you make a valid point regarding the potential if Kane went to City, I think he obviously would have dominated. I think however, that he wouldn’t have done what Haaland has done and it would be insane to suggest otherwise, prior to this season we didn’t ever believe these numbers could be possible in the premier league. Kane has been consistently excellent, but has never reached these heights.
it’s kinda ironic you’re talking about ‘anglo-fetish’ that’s what.
Hes nowhere near kane atm   Haaland is an elite flat track bulky fair play to him
Hmm not so sure about that. I dont see Kane having that in game mentality of just staying there waiting, which you need to be a poacher. By all means, it is normally more entertaining to be involved
What qualifies as generational is subjective, and your idea of that is just different to mine.   I still think Kane is generational not only because in terms of pure goalscoring, he is this generations Alan Shearer. But he also provides for Spurs creatively as well and is an all round attacking threat.
Or I just named 7 commonly known players that haven’t won a trophy? Ain’t that hard to figure out because so many people don’t shut up about how if they don’t win trophies they’re nothing. If you didn’t know any of these players off the top of your head I’m assuming you’re below the age of 15
1. I dont think there has ever been a consensus on who is the best, but I would agree nobody would have said that. However, we go back to "how much of that is due to ze history of ze Tottenham?". Had they won  the CL, maybe people would actually appreciate him  2. He might be, he might not be. I would be inclined to say yes, but I also dont see much competition. Last season, Vlahovic looked like the thing, but he faded, this season its Osimhem, but it is just one season. Then you have the old guard.... but they are old. What I mean is, obv he is going to be regarded as a great (partly due to the team he plays for), but what other candidate do we have? A quick look at Transfermarkt's most valued young STs will show you that there arent really that many up and coming talents, whereas young Kane had prime Aguero, Benz, Lewy... and now that Kane is getting to 30 he has Haaland... playing for City  I really find it unfair to disregard what team they play for.  Also, let me ask you a different couple questions  Was Rooney ever considered the best in any position?  Was he generational?  My answers would be no and yes and this would be due to him doing SO MUCH MORE than just 1 role, like Haaland does.  Kane's best season he had 23g14a in a season his club only achieved 62pts (City already has more points with 10 games to go) and there was a managerial change... I dont think Haaland is ever going to show so much versatility, let alone for a team like Spurs  Maybe I could agree with you that Haaland is a better 9, but I still would say that, as a player, the gap is not that big and both are on a similar from my understanding.
Not really ironic. Absolutely every conceiveable statistic tells us that Haaland is the more prolific footballer at the moment. If you think Kane is better because 'reasons' and 'hold up play' then you're most likely English.
No
No. Some will get a strategic yellow to sit out a less important game so they guarantee they won’t be suspended for a more important game though.  And some pick up mystery injuries (Neymar) the same time every year.  I’m a Boro fan and Daniel Ayala always seemed to pick up an injury in January and return end of February/beginning of March
Anyone just watch the Watford game - I’m pretty sure Bachmaan did just that
A number of players have admitted to getting a yellow card on purpose to serve a suspension so they can have Christmas off if they only need one more card   Howard Webb said a player actually asked him to be booked for that reason  Don’t know of anyone getting a red on purpose to get time off
I recall a Real Madrid Champions League game with Mourinho as the boss where several players got blatant intentional red cards for repeated timewasting near the end of the game so that they would serve suspensions and go into the knock out stages with a clean slate. It wasn't even disguised. It was clear as day. I think it was Ramos and Alonso.
I know that before the rules on yellow cards were changed, players would get them on purpose for either an extra holiday or to be suspended in anticipation of a tough match.  To detail. It used to be "two yellow cards, one game suspension, then clean slate". So, if let's say a player who was important for a team was sitting at an yellow card prior to a game,  with a relegation team next, and a title counter contender the week after, they might try a cheap foul to get a yellow, serve the suspension vs the lower team and have a clean slate in the big match.      Part of why now cards are counted for the season and they don't wipe off the past ones.
Are they stupid?
In addition to what this would say about the player’s professionalism, often there are clubs rules and contractual penalties to red cards and suspensions that would make it undesirable to the player.
No Fabinho is just playing like that
Nah, the club wouldn’t let them go away or Speke that time elsewhere. They will be in training or sat in the stands
"Discussion" over. Nice.
Even Kevin Nolan at Christmas?
That was a very entertaining end of a match as a neutral.
Agree - I think it is pretty unlikely you go for the red.  There are stronger consequences to a red that are not worth the hassle.  Getting a yellow to get a suspension out of the way makes perfect strategic sense.  In fact, it would be stupid in some cases not to take the yellow.
Yellow*
No. They were intentionally getting second yellows to get sent off.  Edit: I've been downvoted but I am actually correct. [Here is the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nImILRmi66Q). They were intentionally getting second yellows in the 5th group game in the UCL so they would be suspended for the 6th and enter the knock out stages with a clean slate.
Hold on let me check this exact same post that was posted yesterday. And the day before.
Tim Ream
Saint Maximin is the opposite of underrated, as we can see from your post. He's massively overrated because he's a flashy dribbler, but more often than not, there is no end product.
Gundogan- amazing at controlling games, attacking opposition box, positioning and ball control. But never gets praised from commentators, nobody rates him amongst the other 3 city mids
Lewis Dunk. Not often appreciated, due to the talented forwards and midfielders in Brighton.  Not among the best CB’s in the league, but a solid CB and Captain.
Lewis Dunk  Should be at a top 4 team and playing for England instead of Maguire
Andreas Pereira @ Fulham  Been excellent this season. He has been their best creative player IMO
I would say benjamin white
Gabriel (big Gabi),  Saliba gets a lot of the praise and rightly so but big Gabi had been immense this season and so integral to how we play as a team.
Gundogan definitely goes under the radar compared to the other City players.
Neves @ Wolves  Him, caciedo and Macallister top midfielders outside top 4
Mister Equalizer himself, Harvey Barnes
james ward prowse
ASM is overrated, he's flashy but has little end product.  Some of the answers given here make me think that people don't know what underrated means
I'd say ASM is super overrated
I love watching him on his day, but his day is no where near often enough. He’s rated about right, people know he’s good, but a bit inconsistent
Wilfred Zaha  Amazing at dribbling and shooting,scores goals for Palace
Eze at palace.  Kovacic is pretty underrated imo.  Raya
This is a hard question...as a Spurs fan I would say Bentacur, he is class but nobody outside of Spurs would fear him...but trust me when he doesn't play we are crap and I think Spurs fan would agree he is our second best player
Christian Norgaard, nobody talks about him but he is leading Brentford s midfield in quite an amazing season for the club
A Isak
I'd say JWP    Hate it when people only refer to him as a "setpiece merchant" and people go on to completely ignore all his other aspects of the game
ASM is awful. Yes he can dribble but he dribbles to nowhere. He often runs with his head down towards the corner flag only to lose possession it must be so frustrating being a forward in the same team as him as you know you won't receive the ball as he just doesn't look up and rarely finds a player.   If he was good a bigger club would have taken him yet he's stayed in an average Newcastle for years so says a lot about what other managers think of his ability.
Robinson at Fullum
It's kinda hard to go for all of the prem so I'm just gonna stick to my team as I mean I know them best and I watch them week in week out.  I'll probably get a lot of hate for this... But I'm gonna say Nketieh. Is he first team material right now ahead of Jesus, absolutely not... But in arsenal groups you'd think he's complete wank the way people talk about him, but in my view if we win this season he played his role in that and you can't take that away, when Jesus was out, he got involved, got a fair amount of goals and stuck his position well.   He ran out of fire and luckily we've got Jesus back in, but fair play to the lad if you ask me.
James Ward-Prowse  Much more than a set-piece specialist  Would be interesting to see him at a top 4 side  Edit:  * 330+ premier league appearances * captain of his club * England International   Also:  "Across the entire season, Southampton workhorse James Ward-Prowse has covered a league-topping 334.6km"  So, he covers ground. A lot of it. Closes down, can make a tackle. Good passer of a football, great technique.  Only Southampton fans can genuinely reply to this, as Southampton are probably only watched by anybody else, about twice a fuking season
How can you be underrated when you only "pop up with the odd goal or 2" as a winger?   Hes a fifa type player with no output in real life. Hes a fancy Adama Traore
Mctominay
Azpilcueta has always been underrated. This is the first season I've seen him make  mistakes and there's only been a couple. Never heard a single shout for best RB in the league. Not saying he is that right now but still
Trippier for Newcastle
Saint-Maximin is very overrated.   His best return on goals in one season in the PL is 5.   In 4 seasons at Newcastle he has scored 12 goals and got 19 assists.  He’s just a flashy dribbler. Nothing more.  Adama Traore, who is the walking meme of “No end product dribbler”, has 10 PL goals and 16 assists in the Premier League
James Tarkowski
Didn't we already have our daily post of this?  Next up, "who do you hate/like the most" and "who's the best striker after haaland"
There's a young Norwegian kid at City that I'm not hearing much about that's quite talented.
He’s a starter for a third place team in the prem?   Where would a realistic move up be?
I feel like I don’t hear enough about Kaoru Mitoma
Friend, I can’t make it out, what’s your flair?  Edit: I ask a simple question and am down voted? Y’all need a hobby.
Have you checked yet?
A very good answer. Not many people are talking about him but he's so composed in Fulham's back line. Always in the right spot, always making that last ditch block or interception, and can ping a solid pass with that left foot.
I’d say Howe has made a difference in his play. He’s passing more and actually looking for his teammates instead of immediately dribbling into the abyss.
Who would you say is underrated  Edit: Could someone please explain to me why I've been downvoted so much?
I don't think any City players are underrated
Yup. Insane to think he's been in this successful squad for 7 seasons now yet no one gives a fuck about him. He's not getting so many minutes for no reason
I agree with this, nobody talks about him but whenever he plays he is class, I wonder if the City fans rate him
That's a good point about how no-one rates him among the other man city mids considering he's got de bruyne (who's a great) but then Rodri  who's inconsistent in performance.
Solid shout. Many Brighton players can fit this theme as well.
shut up
His name did come to mind but I've noticed a widespread recognition of his abilities lately.  People's eyebrows were definitely raised when he didn't make the latest England squad (even though it has become apparent that there might have been a falling out between him and the assistant coach).  I guess there's often a point where a player is underrated, people begin to recognise him as underrated, thus he eventually becomes rated.  I feel he has now reached that phase of becoming rated by a lot of neutrals.
Most underrated Arsenal player by some distance
Based on a recent post in r/gunners comparing xhaka and gundogans stats this season, and even all of r/gunners saying gundogan was still way better (despite the two being nearly statistically identical), it seems like xhaka should be in this underrated conversation.  Edit: why is this being downvoted? Just my opinion. And if you think “no way xhaka is anywhere close to gundogan”, you’re kind of proving my point.
How could they be underrated when all 3 of them are being linked with a ton of clubs for massive money moves?
Fellow spurs fan wondering how far I’d have to go before seeing either of our Juve boys
Feels like he swings 5-10 results a season with late set pieces
Fellow arsenal fan here and Nketiah is probably the most accurately rated player at arsenal. Everyone knows he’s fine for a game or two but not top class material and probably won’t ever be
He is yet another striker who doesn't score goals, you are massively overrating him by just mentioning him here.        He has 4 goals for Arsenal in the league this season, how well do you think he'd do anywhere else if he can't score for top of the league Arsenal?
False. So very average outside of set pieces
He’s really not that good
Alright mate sorry
Nah. Most rational people actually realise how good Trippier is.
Birmingham
Yes https://www.reddit.com/r/PremierLeague/comments/12csf1g/who_do_you_think_has_been_the_most_underrated/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1
This man shows so much quality week in and week out. Maybe even one of the most consistent players in the league as well.
Yea, playing under Howe is the best for him. He’s had some end product recently and not just running down blind alleys. It also helps that he has competition in the squad. Not much to push him when he was clearly the best player. Hopefully he pushes on next season, keeps up with the end product and terrorises the Real Madrid defence 🤞
Because this has been posted for the last 10000000 days in a row
Reddits way, due to the disagreement with your original post any time OP appears in a comment section from there they get downvoted into oblivion. Unfortunately with an app that has a very manchild like user nature it's a common occurance.
I think some City players can verge on being overrated as in discussions their trophy counts get brought up and they get Halo'd by the collective quality of the team.  But gundogan seems to get virtually no credit at all
Yes
Rodri is our most consistent player
❤
Also true. He's having a hell of a season as well. Though I do feel like he's talked about a bit more as his lows have been way lower than Gundogan 😅.
If you read my comment, I have only referenced Neves as underrated  I referenced the other two as I believe they are the three best midfielders outside the top 4.  Wolves aren't having a great season.   They are not getting the plaudits of Brighton etc, hence my opinion being that Neves will understandably go under the radar, compared to the others.  His strengths are not being utilised, unlike the other players referenced.  I believe he has a higher 'ceiling' than the others, however that is not easily distinguishable in a poor side.
I personally think Nketiah is an example of the pendulum swinging of a player from underrated to overrated when people realise he is better than they initially thought (and they end up overcorrecting).  Within the Arsenal fanbase, there was a belief that he simply couldn't be relied on to spearhead our attack if need be but then Jesus got injured and Eddie rose to the challenge and did a better than expected job.  And mind you, a lot of outsiders also expected Arsenal to feel the absence of Jesus more than what eventuated. But I do feel there was an element of him eventually ending up a bit overrated with people genuinely starting to ask (prior to Eddie's injury) who should start upfront once Jesus returned...  Similar examples are Emi Martinez, Richarlison, Tielemans. Maybe Mason Mount and Saint-Maximin?  And then some players seem to fluctuate back and forth in the court of public opinion (without too much of a fluctuation in form): Trippier, Jesus, Jordan Henderson, Kepa, Jorginho. Maybe Grealish?  Note: this is a matter of perception, so I can understand of some people may disagree with the inclusion of some of the names (I admit I could be wrong on a couple).
Subjective opinions and facts are two different things buddy
Yeah, 300+ premier league appearances, captain of his club, England International whilst playing for an unfashionable club   Also:  "Across the entire season, Southampton workhorse James Ward-Prowse has covered a league-topping 334.6km"  So, he covers ground. A lot of it. Closes down, can make a tackle. Good passer of a football, great technique.  Only Southampton fans can genuinely reply to this, as Southampton are probably only watched by anybody else, about twice a fuking season  But yeah, cheers for your opinion
It's really not that deep
Most people were mentioning Reece James, Trent and White. I don't think many expected Trippier to enter into that conversation. Also, when he was bought most people were saying he moved just for the money.
Agreed. Trippier is incredible. Him and Zinchenko are just stellar in their respective positions.
Thanks friend
So what’s the verdict?
He is. If he was 10 years younger Fulham could get easily get 75 million for what he’s putting on the pitch week in week out
Not just competition, but I’m sure the team actually has practices now. My understanding is that Bruce did nothing with them, which is probably why ASM loved him.
And in my opinion, you are wrong
That explains your sentiments.  Don't get why people would sleep on Trippier, man's proven himself to be solid, if not good.
Lol why did u get downvoted into oblivion???
Lots of Brighton, Fulham and Brentford players. Can’t really argue with that but we’ll see what tomorrow’s post brings…
Therefore, it is an opinion and not a fact  In fairness, chief, I do completely appreciate that old  Rafa Benitez did a number on you lads  He clearly confused the hell out of you lot when it comes to "Facts"   Off you pop
I don’t know, I guess I’m expected to know every flair? Or I can’t ask a simple question? One thing to down vote a biased opinion, but damn lol
People probably thought that, big 6 = not caring enough to know lower league sides and being stuck up about it or something
Dafuck? Where did i ever say it was a fact. Someone’s just salty their star player is a subpar midfielder with amazing set piece ability. Enjoy the championship next year “buddy”
Yeah I’m not sure why you’re getting downvoted so much for a bit of banter. I’m here for it though lol we’re crap and we know it
"False."  That is a statement of fact, not opinion. FFS
They’re clubs in big cities with big populations, so naturally they’ll have a lot of fans through success and failure. They’ve always had a solid fanbase even before their big money takeovers. But due to their success, there will obviously be a large portion of the fanbase who is just there for the success and not because of their love of the club itself
No they both had decently sized fanbases in the country. I don't think they'd be considered big compared to some other clubs in the country but they were never small.
Manchester City (along with Chelsea) hold the record for single highest attendance ever in an English match, regularly had over 30,000 people selling out Maine Road in the lower leagues, but please go on with your attempted trolling.
If you mean small in comparison to United, Arsenal and Liverpool yeah we were small. If you mean in comparison to the rest of the top couple of leagues, we were average/fairly big  Comes down to the whole ‘history’ thing too. Take out those big three and we were up there in terms of trophies, longevity, big events. Nobody will tackle those big three in terms of ‘history’ for a long time
Yet another weird shitpost from you, but I'll play along.  Both clubs have had decent sized fanbases throughout their histories, even through periods without success, though Chelsea's home attendance did take a noticeable dip during the barren 70's and 80's when switching divisions every so often, as well as times in the 90's having poor attendances (though we also had a lot of stadium delays during these times). I can't speak specifically on whether City had a similar lull to us, though I'm under the assumption that they didn't.  Stamford Bridge and Maine Road (City's old stadium) hold the top 2 records for highest home attendances in England, way back in the mid 20th century.*  *If we're discounting Spurs at Wembley, because it was a temporary home and is naturally the biggest stadium, and if we're discounting United briefly playing at Maine Road, where they either have the 2nd or 3rd highest attendance.
There is universal, evident, causality between success and attraction in any context  Sport is no different. More success = more fans
I mean you’re clearly trolling but there is truth in the comments. People will argue otherwise but prior to the money you never saw a chelsea or Manchester City top unless worn by a chav Gallagher brother type shouting ‘arrrrr kid’.  Now you’ll find tops far further afield. It’s just the way football and success works
Erm... most fans would say they have plastic fans but at the end of the day they have had a fan base a big one before the takeovers
You're a Chelsea fan today? Sorry to see it didn't work out with Spurs and who was it, Newcastle before?   I wonder if you're the same person as that ziad who used to do this, new flair every few days and a question about that club, plus hangouts in those clubs subs.
Chelsea were a mid table Premier League team before the Russian money came in, with a small amount of fans. Since then though, their fan base has grown lots due to winning trophies.  Man City were always well supported, but the soul of the club left after they moved to their larger stadium. Their success on the pitch made them more of a tourist attraction which is why their ground is a library, however, off the field, they've become the biggest club in Manchester by quite some distance.
City are still a small club. Chelsea are a legit big club, but really blew up after the abramovic takeover.
Both clubs are comfortably in the top 10 for largest attendances in their history. Calling either club small pre-takeover is to suggest there's only 3/4 big clubs in the country. It just shows a complete lack of knowledge and makes the idiots easy to spot.
Been a Chelsea fan for over fifty years, so long, long before the takeover, indeed I've seen them away from the Bridge for more games than I care to admit. They were always well supported where I lived. I left the UK nearly twenty years ago, so they managed to be champions before I was born and after I'd emigrated. The last eighteen or so years have been glorious and eventful as a fan. I was and still am good friends with a couple of City supporters who still live in the UK, who I've known for thirty plus years. So no the fan base has always been there but, there are lots others around because of these teams success.
City was a huge team before the take over.  Though in comparison United has always overshadowed City in every way.
Both had decent size fanbases, both had enough history and trophies to be considered top6 clubs. Stop the hate they both have at least half their total trophies came before the takeovers
There are lots of Chelsea fans down south who are in their 40/50s, so I would say they're well supported. You forget that from 96 to 2003 when Roman bought Chelsea they hadn't finished outside the top 6, and have been to the top division for over 40 years.
I am not trolling anybody, I mean people who are trolling are just United or Liverpool fans which most of their fans are actually glory hunters
30.000 attendees in an area with about 2.7 million possible fans isn't huge in itself. Outside of greater manchester, city were never really a club with a great following.  You would have a hard time finding many city fans, from before the financial doping, in other countries.   There is nothing wrong with not having lots of pre-infusion fans.  You can still have a good club, and love it to bits. Even if it's owned by a regime that shits on human rights, and cheats it's way to the league wins. Just own up to it :)
So why are most of people saying that city fanbase is plastic while they had good support
Came here to say this - you said it much better
City or Chelsea or both
When you lazily type away without any research your arguement becomes wasted...you called a team who Qualified for ucl before they got bought a mid table team..club that has won an European club a mid table team  Chelsea hovered between 2nd and 6th for about 5 years before being bought..  Modtable would be 10th
That's a bit disingenuous to say we were a mid table club before Roman. We had our ups and downs (literal downs, with relegations), and certainly did have periods of being the poster club for mid table, but there were also periods of fighting for top 4, fighting for the title. We should have been the first ever English club to play in the European Cup, but the FA blocked us, which undoubtedly had an effect on how things progressed in the second half of the 20th century.  Also, in the immediate years prior to Roman's arrival, we finished 4th (the reason why he bought us), 6th, 6th, 5th, 3rd (4 points off 1st, joint least losses), 4th, and 6th. We'd found our footing and were on the rise anyway - Roman just expedited that process and ensured we went the extra step to league success.
I wouldn’t say city are a bigger club that United personally. I know I’m biased. But to say a team that’s never won a European cup is a bigger club is a little laughable. Do they have the better team currently absolutely but they definitely aren’t a bigger club.
And English local city supporters left supporting after the take-over as they are now very successful and tourist attraction or no it is not related
Small club with higher attendance records than yanited
Bro...I was born in nigeria..supported chelsea since the days of Ruid Gullit while I was still in Nigeria and probably seen about 20 chelsea ganes on tv Wayyy before RA..do your damn research Chelsea was signing top european talents before RA  They had s fan base outside england..not huge but they had  And did a chelsea game not have the highest crowd number back in the 30s?
the issue you've got with this comment is how you define glory hunter.  for example, I was never interested in football until I was about 10y/o when my mother started dating a united fan.  therefore I went to many united games, in person when possible and on the TV every game when not.  I grew up only watching united and learning to love the game because of them.  my first football game i watched 15 January 2005 v Liverpool  my first live game was v Portsmouth 2007, with THAT cr7 Free kick  Am i classed as a glory hunter? I don't support them due to their success, but due to being exposed to only them from 10yo. I just happened to have been subjected to a team who was the biggest team in England and have continued to watched very game religiously since then for 20 years and my daughter is a United fan, is she a glory supporter? or is she like me, just conditioned to support this team because its whom our family supported?  what im getting at, is being the biggest team in England will breed generations of fans. most of which may have moved away from Manchester, or the UK. But it doesnt mean their support doesnt stem from a true united fan spreading that support to their children across the country.     for me a glory hunter is someone who has publicy supported multiple teams, not always the best team, but often a new team when their previous team is relegated or doing bad.   I know chelsea fans who now support Chelsea.
Maine road was quite literally sold out for every match in the second division mate. You dont know what you’re talking about.
No one's claiming that City had a huge foreign support before the money, just that they were always well supported locally - which is true.
Because there's an element of truth to it, but the same can be said for us, for Arsenal, for Liverpool, for United. We're all successful clubs, with varying degrees of medium to large fanbases within England, but the bulk of our fanbases are made up of people who only started supporting each of the clubs through a period of success.  All 5 of us, and some others to a lesser extent, have a significant portion of plastic fans. It's unavoidable.
Have you heard of a thing called GOOGLE? Saves us the pain
Both
Chelsea were never in a title race until they were taken over. That's a fact.
Top 6. That was after the first Chelsea big money take over, 1994, before that they were a lot smaller and a mid table team (if not lower).   Mathew Harding came in with the money and players like Gullit, Vialli, Zola, Desially, Le bouf followed. Chelsea nearly won the league in 1999. Probably should have
Nottingham Forest have won the Champions League, while Man City haven't, Man City are a bigger club than Nottingham Forest.
lol, united is indisputably on of the worlds 3 biggest clubs. I have never seen a citeh shirt in India or anywhere in Africa. You see Chelsea a lot  - probably because in Africa they loved Drogba.   Cope harder lmao  City are definitely a smaller club than Chelsea, they have even been outed for fiddling their income, small club.
And the comment gets deleted..ahhhh  Why post shit u can't back.....coward

>And did a chelsea game not have the highest crowd number back in the 30s?  Wasnt that bc they were playing Arsenal at home and it was mostly Arsenal fans? Much like that Barcelona Eintracht game
‘I know Chelsea fans who now support Chelsea’  I’d certainly hope so
Local fans sure, city has quite a few. The broader popularity is a different story.  I admire the OG fans. But you didn't see kids in other parts, or countries, before the takeover.
Question was if they had a big fanbase. That's fans in general. It wasn't "locally support"  I answered someone saying that was attempted trolling.  City didn't have a big fanbase - wich is true. It's not trolling, it's just how it is. City was, locally, a big club. But you don't call Barcelona, United etc for big clubs because they high attendance, but because they a big fanbase.. unlike what city had (and to an extent still lack world wide comparatively)
Was the Stamford Bridge empty in the 80s and 70s due to some out of control situations or because the fans was just not interested?
I mean you can just skip the question if you don't like it it is very easy
1998-1999 says you’re wrong
City are one of the top 5 big clubs in the league but United, Liverpool and arsenal are all bigger clubs than city.
I agree United are top 3 biggest clubs in the world, yet we still have a higher attendance record. Almost like there’s something to that.
Hahahaha i meant city lmao
> Question was if they had a big fanbase. That's fans in general. It wasn't "locally support"  According to you - by that definition there's barely any clubs that'd be classed as well-supported. You're just arguing about the semantics of what "big fanbase" means.
Six of one, half a dozen of the other.  We had mounting debts due to attempting to renovate the stadium, which coincided with poor league performances and relegations, and thus fans started to lose interest. That's actually a similar reason to our early 90's attendance as well, just without the relegations.
Equally you could skip the pointless post & search online … but hey it is very easy 💊🕳💬
Finishing 3rd is not in the title race....
Which United, sorry? There's more than one.
Nah, theres nothing in it. Fans in the stands are props to the prem, forgotten the artificial crowd noises from lockdown? But, if it helps you feel like a "big" club, go ahead. Even Everton fans describe their club as a "giant".  Seems like you have a low bar for whats a big club. Citeh just do not have the fans globally that real big clubs have. Nobody supports them outside of Manchester. Money? check. Titles? check. Big names? check.   Maybe if Haaland stays fit and scores hundreds of goals things will improve, but right now city are a small club compared to the competition.
Anyway I tried google and didn't find exact answer I thought that it is better to ask especially that many people were alive and support football when the take-over happened
Look, if you’re too young to remember that season, or you simply weren’t into football at that time, it’s ok. You can admit that and move on. No-one would think any less of you.  The problem now is, you’ve shown yourself up in the face of a fact and you’re trying to double-down.
Embarrassing yourself. Chelsea were in the title race in 98/99, the lost the league by 4 points and were top as late as game 22. The talk of the season was how they were going to win the Legaue. It would be like saying Arsenal were not in the title race this year if they lose the league by 3 points. Moronic.  They blew it because then went 2W 4D in the run in, dropping 8 points.
What are you talking about the Prem for when our attendance record goes back to 1934?  Also, saying that the only way to be a “real club” is to have plastics from other continents is just a hilarious interpretation of clubs and their culture.
The London is blue podcast has a little series within it called The Famous CFC, hosted by the Chelsea historian. Pretty good series if you’re genially interested in Chelsea history
Trust me, Chelsea were absolutely bang average before the Russian's took over.
16 games before the end they were top? Good for them.
Clubs as you describe them are long gone. You support Etihad Airways and I support Emirates Airlines.
That might be the case. But your statement was that they had never been in a title race before they were taken over in 2003.  They had, so you’re wrong. Just admit it. It will be better for you in the long run.
No they were not . From 96 onward they were in the top 6 . Granted they were not as big as Arsenal, United or Liverpool but they were the best of the rest .  They also had a sizable US following due to summer tours since the 90’s .
Trust you?    They only won FA cup 97 , 00. League cup 98 and cup winners cup 98 and European super cup 98. Charity shield in 00.  Just the 6 trophies in the 5 years before the Russian
Exactly, it was good for them. We agree. You were saying they were average. It’s rare to change someone’s opinion on here. Well done.
Newcastle United fan, lol. You have some cheek. How hyped your fan base was for your League Cup final this year. Genuinely, bless you coming on here rubbishing Chelsea’s 2x FA Cups, 1x League cup, Champions league quarter final, cup winners cup and European super cup in which they beat Real Madrid. Have Newcastle ever played Real? Genuine question.  Did Newcastle ever challenge for the title? They lost one by 4 points. Does that count?
Arsenal fans lecturing other clubs on whether they’re big or not.  You are aware that your club bought their way into the league back in 1919 right?
In the title race implies they finished 1st or 2nd.  3rd is basically "they were happy to be there"
Which United, sorry?
None of those competitions were taken seriously at that time.  Chelsea were fucking shocking and almost went out of business before the Russian's got involved.
Someone's rattled....
We've played Barcelona and beaten them?  Who do you even support? You a Chelsea plastic?
I never said I was an arsenal fan, I said I am an Emirates Airlines fan.  Not sure what 1919 has to do with it. Certainly the massive fanbase that makes the prem the global superleague dont give two hoots in 2023.  And anyway, my allegiances and my opinions aren't going to change reality. City have struggled internationally. Not sure why, but Liverpool and United are the biggest English clubs in the world. You can toss a coin with Arsenal dnd Chelsea. Citeh are a distant 5 or sixth, vyying with Spurs atm.  I did say that with Haaland City could leap frog them all.
That’s a pretty impressive display of mental gymnastics. If that’s what it takes for you to cope, then so be it. But you are wrong. You will always be wrong. And there is no changing that.
Haha. You are funny. Shocking as they qualified for the champions league?      Do average teams make the CL back then too?
I’m an Arsenal fan and yes I remember that Barca game. Newcastle were a very good side in the middle of the 90’s.
Half the leagues from greater Manchester honestly conflict of interest doesn’t matter anymore because even without bias they’re all inept anywhere.
Didn't know he was a Newcastle fan till now
Tell me how you're going to get refs who don't support a team? It's not like players score own goals against their boyhood clubs, so why would refs favour them?
I totally understand these posts but it annoys me a bit. So many players are fans from different clubs and play this club then - but do you really think they perform "bad" because of that? No professional would do that, we just think it, because we're fans by ourselves and not in that situation. I'm not a fan of him but his performance will be the same - doesn't matter who's playing against whom. Trust me, Ref's love their job and are not always "the bad guys who help another team win" - its just nonsense.
It would be a conflict of interest if he was a child.  You get players who supported Arsenal and played for Tottenham for example. This isn't really an issue for rational thinking adults. It's a job.  Blind devolution and hero worshipping of football companies is for kids.
Who cares when more than half the refs are from Manchester.
They are referees, they like football. And if you like football you support a club. As long as he isn't a supporter of one of the two teams, it's ok
He literally refereed their Caraboa Cup semi final and not a word was said.  Also, Howard Webb....
At least its not from Greater Manchester for once
A Newcastle fan refereeing Man Reds and the Scouse Mackems? Which team will he be bias against exactly?
It's not like hes going to award 10 penalties is it?  The only thing stopping utd making top 4 is their own shit results stop making excuses and also the hypocrisy over the silence when Howard Webb was the ref not a peep out of moan utd then...
As a former ref, posts like these just show that referees will never be able to satisfy the demands of fans. It is a lost cause.
He is the best referee in the Premier League by all metrics, analysis and reporting. Newcastle are at a disadvantage every game by having to settle for lower quality.   There are conflict of interest rules in place for referees. For example, he cannot referee for Sunderland games either. What's really sketchy are the referees who claim to have no allegiance; surely that's not true. Especially someone like Anthony Taylor who has spent his life within 6 miles from Old Trafford.
Kind of hypocritcal coming from a Manchester United fan
A nice change from 85% of all games being reffed by Man United fans.
Howard Webb is literally head of the PGMOL and selects the referee's. Oliver is one of the few competent referees in the league anyways.
This kind of thing happens all the time. He'll probably give Man U a dubious penalty to prove he's not biased.
Footballers have allegiances to clubs as fans but are able to put it aside when playing. Why do we think refs wouldn't be able to do the same?
Oh be quiet
I’ll take it if true
Cry some more
It’s utterly stupid to consider referee fandom as a conflict of interest worth disqualifying a ref over. Refs become refs because they love football and part of loving football is growing up loving a team and also having opinions on other teams. Like what football fan doesn’t an opinion on Man U? By this logic the only people who should be refs are people who don’t have any interest in the sport.
Wasn’t the league cup final literally reffed by a Man Utd fan?
Conflict of interest? Every time AT refs a game, it’s a conflict of interest.
I get that people can feel sour, but calling him the worst ref is seriously ignorant of the facts. He's by far the best manager in the league. He very rarely makes mistakes and doesn't get swayed by crowds either.
This got posted a few days ago. What are you on?  Absolutely psychotic
Honestly who gives a fuck. Let the players win the game for themselves and stop making excuses as fans
Unrelated to being a newcastle fan, i think hes an awful ref.
I disagree, I think he is the best ref in the PL.
All refs bad, my team lost because of bad ref once
Man Utd have been in the pockets of the referees since the 90's. A few "unlucky" decisions are due!!
are you 12? fuckin hell
I wonder where the hue and cry about ' Conflict of interest' was, when United benefited during the Fergie era?
Oh noes....  Man United don't have a ref in their back pocket finally.
When Arsenal fans point out that a Man United fan referee is overseeing their game against United, we’re “overreacting” and “referees have integrity.” When it happens in a United match… it’s unethical.
You'd hardly get a full set of fixtures a week if you avoided refs from the area/supported a team or rival of team involved/or supported a team with vested interest.  Professionals should have standard and should be held to account for them no matter the teams involved. That's the problem, not who the ref may or in some cases is suspected to support.
Yeah, maybe. But honestly, I take the view that if a refs decisions are capable of deciding the outcome of a game then you probably didn’t do enough to win anyway. This is even more true with VAR. And is especially true against a side like Everton.   That said, he could book players or send someone off and that could alter the outcome. But it is also on the players to avoid such situations, especially if they have this kind of information available.
This is tiny compared to the fact that the majority of refs are from Manchester.
Take it up with head of referees and Man Utd fan Howard Webb, he might be able to grab one of many refs from the greater Manchester area to replace him..
I wish people would stop assuming professional referees are all corrupt.   Just hope that your team score enough goals so that poor decisions don't even come into it.  Biased referees is one of the weakest pissiest arguments you can have as to why a team lost.
I see nothing wrong here.
How on earth do people think Anthony Taylor is a Man Utd fan considering his record when actually being in charge of one of our games?  Its laughable the myth of this when the reality is he has gone out of his way to constantly feck us every game he is the referee.  I know people hate United but at least try and hate us for the right reasons not ones you imagine
Why would him being a fan of a team that isn’t even playing affect his decisions during this game?
Well, fuck.
He will do his best to be a good referee, just a shame it isnt enough most the time
He will do professional job.
That blue light is shrinking one side of his head
As an unbiased American observer, Michael Oliver is an excellent ref.  Just saying.
Mate 3/4th of the refeering camp is from or near Manchester
Ive said it before I'll say it again. The man is an idiot.
awh no, boo hoo 😿  you realize how many referees are United fans? lol  nobody feels remotely bad for you
So hard to spot satire these days.
He's not a great manager at all. But seeing Newcastle sitting at 3rd, what makes people think he'd set his biss aside?  Can someone explain this post?  Edit: referee*
I hate that “4” shirt so very much.
I think because of this, he will give more calls to Everton. It seems natural to overcompensate when everyone believes the fix is in.
It's a conspiracy contact MI5 this can't happen.
Everyone wants a scapegoat to blame if things don’t go their way. It’s a bloody game. I’m sure you can find photos of anyone that can be used for out of context usage.
Don’t be such a clown. Do you think players that supported clubs when they were younger perform better when it benefits the club they support too?
A referee could support one of the teams in the game he’s refereeing and would still do his best to perform professionally and objectively. The standard of refereeing is bad in our league but I don’t accept it’s biased. Footballers support the team they’re playing against all the time and don’t intentionally play badly. It’s about integrity and professionalism. We love the game first and foremost and no one is actively going to bring it into disrepute like that. Oliver won’t even be thinking about Newcastle tomorrow.
just score more goals.
Hell yeah. Get em Mikey!
Get foreign refs to avoid bias
You're kidding me right?  Oliver hates Everton more.  Prepare for a 12th man on your team tomorrow  And every ref is gonna be a supporter of someone
This should never be allowed, fans are going to be fuming if he makes a bad decision against Manchester United!
I bet most refs have a favourite team without us knowing about it
Is it just me or does anyone else want to cut his stupid fucking ear off
He is just the worst
Feels like Michael Oliver officiates every match I watch lmfao
YES! I expect a good half dozen penalty kicks for Everton.
LOL yanited fans have been reffing yanited and liverpool games for decades. Learn shame.
Fuck me, has someone been passed down a tinfoil hat from the Arsenal lot?
I can assure you if any true bias is shown he won’t officiate again if he’s shit that’s his level
Local reddit user doesn’t understand the concept of having a job
Good. Anything to send the Ev down
Genuinely would love to see anyone criticising Michael Oliver actually try and referee and get to where he is.  Everyone has an opinion on how to referee but the moment you get called on your bluff no one takes up on it 🤣
I honestly think that a ref being a known supporter of a particular club poses as a disadvantage to that club. He will never want to be accused of favouritism and possibly side with the other team in pivotal calls.
I thought this was a troll post, but apparently OP is serious??
Well all the refs have been shit with United..what’ll Oliver do? Don’t expect much worse
Yup. He's one of the worst regardless of where he's from.
It's okay though because for some reason all these refs from around the area all support small teams in the 3rd Division or lower
Utd fans crying about refs is peak gaslighting
Aye, used to live in Shankhouse in Cramlington, about 20 mins from St James's Park.
Was with a friend when we were teens. He was refereeing even then
Still isn't a cause for concern, get back to me when the head ref manages the youth for the derby rivals in cup final lol.
They just do what Anthony Taylor does and claim to support some non league team.  It's amazing how many of them never followed a Premier League team growing up. Some might even say it's unbelievable...
This ref has literally said before that it's a conflict of interest
You only need 3 refs from different fan bases to make sure a neutral ref is available. Its not that they have to support no teams; they just can't support one of the teams playing. I'm pretty sure there are at least that many around. It isn't that hard of a problem to solve.
Agreed.
I agree with you. Carragher was toffee for his childhood - went to game, left liverpools academy to join Everton, celebrated Liverpool losing etc He then noticed the level of abuse given to team mates (and himself) and eventually stopped supporting them.
I’m sure they care much more about their performance evaluations than their club getting a favorable result.
the issue for me, is he refuses to ref any team around newcastle during their relegation battles as its a conflict of interest, but what is the difference with a top 4 battle?   should keep the same energy both sides of the table
But it has to make a difference subconsciously on those 50/50 calls
Even then it shouldn't really be a big deal. They are professionals not children.
Well I'd add in rivals. That's probably a tad biased. But they should be professionals and not let that matter.
>As long as he isn't a supporter of one of the two teams  Or a team affected by the result of the match he is refereeing... which is the point. Eg, while I doubt many referees are Arsenal fans, they surely shouldn't referee city matches.
The Greater Manchester area is 500 square miles and contains Bolton, Manchester, Wigan, Salford, Rochdale, Trafford, Stockport, Tameside, Oldham, and Bury. It's the 3rd largest by population,  Of the 22 referees that have officiated in the EPL this season by district/county:  * West Yorkshire: 2 * South Yorkshire: 3 * West Sussex: 1 * Lancashire: 3 * County Durham: 1 * Oxfordshire: 1 * **Greater Manchester: 3** * Northumberland: 1 * West Midlands: 2 * East Midlands: 2 * Warwickshire: 1 * Wiltshire: 1 * Queensland, Australia: 1  **Number from actual Manchester city area: 1.**  Tons of 'em. No doubt all the Lancashire and Yorkshire ones count as Manchester too, because reasons.
Considering United are level on points with Newcastle you'd imagine he'd be biased against United
Or when Howard Webb is named the head of the refs’ association.
If he sends off Pickford then disallows a bunch of Man U goals you know he's biased
Anthony Taylor lived within 3 miles of Altrincham and even [moved](https://www.cheshire-live.co.uk/news/chester-cheshire-news/heroic-euro-2020-referee-anthony-20809444.amp) there as an adult. He helped Altrincham get a defib fitted via the Premier league fund and attended the [installation](https://www.premierleague.com/news/2205954). He even does a lot of work with businesses in the area on behalf of the [football](https://www.messengernewspapers.co.uk/news/19448748.altrincham-invite-companies-big-small-join-new-business-club/) club. He is also a season ticket holder.   Seems like an awful lot of work to “pretend” to support them don’t you think?
>What's really sketchy are the referees who claim to have no allegiance; surely that's not true. Especially someone like Anthony Taylor who has spent his life within 6 miles from Old Trafford.  Anyone who has seen Anthony Taylor officiating United games and still proceeds to claim he is biased in their favour is a fucking idiot.
It’s hilarious seeing United fans in this thread
Have to keep yanited’s title chase alive somehow
To be fair this season we've barely gotten any penalties. Fuck you, Klopp.
Nah mate remember Mitrovic's penalty against us? Inside agent
Oliver has stated in the past that he refused to ref Newcastles relegation rivals. If that was the case then, I think it's fair to ask if he should be reffing us or Spurs now
feel like people like to make excuses before shit happens just in case lol   can only imagine how many times a ref has just said "nah no penalty" and no one ever knew it was because deep down it was advantageous to the team he supports on the down low  shit happens and we will never know when it does, im excited to see Newcastle vs Real Madrid next season lol
Facts
Not sure why this is being downvoted, it’s absolutely true.
Said by a utd fan lol   Refs control the game. If they are bias they can have such a big influence on the game.   There has been proven corruption in nearly every other league.   Spain, Germany, Italy, Scotland. You think they haven't been in the English game? Where there's the most money?
Aye mate because he doesn’t let yous turn it into an mma match must mean he’s never supported you
Don’t worry about it. Happening so much this season we are over it 😎
I love how nobody even claims bias anymore we all jsut kind of accept they’re that bad they are probably incapable of purposeful bias haha
People say "he's one of the worst" about every ref tbf
Really don’t get this - United have shit luck with refs m?
Mark Clattenburg went to Cramlington High School as I recall. Seems to be a correlation between Cramlington and shite referees.....
Or some might need to understand that some people only do follow lower league teams because that’s who they support. Loads of refs support prem teams and are open about it or have support teams that have been in the prem. Michael Oliver supports Newcastle, Kevin Friend supports Leicester, Martin Atkinson supports Leeds, Andre Marriner supports Villa, Jon Moss supports Sunderland, Craig Pawson supports Sheffield United. Would maybe do the smallest abit of research before just spouting stuff
Crazy how all those Manchester born refs ended up supporting Dulwich hamlet fc!!!!!!
To be fair, Mike Dean really is a Tranmere fan. Plenty of footage of him giving it loads in with the rest of the fans at Rovers games.
I only half-watched the match on Tuesday as I was working, but did he get any major decisions wrong? I didn't notice anything too bad.
the only one who actually did support a lower league team seemed to be Mike Dean
Alternatively, huge numbers of people support smaller clubs in England, and always have, and a disproportionate amount of those fans are serious fans - nearly all casual fans support big teams. The depth of your football pyramid is unparalleled, and that's why your refs are often fans of smaller sides
Anthony Taylor lived in Wythenshawe and spent 8 seasons reffing local leagues in the area. He’s always been hands on in the Cheshire leagues and even gives talks in the area. He also does quizzes where audience members can test his [Altrincham](https://www.cheshirefa.com/news/2021/oct/13/the-refs-room-kicks-off-with-anthony-taylor) knowledge..  Seems a lot of effort to “fake” support for a club. Next you’ll be saying there’s no chance Mike Dean supports Tranmere.
So does a home crowd.
Can you tell them that when they are fucking up basic VAR decisions then. Children can see lines idk why PL officials can’t.
Yeah but we can avoid all the shit by preventing it
How dare you have common sense on this sub
That's pushing too far in my opinion. The result of one match might affect 4+ teams,plus the 2 playing,  you can't eliminate so many people for each match every match day
United fans worrying about refs being biased? That’s a first.
Why would he be biased against United, OP said he supports them?
Obviously Newcastle are level on points with themselves lad
Altrincham is 6 miles from Old Trafford...   He's a season ticket holder because his daughters play there, it's less than a 2k seat stadium, and £40 a season.   I too support my local 4th tier team, which is a higher tier than non-league Altrincham.   It's possible to support more than one team.. which is why many other referees who don't openly claim to be a supporter of a major club near their childhood home don't referee any of the teams in the area: John Brooks, David Coote, Andy Madley, Michael Salisbury.   Yet the ones from the Manchester area don't get the same treatment: Anthony Taylor and Chris Kavanagh.   Weird how that happens.
Cmon now don't be letting the facts mess with their made up fantasy they have of him
Mate, actual United fans know they're not in the title race. We are however, still in all the competitions for now though.
Arsenal fans piping up now
You still got more pens than Liverpool 😂
Us beating West Ham 5-1 this week?  All down to Agent Nolan spiking the West Ham players Lucozade believe it or not.
I think this is a key point. He excused himself from games where he could benefit Newcastle in the last. Yet he hasn’t here. The inconsistency (I know right, referee’s and inconsistency, who’d a thunk it?) is the bigger issue
The saying of "Fergie time" didn't come from no where!
Wtf does being a united fan have to do with anything?   That must be why win every single game we play.   Idiot.
It’s because they’re all shite regardless
People say...
Can't remember, was he famous for supposedly favouring Manchester United?
Taylor grew up greater Manchester in the 90’s, when United were the best team in world football, born into a family of reds, Uncles season ticket holders. And you really expect us to believe he thought “nah sod that, I’ll follow Altrincham”?  Edit: should add that I don’t think Taylor is biased. He’s refereed some Manchester Derbys and would generally say he’s done an alright job. But the idea that he’s an Alty fan has always made me laugh.
This. Most are openly fans of premier league clubs and have even officiated rivals. However there are some like Taylor, Dean, Madley brothers, Darren England and Atwell who are well known as supporters of lower league clubs. I’m guessing the person above believes people only support premier league clubs and all lower league games are empty.
You've named 6, half of which are retired. What about the rest? It's just statistically unrealistic for that many professional referees to 'support' non league/league 1/league 2 sides.  If you genuinely believe they have no bias to a certain club, you're naive.
He's one of the very few I'll say seems like a genuine fan.
He was pretty bad but it was just 50/50 soft free kicks, the game was awful in general and the only big calls were dealt with by VAR. Quiet game for him I bet he was giving all sorts of red cards out when he got home to the Mrs to make up for it.  Dog banned from the house for 3 weeks for shitting on the rug.
Or all the Manchester guys are lying
I bet Mike Dean claimed those tranmere play off tickets back on expenses
Yeh but that affects all equally
If they remember to draw the lines
because the pl is staffed with incompetents
Just ignore the idiots who bring it up.  It's not as if people actually listen to these people anyway.
How original
He supports Newcastle, not Man United
Most non Newcastle fans use United for Man United, not Newcastle United. You don't need to be pedantic
Okay, he lives outside manchester and happened to grow up 6 miles away from Old Trafford. There is still absolutely zero evidence he supported or liked United. Can he like other teams? Of course. You are acting like it’s a fact he supports them. He has always attended Altrincham games, helped with refereeing schools at the club since his days officiating non-leagues before his daughters were born.   Martin Atkinson is from Bradford and supports Leeds. Andre mariner is from Solihull but supports Villa (twice as far away than Birmingham Citys ground). Graham scott is from Oxford and supports Swindon (30miles away) rather than Reading that’s closer (25miles). Stewart Atwell is from Nuneaton and supports Luton (63miles away) over Leicester (18miles).
Did you see the goals? Would make more sense if they had been drugged
Lmao
Haha exactly! Still exists to this day. Every time I see 3 mins added time and united is down, I know united is going to score in the 96th min.
Lmao
Because you have and historically have had a huge bias from the refs, so it's ironic that you say it's a poor excuse for losing, lol.
Think there was a game at Stamford Bridge years ago where he sent off Torres and Ivanovic(?) when truthfully I believe a United player should have been sent off earlier in the game. Outside of that I’m not sure. (Recalling that whole game from memory lmao, I was young enough at the time but seeing Torres’ face when Clattenburg showed him the red is a memory I’ll always have)  As I write this message I now remember that Torres was brought down unfairly and should have had a foul for but instead Clattenburg ruled it as simulation and showed Torres the second fellow.  This was very long winded I apologise, the whole game is coming back to me the longer I type the message. Gonna go on YouTube now and watch it hahaha
Maybe want to go ahead and read below this. Future advice, read everything that has been said before you try have your little say
Not really, I think maybe you don’t understand the size of support some lower league teams have. Not naive at all, I just know that people support clubs outside of the prem. think you might be the naive one or maybe you just don’t have any form of understanding of lower league teams
i wonder if you understand how big the efl is
or manchester has 91 clubs across the english football pyramid, including 6 in the EFL system + Prem, and not everyone supports big clubs
Wasn’t meant to be original
Big 6 fans. But generally it’s whatever in a discussion.   Until you’re talking about two clubs that are both United. Then you get leeds and Man U, Sheffield and Newcastle. Cause then United are all of those teams and 2 of those clubs unite a city. And Manchester isn’t one of them.
No, it’s just fans of the big 6
Tbf I don’t ever say that when man United fans are talking about themselves or any other team… but when they are also talking about us and ‘United’ doesn’t mean the club that merged from two clubs to create a one club city, it gets a bit silly
No evidence is needed for the others who don’t claim to support any major club to not referee clubs near them.
From 1992-2016, this was the number of games won by goals scored after the 90th [minute](https://www.skysports.com/amp/football/news/11661/10168578/arsenal-have-scored-the-most-injury-time-goals-in-premier-league-history): Liverpool - 27  Arsenal - 21  Chelsea - 20  Everton - 19  Manchester United - 17  Here’s a list from [Opta](https://twitter.com/OptaJoe/status/1112406296605716481?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1112406296605716481%7Ctwgr%5E723575c27915faa024b436082d66b9bb98ee9415%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.givemesport.com%2F1465153-liverpool-have-scored-the-most-90th-minute-or-later-winners-in-premier-league-history%2F) regarding most goals scored after 90 minutes (1992-2019): Liverpool - 33  Arsenal - 25  Manchester United - 22  Spurs - 22  Chelsea - 21
We had less injury time goals than Liverpool under Ferguson’s reign
Just factual not true
What I said still makes perfect sense.   Play better football, score more goals, stop sounding like a little child crying because you didn't get a penalty.
Just not true though
Hahahahahaha are you this condescending in real life or just on Reddit? Try learning how to have a decent conversation with someone who dares to have a different opinion than you.
Majority of lower league fans have a '2nd team'. They usually follow a prem side and their '2nd team' is a club local to them/where they were born. You think Anthony Taylor is a hardcore Altrincham fan while he has family members with season tickets at United? 😄  Maybe you're underestimating the fanbase size of clubs like Manchester United, which is literally the place where half of these refs are from lol.
Well if we're gonna get picky about what to call football teams then you shouldn't call Man United "Man U", but hey ho
That’s honestly great research friend, but can you tell me, in those games that were affected by added time, how many were extended beyond the original amount added, and by how long? That’s my point here. It always seems that United get that extra bit, and that’s when things happen. It’s not an isolated event either, there’s been multiple occasions.
Do you genuinely believe you have been "hard done" by the officials at any stage in your life?
Don’t talk facts it scares Chelsea fans
Which part exactly? The fact that they get added time on added time? Because that absolutely is true.
very ironic again, considering you have the biggest cry baby  in your squad.
We aren’t talking opinions though we are talking fact, you’re saying something which has already been discussed and that conversation is clearly over. You’ve wasted your own time typing when you could of just read how this plays out
Am sorry but that is just not true, all you’re doing is showing that you have zero knowledge of football outside of the prem. Do you think Chesterfield are averaging over 6K fans at home games in the national league because that is there second team? Or how about Gateshead fans that travelled to Wembley to watch them or how about the ones that will be soon? Yeah people don’t do that kind of stuff for their second team. Not really sure what you don’t understand here, you’ll find lower league fans tend to be die hard football of these clubs.
I'm a United fan, my brother supports Liverpool, my Dad supports West Ham, my mrs supports Arsenal and my nephew supports Chelsea. Family members don't always follow the same teams.  Also, I know of no lower league fans with second teams. Like at all.
Bollocks they do.
Well Taylor certainly isn't a United fan because he gives literally twice as many cards and fouls against United as any other referee
There’s not a lot of info about it unfortunately but I had a good look. This [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-20464371.amp) article does seem to show that United did seem to get extra on top of added time when losing/drawing at 79s. However Liverpool 56s and City 50s. The article definitely doesn’t do much to dispel the Big 6 myth though.
But it isn’t factually true but whatever helps you sleep at night
If that's the best you have to counter my point then we're done here.
Why are you so hostile? I’m allowed an opinion that Taylor could be a red, you’re allowed one that he isn’t. It’s not that deep.
Thank you again. If free awards were still a thing, you’d have mine.  Edit: interesting to see that Chelsea actually got *less* time, but surely there’s no agenda there.
[Oh? I guess this never happened then.](https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11667/12082485/manchester-united-penalty-drama-why-bruno-fernandes-goal-after-final-whistle-stood)  Fucking idiot.
Like I’ve said we are talking facts not opinions and the proof is below. Hostile would be me telling you to shove it as you’ve been too lazy to read and your little ego needed to have a say. You’ve had your say, well done you. Gold star? That would be hostile. Maybe next time when trying to have an input in something maybe read everything that was said already. You’ve came well after the end of the conversation and decided to say something that has already been said and proven to be wrong.
Oh no look I have proof that it happened once, so you have proof it happened once that means that it happens every time…. Yeah doesn’t really work like that does it, that’s why I’ve said it’s factual not true. Think it’s time someone learns to use to correct works before calling someone an idiot. Poor poor Chelsea fan, what a joke. Onto your next L son
Bellend of the day is awarded to yours truly.
Lol, you want me to find more events? How about you prove me wrong instead? Or I guess you can’t do that…   I have literally provided a fact, yet you keep on with your “it’s factually not true” argument.   Perhaps you’re the one who should “learn to use correct works”.   Also, me being a Chelsea fan has nothing to do with this, so why bring it up? Is it because you know you’re wrong and can’t back up your argument? I’m sorry, perhaps you’re one of the Toons who always stated oil money is bad money, yet you still support your side? I guess you’re a fucking hypocrite as well?   I reiterate, fucking idiot.
I get where people come from with the Tennis/Cricket angle, but these sports are played on individual points, so it’s a fair bit different.  I’m sure that if a system like that was introduced, it’d end up being used for shithousery without actually solving any issues. It should all be up to the referee either way.  > any point in the game (made without using VAR) and force the ref to go to VAR, so this cuts down on BS like Bruno's goal against Man City.   Didn’t they check it and still get it wrong? Being able to challenge a decision still wouldn’t mean the referee would be guaeanteed to get it right.
Not a fucking chance.  Football is a game meant to be played at pace, it’s meant to be exciting.  VAR is bad enough at stopping the game and killing momentum at times without more of it
It never ceases to amaze me how often people want radical rule changes when something bad happens to a team they like or a team they don’t like gets a bad decision.  Here’s a better idea: better referees and more consistency.
Cricket is pretty slow so it probably works well there but I'm not a fan of slowing down football even more.    I hope you do find love though
Nope.. be having unnecessary stoppages mid game, leave it as it is, except tone back on the VAR and only use it to back up decisions and confirm the refs suspicions, don’t even think it should be used for offsides as I’m happy with human error on offsides, this whole joke of a players left toe being offside by a margin line is pathetic sometimes.
Football is too fast paced and we don't need anymore time wasting. We already have 1 referee, 2 referee assistants, 1 x 4th official plus multiple refs controlling VAR so we don't need managers breaking up play just to waste time as 100% the system would be abused.   You're winning 1-0 late on and defending like crazy so you appeal something stupid to stop play so your team can reorganise.   This is football not basketball so we don't need a time out system.
In theory, sure, but in practice, I think it would be abused. All kinds of situations in which it would be advantageous to stop the game on the pretext of a challenge.
DRS in cricket works because things are objectively out or in. There's very few subjective things in cricket whereas in football the vast majority of decisions are subjective so one person might think you're wrong to challenge whilst another thinks you're right. Bruno's goal vs City stood even with VAR so it's not going to make a difference.
Lmfao wtf did i read
No chance. Which country are you from b
No
The difference is that the DRS system is aware that it has issues, and needs margins of error and things like umpire's call to accommodate it.  VAR is patently shit at a lot of the decisions it's being forced into making. It simply isn't a good tool for toenail offsides, and nor was it ever meant to be. VAR, like DRS, was intended to resolve issues of clear and obvious error. Because the margins are so tight in football - one goal either way frequently decides a match, while there aren't too many cricket matches decided by one or two runs - it's being asked to review other issues that it's just not good at.  There's also the slowdown and delay. Cricket has staccato moments of action; a ball can be sent down the wicket every 45 seconds and still keep up with the over rate. Football is designed to flow with minimal stoppages and breaks. It's a completely different paradigm. See also tennis, the NFL, and every other sport that's implemented it successfully. Maybe the only continuous (in the mathematical sense) sport that's been able to pull off video replay is rugby, and there the referee asks for the TMO to review, not the teams.
yeah they checked bruno's goal and deemed Rashford not interfering in play because umm ??Akanji?? would have never made it to the ball or something. but we will never know because rashford was stood in front of him lmao
Right as hell
Well, with how tight the title race is this year, that bad call might end up losing City the three-peat. This BS also lost Barcelona a title. If this 'minor' issue is changing the history books, then why not fix it?
I misspelled live
i think if this was something to be introduced, there should be criteria to when you can use it  you get 1 challenge a game. If its correct, your challenge remains  but you can only use it when VAR felt the need to check it or something similar like a "challenge available" type light in the dugout.  so you have a choice to make, was that ACTUALLY handball or are you just crying because you wanted the pen, are you going to waste your challenge on the clearly tucked away arms or are you going to save it for when youre 1-0 up and the opposition scores a clearly offside goal in the last minute to lose you 2 points or when youre player is given red for something you don't think was deserving.    i think you'd see a lot less people arguing with a referee if he can just turn around and say "well your manager hasn't challenged it"
No
The title last year was decided on the last 15 minutes of the last game, there were numerous awful decisions throughout the season. This season isn’t close in comparison to the past few seasons.   You’re looking for excuses.
Personally I’d start the 4 worst players you have, ignore the flair, it’s bugged.
Shouldn’t this be in the Arsenal sub?
Very sneaky username Arteta, nice try
It’s not the best weekend for Jesus, let’s be honest.
You not got your own sub for this?
Probably anyone if in being honest
martinelli - jesus - saka
Trusted pair, Terry Henry and Birdkamp
Martinelli on the left; Jesus in the Middle; Saka on the right. I mean who else you want lol?
Gabby offers a lot more when he plays
Throw on the U18s, I'm sure it'll work
Yes yes
Trossard Saka Jesus
We’ll do that if you put your worst defenders as well.
This is the karma sub for accounts who dont yet qualify to participate in their own sub lolol
But he may rise to the occasion.
I’m afraid he may nail it honestly
Your name must be Thomas
Trossard?
They sure do
Underrated: leighton baines   [the proof](https://youtu.be/Mu2ZsfwCqQk) (keep in mind he’s a left back)
He pours milk before cereal
He was a beloved wrestler but then he became the mayor of Knox County, Tennessee and people found his politics objectionable
He puts right sock on, then his right boot on, then his left sock on then his left boot.
He buried his brother alive at Survivor Series 2003.
He’s England’s Golden Boy, enabling him to get away with pretty much anything and the media turn a blind eye to it. He pretty much ended Lejeune’s career a few years back and didn’t even get a yellow card.
I think there has always been an undercurrent of people not liking him, to me it was such a surprise that the pundits went so hard on him this week when has always had a bit of a rep for overselling tackles and going down easy, when he was struck in the face this week (he made a meal of it, but I think most would agree with the red)
I met him once. The foulest attitude of any player and that's really saying something because I also had the displeasure of meeting Zaha.  You will be surprised at how often people HATE being recognised in a brothel in Soho.
She’s working for Moff Gideon in secret and indoctrinated Dr Pershing
People think that he’s going to move to Utd, so they’re just getting some early practice in.
Because he doesn’t know how to breathe through his nose.
The real question is why you would like him?  He’s just so spursy
He has fragile eyelashes
I hate that stupid backing into players then falling over like he’s been shot in the back of the head thing he does. But he’s a world class striker, and any team would be incredible lucky to have him.
Because he likes to try to injure players in the air? Oh, guess that’s not just recently.
He fucking almost died because someone touched his face.   Until we start actually booking for simulation this shit just carries on.
Because he is a very good footballer. The most efficient way to get people to dislike you in sport is to be very good at it. Sadly it’s in a lot of people’s nature to try and drag people down who are nearer the top.
I hated him ever since he turned on his tag team championship partner Mankind in 98
I don’t think he belongs in an elite category. He’s very good, but not great, yet he’s lauded like he’s englands best ever player. My nan could have scored that WC hat-trick against Panama with 2 pens and a header from a corner. He belongs in a category with sheringham and le tiss, not shearer and Rooney for me.
i haven't seen Kane get hate tho
As a Gooner, I hate to admit it but I don’t have a problem with Kane, seems like a decent guy!…although I don’t like the way he goes down like he’s been shot with the slightest touch!
He's England's best player and for some reason we always seem to hate and dislike towards our best player and I've never understood it. Same happens with Rooney and Beckham. For some reason fans and the media love disliking our nations best player.
Hes pretty hot I guess
Yes. He's suddenly been linked to Man United and there is every possibility that he might go to United next season. So people training guns.
He’s typically Spurs ... loads of promise and as we shall see a distinct lack of silverware. He is also a complete shithouse - his reaction after he goes through 2 separate players as he knows his team ethic is shit along with his chances of ever achieving anything with them. Then gets touched on the face by doucoure ( who also was out of order and let his teammates down with such action). If Doucoure wasn’t to touch him in that moment, you could bet your left Nut that he wouldn’t of received even a yellow card.  Ie  Shithouse.
Because he's linked with united. United has the most haters. 2+2
He killed his brother out of jealously then changed then spelling of his name. Forgive, but don’t forget.
Ofc he does! Thats the right way you carb psychos!
Lmaoo if you know you know
The best debute ever. "That's gotta be...that's gotta be Kane"
This is the correct answer.
Oh that is horrendous I have never heard that one and that is disgusting behaviour
Haha that’s genuinely so annoying.
I see what you did there…
This is what I found baffling. Never got any shit from pundits due to being England’s “star man”, but then they give him shit for getting hit in the face!
You shouldn't really disclose people's identity like that, have some respect for your customers.
Long term covid
Is that why he fell to the the floor like he'd been shot, was he searching for the eyelash that fell off in the brutal attack by Doucoure 😂😂😂😂😂  Surprised he didn't need a stretcher after that mauling
Don't spoil it for everyone.
Exactly and yes he's England's top scorer but 1 in 3 are penalties (18/54) so not exactly proving himself as a top striker on the world stage he can just shoot from 12 yards lol.  He's had more pens than any other England attackers by at least 15 pens I think he's had 22 in total in I think 82 games. Excluding subbed games it's around 55 games.
Mate you couldn’t score against Panama never mind your nan
Was Englands best player. WAS
Beckham doesn't belong on that list... Rooney shearer kane yes but not Beckham
Thank you for the recommendations
I don't think utd should go after him. He's gone 30, his legs have already gone plus he's injury prone and goes missing in big games I think at best you'd get 2 years from Kane which isn't much for a reported 80m.   I'd go after that Napoli forward is it Osimeni give him a 5 year deal and he'll still have a resale value unlike Kane who wouldn't in a few years.
It’s got nothing to do with Man Utd 🙄
Time to take away his medals
Clients, actually.  Although, for the sake of clarity.  1. I do not own nor operate a brothel. This would be illegal under English & Welsh law, where a prostitute must be in business for themselves. 2. I have not had sex with Zaha or Kane. I have seen neither of them in a position where they may have had sex in the very near future. 3. It is 100% fine to have sex with a prostitute if you wish. Completely legal, just don't pick people up on the street.
Lol yup
Mate you haven’t seen Nanny Jelly take a penalty in the back garden.
He still is
☝️this
Is it a plural?   Is it 1 LC winner lol so medal hahaha
Still is for sure
Just an FYI, Mata didn't win the league. His timing was impeccably bad on that front. Joined us the year after we won the league, left us the year before we next won the league, to join United who had won the league 8 months previously lol
You must be tired of all the Bruno Fernandes posts to ask this.
Sadio Mané.   2019, Mané donated £250,000 ($319,103; €284,813) to build a school in his home town of Bambali, Senegal.   In March 2020, Mané donated £41,000 ($52,564; €46,083) to the national committee fighting COVID-19 in Senegal.   In 2021, he donated £500,000 ($684,932; €561,987) towards the construction of a hospital in Bambali.  In addition, he has also financed the building of a school, petrol station and a post office for his local community, supplying the school with free laptops and internet from the 4G internet service he financed in the village. In total, he has spent more than £700,000 ($684,932; €561,987) on these upgrades.   He also commissioned a €70-a-month stipend to each family in his 2,000-person hometown. This is roughly equivalent to a month's wage for a Senegalese citizen on a minimum wage.
Kaoru Mitoma, dude just plays the game
Santi Cazorla
I think Christian Eriksen is a pretty safe pick
I think Saka is generally well liked. Asshole racists from the euros aside, I think most people like him
Gianfranco Zola
Everybody has a hater, and the internet/reddit is the best place to find them.  Someone always hates someone.
Park Ji-Sung
Marcus Rashford! Feeds children, goes about his business with humility, dresses funny and scores from everywhere!
First off, solid list.   Second, I can’t imagine anyone hating Thiago Silva.
Gary Speed
Phil Jones. He’s just a cozy culthero.
Xabi Alonso?
Nicklas Bendtner for sure. Such a humble, hardworking player who earned everything that came his way and never complained if the chips were stacked against him. All hail Lord Bendtner!
Surely no one hates Miggy. With that smile.
Kante
Kante is the antithesis of bruno fernandes
Not a Liverpool fan but was a huge fan of sadio mané such a great player and person
I haven't heard much hate for Alison Becker if any at all
Feel that there is a lot of love going around for Almiron lately...  Zinchenko is another well-liked player. Maybe Saka, Thiago Silva, Reece James, Lisandro Martinez and Eriksen as well.  Edit: OK, maybe not Martinez. No list is ever perfect 😅
Bobby Firmino. That man is talented
Maguire, so hated he's loved
Lots of good ones here. Gotta give a shout for Milner. Just moved to third all-time for PL appearances. Incredibly hardworking and no nonsense. Seems to have a good sense of humor.
David Silva and Kun Aguero always seemed to be universally liked when they were playing in the league.  Out of the current players, Mac Allister seems like a genuinely nice guy.
Not in the premier League now but Sadio Mane. Seriously, what he's done for his home town is beyond humble.   Build them a hospital. How many footballers can say they built a hospital for their home town (I'm there are others)
Kevin De Bruyne, he's an exemplary player. Pure class , and I'm a Liverpool supporter. Salah  is also right up there. Most of his yellows are for taking his shirt off .
Miggy Almiron.
Surprised no one has mentioned de Bruyne, he seems chill and generally well liked
I think Rashford is only hated by racists. Other than that he seems like a great guy. No antics off the pitch, has a whole campaign for child poverty as well. I’m a Liverpool fan, but I still think he’s great on pitch too. You don’t see him kicking off and he has a great finishing ability
Vidic? Have never heard anyone speak ill of him.
Not a pl player anymore but if you hate mwepu than your just weird
Mahrez
Martin Odegaard!
Eriksen
Everyone seems to love Son apart from spurs fans ironically.
Bobby Firmino
Saka from Arsenal Isak from Newcastle
Jimmy Bullard
Surely Saka is in the mix for this
Nathan akè? Improves every game, plays so well, doesn't make a fuss and acts humble
I think Declan Rice is well respected
I imagine HM Son is very respectful & kind to all.
Marcus Rashford
I would throw an old one, Paul Scholes, always respected him
Joey Barton
Eriksen, Yaya
Mitoma? I don't really keep tabs on who people hate so I'm not too certain.
Evra besides racists and Liverpool fans. Everyone loves uncle pat
KDB and Augero.
Can’t hate Mohamed salah
Bukayo Saka
Christian Eriksen, Bukayo Saka, actually can’t hate Mo Salah he seems like a top geezer
David Silva is a little bitch
Jamie Vardy. He stuck with Leicester through thick and thin, and finally when able to get his big payday he chose to stick it out with Leicester for its long haul. He’s earned my respect and many others. A statue of him being built in that city doesn’t make me question why.
This sub is sooooo thrash recently, "who do you like, who do you hate, who does everyone like, who does everyone hate". Who tf cares.
Idk why but as for now, with few exceptions especially for a certain person unless said person is proven innocent which I hope he is, its hard to hate most of the Arsenal players right now. Saka being one of them.  However, if you ask me about past Arsenal players, I think Santi Cazorla deserve a good mention.
Son, Saka, Kante
Kante is an anti vax, enough said.
Saka
David Luiz, maybe?
Saka. He’s so lovable.
Heung min son - I hate to see him not smiling this season
Son
Son for me
Bruno Fernandes
Saka
Bruno
If we're talking about foreign players it has to be a list that includes Kanté and Mo Salah. YES, I do am a Liverpool fan, but what can you really have against him? He is overperforming since he came here, is not into the banter, trains every day in the gym…I mean, look at his body. He is so professional, has a humble family, lives religious and would have gotten the chance to change clubs multiple times FOR SURE, and still, he is at Liverpool. I rate that very high.  I would also out Bukayo Saka, Mount, Eriksen, Thiago Silva and Rashford in that category.
Miggy Almiron, man wakes up smiling :D
James Milner
Gotta be Son.
Harry Kane.
I don’t live in the UK so I don’t see the same coverage of the PL that many do.   I was set to offer up Mo Salah, but have seen folks already dismissing this choice and am curious as to why? Doesn’t dive, plays within the laws, and I haven’t seen him engage in retributory challenges or shithousery.   Are there enough hooligans in the greater fanbase of the Premiership that dislike his religious beliefs or his nationality to disqualify him from this list?
Harry Kane comes across as being a good guy.
You chose a black player.  I can guarantee that there are people who hate him for that alone.  According to a study, Chelsea are the most racist team in the Premier League, followed by Manchester United and Leeds:  [https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/sport/football/leeds-united/latest-leeds-united-news/most-racist-football-clubs-leeds-joint-second-league-shame-1821833](https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/sport/football/leeds-united/latest-leeds-united-news/most-racist-football-clubs-leeds-joint-second-league-shame-1821833)
Mbappe
Son Heung Min
Reece James. Loves his football, never complains, just gets the job done.
WHAT ABOUT SONNY BOY
WHAT ABOUT SONNY BOY
Jack Harrison is so wholesome. Can't imagine anyone hating him.
David Silva was an asshole to Lazio tough agreed to a contract and then just walked off he is not as classy as many think
Harvey Elliot
Who hates Son though?
Bruno Fernandes.
Bruno Fernandes
Is there anyone that actually hates darwin, ik he's trolled a lot,  but does someone actually think he's a rat faced cunt or something
The answer is: Bruno Fernandes.      Prepare for downvotes.
Moe salah
Hated David Silva
No one ‘hates’ Harry Kane, or at least I don’t think anyone has any good reason to hate him.
Juninho
Matt le Tissier
Moises Caicedo - consistent hard worker who doesn’t complain or dive.
Kante
 I haven't heard any hate towards Edourard Mendy
Debruyne, Aguero
Mane when he was still with us
I doubt anyone hates/hated Kante, Zabaletta, Ledley King, Silva, these are the ones on the top of my head.
Luke Shaw seems chill, I think everyone is happy for him to recover from the leg break
Rodri
Everyone who's not Bruno Fernandes
People hate without knowing barely anything actually about them lol
Dennis wise
Seamus Coleman
Son?
stop asking the same question every two days?
Sonny
Saka
Can you hate Ødegård?
As an Arsenal fan, I cannot hate Heung Min Son of Tottenham. I'm half Asian and Son hasn't done anything I dislike apart from representing Spurs. I still like the guy.   I'd also say Adama Traeore of Wolves because the guy just looks like a very fast mammoth whenever he plays. That's fun to watch.
Jonjo
I hate Silva...
Salah
Kante is a good shout.
Ricardo pereira - spends so much time injured that he doesnt even have time to get someone hating him.  I am not from the uk so this perception may ne wrong, but always felt that Son is not really disliked. He also seems to be a genuinely friendly player.  I guess that the others - Rashford, Mané,  Eriksen have already been covered. Though i think the Eriksen is in large effect due to the heart attack in the Euro, otherwise indont think we would see him in these lists.  Nick Pope also seems.to be one to watch. Seems to be a humble non-flashy keeper that amazingly has been away from top teams. Sure newcastle is doing fine now but at the start of the season were any of you ready to bet on Newcastle as contenders for a CL spot?
Son
Bukayo Saka
Did anyone dislike David Seaman when he was around? Always heard he was good for a laugh with the opposition fans when his back was to them.
Son Heung-min. Seems like such a likeable guy.
I'd go for Son and Saka, IF arse nal win, it will do rependance(is that a word?) to Saka for all that hate he got
Juninho from Boro, everyone I know loved him.
Haaland. I’m not a City fan, but anyone who hates this man is simply jealous
Is Saka up there? The only hate I see him get is racist hate.. and those guys don’t count. Maybe he’s too young to be put in the same category as these guys but I’d be curious to see perspectives on him in 5 years!
Salah
Saka, Rashford, are both good picks. I’d also say John Stones - comes across a very likeable bloke. Nobody seems to hate Ruben Loftus-Cheek either. Current Leeds-specific, Gnonto tends to evoke admiration from fans of all clubs. Luke Ayling also always plays the game in the right way - another player with general appeal.   I think you’d be hard pressed to find football fans who actively hate Rooney/Gerrard (and players like them) - even if fans don’t explicitly like these players, respect for what they achieved is usually the default.   Some examples of the opposite include Pepe, Ramos, Bruno Fernandes, Richarlison, Anthony Gordon, and Grealish, for quite obvious reasons
Son
Raphael Varane
Miggy Almiron
As a Liverpool supporter its hard to give any Man Utd player credit, but what Marcus Rashford has done with charity work is fantastic. Some things are more important than football and rivalries, and its impossible to not look up to him for his work with homeless charities and free meals for school kids. If only everybody with his influence did as much as him. A really great guy, huge respect.
Bryan Robson back in the day ....name me one person who hated Robbo !
Maguire n  Burono
Probably Fred. I love his smile.
He’s only been in the Prem for a little over a year as well as injured most of this season but I can’t imagine anyone hating Luis Diaz. The man is as humble as can be and hit the ground running when he got to the Prem. I hope to see him back soon
Balotelli
Sonny.
Vialli
I am surprised how Petr Cech never gets mentioned  He seems a good fit for this thread
I think Bukayo Saka is up there
Nathan ake  Ruben dias Kdb All took time out to come see my dad before he passed so ill always love theses guys as people
Erling Haaland
Lol David Silva? Really?
I'd add Sadio Mane. Decent and humble.
12 months ago you could probably have put Marcuse Rashford in here, but he went and spoiled it by getting back to form and becoming Manchester United's main man
How about Rashford he is a very good player, and done a lot to the community
Not many will be familiar with Pablo Fornals, but he is well liked among fans.  As an example of how good a guy he is:    When playing a badly outclassed Larnaca team in the Europa Conference League, with Larnaca already facing a large deficit, one of their players fouled him, and the play went to video review for a red card.  As the ref came back to rescind the yellow and show the red, Fornals put his arm around the offending player and pleaded with the ref not to give him the red.
Umtiti
Son. Who hates Son?
I have yet to meet somebody who hates Tony Hibbert.
Peter Crouch was always pretty well liked
Balotelli?
ZOLA
Diego costa, bruno fernandes, romero
Cazorla
I can’t believe I’ve scrolled down this far and haven’t seen Son Heung-min yet.
Louis Suarez
David De Gea
Definitely N'Golo Kante, he's way too nice. 🔵❤️
Loved Kanté before I learned he refused to get vaccinated
silva for sure, pure class
Son Hueng Min has no hates.
Brenden Aaronson
Bruno Fernandes
I feel like son is largely respected by everyone, even Arsenal fans.
Martin Odegard a young leader being an example
This blew my mind lmao, “mata never won the PL” belongs in a trivia post
Holy shit this is standing in a queue and watching the line next to you move a lot quicker, so you move over to it only for the next person to forget they only have 40quid in pennies n 2ps, In turn causing your queue to grind to a halt as the one you were in, now picks up pace and 5 people that had been behind you now have their shopping sorted, energy turned up to 1000.....    And breathe, yes that was an intentionally long sentence.
Yeah, he missed a couple of chances. Did win the UCL with Chelsea.
Lol reminds me of a hockey player named Marian Hossa. He played for the Pittsburgh penguins in 2008, they lost in the finals to the Red wings. He moved to the Redwings in 2009, who went on to lose in the finals to the penguins lol. He went to Chicago the next year and finally won a cup.
I hate Silva and Mata, at their worst they were winging POS’
You know? I know it. But I was hoping for something different. Get some positivity into the stream.
You beat me to it.
Zaha gets a lot of stick but he's similar:   "Since I started playing, when I got a proper, decent contract, I’ve been giving 10% of my wages back \[to charity\], My sister has got an orphanage, but I kind of take care of it, so it comes under the umbrella of my foundation."
He's a beautiful person and an amazing player. Liverpool shouldn't have let him go.
I was going to say Mane. Absolutely love him on and off the pitch. What a role model.
He was also a dirty player. He was universal hated by non Liverpool fans. Good deeds or not.
Sanio mane, aka elbows. Nasty footballer.  A good human being apparently. But on this list??? Never.
All that just to he called a "dirty cheater" by everyone who wasn't us. Revisionism doesn't work on people whose memories arent made of shit.
No chance.  He’s a diving prick.
a united fan saying this, respect
Nasty piece of shit on the field, apparently a decent guy of it.
Incredible footballer and incredible off the pitch but he is hated for his use of elbows!
Mané dived a lot, played for Liverpool and kicked Ederson in the head - I wouldn't say *no-one* hates him.
£700,000 is €792,190 and $869,470. He's such a genuine person and I think Liverpool would have been better cashing in on Salah and keeping Mane. I think he was happy to move on with his career however so it probably wasn't an option.
He has on of the highest foul counts, I'm pretty sure 300+
He one of those players who you can enjoy his football without supporting his team.
Good one. I always admired Santi Cazorla. Great player.
Maybe not the one dude who had the dream in the Gunners subreddit
Gooner twat.
I always hated this guy
Brentford fans didn't like how he left
Not too hot on the team he plays for but I’m both amazed and happy for him that he’s somehow back playing football at the elite level, so soon after what happened. Genuinely amazing story
Not my cup of tea.
Spurs fan. Nah, fuck him.
Majority of those racist tweets weren't even sent from the UK. The ones that were, were swiftly convicted. A nation of 50,000,000 and 3 people is not representative of that. I think nearly all fans really do like him because of the penalty miss and how young he was. The support well outweighed the 3 English racists
This. To hate Saka is to hate football
Starboy is pure ❤️
As a Spurs fan I don’t hate Saka, and even love him when he plays for England.
He can play a bit nasty sometimes. I'm sure he's great off the pitch though.
Spurs fans
Gooner twat.
Anther good call. I think most of the highly mentioned names here are fair.  Santi cazoroa, kante,  rashfiord etc
Exactly. I’ve already read multiples names on this post that I don’t like lol
Tories aren't the biggest fan
The Daily Mail and The Sun disagree but I wouldn't count them as people, just scum
Id say he's the only man u player i like.
Apparently you missed the "you let your country down" chants
Very dislikeable player, massive diver.
I remember the last euro cup I was looking at transfermarkt values for players and he was worth one million euros and I was flabbergasted. Who isn’t taking that deal. Giroud was also only 3 million euros.
He's a Bolsanaro supporter
He openly supports Bolsonaro, so...
His wife seems kinda batshit, always complaining about the manager publicly. Even if things aren’t going great, surely that doesn’t help.
A lot of Brazilians support Bolsonaro and show their true colours off the pitch, Silva is one of those supporters.
He said Julian Alvarez's ranking in FIFA The Best was a joke. People voted for Alvarez, and he didn't win it, what's the difference between lower ranks? And what Alvarez was supposed to do? Refuse the 7th position? I used to like Thiago Silva but after this I lost so much respect for him.
thiago silva is a bitch😭
if i didnt know about his early career i would probably dislike him purely because personally i dont rate him as much as the majority does and because he was on that chelsea team
Kane’s goal that was ruled out for no reason. But otherwise yeah he seems sound as a pound, much respect for the high level he still plays at.
I can think of a few Reds who loathe him...
Good shout. I was going to say Sami Hyypia
He was also the greatest striker that ever lived, what’s to hate?
Despite being rubbish and only coming to Forest because both he and the club were desperate, he scored twice, but we stayed up in the Championship on goal difference by 2 goals, so he actually did a surprising amount of good.
Were those chips from paddypower?
Nobody. Not even jack anymore.
Always scores against us so I don't like him
I think hes a decent player and i dont hate him but he has such a punchable face lol
He dived against us once so i've not liked him since
He wasn't loved by everyone, far from. Diver, and dirty player, mostly the last few years. He was hated by everyone i know who isn't a Liverpool supporter.
Mané is great to watch but he's definitely not loved. He was a dirty player. Had a habit of elbowing people in the face "accidentally" every other game.
Horribly dirty player, elbowed someone in the face and got away with it every other match it seemed like.
Was he not well up Bolsonaro?
I wouldn't say most people like Martinez.
Solid list aside from Martinez
Miggy!!
Ramsdale?? Class act imo
Loved by 19/20 clubs hahaha
Yep, scrolled a long way for this. Humble, incredibly hard working, a proper role model.
Only reason people may dislike him is that he’s been to near every prem club up north
Definitely not Aguero he could be a nasty prick, just look at his red card on Dave Luiz
Not comparing but Salah donated £2.5m to a hospital in Egypt.
Not a single reason to hate this man, so genuine, so honest and so humble
He made a comment about being bored by playing Wales which got my back up a bit, but they have played something like 9 times in the last 10 years, so maybe he has a point.
The only reason why some people hate Salah was his tendancy for diving for just a 2-3 game stretch a few years ago. He hasn't dived since then yet still gets called a diver.
Miggy!!!
He always seems to throw a tantrum when things don’t go his way though
Too much of a flopper
A bit of a let down for the national team, always faking injuries to drop out of games outside of main tournaments.
Torres even loved to play with him.
I assume some Everton fans would disagree
Ask Hull City fans and they'd strongly disagree. Man was a gigantic mess at the time and behaved like a twat to everyone around him
Jimmys a clown! In a good way, he’s hilarious.
Not in Ireland he’s not. Turn coat.
Lol no. Proper try hard vibes.
Yeah, just seems like such a good dude. I think on his Gary Neville Overlap, he said he's never had a drink.
Snake
Dont like Son, his true self comes out when things dont go his way
Andre Gomes and Everton may have something to say here
I hate son so so much, not because I'm an Arsenal fan but because he's such a fake character. Kante is nice though
Not a fan of Son at all. Hate all of the crying and theatrics, and he has a dirty streak too. He's so fake.
I heartily disagree. Last year's NLD he tried to elbow Holding and pretended nothing happened. He's a dirty player but most people don't see it because he has a "nice guy face".
Son is a wolf in sheep’s clothing
Nah
Arsenal fan and I'd have thought so too.   surprised by some of the responses tbh.
I don’t get the hate for Sonny! Seems like a great person and is definitely a terrific player.
Nope. A faker and a dirtbird at times.
Yeah just a really good role model for kids.
an incredibly dirty player
Leg breaking petulant narcissist scum bag. I hate him.
Booo. Great talent.  Not a likeable player.  He was sneaky af
Agüero's recent antics like "take this up your ass madristas" and "All of cristiano's goals are pure luck" type of comments are destroying his reputation. He needs to realise messi isn't going to shag him this way
Eriksen is living off the fact he died on the pitch. Not a particularly likeable player, quite the opposite.
Are you thinking of Bernardo Silva? Cos he IS a little shit.
I'm a blue so I'm biased but don't think this was anyone's general opinion while he was in the Prem.
Jamie Vardy has half the league hating on him for the shithouse he is
He is kinda racist though. That would make a lot of people dislike him (including myself)
Jamie Vardy looks like a bent copper
haha good point...so who do you like???
Yup. This is about the third post asking exactly this in a week.
To be fair to him it's his own opinion and he keeps it to himself. I've never seen him advocate for it or try to push the message on anyone. I don't mind if anyone is anti vax as long as they aren't part of the "I'm anti vax and you should be too" crowd.
Shut the fuck up. I don’t see him telling others not to get it so why is it such an issue?
You'll find half the United fanbase hating on Fred
Who tf like Fred
Salah?! Lol
The entire league shits on salah's name every minute of every day
Thiago silva?
He asked who is most liked , not most hated.
Bruno from Newcastle, right? The other one is hated so much as he's a cunt of player, cheat and little whining baby.
LOL
Wtf he is the kind of player everyone admires yet everyone hates
If you live outside the U.K. you can probably see more coverage than we do
I don't hate Salah but I do think he's definitely a diver
He went through a period of diving which tarnished his reputation. He cut it out but the perception remains. He gets absolutely nothing from referees every single week.
Sorry but could we clarify that having a segment of racist idiots in your fan base does not mean that the team is racist. It's unfortunate that there are still people that behave that way towards other people but if you take how many fans the likes of Man United and Chelsea have It's a extremely small minority of the fan base. I'm involved in a few Chelsea forums and I can tell you that I've never had anyone say anything negative about Kante and certainly not because of the colour of his skin
I’ve never heard of anyone disliking him? But we’re just gonna shut this whole thread down for black players because racists must exist out there somewhere? I’d say Kante belongs because I’ve seen hate for all kinds of players but not him. Also this is a Reddit question so let’s assume redditors are addressed here.
Even racists like kante.
Why even bother to count racists in with this fun little poll? Why even bring it up? Why not just punch everybody in the stomach and really being the mood down
>hat there are people who hate him for that alone.  I am not sure what you mean by this? Are you saying people hate black players because they are black? I'm optimistic that people don't hate people because of color. I'm not naive, and I think most of the racism in football is just stupid banter and bottom of the barrel bullshit designed to hurt the player and throw them off their game. But if you got most people alone to chat, they would just say sorry and say they were messing about. (maybe I am naive.)
You're sounding kinda racist yourself there. Excluding an entire race from the conversation because of their skin colour...
Very much a hated player.
Anyone with that fake blonde hairstyle is instantly a twat in my books
Nah lazio are nazis fucking them over is great.
Based silva 🗿
Every non spurs fan. Dirty player and constant whinger.
He was heavily booed at Everton
He comes off as hateable and a bit dim. Also got that red card for double headbutting early in the season, which just adds to those points as well as making him seem violent.
bottles it for his own club, bottles it for the national team, constantly diving and putting in dirty tackles and getting away with it because he is the England captain and FA goldenboy. Never mind the fact that he has a trademark move in which he actively puts other players at a high risk of broken backs/necks.
Finally! I was searching this whole thread astonished no one had mentioned him. He’s so lovable!
And to be honest you can't hate him...mostly because of that innocent smile. 😆
That's actually hilariously bad misfortune. Glad he got his win in the end though, but that shit is wild
Nah you can miss me with that shit
I’ll throw out Christian Eriksen. He’s been through a lot and has always seemed classy and well respected.
What can you do when a player wants a new challenge?
It was the right decision. It was also his decision. We will always love him.
It’s no secret that many hates him though
Getting downvoted but I agree. I love Mane off the pitch, but on it he was a diva and dirty at times. I remember him stomping on players, sneakily punching a player, he was just a nice guy tho so everyone brushed it off. Same with Son imo, there’s a compilation of dirty tackles from Son where he loses his head, but since he’s got a cute smile everyone loves him
Dirty? He made one mistake with the Ederson incident.  Gfy
Dirty or aggressive? There is a difference.
I hate fans that have agendas against other players and say stupid things purely because they’re rival players. For example, Utd fans hated Eriksen four years ago because he played for Spurs but we love him now. So many fans don’t respect these incredible athletes.
Tf has he ever done that makes you say that?
My friend, is okay, no?
Personally don’t care. He went for wages that Brentford would never do long term. And I’m pretty sure he was honest with the club and the fans about why he left.
Eh only some. I was perfectly fine with how he left. He went for the money and completely understood that. He helped alter our trajectory and was a significant reason we stayed up. It also looks like he helped Jensen become a player on another level. I’ll always be grateful to Erisken for that.
Bloke almost never came back, let him collect that fat pay check while he can. Besides he was only there for 6 months, he did his job.
Yeah you can drink piss
I hate Saka but I love football
What do you mean by nasty?
On behalf of Spurs fans, we don't hate Saka really. We were one of the first fanbases to give him a standing ovation after the euros.
I assure you only him and Bellerin back in the day I do not hate.
Love Saka and Zinchenko
Saka is?
Tories aren't really people tho.
I'd love to "let my country down" by scoring 3 in under 150 minutes played in a world cup to be honest.
Don’t bring back painful memories… Giroud should never have been sold
Transfermarkt values are absolute garbage though. They base partially on wages and then just what they think someone is worth. It's the same as asking someone down the pub what they think.
Obviously that’s not what they would sell for lol
I have to plead ignorance here.. I’m assuming that’s some sort of Brazilian political figure? The same one that Neymar supported?
So what?
Supporting Bolsonaro in a race against Lula ain't no reason to hate anyone, same applies if it go in the other way like Richarlison supporting Lula
She absolutely is, but she’s our batshit. I’ve come to realize that and love her all the same lol
And none of them should be judged for it.
I stand corrected. One person hates Thiago Silva.
Serious question, how can you not rate him? He has an argument for being the best CB in the league at 38
Understandable. I probably would feel the same. I didn’t know much about him in his Milan days and am not a fan of psg, so in reality, I’m probably the same… I did go back and watch games of him in Milan, was incredible there as well. Used as a DM at times too. Phenomenal player.
Yeah. Probably because of his paycheck. But thats really the clubs fault. I would have accepted a paycheck myself also - While beeing injured.
He's scored like once against you in the past 6 games. Was a worldie tbf.
Wow what a take? Do you think puppies have a punchable face to? 😅
I see 2 elbows when googling it. Surely you can provide dozens since he does it every other game. I'll settle for 5.
So was Thiago Silva but I don't see any comments about that  For the record anyone who supports Bolsonaro is a gigantic cunt regardless of how "classy" they come across in person
As a man from South America with a German grandfather and last name (Becker) who vocally supports a fascist, I've always reserved some concerns over Alisson to say the least.
Maybe I'm conflating praise for his ability with likeability.  I know his signing was met with scepticism but now seems to be publically acknowledged as a good move by United.   Perhaps a hasty assumption on my part to interpret that as being well liked by the public.  Did say 'maybe' though 😅
Yeah I’ve no idea what this guy is talking about no one likes him apart from united fans
There is something wholesome about him. I mean I'd probably almost smile if he scored against my team...almost 😅
I was very tempted to include him but I'm an Arsenal fan and I'm not fully aware of outsiders' perception of him.  He is a bit of a larrakin, which has the potential to ruffle a few feathers with opposition fans. Glad to hear you like him.  On a side note, I do recall Liverpool fans ripping into him on social media last season...  PS. On the topic of likeable goalkeepers, I was thinking the other day that the most likeable of the PL era would have to Petr Cech.
I’m an arsenal fan and ramsdale used to annoy the shit out of me. He’s so dramatic on the field, it reads as immature. But the more I learned about him and watched interviews with him, the more he grew on me. I think he’s so passionate (and also young) that he just has trouble moderating his reactions a little, which, you know, so do a lot of other players. So he’s won me over!
If we'd paid Mane the same as Salah he might not have left, and built 5 hospitals 🙃
Very true. There's a humility with the two of them that makes them so likable
I don't mind KDB, but he's not exactly honest on the pitch. He's been guilty of some laughable dives over the years.
Heard plenty of Welsh fans saying they were bored about playing Belgium as well so I think it goes both ways tbf.
Heard plenty of Welsh fans saying they were bored about playing Belgium as well so I think it goes both ways tbf.
I doubt he meant that in the arrogant, "we're far too good to have to keep playing against these idiots" sense, given that you beat them in the Euros quarters. Probably more along the lines of "we're sick of the sight of them", which confers a great deal more respect.
That’s what I’m saying.  And the shit he was saying during the World Cup. That really ain’t something you say lol.I don’t remember if is Captain go Belgium, but even if he isn’t, I’d assume he’s definetly a leader in the dressing room, so that really shouldn’t run.
I’m not surprised you’re saying that since you’re a Liverpool fan as well haha. We’re talking about a player no one hates though not what their accomplishments are or are not.  Edit: and even if his ‘knock’ he suffered that made him drop out the England squad was made up I wouldn’t blame him. Got called every name under the sun after the Euros and the World Cup.
Why Everton?
Yeah I actually forgot about that, him a grealish done us dirty
was embarrassing when he tried to start a fight with Nketiah when west ham were getting spanked.
Not having a drink makes him a good dude? He’s a professional athlete.
Yeah just seems like a true professional too. Doesn't go down like he's been shot when another player blows on him so that's a plus too
What’s his true self?
I’d say the same about Saka, numerous nasty stamps on his resume.
Because [nothing fucking happened.](https://youtu.be/KRsLdWWMnpM). Holding was being unnecessarily rough on Sonny (e.g. kicking him on the back while on the ground) and in one of these ocassions, he was pretty much wrestling him for no reason, without the ball, not allowing him to  get off the ground and Son simply tried to put his arm in between as if to break free. It seems you've never seen anyone getting elbowed in your life. I swear the bias is unreal.  Its the same sith the Andre Gomes injury. He mistimed a tackle with such bad luck Gomes bump into Aurier in a bad manner and got a horrendous injury. Son got a red, which he never disputed, ans felt so bad that he was crying, but ofc, thats also fake, just like showing [genuine concern](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/07/son-heung-min-text-contact-andre-gomes-injury-everton-tottenham-football) after it happened.  He even [prevented a fight between 2 players from the opposition](https://youtu.be/ITemr9I93_g)... talk about fake guy.  [He genuinely cares for the staff](https://www.planetfootball.com/quick-reads/son-heung-min-tottenham-south-korea-nicest-man-world-charity-fans-classy/) even behind the scenes, when you dont see it.   If he is pretending, he is trying too hard. Just because he may have gotten a bit intense a couple times (which even Messi, despite his cool, nonconflictive character, has done), does not make him the bad guy some Arsenal fans try to make him out to be.
Maybe I have a bad memory lol
Ha ha ha guy is just clowning around. But as long as he was playing in PL, none of my friends, who were die hard Man U fans themselves, hated him. They always got nightmares of Augeroooooo but there was respect for him as a player.   But yes a loose mouth and a loose cannon never did anyone any good. I hope he realises it sooner than later.
Only because he loved getting under Liverpool fan's skin....
I hated him and know many who did, what a rat.
Why is that?
Yeah but who hates him? A bit of a clown player, like maguire
Bit of a paranoid liverpool fan. He is generally well respected.
I misread the post lol
definitely naive
really? i guess that’s just my perception as a relatively new EPL fan
Why did he want to join them in the first place them? He was just a hypocrite
He won the Golden Boot last year and how can u call him dirty by one mistake that he was clearly distraught about. He is one of the top 100 players in the world. His performance this season might not be good but that doesnt matter. I don't see a reason to call him a whinger
I remeber, it was Aurier who tackled and made Gome's foot turn. And Son was really distraught and impacted by this because he though it was his fault not because of a red card. And later the red card rescinded
Lol yea it’s crazy! I actually thought it was 3 times in a row that he lost the final but turns out only 2 which is still pretty bad luck. Like imagine moving to the team that beat you and ending up playing all your friends/ex teammates in the finals the very next year only to have them beat you lol.
It's a good one. Eriksen the the player who can have the most impact on a game with the least movement and the fewest touches. Glides into space, 1-touch ball around the corner and off a team goes.
Excellent shout
Yeah, Eriksen is a G.
Didnt he leave Brentford on bad terms tho?
Nah, the bloke is a nasty little cunt on the pitch
He's elbow game was Diego costa-esque.  So many times he magically evaded a red card.
Elbowing opponents, diving, constant whining, you want me to go on?
He went for more than wages
Sure, wages is the only reason for going from Brentford to Man United
We get you’re a spurs fan
He was against Villa this season, so just being a little biased. Don't really dislike him tbh, seems a nice lad.
That was class
Don’t hate him, hate how good he is for those scum in Woolich
Santi?
Preach lol
Sadio Mane shouldn't have been let go of either.
One of the most underrated strikers ever.
He wanted to leave
Do yourself a favor and do a quick google
I dont "hate" him, I just don't respect him like I used to, can't you guys read?
see thats my problem, imo he isnt close to being the best centre back in the league, i’ll happily agree that hes top 10 ,borderline top 5 , and that is incredible for a 38 year old .but the best? no. i can also appreciate hes a had a legendary career and is one of the best centre backs ever but thats what irritates me
do u know he retired in his mid 20’s in russia due to a near fatal heart condition? thats more what i was talking about
Not just that, his refusal to accept that he's like our 783rd choice CB & give up the #4 shirt and/or move somewhere where he might get game time grates on me
Haha I swore he'd scored more than once against us - guess it was back when he wasn't scoring much so I remember it more. Our games are always dreadful too, seems to be 0-0 or 1-0 every time
No, puppies are cute. My friend is a huge newcastle supporter so i watch a lot of their games and hes good but idk. His face just urks me lol
Almiron looks a bit like Sid from Toy Story tbf
If you found 2 already with a doubtlessly not very thorough google, I'm sure you can find a few more. I'm not really bothered wasting my day doing that.
Pretty much every Brazilian footballer barring Richarlison and Juninho is a Bolsonaro supporter.
I would rather judge a person on traits other than his political views
It would be like saying Ben White - Arsenal fans love his shithousing but i’m sure most the league things he’s a dick
Agreed. He’s just so easy to cheer for. And his struggles and controversy and then subsequent success and humility and great attitude through it all make it all the more wholesome and easy to root for. I can definitely see why opposition fans would feel good about him scoring.
I think he’s the sort of personality you need in football to keep it entertaining. Not everyone likes that but it’s great & otherwise the Prem would be a bit more boring than it is without people like him.
I like him, he's very entertaining lol
Tbf, he's getting paid like 25% more at Bayern than Salah is earning rn. He's set.
So has Salah....
The coach didn't listen to him and played old ass cbs, de bruyne is simply honest and straightforward and doesn't act fake for pr
caused Andre Gomes’ injury
Don't care so much about Grealish. Rice actually played for Ireland three times.
Matey couldn't hurt a wet lettuce
Yeah I heard Haaland having an interview saying he loves wine and kebab pizza but he can’t have either of them. Bit of a silly reason to like someone because they don’t drink lol
No there aren't lol.
Altough I agree with you in the clip he literally elbows him in the face lol.
He elbowed Holding more seriously than the elbow Holding got sent off for in that game - son literally ducks his head a foot or so to run into the elbow lol.  He broke a leg through an intentionally reckless challenge after being dispossessed.  Not saying he is a psycho, but far from a clean and respectful player. Only gets away with his bs because he is teammates with FA goldenboy kane and has a babyface.
Thank you for this.
This is straight out of left field.
For what reason?
[this](https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2543538-jamie-vardy-apologises-for-racial-slur-at-casino-captured-on-video.amp.html)
yeah probably. Sad.
He is a constant diver, always complaining to the ref and putting in nasty tackles. The single worst moment was him intentionally putting a player at risk with a reckless challenge after he lost the ball and was a bit bitter, thus breaking the other player's leg. Then putting on a show about how he didn't mean it. When he sprinted and leapt straight into that unnecessary tackle.
Not really? I think they were disappointed that he didn't sign a new contract with them but I don't recall any bad blood...
How so?
Of course, but Wages were definitely part of it.
what do you mean by nasty?
Didnt know enough of him back in the day
Shame for Liverpool. I think in both cases, the player wanted to leave. Giroud for sure should have gotten more play time. No one appreciated him.
Absolutely. Only real fans of the game can appreciate what he brings. Such a solid CF. Does absolutely everything you need from a player in that position.
Gotcha. No bueno.   He’s no longer president at least?
He’s been great for Chelsea, but their fans definitely overrate him. He wouldn’t be anywhere near as good in other team’s systems too, if he had to run more he’d get caught out so much more frequently.
Then they are all cunts
Even when they're supporting a literal fascist who hates gay people and women and is destroying the Amazon?
Ben White isn't nearly as horrible, nor does he receive that much media coverage for his league performances and antics. The only coverage he got was from homophobes spreading rumours when he left the England camp.
 Ramsdale vs. Leicester fans: https://youtu.be/y86CWwWhLh4  Ramsdale Ad: https://youtu.be/ENLZbE8RbfM
Vs Villa this season and Norwich a couple of seasons ago. That’s just off the top of my head in games I actually watched. Probably more out there guy is a sneaky cunt.
Again, there is a difference between elbowing in the face (with intention and motion), and placing an arm between both of them happening that the elbow is close to the face. If he had elbowed him, even slightly, Holding would have been trembling with pain
This bias is ridiculous. And to think he is loved because of his face even more so.  The challenge on Gomes wasnt reckless, you see those every game, was a bit late, but the injury came because he was sandwiched with Aurier, he didnt even get injured fron the challenge, but fro [the way he fell on the collision](https://youtube.com/shorts/pib83E8hn00?feature=share)  He didnt "lean" on to Holding, watch the clip again, and Holding should have been sent off earlier that game, for kicking Son, on the back, while on the ground and off the ball.. but, for some reason, you dont say anything about that. Son didnt elbow him, he place his arm in between to create space cause Holding was fucking wrestling him to the ground and the ref was doing fuck all. If you cannot see the difference then there is nothing I can do
I genuinely dont understand. No other player that behaves like Son would be this hated, but somehow, some Arsenal fans think there is a conspiracy going on to make him look good... which fits with the thinking of that section of gunners
Constantly tried to leave a bit on opposition, leading with elbows and dangerously high legs, that sort of thing
He made a couple of ugly tackles, got into arguments with Villa players and kept heckling the ref. Basically he didn't make himself popular with our fanbase. It's just one game though, and like I said, I'm sure he's a lovely lad off the pitch.
Agreed.
Ok Giroud has defo been underrated at points in his career but to say he does absolutely everything you want from a CF is overselling him. One of his major flaws is that he's never really contributed to that many goals, I think his best ever season in the top 4 leagues was 16 goals 6 assists whilst playing in one of the most creative premier league sides ever.   He is fantastic at a lot of things but we wouldn't have spent years trying to upgrade on him and you wouldn't have sold him on if he didn't have very glaring flaws. Maybe they're more apparent to me given Auba (also has his flaws) filled in his role for us whereas it was Lukaku/Kai for you.
Small victories indeed
three at the back hides his deficiencies as although theres no doubt about how good he is at reading the game and his positioning is great, he is poor in terms of his physical ability and that means u really need him to play a certain role and have players suited to him surrounding him, so i dont see how u can have him as the best centre back in the league
No disagreement there. As much as Richarlison is a cunt on the pitch, I have nothing but respect for his political stances.
Yup pretty much
Sorry bro i didn't know all that stuff, i am not big into world news
Exactly  Only the gay people one I absolutely agree. Its not the culture of brazil. Homosexuality has been around since time began yes, but it is considered inhumane by cultures that has now created the world. And then some pillager starts conquering the world and change everyone’s culture, but even after that there was hundreds of years before some idiot started the homosexuality trend which by then now creates a very very divided world.  Another thing is that fascist is just a nationalist who doesnt like other people staying and ruling their country. Which is why there are many many racists around. In fact these racists are actually somewhat fascists. And you calling them bloody cunts shows that u are a fascist. Everyone is a fascist, just to a certain degree. Same for all racist people
True! He’s less hated and even i’d say he’s still heavily disliked
hahaha point proven!
The Norwich one I remember and he got away with. Villa no idea what you're talking about.  He does leave a sneaky bit on people very occasionally but only ever in response to tackles and challenges that he gets. And he gets so many every single game, he's targeted physically all the time and just gets back up and plays on 99% of the time.  Nobody is perfect and I really don't think retaliating very very rarely in a way that would never injure anyone makes him a cunt but that's just my opinion.
Yeah Saka was horrible vs Villa this season.
He quite literally looks at him and then elbows him purposely in the face. You can tell by the movement that it's done out of frustration.   He 100% meant it.
Mate, you’re arguing against people who don’t want to debate in good faith.
Can't expect a wolves fan to know anything about football, lost cause aren't you?  Where did I say anything about leaning?
This just isn’t true
It’s cause he’s constantly fouled and targeted every game but it’s never called. He finally stood up for himself that game and was giving it back, I loved it from the kid
>homosexuality trend  People being allowed to be with people they love is not a trend, it is a basic human right. Banning homosexuality is evil just like slavery is evil. Doesn't matter if those practices are/used to be parts of many cultures, they still go against basic human rights.  &#x200B;  >fascist is just a nationalist who doesnt like other people staying and ruling their country  That's not true,  stop trying to downplay fascism.
Yeah their fans are so noisy and delusional and will deny it, they all support the rapist Partey with gusto as well.
Then how the fuck does he make a slow pushing contact with the triceps instead of a knock with the elbow? You cant fail that bad. Its not an elbowing.  Im not saying he didnt mean to do anything. Im saying its just a push
Nah even the one "agreeing" with me says Sonny elbowed Holding first
Oh right, I forgot, you can just bring the badge into this to insult and that will make your point right..  Lean is pretty the same as run into, but softer. Doesnt matter, cause he didnt do either
It is though. Cope
Arsenal fan? If so I get your position XD
I will only say that I absolutely do not support Partey.
Who cares if his elbow or tricep lol.   The intent is the bad bit not the execution of it.
Ignoring the kick to the ribs, the suplex. Holding intention that match was to purely rattle and abuse son. It cost them a goal as he was skinned because he was too preoccupied trying to shithouse.
No it isn't, and he ran straight into the elbow ducking to make the contact on his head.
Clearly you’re the only one who thinks so clever lad
Do you think he kicked first or that he reacted to kicks?
None of the arsenal fans I know want him at the club, that guy just hates arsenal.
Right, but it is a different intention to _push_ someone to get them off you and to elbow them, dont you think? Like pushing someone thats grabbing you is a normal reaction, elbowing has evil intent... so it does matter whether it is a hard elbow hit or a soft triceps push
I dont even care about those. Its just not an elbow. I play footy. I have been pushed, kicked, hit and elbowed. Those are 4 different things and have an ascending evil intention going in that order. Son pushed. This is a hill I die on xd
Jesuschrist mate, you see whatever you wanna see. Have at it
Care to clarify that? I’m not sure if you’re implying that I’m the only one who thinks I’m clever, or if you believe that I’m the only person who thinks that Mane is a dirty player
Most likely a bit of being kicked and trying to play the ref and get our players pissed off. You're trying to make him sound like a victim here and I just don't agree.
No it doesn't. The mental gymnastics you've gone through is quite amazing.   Son hits out because his frustrated and rightly so. Looks like his aimed to.elbow him in the face. Who cares if he misses with the elbow but catches him with a body part 1 inch away. Who cares if it was a "push" or a "strike".
Swansea City,they were quite decent and fun for awhile
Bolton
Sheffield Wednesday
Blackburn  Sunderland Reading Bolton  Middlesbrough Fifa 04 times!
Sunderland. I'd probably just want them to go back down but it would be fun to have them back for a season
Swansea.
To me Fratton Park was never electric it was just home to the bellend with a bell.   90 mins of DING DING, DING DING, DING DING
Blackburn. I love their kit
Wigan.
Gotta say Sunderland, watching them narrowly escape relegation season after season was definitely one of the best moments every year. They'd randomly pick up steam in the last 10 games beating all comers, be it title contenders or even would be champions. And you'd hear the commentators say the famous words, "you never know in the Premier league, you just never know".
Reading for me
Burnley with Dyche
Blackpool
Sunderland
On your Portsmouth pick, their crowd were great in 09/10 when their team were utter shite. I remember when villa played them, the crowd were great, then when they scored they were chanting "one nil to the championship" really really loudly.   My pick is Swansea, at times they knocked the ball about so nicely
AFC Wimbledon
Chelsea
I always wanted stoke to do well
Manchester City.
Oldham
Swansea with Michu and Blackpool under Ian Holloway
I had missed West Ham, and looks like i may miss them again
Watford!
Blackburn rovers
Blackburn Rovers, just sounds so good
middkesborough. and looking forward to burnley coming back with kompanys new football style
QPR. It always fun watching the roudy crowd.
Wigan Athletic
Cardiff
Swansea and Cardiff. Would love to see them in the EPL at the same time to have the South Wales derby. Plus Swansea were great to watch when they were in the EPL last time!
Liverpool with Mané in it :(
Bolton Wanderers because they were a fine team when they had Chris Eagles, Kevin Davies, Stylian Petrov etc. Also the Big Sam era had big name players like Jay Jay okocha, Ivan Campo etc.
Blackpool
Derby
Still can't believe that stoke got top half regularly
Leicester City. Oh wait
Blackburn, Bolton, Coventry
Yeah they were. That Michu season was something else. Then the Wilfried Bony/Gylfi Sigurðsson connection. They were always 10 yards from each other, moving like they were on a rope.
God bafetimbi gomis was so fun to Watch
Good one! Sam Allardyce at his best!
They had such a dynamic and watchable team at one point. Ivan Campo, Jay Jay Okocha et al.
Oh God
Sometimes it’s used for motivation of the players on the pitch. As in if they see a teammate who plays in a similar position to them it could give them a kick up the backside. Likewise it can also distract the opposition if they’re preparing for someone with fresh legs to come on.
I think they do it to let the coaching staff know that, 1. They want to come on, 2. It keeps them active, 3. You never know when they need to be called upon, you won’t get many doing it in the first 10 minutes
Do you think clubs would risk assets by not having them warm up properly?
I think its one of the assistant managers that tells a group of them to warm up.
It’s not player led , the coaches would have the players coming down to warm up at set times each game, every game.
Seamus Coleman
Mark Noble is the answer…
Jamie vardy
Phil Foden, grew up six miles from the stadium and will never leave.  As for mercenaries, Raheem Sterling and Nicolas Anelka come to mind as players that are out as soon as their situation becomes less than ideal.
Steven Gerrard, I know he flirted with Chelsea but you can’t say that man does not bleed Liverpool
Ian Wright
Why did you ask if you don't like any of the answers? Or you weren't actually looking for answers and just wanted to whine about players?
Harry Kane man
Was shearer less mercanary I always got the impression he stayed because he knew he'd be the main man.  But for us at the minute I believe the whole team does. Boyhood club for the likes of Anderson, longstaff, burn
As a Chelsea fan, many of ex-Chelsea still do.  And of course our clubs legends mostly, especially Frank Lampard and John Terry
Xhaka proved it after all the BS that he caused/went through in my opinion.  But every one-club man should be on the list
Currently, James Ward Prouse, been with his club for over 20 years, and imo could have pushed a bigger move if he wanted to.   Newcastle has 4 life long Newcastle supporters in the team at the moment, and you can tell by the performances.
Zaha has been exceptionally loyal at Palace.  I don't know if I'd agree about 'complete' mercenaries - a lot of players have real attachment to their clubs - Saka, Kane, JWP other examples. Even if those players move on it wouldn't mean they don't feel a strong connection.
Lionel Messi. Thomas Muller. Chiellini. Veratti. Harry Kane. Marco Reus. Jordan Henderson.
Foden, Haaland, stones, Aguero
Kompany for us was very much a Manc in disguise, Zabaleta too  For current players I’d say Foden for obvious reasons, and also Bernardo Silva perhaps.   Bernardo wants to leave for non footballing reasons yet takes it in stride when a deal doesn’t work out, and for two years now has continued to be a model professional. You don’t really see that so often nowadays
Bruno Fernandez.
Honestly feel like the majority of this Liverpool team do even if it doesn’t seem like it this season
Might be crazy, but as a City fan, I think we have so many players who have genuinely fallen in love with the club, or maybe fallen in love with Pep. Stones, Dias, Ake, Rodri, Gundo, KDB, Foden of course, Grealish, Mahrez, and might be a stretch but Haaland. The way he celebrates goals and our success even when he's not on the pitch warms every City's fan heart. Probably down to his dad too.
All our Hale End players
Mo Elneny
Majority of the liverpool squad.
Bukayo Saka
Current or not playing any more?
People tend to forget football is a real career. So not a lot. But there are the few, esp those for a big club. Like Henderson, Milner, Licha, Rashford, Degea those.
Lewis Dunk is born and raised in Brighton
As a Real Madrid fan, when it comes to loyalty first name that comes to my mind is Nacho. He doesn't have high wages nor does he play consistent mins yet he hasn't left despite being good enough to start for a lot of good clubs. One club man and someone who I believe will retire as one and its very hard thing to do at Real Madrid.  There are great examples like Del Piero, Buffon, Chiellini etc who went to serie B unlike others stars in Juventus who left for other teams once they got demoted.  Then there are likes of Totti, Maldini etc as well.    You can't measure loyalty with just things like moving to other clubs, length of stay etc though. Gerrard and Kane for example despite trying to move for an instance or two stayed in their clubs and its hard to question their loyalty when they could have played for much better teams if they wanted. It's easy to get mind diverted when you see better opportunities but what matters is whether you go through it or choose to stay in your home. Even if Kane leaves next season, its not gonna change the fact that he loves Spurs and stayed loyal. You can't away years of bond between the player and the club just like that brother.
Rvp for Arsenal (just joking to spite the fans). On a serious note, one that comes to mind is Giggs, but he’s already in a successful team so hard to judge on that.. maybe Chiellini for Juventus but that’s not PL.
Frank Lampard both as player and manager
Big Dan Burn for Newcastle, he bleeds black and white
Players can move to another team but really care about their previous/boyhood club. Kalvin Phillips absolutely adores Leeds United but he had the opportunity to play for probably the best manager in the world, get a pay rise that Leeds couldn't afford and possibly win titles that aren't likely with Leeds.  We can all sit back and say "I'd stay there and fight for my team" but when someone waves £150k in your face and you're on £30k, it's a choice you have to consider. Then add a world class manager, world class team and being able to compete for titles, it's a tough choice.   If Gerrard did move to Chelsea, he didn't suddenly stop caring and loving Liverpool.

All I have ever wanted from a player is for them to care about the results they give the club they are playing for.  They are not fans.  As an example, Richarlison played like he would bleed out on the field to score a goal for Everton last year when we were in the relegation battle.  That is what I want in a player.  I don't care what he thinks of us now.
Onana too. He has given his heart and soul since being here
One of the few good shouts here. Most people are conflating staying at a very successful club-while getting a ridiculously salary and winning load as of trophies-as some exceptional display of loyalty. These players almost never actually have better options. They are “loyal” by default .   Vardy however genuinely could have pushed a move to bigger clubs for higher wages and a higher chance of trophies at a certain point. He chose to stay with Leicester at the sacrifice of more personal glory and wealth and as such will rightly be considered a legend of the club.
Ni way did you put sterling and anelka on tge same level? That's not even being reasonable. You just hate sterling.
Surprised to see this slip so far down the thread.
I think this is one of the best shouts. Very popular at Palace but he is an Arsenal guy and is so committed.
You could pretty much pick any of the key players from that 97-98 team.  Seaman, Dixon, Keown, Adams, Parlour, Bergkamp.  All of them have shown true love for the club.  Would even throw Steve Bould into the mix.  Thierry Henry loves the club too, even turned down moving to Barca because Arsenal lost to them in the CL final.  Jack Wilshere, doesn't need explaining.  From the same era at United, you have the likes of Giggs, Scholes, Gary Neville.  Carragher from Liverpool.  John Terry from Chelsea.  When you listen to interviews with them, all of them refer to the clubs as their team.  Sometimes circumstances change, sometimes players don't get into the Academy at the club they support and takes them a few moves to find their home.   Just take Alan Shearer, bleeds magpies, but made his name at Southampton before moving to Blackburn to win the league, before finally getting his big money move to Newcastle.
Hmmm…for who? Crystal Palace or Arsenal?
I’m engaging in the responses and it’s not true I don’t like any of them. Some people have given great answers( Vardy and Cheillini for example) that I have also commented on. If somebody presents an answer I happen to disagree with-and then give reasons why-I don’t see how that’s an issue? It was my understanding that this was a discussion board?
I am assuming you have forgotten Kane-while on contract- trying to force a move just a couple of years ago?
BDB for sure. Anderson and longstaff are living out their dreams. Just wish Matty had a place and could live up to his potential.
Although Shearer was of course massively compensated the reality is he could of genuinely of spent the majority of his career at bigger clubs for bigger salaries while almost certainly winning many many many more trophies. Nobody can doubt he was and is a true Newcastle fan whose greatest ambition was playing for and helping his boyhood club. Which is exactly what he did.
Why do you think Frank Lampard has some kind of special loyalty to Chelsea? An absolute club legend no doubt but what has he ever done to display a uncommon level of loyalty? His boyhood club was West Ham. He left them to seek more money and more glory and he succeeded massively. Good on him but he would of obviously have gone to and stayed with whatever club offered him the highest salary and most chance of personal success. Just another highly rewarded mercenary who’s so called affection for a club is entirely built on his own personal glory.
Zaha has tried to leave Crystal Palace every season for years. Nobody has wanted him, so he doesn't leave, and then Crystal Palace fans are 'OH HE SOOOOOO LOYAL'.  The one time he did leave, he was shit, and went crawling back to Crystal Palace.  I don't think that quite meets the criteria for 'exceptionally loyal'.  He currently has his eye on playing upfront with Ronaldo in Saudi Arabia once his Crystal Palace contract finishes at the end of the season...
Love Zaha but he isn’t loyal in the slightest. He went to and failed at Man United and has spoken about leaving on numerous occasions. Been a great player for Palace and will probably get a statue outside the ground one day but you certainly don’t get the sense he bleeds for the club in a way it was evident with Shearer at Newcastle and Le Tissier at Southampton.   Same with Kane. Tottenham legend and probably their best ever but the way he dealt with trying to force a move a couple of years was disgraceful. He is seen as loyal by default rather than how he has actually conducted himself. If I was a Tottenham fan I would find it difficult to love him despite is wonderful performances on the pitch.
He has pushed for moves away from Palace multiple times.
Can’t agree with the majority of these.   Messi hasn’t displayed any exceptional loyalty to Barcelona. He is the most talented player of all time…who was lucky enough to be playing for arguably the greatest team of all time…while winning pretty much everything and being paid more than God for doing so. There was zero reason to ever leave Barcelona. All reward. No sacrifice. I’m not saying he doesn’t love the club but it’s only because there was no better club to give him the personal success he has had. It’s a bit like when somebody says a member of the Royal family has been been a tireless servant to the country. Seems to me they’ve got a pretty good deal of it.   Kane is only seen as “loyal” because he has spent his career with Tottenham without winning anything of significance. It’s amazing though how quickly people have forgotten him trying to force a move almost after signing a fat new contract the moment Tottenhams form stared to drop. The man is about about as loyal as a snake and if his agent brother wasn’t as stupid as one he would of been out the door a long time ago.   Henderson won the lottery joining Liverpool. It made his career. All reward and no sacrifice. He’s the epitome of a disingenuous badge kissing mercenary. If he wasn’t chasing personal wealth and glory he would have stayed with his boyhood club Sunderland and helped them avoid the disaster they found themselves in after he left.   Verratti the same. Just because he has been at a club for a long time doesn’t mean you should be considered a loyal servant if it’s done nothing but personally benefit you. Playing for( and getting a ridiculous salary that you wouldn’t receive elsewhere) one of the biggest clubs in the world( while winning countless trophies) isn’t really a remarkable display of loyalty.  I’m not to familiar with Marco Reus’s career trajectory so can’t really comment.   Chieilli I’ll give you is an excellent shout. Stayed loyal to Juventus even after relegation and was instrumental in the rebuilt. Undoubtedly deserves a statue outside the ground after he fully retires.
Ake, Grealish, KDB…
Serious question; if you had to put money on it do you think Foden would choose to stay or leave if and when Man City are relegated for their dodgy financial dealings?   Obviously every other single mercenary that makes up the current team will immediately jump ship…and nobody would blame them. Foden however “might” be an exception and display proper loyalty like Chellini when there was similar situation at Juventus.   What’s your gut feeling?
You’re not crazy. It’s evident every game and every season. Cancelo was weird for like 5 minutes and he was gone. No one messing up the great atmosphere. Mbappe doesn’t get a pass and he marches around the field angry and stops running. Haaland gets pulled at the sixtieth minute when he could have broken records and he says he should have done it with his chances then. We have great team players. Being a fan is such a privilege. Now all we gotta do is put up with the r/premierleague clowns who can’t see this and downvote you purely out of spite.
Lol, no one loves city.
the agenda against City is crazy! just seen a comment with upvotes saying most of the Liverpool squad love the club, and yet this comment about City gets downvotes. Forever an agenda against us
>The way he celebrates goals and our success even when he's not on the pitch warms every City's fan heart.  Hate to burst your bubble but most players do this at most clubs.  And it warms every fan's hearts.  Then usually the player still wants to leave when the bigger money is flashed at them. Just doesn't happen at city because not many others can beat their money. They are at peak money.  Prime example mahrez. Kissed the badge celebrated with Leicester fans and players like one big happy family. Then off he went throwing his toys out the pram till he got the big money move to city to kiss their badge etc.  Grelish the local boy. Loves villa yada yada yada. Off he goes when that £ comes calling.   Not saying its wrong but let's be real they don't love the club.
You are crazy. It’s easy to fall in love with a club when it’s paying you more money than God and you are winning just about everything in sight. The only player that might “possibly” have genuine affection for the club beyond the oil money and trophies is Foden who is of course a boyhood fan. The rest of them would obviously be gone in a week if and when Man City are relegated for all their dodgy financial dealings. You really think Pep, Grealish, Haaland and all will be sticking around to play in the Championship?
Saka is going to be interesting to see.   Right now he is a very young local talent playing for literally the best team in the country. He’s living the absolute dream. It’s easy though to display “loyalty” and affection when things couldn’t be going better.   It might be a very different story though if his form continues but Arsenals form as a whole drops.   Will he end up being a Tony Adam’s or an Ashley Cole when even bigger( not that there are many) clubs start knocking and offering to double his wages?   Time will tell…
Either
Giggs wasn’t just part of a “successful” team. He was an integral part of arguably the biggest and most successful team in the entire world at the time. As you say it’s very hard to judge somebodies loyalty and affection for a club if there is absolutely no better option available-either financially or in terms of personal glory.   I think though given Giggs can’t even display a bit of loyalty to his own family we can safely assume that had Man United ever truly hit a proper rocky patch during his tenure he would of abandoned ship faster than an aristocrat on the titanic.   Chellini though is a great shout and a rare example of a truly elite level player that did genuinely show loyalty to a club rather than acting with complete self interest. These players are exceptionally rare but they do occasionally exist.
If he would just lay off the cheeseburgers…
Agreed. Whether our financial situation will allow that to be a career long commitment remains to be seen.
Seems based on the stuff he says and the way he plays that he cared more than clowns like Gordon anyway.
Oh absolutely not on the same level lmao. Sterling at least stayed at a club for a time before taking off.
Almost slipped my mind
Right?
Legends. All of them. But Shearer is a God
Arsenal for sure. But he was great with Crystal Palace as well. Still talks about them very fondly.
this narrative that Spurs are a big enough side for Kane is so so poor. Harry Kane is a bigger player than Spurs, and that's fact.   Imagine if he was moving from say Everton to a bigger team, everyone would be behind him because he is destined for way bigger things than what Everton can give him. That is maybe an extreme example, but Kane is destined for bigger things than Spurs and has done more than enough for the club.
Coming back to manage us during our worst form in a long time
Only God knows one's intentions. I'm pretty sure most of us will act the same if they had personal success somewhere. He could have left the club at many periods during his time. I remember the links with Barca and one other English club at his prime yet he stayed. Our club had many ups and downs and he didn't leave us during the downs :) I respect your opinion so I hope you respect mine too!
No one begrudged him for leaving for United at the time, we were in the Championship and he came back to us on loan to help get us promoted. You're right that he's wanted to leave but he's also never really kicked up a fuss about about it like a lot of players would in similar situations, he's always given 100% on the pitch, which is ultimately all you can ask for.
Practically Greyfriars Bobby
Maybe loyal is the wrong word, but Zaha has had plenty of chances to leave since his return and hasn’t - but it goes back to my point that you don’t need to be a ‘one club man’ to genuinely care about the club. I think Palace and Spurs fans are in the same boat with these players - you wouldn’t resent them leaving in the slightest partly because they have given so much of their career to the club.
can you really blame Kane though, at some point he has to put his own career first and that's nothing to do with money. Purely accolades and trophies. IMO he can still be loved dearly by any Spurs fan and move on given what he has done for the club and the shit they've put him through.
Pretty certain Barcelona had to terminate Messi's contract due to his insane salary, he didn't leave by choice.  Messi would've retired at Barca.  To say he hasn't shown "loyalty" is utter bollocks.  EDIT: Just read your paragraph about Kane 😂 Where are you getting your information from?   Kane is a boyhood fan of Spurs, he's loved the club since childhood. He's literally given up ever winning a domestic trophy by staying there despite it hurting his individual achievements.  If that's not sacrifice I don't know what is.  Every player gets their head turned, I'd call bullshit if you get an offer from a recruiter today offering to treble your salary and you try and say you're not tempted, you'd be an absolute fool not to consider it.  Footballers careers are generally only 10 years, if you're an exceptional you might be able to push that to 15 years. They always have to consider how to maximise the return on their talent.
Barca let him go a couple of years ago in fairness to balance books. He wanted to stay. That was only 2021. So regarding OP's question. He fits the bill.
Scotty Carson
Depends on the extent. Don’t think we as fans would begrudge him if we got kicked down to national league - that’s five years of his career to get back to the prem   If we lost UCL privileges or were booted to championship for a year, I think he’d stay. I think a lot of them would to be honest, if it were a 1-2 year issue
I fear the day we fall off the top! because it is great being a City fan! we have players that I love, the best manager in the world, a board that backs us and makes smart decisions, and if I didn't already mention it players that I love. Never been more in love with a City team ever before
don't think Mahrez and Grealish are very good examples tbh, both were at smaller clubs and wanted to win more. They have every right to leave their clubs despite having an attachment to them.
I think I could safely bet that almost every player in a top side in the PL would move on if they were relegated
Good point, good point.
And it’s going to be rarer now since business has taken over football. Sad times.
Best finisher in England of all time, we need you Geordie's to get breeding and give us another one!
Can somebody display exceptional loyalty and affection for two teams at the same time?  Could you see yourself supporting two different teams?   People only say this about Wright because he was a great player, playing for a great team, while coming across as a lovely guy.   I wouldn’t say he however has ever done anything exceptional to suggest he wasn’t a complete mercenary.   It’s not like he was turning down more lucrative contracts from bigger and better clubs.   He was just having a great time playing for pretty much the second biggest club in the country while winning lots of trophies and getting paid a shed load of money.   He could only ever really be considered a “loyal” player if he had stuck with Palace. He choose personal glory and he won. Good for him but hardly the epitome of somebody who truly loves their club in the same manner as an actual fan does.   He clearly would of bounced from Arsenal the moment their form dropped- for an even bigger club(not many of those) and higher wages.
Very few people believe Spurs are a big enough side for Kane and his talents. They are not. Nobody would begrudge him leaving and lots of people would think it silly for him not to so.   The only issue is Kane some how being held up as a poster boy for loyalty and personal sacrifice when he in fact tried to push through a move after signing a massively lucrative contract the moment Tottenhams form started to dip.   The man is only “loyal” because he couldn’t snake his way out of his contract.
Are you serious? After he’s just been sacked by a significantly worse team and his managerial stock is in the gutter?   I’m pretty sure right now he thinks he is the luckiest man in world football rather than making any kind of personal sacrifice in the name of loyalty.   Hmmmm… I could possibly get a job in the Championship if I was very very lucky or I can go back to Chelsea and mange in the Champions league despite having done nothing( as a manager) to deserve it. A truly difficult decision…
I’m pretty sure his intentions might have something to do with the obscene amount of money he will be getting paid.   Not to mention absolutely no other elite club in the world wanting to touch in him with a barge pole given his complete(thus far) failures as a manager.   The man wasn’t even especially “loyal” as a player. Have you forgotten that in 2014 he even played for you’re biggest league rivals at the time?   The notion that Lampard is some kind ride or die blue is ridiculous and purely comes from his remarkable achievements on the pitch as a Chelsea player rather than any kind of uncommon integrity.   There is a massive difference between being a club legend because you were one of their most successful ever players( which he undoubtedly was) and being a club legend because you have a genuine connection with the club, fans and community.   It’s incredibly easy as a player to say you love the fans and community when your oligarch owner is paying you 100’s of thousands of pounds a week and you are winning every title going while living in a gated mansion in Surrey.   If Lampard did actually have any real “loyalty” to Chelsea he wouldn’t of( at the very end of his career when he had already amassed more money than he could spend in a lifetime) agree to play for their literal biggest league rivals at the time. Even Sol Campbell and Ryan Giggs where probably thinking best never leave this guy alone with my girlfriend…  As mentioned in my original post. The vast majority of us would act in exactly the same way as the vast majority of players. I don’t begrudge Frank Lampard’s amazing career and he is a complete Chelsea legend who obviously will have a big affection for the club that has given him his amazing life. None of that is being disputed.   There is just no way he can be put in the same bracket as certain players that did in fact sacrifice some personal glory for the betterment of their club as a whole. I.E real genuine fans rather than just highly compensated employees at an amazing job.
And it goes the other way too - he can leave and still really care about the club.
🐐
I don’t think any one would begrudge him leaving even if it was only down to the Championship for a single year. He would immediately get legend status though if he displayed even the slightest bit of personal loyalty to the club. It will be interesting to see how it pans out.   What will be even more interesting is if the FA decide to really make an example of Man City and hit them with the biggest sanctions possible. Very unlikely to happen of course but relegation to the very bottom of the pyramid and the official retraction of all the trophies they have won during their reign of dodgy dealings isn’t( technically) impossible.   If this happens it will be not only a real insight into player loyalty but also fan loyalty.   Another genuine question for you; what percentage of current Man City fans do you think would actually remain as Man City fans if they were relegated to the bottom of the pyramid and the oil money was cut off?
Yep and while at them they both showed the same examples of loving that club you suggested.  Players right down the pyramid will do exactly the same when they score/win etc. Even on a game that means nothing.  It proves nothing, just a reaction to the moment.
And I would agree with you.   99.9999 percent are indeed complete mercenaries.    However there are some extreme outliers at the elite level which is why I asked this question.   Chiellini for example stayed with Juventus after they got relegated despite being one of the best players in the world.   Not quite as extreme as dealing with actual relegation but Le Tissier would arguably of been a Ballon D’or contender had he signed for any number of big 4 clubs constantly sniffing around.   Instead he choose to wrestle with relegation every season because of his genuine love and loyally to his club. It’s extremely rare but not impossible.   Will be interesting to see just how loyal boyhood fan Foden is if and when Man City are thrown out of the PL. Everybody else kissing the badge every weekend however will be straight out the door the moment they realise they will be playing Millwall twice a year.
That’s fair. But i genuinely feel that he loves Arsenal as much as the fans. He talks weekly about how much his mood is affected by their form. He’s also talked a lot about how stressed he is hoping they can win the league. He genuinely cares about his club.
Honestly I don’t see us getting any non financial sanctions but yeah we’ll see   We would lose very little British fans as they’re likely fans due to the locality. As for the African and Asian fans yeah lots may well leave. The massive Algerian contingent will go as soon as mahrez does
I love Wright as much as most people. Neither a Palace or Arsenal fan but one of my idols growing up and until proven otherwise he seems like a genuinely nice guy. Sure he does genuinely have deep affection for Arsenal but why wouldn’t he if it’s given him an amazing life and nothing but great memories.   What’s truly rare and the purpose of the question is trying finding players that are genuine ride or die fans of their club…like most of the people on this sub presumably are. It’s easy loving something when things are always going well. It’s much harder to do so when things are going badly and you have lots of other options on the table.
Ok. That’s fair. I think i just love Wrighty and absolutely adore how much he loves Arsenal. Obviously the answer as you eluded to in your post is Shearer. But Wrighty is just such a gem and lovely person.
Leeds 00/01, surely…
Dalglish was just a serial winner, even as a intern manager after Hodgson, he somehow won us a league cup.
And you've missed Forest 94/5, the only side to get promoted and finish third. Collymore was unbeatable
I don't understand the rules but 92/93 Norwich were great to watch and had a great kit.
Invincibles weren't the best arsenal team for me, just just didn't lose, which is great but they drew a LOT. Still  very very good team, but I'd argue as a team 05/06 was better with the champions league run, their results were poor though.  Just from an outsiders perspective, more fun to watch.   Centurions is a better feat than invincible for me, more points is better than 0 losses if you got 12 draws. Only time they've drawn more is like w seasons ago when they got 14 draws and came 8th
08/09 Fulham gives you Hodgson and a better league finish if 7th. 09/10 gives you 12th the same as Palace but a magical Europa League run.
I see the logic, but I wanted Bielsa in the list (and I wanted more teams from recent seasons)   I’d also struggle to add West Ham anywhere else
Almost an FA Cup too, I was certain Carroll’s header crossed the line when I was watching it at the time
I couldn’t have them and Blackburn by my own rules; one entry per team and per year
When Liverpool signed Davies when all of our center backs were hurt but we never played him cause Nat Philips came in
Danjuma 😭
No Chelsea have never done anything like that
Manchester City signed and did photos with an American man called Mix Diskerud.  Never even sniffed a minute for the club.
Arsenal signed Park Chu-Young on deadline day and he made one appearance in three years. Always felt like there was more to that story that never came out.
Lucas Piazon Ulises Davila Patrick Bamford Kenneth Omeruo Marko Marin Thorgan Hazard Marco van Ginkel Christian Atsu Juan Cuadrado Mario Pasalic Michael Hector Matt Miazga Nathan Papy Djilobodji Danny Drinkwater  And there are probably many more than that
Fang Zhou did play in a league game when the title was wrapped up, Chelsea gave him a guard of honour
If you have the opportunity to sign a dong, you take it.
Park Choo Young and Kim Kallstrom come readily to mind.
Bebe......  I mean, he played like 1 or 2 games, but was totally random.  Dong played 1 game like Bebe, they were bought cause of the potential, just never met the expectations and were let go.
Watched the winter world cup and the name Takuma Asano rang a bell.  Signed to Arsenal and loaned out straight away.  Never played a game for us.  Can't be shirt sales as he was unlikely to have been assigned a number.
Ben Davies was at Liverpool for almost 2 years but never played.   Another random player for Liverpool was Steven Caulker, one of the first signings under Klopp. He joined on loan and only played 4 times but played ST one time. Probably his most iconic moment.   Liverpool have a had a few youngsters signed over the years and only was around during pre seasons. Anderson Arroyo joined in Jan 2018 and has had 6 loans since. Kamil Grabara was in the academy for a bit then a number of loan spells later left, only really heard of in early preseason games when the senior players were just getting back from tournaments or vacation. Allan was another, never got a work permit and loaned out around Europe until he went back to Brazil.
Arsenal signed Emiliano Viviano as a backup goalkeeper and never played him.
Erdal Rakip and Jaroslaw Jach, both I think signed around the same time
I mean right now Joe Rodon and Jed Spence kinda seem like that as a Tottenham fan
Big Kim Kallstrom
Ryan Bertrand. How did we sign a 32 year old full back who was in the squad when we beat them 9-0???!? At least Vestergaard played a few games.
Chelsea rob green
Dong did play in England during the season. He did only make 3 appearances though. One in the Premier league, one in the league Cup, and one in the champions league (so technically he is a champions league winner I guess)
Imants Bleidelis, a random Latvian signed just to help Marian Pahars settle.
Just had a random flashback of Wellington Paulista signing for West Ham
No never
Denis Suarez. Then we did similar January loan move with Odegaard season after and I was honestly terrified that he would turn to Denis Suarez 2.0. It's still pretty early to say but I'm pretty confident that he'll be better for us
Cardiff signed Sala
Kael kallstrom
Mounir el Hamdaoui was a Spurs 'player' at one time. Delivered one of the most outrageously beautiful assists for a goal scored by Robbie Keane in our preseason Peace Cup triumph. The goal was disallowed for offside.
Dong Fangzhuo started in the infamous guard of honor match at Stamford Bridge.
Jesus Gamez
Did Zaha ever get playing time at Man United?  I remember he was like one of Fergie's last signings but I don't recall him ever making any appearances at United.
David Luis who I was excited to see come into the team Edit not David Luis but the luiz or whatever on villa ? I’m blankin rn lol
Chelsea: Jèrèmie Boga   Really Impressed everyone in the preseason, so much so that he got his start in the first game as well.  Around half-way during the first half, Cahill got sent off, Boga was sacrificed, sent on loan and we never heard about him ever again.
We've had loads, Florian Marange, Elliot Grandin, Osman Sow, Erdal Rakip, Jaroslaw Jach - I'm sure there's more that I've forgotten too.
Two come to mind at Newcastle - one is Antonio Barreca who arrived in January 2019, made one sub appearance in a defeat at Spurs and was never seen again, while the other is Facundo Ferreyra, who played a grand total of zero minutes in a season long loan in 2014/15 but was inexplicably a goalscoring machine in several people's Newcastle saves on that year's Football Manager
Marco van Ginkel?
As a Chelsea fan: all the time...
Henry Saviet  It was criminal the way he was treat
Liverpool signing Andy Lonergan. I seem to remember it was mainly because we were short of available keepers during pre-season.
Newcastle signed Facundo Ferreyra on loan in 14/15 to get him away from Ukraine conflict rumoured because he was friends with Coloccini - didn’t make a single appearance
Leeds signed Quasim Bouy in 2017, never got a cap.
Marquinos this season, i think i only saw him 2 times in the Europa group stage, then benched and now on loan
we signed Andy Kellet on loan from Bolton when LvG was manager... absolutely no clue why
Ron Atkinson signed Peter Beardsley who played one game in a league cup match for Man United
Weird one was Marcus edwards at Norwich , loaned him in and never really played , apparently had a horrible attitude
Shaqiri didn't get enough love at Liverpool IMO.
Aurther Melo. >Which club does he play for now???
Takuma Asano, Viviano, Kallstrom, Park Chu-Young, Miyaichi, Wellington Silva and who could forget Francis Jeffers.
Lacina Traoré… came in on loan. Scored in a couple friendlies and got everyone excited and then disappeared.  Henry Onyekuru… not his fault as it was down to work permit. But Everton didn’t really have a solid path there and got lucky in being able to flip him for profit
Not a “random” player but **Donny van de Beek**. I’ll never understand how or why Ralf or Ole never used him. When he played he was great and at the time was our best midfielder but they stuck with McFred.  Injuries weren’t kind to him but even without those we completely ruined his career. Hope he gets a transfer and his career back on track.
Leonardo campana
I remember Keegan signing an Argentinean 20 year old called Vicente Matías Vuoso for £3.5M, which, considering the financial crisis we were in at the time, was a big gamble.  Keegan said he had high hopes for Vuoso to be a massive hit in the PL despite never actually seeing him play... fast forward a season later, he never ended up getting a game, despite being our top goal scorer in the reserves the season prior, he then came out and said he couldn't fathom why Keegan never played him... after that, he was subsequently sold for about £500k.
Glauber Berti. Manchester City legend
Add Arthur Melo, too (Although he was on loan). He was on the bench against City but only to warm it.
That Lucas sub was criminal. Can't wait to finish this season and start fresh with a new direction.
Would've been quite something if he came off the bench to score at Goodison Park on Monday just gone given how close he was to going there instead
tbf Khumalo Bongani was the OG random signing.  Danjuma has played and scored in a game for spurs at least.
Man's describing half of your business model
It was a thank you gesture for everything he'd done at NYCFC, I looked into this myself a few months ago. He was to train and play with the reserves to keep fit until he found a new club. The photos were certainly odd though 😁
I think they signed him to balance the books with their sibling club in the MLS. It's pretty funny that he took photos and everything, they had no intention of ever playing him 😆
*Stabæk Legend Mikkel Diskerud  Norwegian (born and raised) save for having an American mum. During the dark period before Erling Braut, there were many pieces written about how Diskerud and King up top would’ve carried us to Euros and WC.   I’m not bitter
I don't recall Ryo Miyachi playing more than a game or 2 for Arsenal either and he was being touted as the next big thing
And Dennis Suarez as well
This. I remember watching him play in the league cup I think it was, and he scored a beautiful goal. Was left thinking after the match “why the hell haven’t I seen more of this guy?” - and then he was gone.
Might be cynical but premier league teams signing players from some Asian countries instantly gets them tons of new shirt sales, social media follows etc.
Cuadrado got a few runs late game from what I remember.   Pato isn’t on that list! I was so excited for him…  Edit: RIP Atsu… such a sad situation man.
I remember Sunderland buying Djilobodji at a tidy profit for you
Van Ginkel was the worst. Hot prospect, who had his contract renewed 3 times. He was at Chelsea for 8 years and played 2 competitive games
Loads of these players have played in the league
This is so funny to me, you guys really just love signing players. The efficiency is crazy bad but I love the tenacity and insistence on doing it this way. Swing 100 times you’re bound to hit one
Ah yes coming back to me now, Kieran Lee played as well.
Completely unrelated, but at one point, the Toronto Blue Jays pitching rotation looked something like this:  Dickey Bush Wang Johnson  And I can’t remember 5…
I'm afraid to ask what you mean
Kallstrom scored that penalty
Still the greatest portugese player in Man Utd's history /s
Contacted to Arsenal for 3 seasons. Spent them all in Germany before being sold to Partizan.
Jesus I remember him. I don’t even think he stepped onto UK soil  Work permit issues
Ah yes, the Asano, Mavropanos, Bielik era. The other two got a few matches at least
I know we actually had a Winter World Cup, but still the phrase sounds to me like a sister version of the World Cup that takes place in the snow in Austria or something, like the Olympics & the Winter Olympics  A second World Cup, plagued by snow and ski lift maintenance problems
And Taiwo Awoniyi, with us for around 6/7 years, didn’t play a single game (due to work permits I think) and now doing reasonably good things for Forest and scoring the winner against us…
I’d say most clubs have signed keepers that have payed rarely if ever.
I think they thought Jach would come to something as he was young. But Rakip, that was such a strange signing
Rodon being more expensive than a price we refused to pay for KMJ
For a bit of fun: Rodon has played 24 times for spurs, 15 of which were in the PL.   That means he's played 2 more PL games for Spurs than Vorm (13) and 3 more than Stambouli (12)
I'm still bemused Leicester have signed 2 members of the Southampton backline who started that 9-0. Are Angus Gunn and Jan Bednarek on call as possible summer additions?
Don’t forget Kleber Chala. The Ecuadorean signed to help Agustin Delgado settle.   Or Romain Gasmi, who was signed to help Schneiderlin settle.   We’ve had a few…
Twice, afaik
Douglas Luiz, maybe?
Awoniyi is one too.
There were rumours about his previous club that he had a difficult character. Just have to wonder if he's shown the same in training here?  Also worth mentioning that he may have scored on his debut but he missed it completely with his kicking foot and it hit his standing foot and just happened to go in to the goal.  You could say at least he was in the right place but standing back from all the clattering bullshit, our remaining coaching staff aren't completely incompetent and you have to at least give them enough credit that there is a good reason he hasn't been on the pitch since.
That makes more sense. The photo of him with the scarf in front of the bee is burned into my brain lol.
They thought they could flip him for profit since he had EEA citizenship (🇳🇴)
I’d forgotten about poor Ryo. I put him in a slightly different category because he was a youth prospect and Park was like 27 and an established international.
It was crazy because he was moved to Feyenoord on loan at 19. Immediately became one of the best players and had 3 goals and 5 assists. Looked like he could be the next big thing.  Then they gave him a few loans in England and he was too weak on the ball and perpetually injured.
I remember this theory doing the rounds but if you look at the commercial shirt sales vs. the fees and salary, it is a massive net loss. The numbers don’t really make sense.
Never speak of this again
Just remembered Peter Gulacsi too - with us for a few years, hardly played if at all, but went on to be very solid at RB Leipzig
Actually gonna kms if that happens. Granted Gunn is better than Ward and Iversen but still not what we need
I know he got in, but Guido Carrillo was supposed to be a star. It was just always cloudy, so we never saw him.
Yes Douglas Luiz was contracted to Man City but never made an appearance.
Awoniyi was because he couldn't get a work permit (like Leto and Mihaylov). Then as soon as he finally got one, we sold him to Union Berlin.
Doesn't necessarily have to be shirt sales though, the PL clubs are doing battle for fans in these areas. Signing a player might get you fans for the next 30 years
Couldn't play due to work permit issue
But do you think that holds true if the signing from that area never plays or is perennially loaned out? It seems more likely to engender resentment if you mistreat a local star than get you a new fan base.
You mean St James’ Park, Elland Road and The City Ground? Newcastle fans raging.
By far, Manchester City's stadium.  BY FAR.  I love the echo.
Ellind road. Home of the mighty yellows!  MARCHING UP TOGETHER  LEED LEED LEED
Saint James’s by far it’s class city’s ground is a library
What’s a hotspur?!?!?

What I would say and this might be unpopular, the size of St James park takes away from the atmosphere a bit, especially as an away fan when ur up in the clouds
The world famous
I think they mean St James' Park, Elland Road and King Power Stadium.
I too enjoy the echo of empty stadiums :3
If new expansion happens,  you'll wish for the clouds when sitting on the moon!
No, Nottingham Forest’s Stadium is called the City Ground. SMH my head
Reminds me of the games that occurred during the Pandemics. You could hear the manager and the players.
It’s poor already for away fans, bigger grounds don’t equals better
Making a joke my friend.
Fair enough. Almost as quiet as St Mary’s
Shake my head my head? Huh
Good player, amazing first touch, often has impact but blows a bit hot/cold. Thankfully playing well at the moment.
Great news for Leeds fans! Harrison has been one of our best players this season, and I’m glad he’s committed his future to the club. He improved so much under Bielsa, and he’s a joy to watch on the wing. He deserves to play for a club that values him and gives him regular game time. I’m glad we didn’t sell him to Leicester, even though they’re a good team. He’s a key part of our project and our identity. Hopefully he can help us push for Europe next season. MOT!     Big thing for me is the NYCFC connection and the path he took. Went to the USA on a University scholarship, worked his way through and made sure he PLAYED in those key ages. Not everyone is going to be in a first team at 19 or 20.
Idiot.
Dang imagine if we got him
Because they getting relegated . Likely he waited
Yeah. Good player. Leeds is his level. It's good he's tied down now
Don’t think he ever wanted to leave, would have been a Marsch duck up I think. Still have Klich until the end of this season would have been nice too.
He's a very good squad player and he's the type of guy who can just pick up the ball and score an apsoloute screamer, something very useful when in a relegation scrap
His first touch was the most consistent I’ve seen it against forest. Was unreal.
'our'? you have a man city flair...?
What's up with your flair
I am actually a big fan of his, I'm surprised no Top 4/6 team hasn't swooped in for him. Anytime I've seen him he's been class. Great shooting, great pace, good dribbling.
Most contacts have relegation clauses. If he got relegated, he'd have the option to exercise his contract clause and sign to a new team.
Are you lost? This is the premier league sub
Gotta support a glory team and a minnow. What does he do when they play? 🤔
He deserves to play for the big six
I know wish arteta bought him but probably won't leave in the summer:(
Only if
Did you watch the game?   Most goals were from mistakes so manager can't be accountable for that.   This season favours the teams that didn't play European football last season. It's not surprising that teams like arsenal, Newcastle, Brighton, Brentford and Fulham are competing well this season as they are fresh and not burnout.   Teams like Liverpool, Chelsea and West ham all went far in Europe and games played last season so these 3 are burnout and struggling this season.   This will be a constant occurrence with ever increasing work load and games constantly increasing.
Teams with enough players to play 2 competitions independently, struggle to make impact in one and do at least average job in the other. That's exclusively PL story.  Euro competitions excuse is just that, excuse, bc same can be applied on many teams. And every league is difficult in its own way. Napoli built huge advantage in Calcio and is still in CL, Real just trashed Barca in Copa del Rey, and is likely to walk over Chelsea, just like they dismantled Liverpool before that. Teams go all the way in multiple competitions across continent and no1 can tell me English clubs can't do that. Just last year Liverpool was hunting quadruple and so it's obviously possible.   If you're good enough, you challenge, if not you're mid-table mediocrity.  Complaining about multiple competitions reeks of Superleague and nothing else for top teams. I think fans of most clubs voiced their opinion on that not so long ago.
Individual mistakes due to the destruction of confidence in the first team squad. The cautious and negative approach has sucked the life out of them, has caused many negative results and now we are in a situation where the players are scared to put a foot wrong and end up doing so. Moyes is very much accountable for this season.  3-1 down at home to Newcastle. 4 subs at once out of desperation . All like for like. Takes off one forward for another. Takes off Soucek, who in the 10 is an absolute joke, to replace him with another DM and leave Lanzini and Fornals on the bench. He’s hoping we hold on to a 3-1 defeat and ended up losing 5-1. Yes I watched the game, I was there. He’s an absolute clown, who should have been relieved of his duties before the WC break. He fluked a system with Lingard and Antonio in counter attack and Dawson sitting as deep in defence as possible. He signed better players and failed to incorporate a system to benefit them. He’s still trying to play counter attack with a team that doesn’t suit it.  He’s more accountable than anyone else, other than the board who are culpable for not sacking him.
How is it an excuse?   Example last season Arsenal played 44 games (top of the league) no European football   Newcastle played 40 games (3rd in the league) no European football   Liverpool played 63 games (struggling with fatigue and injuries)   Chelsea played 62 games (struggling with fatigue and injuries)  It's no excuse it's clearly factual  Funny how you quote super league being a Newcastle fan as that's exactly what you guys are doing. A group of teams with unlimited wealth making a league for the super rich. Man cheaty, New Castle and Man utd when they get bought so don't cry about super league when you club are the most guilty of it.
Last season West ham over performed so Moyes was hailed as a great manager. Now because West ham is suffering from fatigue and bad transfers he's deemed as an awful manager.   Managers don't become bad overnight and players being paid 200k+ a week shouldn't need to be motivated to perform.   There is a saying "you can't polish a turd" yes you were 3-1 down and yes you needed goals but who do you see on your bench to get goals? If he hasn't got the players he can't make a necessary change he's not a magician.   Too easy to blame the managers nowadays, is it 13 managerial changes in the prem this season? Maybe a few more to come  like Moyes and Cooper and that's a crazy amount of manager changes for a 20 team league. Too many trigger happy owners who sack the manager to divert the problems away from their own failures.
How many games Liverpool played last year? Finished top 4. No fatigue back then, lol.   Stupidity about Superleague isn't even worth commenting, my club was nowhere near talks about that. But guess who was? Liverpool.  Explain how Real Madrid trashed you, Barca and God knows who else and still look competitive in the league. They play all competitions each year til the end and don't complain. Only you are tired. That's excuse, fact is not everyone is good enough. You simply aren't good enough.  Don't be envious about our money, you spent more than us this season. 😉
You’ve watched one game and think you have all the answers. As for the other cliché. Moyes had one system and one way of playing. It worked. It revolved around 3/4 players. 2 of those have left and 1 is now 2/3 years older without the same pace and strength. He was then given £160m to spend on Internationals. This decline has been happening since January 2022, not just this season. Started in a home defeat against Leeds, as he wanted to use Lanzini as a DM instead of Kral. Instead of change the shape to account for missing players or just simply use a squad player, he went with square pegs in round holes, while Bielsa played 18 year olds in their correct positions and won the game. He has continued to try to play the same away, while Paqueta, Ings, Scamacca etc do not get played to their strengths. He is the problem. Fatigue is not.
You enjoy making awful posts.   Ask yourself why no-one posted?   No-one cares about cartoon club and their desperation for attention so they sold their soul to people who abuse human rights and buy cheap clubs to sportswash their reputation.   I hope toon never wins anything.
Not 1 game it's been the whole season   I can't think of a single player that's performed this season Rice, Bowen, Antonio they've all been poor. Also 160m for a team competing for European football is nothing nowadays when you think teams like Everton, Villa and forest to name some have spent a lot more.
Let's see. You're going down next season. Without European football.  Can't wait to see excuses then. 😉  Cheers.
Nothing? He was able to sign Areola, Aguerd, Cornet, Emerson, Kehrer, Paqueta, Scamacca and Ings. If that’s not enough to stay away from a relegation battle and have a go at the Europa Conference League, then something is seriously wrong with football Today. As I said, the decline started ages ago. We have a win ratio of something like 25% in the league since January 2022. He has been given so much time and he’s been unable to sort it out. It’s now almost half of his time here that has been rubbish.
How many of those would get into other mid table teams nevermind teams challenging for European places?. Ings is a has been so expecting him to come in and fire in goals was very optimistic.
Danny Ings a has been? Scamacca, Emerson and Aguerd wouldn’t get into other mid table teams? You’re talking absolute rubbish.
Football really could learn something from Rugby regarding refereeing, both in protecting the refs and the officiating standards  Firstly, start carding anyone approaching the ref that isn’t asked to or is the Captain, but also mic the ref and the VAR officials up so when they’re making decisions they have to explain it rather than just seemingly making decisions based off vibes
The FA need to start hiking fines / punishment for this shit.   £1m, each time. £250k In Championship. £100k In League 1, £50k in League 2. Do it 3x in a season, a 1 point deduction. Do it again, 2 point deduction.  The culture of players towards refs must change
Don't united do this every week?
Referees are out there influencing these games with their terrible decisions and then the FA is taken aback when the players group up and give the ref shit for it?  Liverpool swarming the ref isn't even the worst of it, teams do this all the time; there's been plenty of times where I've wondered, "whatever happened to it only being the captain who can approach and question the referee?"  Refs get surrounded and questioned all the time.  Mitrovic putting his hands on one a couple weeks ago, Bruno Fernandes grabbing one (I don't think he even got a card for that)......it keeps happening.
Fair enough. We better start seeing the same punishments handed out for all who cause these situations. No exceptions.   And the same goes for when an official makes a major mistake.  Anybody that has any significant negative effect on a game should reap the whirlwind regardless of whether they're a player, manager, supporter, ref ect.
Damn… didn’t know Bruno played for Liverpool too.
Need to see reds flying when this happens in games. Charging the team afterwards won't change anything.
The fines are pointless.   Start carding players and they will learn. Once they're down to 10 or missing a key player for the next game because they couldn't hold their shit together, managers will ensure they don't do it again.
This is bullshit
Stupid fucks almost taking a week to punish a clear offence. I wonder how many years it would take to punish man city
it wont stop if the refs dont stop being shit
It’s just hilarious how this is the example they choose to use as the ‘line you can’t cross’ right? Also, why has it taken them almost a week to decide to take this action? Not to mention, where are the fines and sanctions for literally every other team in the premier league for doing the exact same shit, every week? Lol. Such a fucking joke. If you’re gonna take this stand, great. Now you better take this stand against every single incident moving forward, for every single team. But we all know that’s not going to happen.
There goes Klopps budget for the summer for midfield improvements.
Are you serious and Bruno still hasn’t been charged for pushing the ref lol. The audacity
Love it.  This shit needs to stop.
Oooh looks like someone’s lost their favour with the fa
I love FA charging teams on Twitter, because the thread is full of completely unrelated incidents, and normally whiny Arsenal fans.
Now this just seems unnecessary Every team does it
Seems like after the recent ref events FA is going to start cracking down big time. Bruno must of gotten a letter he was mild last game.
The inconsistencies are just funny at this point
Liverpool players could learn a few tricks from Bruno here.
Something, something, Bruno Fernandes
They should charge people for this, but why us, United do it every week? And on a greater scale with the manhandling
City players were literally doing the same thing
Ref misses absolute blatant 2nd yellow offense, to an important player at a crucial time, potentially altering the match, and each team’s remaining seasons; gets called out on it.  The aggrieved team gets punished.  Bruno can finger bang an AR, nothing.  Got it; just making sure I was caught up   Ultimately; this is good *in theory*; as this part of the game should have been stomped out at early as 2012ish, after we had a few years of Barcelona being notoriously awful at this side of things. But Lord knows this looks TERRIBLE on them when you consider what they haven’t addressed
It is interesting that there are two things this sub can agree on:  1. Referees are found lacking on consistency and are generally shit across the board.  And  2. It is unacceptable to crowd the ref.  The likes of Man U, Man City, and Liverpool have gotten away with too much of crowding for too long. It's extremely frustrating to watch the Prem teams do it, this isn't La Liga.
Wow so they DO actually pay attention to when other teams than Arsenal do it!
Isn’t this what all teams do near enough every weekend though? Sure, it’s not good but the lack of consistency is baffling.
As a LFC fan I completely support this. Make the game more like rugby, you slabber at the ref and you get disciplined
Same as Forest the other week against Wolves. It’s all heat of the moment shit, but rules are there.. every game has controversy, always has. Refs should grow a pair and simply send the fuckers off.  8 v 8 every game would liven things up
I play rugby.  Most refs are actually fine with you asking them questions if you do it calmly and addressing them as a human being.  Fairly regularly I'll get penalized, ask the ref what I did wrong and they'll explain if there is time.  Have spoken to some of them in club houses afterwards and apparently they like talking so players know what they don't want us to do or what they're looking out for.  In theory they then have to whistle less and the game flows better.  They 100% would not be cool with swarming.  If I was a ref that would also motivate me to not look kindly on that team.  "Big conversations" such as we think we're being unfairly penalized compared to the other team or can you keep an eye out for the other team doing this are Captain only conversations.  Some refs are the "only the Captain talks to me" style, that's fine, live with the ref you have.
I agree fully and have been calling for it for years .  Only the captain and the offending players should be allowed to speak to the ref, in a cordial manner.  Turn on the mics in games and start giving yellows and the game will soon change
Been saying this for a while. I think the refs should also be trained on how to be cheeky   "If you're going to cheat, cheat fair"
Most other sports tbh. I play Lacrosse in the UK and if you have a go at the ref they'll tell you to wind your neck in and if you don't you'll get a straight 2 min send off for unsportsmanlike behaviour, with the possibility of ejection. It's only really Football that has allowed the treatment of referees to degenerate to this shocking level,
They tried miking the refs once. The language made the sport unbroadcastable.
Couldn't agree more.  Start dishing out cards for disrespect. They'd soon learn.  Rugby players manage to control themselves, no reason footy players can't.
Do these professional Rugby referees make a mistake for every 10 minutes of play?
Agree, although I think the Refs themselves could help.  If they started throwing a few cards when players surround them and start yelling, this would stop immediately.  The only person who is supposed to talk with the Ref is the captain.  No one else.
It's because it's the whole team, the captain is supposed to be allowed to talk with the ref, so if any more than the captain is complaining then fine them.    Also, it needs to be more than fines, start suspending players.  Look at United without Casemiro.  If these teams had to play without 2 or 3 of their regular starters.....
Refs are too protected , and they know it , which is why there's a blatant error almost every week now coz they know that nothing's going to happen to them after the game .  Your suggestion will only protect them more , leading them to become even bigger entitled pricks whose decisions affect results and even titles in the long run
No they mix In a little manhandling as well so that’s okay
Every team does it, let’s be honest
Yeah but we bought the refs and fa, deal with it 👍
United does, and they get charged for it too. They just did actually. But that doesn't fit united haters narrative so it's left out
And we get fined for it everytime, there's no difference yet people want to hate on us so they leave it out like how people ignore Fabinho pushing the ref and focus on Bruno
Scousers gonna hate!
If only they just made the right call and didn’t influence the game there would be no need to surround them
100%.  As a Liverpool fan I’m fine with this but it needs to be applied across the board; so many teams just bombard the ref and it’s one of my least favorite parts of watching the sport.  Let the captain say something if there’s a call you don’t agree with, it’s aggressive and pointless as the ref almost never changes their mind because of a team’s protesting.
Yeah i talked to him he said minutes were too short for him, so he'll play every day from nowadays
I agree. There’s a narrative that managers like to say to players don’t let the opposing team influence the ref.. have a go back. Now if the ref had balls to deliver a red immediately if swarmed it would kill the problem. Managers seem in necessary
It’s so confusing.   As a Liverpool fan I think it’s the right call, players need to have more respect  BUT a certain club gets away with this every week. And also I feel the ref did a great job on this he game ngl, what’s your thoughts and
It’s been years and they are still allowed to keep the leagues they “won”
Breathe easy my friend. We do as we please
Neither has Fabinho yet everyone seems to ignore that
When did we have that? Utd had Fergie time and City are keeping the titles they won as ruled by the Prem illegally. We just have the S*n spreading lies and everyone getting away with singing Hillsborough chants.
Anything happens, United get targeted  We are literally rent free in theirs minds
And every team gets fined for it.
Yawn. You know what he is, let’s not pretend otherwise.
Don't forget we cheated and haven't got any fans
Classy reference to Hillsborough there mate. Hope you feel good about yourself.
Hope your shitty club gets charged if you don’t already get relegated, especially that time wasting dinosaur
I got penalized for playing on after I wasn't held in my most recent game and that was my exact experience lol. I talked to the ref and he simply referees tackle completion stricter than anyone. Explained it and sure enough, was consistent through the rest of it
Then penalise people for swearing on mic, and it'll stop. Players manage to do multiple press interviews without calling someone a cunt, the idea that they're somehow too stupid to not yell bad words all the time is weird classist nonsense.
They're human too, so why shouldn't they? Unless football is somehow harder to referee. I don't know enough of rugby to determine this
It should be a yellow card to anyone who approaches who is not the captain, or instructed to approach.  I don’t care if I have to watch Arsenal vs Liverpool this weekend go down to an 8v9 match, I do t care if Chelsea vs Spurs becomes a 7v7, just start clamping down on this.   The players would learn incredibly quickly.
Agreed.  Someone mentioned rugby below, but look at the NFL.  Players don't backchat to the refereeing teams.  If they do, penalties, players ejected etc.  It really is unedifying seeing a ref surrounded by half a dozen petulant dramatic players.  Announce that it's being clamped down, start throwing cards around and it stops.     Probably be like carding divers though.  Fashionable for a month or two and then forgotten about.  I'm thinking this at home from my couch, but I can't help thinking if I was the ref I wouldn't be cool with it.
Literally had 2 players shove Refs (admittedly different levels of shove, but shoved regardless) in the past 6 weeks… and you think they’re too protected. They’re protected from off-pitch consequences of errors, not on-pitch intimidation from players.  Go and watch 3 games of rugby, the way refs command the game, the respect between players and official, and tell me it’s not better.  Less ref swarming means faster decisions, and more in game time… idk why folk don’t want reform on this.
not like Man United...  Bruno Fernandes spends more time whinging to the refs than he does kicking the ball.
Not entirely true.  This often happens.  Player A tackles Player B.  It's a foul and the ref blows for it.  Before he's even had the chance to show if he's going to produce a card, B's team surround him calling for punishment.  Often A's team will join in the melee.  Player B tackles Player A.  It's a foul.  It's worth a Yellow Card (but not more).  Ref produces a Yellow.  A's team surrounds the ref calling for a Red (they're wrong).  B's team joins in to protest the protesting.  I don't disagree that Premiership refereeing is often poor but we're talking about players who go bananas about a throw in being awarded against them on the halfway line when they're obviously the one that kicked it out.
Yikes.
Which club?
how are you a right winger and a Liverpool fan?
Maybe, but hey atleast out pl titles will not be remembered with ledger frauds.
Atleast we don't buy our trophies. You lot are nothing without your money. Would be in League 1. Lol.
Perfect.  Ref explained, you knew what his boundaries were and could play accordingly for the remainder of the game.  Not sure a ref could have that conversation with a wild-eyed Fernandes.  As an aside, I hate it when you don't think you've been held and carry on going, only to be called back!
It's not classist nonsense, it's borne out by actual evidence.  Penalising people for swearing on mic doesn't help when the BBC also gets penalised for broadcasting it to kids pre-watershed. There's a reason TV desperately cuts away from streakers now; it's not because it gives them the oxygen of publicity, it's because airing some fat dude's dick in primetime will get you slaughtered by the regulators.
Rugby refs make mistakes.  Sometimes it is because, as with any sport, not every incident is clear cut.  Sometimes they make bad calls.  Generally players and fans accept the decision.  Players act like grown adults not 7 year old children.  Apart from the keyboard warriors and experts that exist everywhere.  Just be glad Rassie Erasmus doesn't work for Arsenal.
Referees in Rugby are by far more consistent across the board, meaning they enforce the laws of the game more accurately as a collective. In football you can see two incidents that are the same with completely different outcomes based on which ref it is.  And human or not, the amount of inconsistencies and mistakes in the Premier League are crazy. They are meant to know the rules better than any fan.
Exactly - and it doesn't matter if the ref is correct or not.  Everyone thinks the ref is wrong if it goes against their team.   I do appreciate it when the ref is disciplined later if he/she made a clear mistake.  They should be accountable, just not in the heat of the game itself and it isn't up to the players to enact that discipline.
That's a good idea, but you remember a few seasons ago, they were starting to clamp down on fouls inside the box during corners and free kicks,  like shirt pulling, holding, etc?  They started giving penalties for that bullshit.....that was a good idea, too.  I don't remember that lasting more than a few weeks, if that.  I think it would go the way of the yellow card for diving, like you said.
And Mitrovic got an 8 game and a red card for it. By protected i don't mean literal security guards physically protecting them if that's what you thought.  Their jobs are protected , they aren't answerable to anyone , their wrong decisions literally affect games and seasons but they don't face any consequences , they don't have to face the media , they don't lose their jobs , nothing. Even when it's blatantly obvious that they've had a terrible game , they face no consequences.   Less ref swarming also means the freedom to mess up more and ruin matches, i don't watch rugby so idk to what extent ref decisions affect a game , but in the sports i watch, i feel referees are too protected for the amount of decisions they mess up consistently
Yeh but he plays for united so it's allowed.
We made him captain so he's allowed to approach the ref without getting fined for it, 200 IQ play.
Bruno has spent more time "kicking the ball" than any other player in the PL by a long shot, look at the minutes played table. He's also the captain, so logically he would be the one to complain to the refs about calls the most out of anyone in the squad. And since he's played the most out of all clubs this season by a lot, it adds up. I'm not saying he needs to calm down with the whining, I agree he needs to approach the ref like an adult and not a whiny little b. But I don't think he should do it less.
But this was a clear second yellow and the ref doesn’t give it. So it’s the refs fault but the players and team take the blame when they were right.
The club that was recently fined. But living rent-free in people's head so they missed it.
What are you talking about
Salty arsenal fan shoooooock
Own that freak
Sorry about your tears.
Rolling on the ground, screeching
Oh I know. Looking back at the film, he had let go long before I was down. I would have had a 2v1 with the fullback because my winger was pushing up in the outside, so almost certainly a try disallowed
Is the Prem worse than the CL or other leagues?
As an LFC fan I fully agree. My only issue is how uncommon it is the ref is punished for a clear misjudgement.    I agree LFC should've been fined, but also the second yellow should have been given. I'm not sure what to do with that information.   Also not trying to make excuses for Liverpools poor performance. City deserved the win, and probably still would have after a second yellow, but at the same time based on the majority of fans who hate or like us agree that should've been a second yellow. Surrounding the ref with players is obviously not a solution, but if there's no repercussions to their judgement as there often isn't,I can understand tempers flaring.
Yeah. Refs can shit the entire house with poor refereeing that directly impact the match but when there is a little pressure they feel the need to be protected. Poor guys. It is almost like if they're being threatned or beat every match. People are too soft with some stuff.  Pernandes put his hands on him and nothing happened. The idea of right or wrong on this is so biased, so soft that makes me sick.
Man united gets fined for this literally every week
We literally just got fined for the same thing so this is total bollocks.
We literally get fined for it too, stop acting like we're privileged or some shit
What does "minutes played" have to do with anything? 😆  He can't whinge incessantly about non-fouls for 5 minutes after they (didn't) happen if he's not on the pitch.  If there was a minutes whinged to minutes played ratio he would also be top by a longshot.  And es, he is the cpt, which is why he gets away with it, but he should still see more dissent yellow cards.
Refs definitely get things wrong.  Nobody born could ref a Premier League game and get everything right.  Do agree with you that there don't seem to be many/any repercussions for consistent or blatant mistakes.  Players would still surround a cybernetic Jesus ref.
United recently fined for this, must’ve missed that
I dislike Arse as much as the rest of the fans in the world, but what he’s saying is true. Good on them this year for figuring it out and being consistent.
The shooock is City having any fans. But that's to be expected. Who would want to be associated with the scum and the cheats of the EPL. Cry some more.
Shameless scum hehe
Crying?! Haha. I am taking you sorry lots, Mickey buddy. You are boring. Your club is boring. Your fans are boring. Your history is boring. Your son's, believe it or not, boring.   Call me out on any of these, i dare you. Lol. Crying he says. You are nothing but the empty pull barrel, ready to roll down.
I would say yes! Tell me the controversy in the champions league games you want me to consider on par with a league game in the Premier League; week in week out?
Agree on referee punishment.  I suspect that there is more punishment for the refs than you realize but no one will publicize it.  I did not see the specific incident so I can't comment on whether or not the second yellow was deserved.
Your mob surrounded the ref before he could have brandished a yellow anyway
Man Utd haters will disregard anything that doesn't help their case, they're doing the same about Bruno's shove when Fabinho did the same
Not *every* week.  But it should be.
It’s nowhere near consistent and it’s always the same teams hurt and the same ones that get a majority of the calls
All people needed to do was a simple google search and they'd see that Man U was fined for their conduct in the FA cup victory against Fulham.  I wonder what the downvotes are for.
I hate Arsenal more than most of the Chelsea fans of the world, but what he’s saying is true. I still wish they’d bottle it though.
I'm a saints fan mate I won't be an EPL fan for long.
You'll win this season's PL chill. Or maybe you won't haha.
Rattled
THAT Barcelona-Chelsea (handballs), Barcelona-PSG (handballs penalized for psg but not for Barca ), Barcelona-Arsenal (RvP early red card for shooting 0,3 seconds after a whistle)
Mentioned this earlier myself.  Players surround refs even before they had the chance to reach for a card (of any colour).
If you think so.  But this has moved away from my original response.  Players swarm referees regardless of the call.  Often even before the call was made.  Or even if the call was undeniably correct.  It's a player behavior issue.  Not a "but if refs refereed better" one.
Absolute nonsense.
Yeah for sure. I can live with city winning it, knowing their ways lol
And for better. Millwall might be better addition at this point.
Haha. Thanks man. Only gods know that 😅
Yah because your team is the one that benefits from this so clearly you don’t notice
👊🏽👊🏽
It’s nonsense because if I ask my mates that all support a various different clubs, who gets the majority of calls go there way and who is most hard done by, they’ll almost all say it’s their particular rival who gets it easy, whilst their club is most targeted.  City have also had some awful decisions go against them vs Liverpool. Just off the top of my head last season when Milner should have received three yellow cards, his second offence the most stonewall foul you’ll see, then minutes later Salah scored. Then later in the game Fabinho with an awful high tackle. I’ve got mates who are Liverpool season ticket holders who agree that both should have been red cards.   Take your tin foil hat off, and just accept that refereeing in general is awful quality for everyone.
Wait, why again do we want West Ham to do good?
It's not Ted, it's Nate. Such a shitty manager, and a real asshole too. They need to get rid of him and hire the laundry guy.
Moyes is an utter cunt, he can fuck right off
But if West Ham do really bad, we can get a proper Dockers Derby next season…
Personally I think it's Cat karma. Hope they go down.
I found it surprising that West Ham were predicted as top contenders in Ted Lasso's world.
"As we know, correlation=causation." I've been working on the statistics part of my master's thesis for a few days now, it really made my night, thank you.
West Ham was in relegation zone when Ted Lasso premiered, so this doesn’t make sense.
Good
Wait! Ted Lasso isn't real?    Well, that explains a lot!
West ham are shit their squad is terrible
Thx for Declan rice btw :)
West am's manager and owner are pricks
Hopefully to relegate wolves.
The wonderkid!
Absolute fraud isn’t he.
Well said
Context?
Noted
He’s looking for r/soccercirclejerk
Can't believe I'm about to say this but.....I'd much prefer that Millwall gets promoted instead to make this happen..
Not that it bothers me, but the distinct omission of Liverpool in almost the entire show, especially when flashing the league table, has been a bit confusing for me.
Their squad is good enough to compete for Europe
Damn, that 4-0 really hit home.
Thats happening anyways
Premier league table
Cats
They might get promoted and you get relegated, whizzing past each other like Norwich and Fulham.
Lol at least you aren’t like us they showed Tottenham at the bottom of the league and we also lost to Richmond in an episode
[Liverpool supporters](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/BBBOLVQRfGHsWEnj0S-nLmFEYrjcfhON9ydnWLljiDCD7YogxTGSwN3hPAkA1netMUQV0TVV8C2Sq2S4wOS2YLfOjr46qBbGnq0cCdvv-D8-D8hUaSWBzJzVS4FQrWDg2p8IQpJIL1nYTVT1IWSHZUarGTZvB4STAB5ZjiwoCphEUOHlxdPvUTgVFA)
😂
As opposed to 1-5 😂
Doubt it tbh you have like half of Portugal in your squad
Nah... It's between Bournemouth and Everton with their game on the last day of the season deciding who is 17th and who is 18th.     if Wolves take three points in week 37 then they can pretty much relax for their Arsenal final game.
Oh I tho he was juz a bad person like a racist or sth like that
For anyone curious the last time Fulham and Norwich played in each other in a league match was 8 years ago
True, they really did you guys dirty.   No clue why West Ham is held in such high esteem either, find it a bit funny while watching.
I love supporting the most hated team in the top 6. Rent free.
Rice could play for a top club in the CL, Paqueta is a baller, their defence is rather solid and their attack has some good players too  They should be competing for Conference league with this squad
Don’t you follow forest? Gloating over another teams win isn’t it boss. At least we scored..
Not the good half
No, he is just a bit of a tactical dinosaur
Richmond’s owners ex husband own west ham, and the wonder kid Nate shelley
Top 6, have you looked at the table lately? And much prefer liverpool over spurs and arsenal tbh
You dont support Chelsea
They can't even compete in the bottom of the table PL let alone Europe 😂
Woooooow you scored on single goal, but you conceded five. That's just humiliation 😂
SIUUUUUUU
I woke my wife up with my sudden laughter from this comment
Yeah, I know how that Rupert owns West Ham, just funny to see the stark contrast between them in the show and the state of the club IRL is all.
I'm saying with the talent they have they should actually be competing for Europe, they're doing shit this season cause of Moyes and other reasons I don't know about but they do have talent in their squad
And conceding 4 isn’t? What about when city put 6 past the mighty reds?
We are a new team and have tons of injuries. What's your excuse ? 😂 I mean it's quite ironic since man city have put 4 past you on numerous occasions
Ah, the old injury excuse. Didn’t you sign the whole population? On numerous occasions? I’m afraid that’s not the case, unless you want to go back several years
Yeah go check out our injury list then get back to me. Barely have of the people we started the season off with anymore.
Have a day off. You signed over 20 players 🤣 using injuries as an excuse for being shit is even more embarrassing than losing any game.
Good player but as a Liverpool fan I don’t want him. He walks into our midfield but the price being spoken about I think there’s better value to be had.
Good player but Brighton play a hard bargain. He will cost a fortune.
Shhhh
Not sure what you would have garnered from viera, Keane and many other all round midfielders statistics   Macallister is an incredibly intelligent player who controls the tempo of the game.   For me he would be perfect for Utd, as a second pivot to casimero, but operating slightly further forward, with the objective of getting the ball into fernandes/eriksen, in pockets of space
Why would he leave Brighton for a shiter team? Really hope Brighton can fend off the vultures this summer, 1 good summer and not having to sell their best players will see them be genuine top 4 contenders.
He's gonna go for 60m + which is probably fair he's a wicked little player but Liverpool probably need 2 starters and 1 or 2 squad players in midfield.  Their midfield 3 is shocking. And there's no way they splash 200m on a new midfield so probably better to spread the cash.
If Caicdeo was £80-million+ (and had a bid rejected for that), Mac Allister is way more.  His Dad even said Mac Allister is happy at Brighton for the foreseeable future.  His Dad is his agent, so he isn't exactly touting him around.
Pretty good player
He's Fant astic
Whats the estimated price
Chelsea should have pick him up to match up with Enzo yet they spent the bag on Mudryk. Surprised Potter didn’t pick Mac Allister when he literally coached him. Man got greedy thinking Mudryk was going to have a breakthrough
Actually if Liverpool manage to get Jude, him Mac Allister and Thiago would be a decent midfield too.
Lmfao Liverpool and United are infinitely more attractive teams even if they’re having a bad season
Liverpool aren't some thrifty value seekers. They spent big on Darwin and Gakpo, broke records on Allison and vvd.
The talk from the ITK is that we are going heavy this season, 200 will probably be spent on the midfield out of necessity
Minimum £80 million, as that is what Caicedo was valued at.  Messi has said he would KILL to play with Mac Allister.  Which means whichever team has Mac Allister next season gets Messi.  Good £300-£400 million, I reckon. It is a package deal with Messi.
Reckon you're looking at £170 million+ for Bellingham and Macallister.   Brighton have released previous year's financial reports and they were in profit....that doesn't include the sales of cucerella and Trossard. They'll probably cash in on caciedo first
a midfield of jude, mac allister, and thiago has no balance they are all somewhat similar players. who's sitting in the hole?? if you think jude is playing dm because his ball recovery and tackling is the best of the 3 then you've sorely misprofiled him
People here don’t get sarcasm lol,please tell me you were being sarcastic
Would he? Why doesn’t Messi go play at Brighton then?
Yeah I doubt they'll sell both of them in one window. Could be a disaster unless they line up good replacements. But that's never easy.
Thiago plays as the deepest of the three. Yeah you are the only person here who knows football everyone else is just a fool. Enjoy yourself.
Perhaps he will. We literally do not know.  Brighton has a habit of being able to attract players far out of their standard calibre e.g. Vicente in the Championship, an ex-Spanish international.
I'm sorry but any team that has Mac Allister next season does not get Messi and I don't think a package deal for the both of them is or was ever on the cards
Messi isn’t going to Brighton.
Tell that to footy journalists and betting odds.
I’m Australian (in Australia) and I’m Forest, but in our country Leeds has a huge following, possibly more than any other PL team, because of Kewell and Viduka back in the day.
Probably Leeds- but there'll be differences in age groups over years from fans outside of the geographical areas imo
Sir Alex Ferguson, when asked if the rumours of Dion Dublin having an unfeasibly big penis were true. “Not just big,” replied, Ferguson, “it’s magnificent.”  Got to be Dublin for me.
Nottingham is a much smaller City and has three professional clubs to Leeds' one   So, yeah. Leeds
If you look at the numbers for historical attendances, forest don't even make it into the top 20, they sit behind the likes of Birmingham, Leicester, west brom and derby. Leeds just outside the top 10.
It's Leeds, but they're both big and historic clubs with passionate fanbases
I'd say forest by far just because of how world renowned it is. Leeds is quite a small regional club
Leeds; used to be a top 4 team. Many fans everywhere and anywhere.
Dirty Leeds
I don't see Tottenham getting overtaken by that many teams.
As an Aston Villa fan, I’d love this to be true. We have a tough run coming up!   I think Liverpool will finish above us
Liverpool would be lucky to enter the Conference League considering their form
tottenham are gonna get there shit together , i think they will get to europa league
CL - Arsenal, City, Man United, New Castle  UEL - Liverpool, Brighton  Conf - Spurs
Swap Villa and Liverpool and it’s spot on I’d say
Add Chelsea to the CL. We've got Super Frankie Lampard back at the wheel, so the CL trophy is in the bag.  In all seriousness, though, it wouldn't surprise me if we somehow managed to win it whilst being dogshit in every other competition. Not that I think we will, because we won't (Real and then City/Bayern, I mean, come on), but it would just be the most Chelsea season if that happened.
In order:  Arsenal   Man City   Newcastle   Spurs    Man United   Brighton    Villa
Arsenal City Newcastle Brighton Liverpool Man Utd
They're only 7 points ahead of 8th placed Liverpool, who have a game in hand over them. Both are in dire form, but I'd be more inclined to believe that Liverpool would rediscover enough form to make a European spot than Spurs.  If Brighton and Villa's form continues, they'll absolutely pass Spurs (Brighton have 2 games in hand and are just 4 points behind), so really the only question mark is just Liverpool.
Tottenham right now are at there lowest point from the past 5 years if they hold on to fourth than well done to them but I don't see them getting fourth due to the situation they are in at the moment don't get me wrong though they do have the talent.
I think fans want #4 or #8 nothing in between, cuz apparently they don't wanna see liv in europa/confrence
Does this mean kane will finally win a trophy
I don't wanna be cocky but i think top4 is locked as it is  Crazy season for Newcastle United man
He’ll almost definitely want to leave if we don’t get champions league, probably wants to leave anyway and I don’t blame him
The Saudis are allies. How is this even news?
Someone's bitter, lol.
Under what rules should the sale not have been allowed?
Shut up stellini.
Because a foreign government bought a popular sports team and possibly skirted regulations by exerting power over the UK government and then the UK government lied to its own people and then got caught.
Allies? They're slavers and murderers
Not really. It's an article that makes some alarming observations which will have serious short and long term implications. It also adds context to a controversial takeover which has been weirdly (and conveniently) forgotten by a large portion of the media.   Seemed relevant to share to this sub.
All rules of morality and humanity, would you be OK with The Third Reich buying a club back in the day?
FWIW, I did not say the sale should not have happened nor did the article cite any specific rule being broken.   The point is that there were serious questions raised by the EPL, the UK gov denied applying any pressure on the sale, but did actually apply pressure.  It's your own moral compass on the matter. My point is that it's a ridiculous narrative going around about Eddie Howe and the turnaround. They bought a bunch of players once they obtained new ownership and those players have been successful, as you would expect. It's not a miracle if they make top 4. They have a bottomless pit of wealth to draw from and have used it fairly well since the takeover. It has especially helped that the top half of the EPL is down relative to previous years.
That's a rational response.
Popular outside of Newcastle ? Sunderland fan by any chance lol? Hate to break it to you but Newcastle are unknown outside of UK by your average none football fan person   Man United and Liverpool are the 2 biggest uk teams
They're allies with the UK, yes. Not sure how any of this is news.
Saudi gov buys billions of pounds a year from the Uk government in arms and military support we even have an alliance with them. No one in government cares less that they own a football club
Wonder if you would care so much if Newcastle were below you in the league table....
So what? Do you have the same view about Israel and Euros? I would guess not  Edit: mind you, Israel is much much much worse
In that case shouldn’t US and Chinese ownership also be excluded?  They both heavily exploit prison slave labour.  Not to mention US corporate capitalism contributing to tons of inequality and poverty.  Not to mention the US support of an apartheid state.
So not actual rules ok pal
One post. Godwin would be proud.   Saudi are our allies. Those you refer to were not.    Let me clarify, what rules, that also apply to other clubs, meant that the sale should not happen?
Morality and humanity when, as an entire society, we use devices made in sweatshops that contain colbat, which is mined by children.
There absolutely isn’t a bottomless pit of wealth to draw from. The owners are extremely wealthy but the club still has to abide by FFP which has been changed recently to protect the established top 6 and make it difficult for new teams to challenge long-term.  Our wage to revenue ratio is 94% which is extremely unhealthy if allowed to continue long term. We need to offload players if we want to make signings in the summer.  The idea that we can spend vast sums on players is completely false. If we are to challenge the top 6 regularly the club’s revenue needs to grow significantly
I live in America and think you're seriously underestimating the global popularity of the EPL.   EPL has massive television deals worldwide. Yes, some clubs are more popular than others, but even smaller EPL clubs have massive global followings.
You are stupid that's for sure.  Back to school, perhaps?
What is your definition of an ally? Someone we will take money from? Someone we rely on for oil?
That's objectively false based on the article which shows UK gov pressuring regulators to allow the sale for fear of retaliation from the Saudi gov. They absolutely care and it was documented.
I did not write the article nor did I determine the time it came out.  If you don't think government cover-ups and clubs being owned by governments that use unsavory leverage are problems that's fine.  I strongly disagree and am really not even saying anything other than facts per a recent article.
🤦 it's not the Chinese state or American state buying the clubs is it?  Both city and Newcastle are state owned clubs.
Saudi Arabia is carrying out a genocide in Yemen but because the people of Yemen are not blond and white the world does not care
Do we have evidence of FFP enforcement making an impact? I know man city may face something, but that's not sussed out yet. I think clubs are going to be able to skirt it, especially with the amount of wealth some of these owners have, the fact that there is already proof of political interference and there is a long history of corruption in football's legislative bodies.
The proof is in the viewership figures, Man United and Man City get millions and millions. Newcastle - West Ham didn’t break 200k on the global views
We are registered allies with Saudi and have a active Military alliance with them, we sell them weapons and training to the tune of billions a year
It's literally on the government website https://www.gov.uk/world/saudi-arabia/news
They care that they were allowed to buy them that is different to caring how they are ran which is the crux of the premier league issue. Which are entirely different things
Spurs are sat 3rd atm, you don't read nor post the article. Simple facts.
I do know about that, I also know about the war in Mali and the continued Israeli genocide of the Palestines sponsored by the US and NATO as well as France’s exploits in West Africa, not to mention the Myanmar genocide of the Rohingyas.  Also the instability in the Middle East caused by the US-UK’s illegal invasion of Iraq which the BBC this year even released a piece on criticising the actions of the government at the time.   But you do know the Saudis, US and the Arab league support the Yemen government, or would you rather support the SRC rebels and their allies North Korea, Hezbollah, Iran and Syria?  What I’m saying is why advocate for the ban of the Saudis and not the US? They’re both interlinked close allies anyways, the US even support the Saudis in their war in Yemen.
What exactly did I say that was incorrect?
even in UK the support for non big teams is less , in London alone there are so many clubs and most support the top clubs , u hardly find some1 supporting something else unless u actually go to that place
I don’t know why you are getting downvoted. You are quoting the British government’s position. I guess people don’t like the truth of the matter.
Who gives a shit
Isn't the purchase a precedent and indication of how the owners intend to run the club which literally becomes a permanent EPL issue?
Spot on. The 3rd/4th place trophy means so much to me🙃.  My club has different issues and going to the champions league or missing it won't fix them. They'd actually be better off finishing 8th and skipping the nonsense since they continue to prove they do not have the depth to compete in Europe with the current squad.
You're like a rich guy that's moaning that one of his investments didn't turn out quite the  way he expected but at least he can use the losses against any capital gains during the year. Do one
Kinda what I was trying to point out to the op, Newcastle are an unknown football team to many people
You do you.
In what world am I morning? I’m simply pointing out that we don’t have the unlimited funds people claim we do.  I, like most other Newcastle fans, are over the moon we finally have a team that works hard and gives us everything on the pitch.
up until recently yes , ever since Saudi took them over + their performance in FA Cup and PL have made them famous lmao
You're not fooling anyone mate
I’m not sure what it is you’re trying to suggest
If you want
I think it’ll be Southampton, Forest and one of West Ham or Leicester to go down honestly.  People will say West Ham and Leicester have too much quality to go down but they’ve both been shocking for the full season and there’s no signs of improvement whereas Bournemouth and Everton are at least looking hard to beat at home.
No one’s down yet, one win changes everything
Surely looks like it, unfortunately. Their toughest games will be at home though, so miracles might happen.
But this time next week it will be a new favourite to go down , it’s gonna be right down to the wire
Really hope forest don't go down I love them in the top flight.
Fun while it lasted
Watch forest take points at Villa this weekend!! Typical villa, 16 points out of a possible 18, but will lose to forest at home!
Think the bottom 3 will stay as is - in order.
Too close to call.
No, there's 4 points between 13th and 19th.
Wolves need to get 6 points to make sure that they don’t fall into relegation. We just need to get points.
Too many injuries for us. We lost another one on Tuesday. I can't remember when we last had fewer than 10. Who loses their keeper for three months? It's rare. Our best midfielder out with a mystery malady, our striker out for three months and only just returning. We are using our second choice fullbacks on both sides now.   Mid season we were great at shutting teams out but we are struggling to do it now. I personally think we'll go down. We had to beat wolves and their equaliser was devastating in a game we really deserved to win
Yes, I think we can, sadly.
You can say what you like but someones gonna get pissy about it and downvote you even if you're right.
Forest will win the title. MARK MY WORDS!!
Nope, they are not out of it just yet. There’s 9 teams currently in the position of facing relegation, and while their remaining fixtures are going to be difficult, I can see Forest ensuring survival by a mere 16th/17th place. Hang on lads as I don’t want to see them out of the Premiere League so soon
Yeah also forest have alot of good players
What a massive fall for West ham... Wtf happened? They went deep into Europe last year.
Do you think we’re staying up mate? I think we might go down unfortunately.
That's right but if you looked at their schedule you will see what I mean they have very hard games
If we can't beat Leeds away we sure as shit won't beat villa at away
Forest have a lot of players*
They have a forest of players
We have like 3-4 genuinely good players
they’ve gone deep in Europe *this year* too
I think you’ve got a good chance, maybe I’m putting too much stock in your performance against Liverpool but I thought you’s looked really good on the counter and organised at the back.
It's you, us and Southampton I fear. One of us two might make it out alive at Leicester's expense, but I think we're doomed.
If we bottle this season (forest) you'll stay up quite comfortably
Don’t worry sadly I know. But Forest can do Forest things and give anyone a game at home
Well this year is the UEFA Farmers (Conference) League. Last year's Europa cup run was much more impressive.
Personally I think it will be Southampton and AFCB for bottom 2 unfortunately as we’re struggling and haven’t won consecutive matches this season.
Without awonyi sadly most we can do is draw games lately
City haven't had a recognized left back in years going back to the Fabien delph phase . Seems they like making it harder than they need to
He is the greatest manager in football. Watch the first episode of the of the City All or Nothing and try not to impressed.
you say this but this formation we’re using doesnt have a left back. it’s basically a 3-2-2-2-1 where the ‘ right back’ moves to dm next to rodri with the right centre back and the ‘left back’ play as wide centre backs. then the two midfielders ahead of the dms play in the pockets and either try to send a through ball to the striker or send it wide. the wingers stay wide always and drag themselves inside. then the striker has to play one twos, drag the defenders wide for space for the wingers or just finish the chances themselves
Peps is a genius and so far ahead of any of his fellow managers. We're in danger of taking his brilliance for granted at the minute  He will be much more revered once he's left and retired and he can be fully appreciated.  He invents a new system every other month and has players playing in unfamiliar positions and completely smashing it. He played John Stones in centre midfield against liverpool and he embarrassed liverpool looking like a prime xavi in the process, he went to the Emirates and played Bernardo silva at left back against the player many are claiming has been the best winger in the league this season and won comfortably. he's brought in a 17 year old in Rico Lewis in big games and made him central to his ganeplan, Nathan ake has been the best left back in the league this season, he scored the most goals last season without a striker.   its a marvel to see and is exciting to see what he comes up with next. His constant innovation is why nobody can keep up with him, he's moved on to something else by the time anybody figures out how to play against it.
The thing is with Chelsea, look at how many strikers they have bought over the past few years and have ruined sadly. Nkunku is the next one (just like Morata, Werner, Auba, Havertz, and Felix)
System over individuals   Player over position   .....add this to all he 'borrowed' from the Dutch, going back to fluid dynamics and positions being irrelevant, then this is what you get  The Dutch figuratively trained/played for decades without numbers on their backs and taught young players to understand and appreciate multiple positions....by playing them  Football isn't stacked with the most intelligent, and the majority regurgitate what they have seen as players  Pep isn't much different in that respect.   He just had Johan Cruyff as a mentor instead of Neil Warnock  Edit: minus 4 for this 🤣 I'm going to have to assume that  it was a little too advanced.
Positions in football aren’t a set thing especially at City, Liverpool or Arsenal who all play/played fluid systems.  You’ll always have players interchanging positions in game wither it’s the front 3 or the midfield 3 sometimes even the full backs with them going forward or tucking into central areas.
You're absolutely right! Guardiola has always represented a different level to me, although I know that this is not the popular opinion, as Manchester City is not a popular team.
In fairness, their first choice was locked up at her majesty's pleasure for the past few years
At this point it's pretty nailed on pep is just deliberately handicapping himself to give him a challenge. "I'll win the league with delph left back for a laugh" makes no sense why theyve repeatedly refused to by a proper left back all these years. They've bought 1 left back since pep came to this league and he has probably played a couple of dozen times at most due to back to back ACL injuries and being a bit rapey.
They don't/didnt get a traditional left back because at  they play with inverted fullbacks   Usually in a 433 the fullbacks push up, wingers come in as 10s or wide forwards to link with striker and the wide CMs cover and control  City 2018 Pep hasn't usually attacking fullbacks so he innovated, play a defender like walker or stones who tucks in and delph/zinchenko to push into midfield allowing wingers and attacking mids to form the front 5   They could sign an attacking LB and have him overlap grealish and keeping gundogan back which would work perfectly fine but in the past with sane sterling foden on the LW there would be no point
Second best manager in football you gooner 😉
I’m curious, what puts him ahead of Ancelotti?  Only manager to have won league titles in all of Europe's top five leagues.  4 CL wins with two different teams - AC & Real  Pep hasn’t won a CL outside of a Barca team that had Messi, Xavi and Iniesta on it. And for all the money spent at City, they’ve made one CL final which they lost.
“So far ahead of any his fellow managers”  Lmfao
He could have played ederson in midfield and embarrassed Liverpool's midfield. I honestly can't think of a worse midfield in the league this season
I'd start with Lukaku if you're heading down that street  Chelsea need to find a manager.  They then need to actually converse with said manager, understand and interpret their style of play  .....then recruit players to fit his system  They will likely sign another 7 players   Then appoint a manager, as per  You can have a "head coach" system, with technical/sporting directors instead of a "manager", however, they need to actually make an effort to understand each other.  The players referenced, can provide output in terms of goals/assists - in the right system, that plays to their strengths.
Morata has always been the same, that’s not a Chelsea thing   Werner I have a hard time believing he’d have done well at any premier league side   Aubameyang was good at Barcelona but had a poor season at Arsenal prior   Havertz isn’t a striker, he’s just being played there  Joao Felix is exactly the same as he’s always been  Chelsea don’t have a tremendous record with their strikers but I think it’s more a recruitment issue than them destroying strikers
Chelsea didn't ruin Auba. He was shit for ages before moving.
I see you trying to sneak liverpool in there with the genius of Pep football. One of the main reasons you lot are 8th is because you cannot adapt, you have 1 way of playing and if it goes tits up there's no changing it.
Stop it. Go away
Which has worked out better for city on the pitch. The guy is fucking woeful
He's not deliberately handicapping himself he doesnt get attacking fullbacks because they don't fit his system - using inverted fullbacks so the wingers stay wide and CMs have more license to attack
finally, someone recognizes the intrinsic genius of Unai Emery!
Klopp is going to be sacked soon
I somehow forgot lukaku,sorry
It is a recruitment issue, you're spot on.
Immediately prior to Chelsea, he scored 11 in 18 for Barca. Not exactly shit.
😂😂😂😂
That and the fact City can buy two starters for every position and cook their books.
Klopps changed formation multiple times this season and the same issues still occur, there’s nothing you can do when our best midfielder is always injured and the two other main midfielders have declined massively.
Eh?
Kind of disproves your original post about Delph though
He wasn't woeful (as a footballer). He hardly played because his knees were made out of glass. Any time at City he had a run of games, he looked good.
Lol no he’s not
And before that purple patch he had been useless and eventually banished from Arsenal.
then why don't we have any depth at left back?
Well weve got a 20 man squad including 3 keepers so that's bullshit straight off the bat.
Changing it and still getting thumped isn't the same as changing it and finding new ways of winning. If klopps is as great as we're led to believe why can't he come up with solutions like pep does?  Klopps been there for 7/8 years it's his team, he's as responsible as anybody for the state of his squad. Blaming the players is a cop out anyway, do you think Brentford have as strong a squad as liverpool? Do villa have a better squad? Newcastle?
If he's lucky you might snatch a place in the conference league next season. Must be a brilliant coach
https://www.espn.com/soccer/blog-the-toe-poke/story/4194191/man-city-have-spent-368m-on-defenders-in-four-years-heres-how-peps-signings-rank
Yeah let’s all pretend you guys don’t spend £100mil on every position
Yeah it’s clear you haven’t got a clue why the teams underperforming
All of those teams have a better midfield
Average r/premierleague user right here lol
City are responsible for 1 player in the top 10 highest premier league transfers.
You only care about spending when the team is successful. What about Chelsea?
Haaland wasn't even £60m
Deflecting...   You're gonna finish 8th. Van Dijk is washed. Salah is washed. Nunez is Andy Carol. Nobody wants to join you. Milner's getting a 5 year contract. Trent.
Correct but his agent fees were around £40mil which city paid……not to mention his £385k weekly wages
Lmfao thanks for proving my point that you’re an idiot   Bye
Such a predictable response...  On to the next position. How much was Ederson?
City spent £51.6 million on agent fees this year in total with the signings of haaland, alvarez, phillips, gomez, akanji, perrone and ortega. for comparison, Liverpool paid £33.7 million on agent fees for nunez, gakpo and Carvalho. The difference in total for all players agency fees is barely even half of the £34 million extra liverpool paid for nunez than what city paid for haaland. Its really not an overly significant figure to warrant constantly bringing it up... Not to mention liverpool have a higher wage bill than city.
Why would Bellingham or Mac Allister want to go to Liverpool?
Which team is being investigated for breaking FFP rules over 100 times?
Chelsea
Leicester and West Ham
Leicester if they go down and somehow retain their talents.  Maybe West Ham United?  Not very sure about Wolves and CPFC.  But I don't see So'ton, Bournemouth, Leeds or even Everton coming back instantly if they go down, due to either current squad quality, exodus of talents or even club politics.
I’m biased but AFC Bournemouth will probably bounce straight back up or the season after because I can’t see Bill Foley our new owner not chucking alot of cash into our squad.
If they keep most of their players, Wolves, Leeds, Leicester and West Ham all have loads of talented attackers and midfielders.  I’d guess they’d each do well in the championship.
West Ham and Palace would come back up. Forest, Bournemouth and Soto would struggle the most and those are still the 3 I reckon are going down.
Southampton need a full rebuild could take longer to get back up. Bournemouth could struggle if they are relegated never know with them.   Apart from that most teams who could go down still have a lot of quality. The issue is what they do with that quality, whether it is sold on or they manage to keep it.   I fear for Forest if they go down tho, can’t imagine the financial stress they’d be under with the size of their squad.
As a forest fan if we can keep a few players we have this season and sell off some of the good ones. Then make some strategic signings next year we would dominate the championship next year. I feel like the momentum we've gained this season and a strong rebuild will see us return to the prem the next year only much stronger.
Any of them. Whoever gets relegated are coming right back up
Think we'd be fine-ish with our academy
Leicester/West Ham in my opinion. Those two clubs are huge and there is no way the owners wouldn’t do everything they can to get them straight back up
If Everton go down they’ll either come back up straight away or go full Sunderland
Not this season.  12 points cushion from 18th place Bournemouth with 9 games left, not really difficult matches too with 3 against relegation contenders.  Lotta memes surrounding Lamps but Chelsea has simply too much quality to drop down.
Feel like one of these sides are going down with Forest and Southampton, I agree  Leicester vs West Ham last game of the season could be massive
I would say you are way wrong and Bournemouth would probably bounce back. It’s such a tough league, you tend to need players that have been there and done it before. Many teams that haven’t been down for a while struggle. And if you don’t bounce, the massive wage bills of long term prem clubs can seriously cause trouble.
This is Southamptons rebuild that's why we've signed so many young players. Hopefully they will have gained enough experience this year to get us back up next year but depends who leaves and of course who else goes down.
Most of our squad have relegation clauses in their contracts and or have short term contracts that expire at end of season.
We have the same size squad as everyone else, 25 players. We left two out, both of whom will be right back in the team at the expense of loan players who go back and players on one year contracts like Lingard who go.
Would you want Cooper to stay if you got relegated?
All 3 teams relegated the previous season immediately getting promotion together has never happened since the PL began. I think even just 2/3 of the teams immediately getting promotion has only happened 6(?) times in 28 or whatever amount seasons it is
Except Everton
So what you are saying is Chelsea has a lot of relegation six-pointer match-ups remaining. This season keeps on giving.
Pretty sure he was joking.
What are easy Matches for Chelsea right now?  They can lose to bournamouth at bridge and i won't be surprised
You've a point.
I haven't seen them a whole lot but every time I see Southampton play I think "they're not bad at all." If they keep most of the squad together, I think they'd bounce back up but that is admittedly based on a small sample size on my part.
I thought their business at the start of the season was good, signing high potential young players for pretty low fees. But I think a few of the core young players in the squad are too good for the championship now. The likes of Lavia for sure, Bazunu, Bella-Kotchap for sure, even Sulemana who they just bought. All of them will want a move.      And then JWP I can't see staying, if he does he'd be a candidate for the best player to play in the Championship ever, can't think of any better.
for Forest? fair enough smart business then, still think the mass offloading of players could be an issue.
you don't have the same squad size as everyone else, you have 35 players in your squad, of which 25 are registered. granted you have 4 outgoing loans, the number of players you have is still a lot
I hope you stay up tho, steve cooper a legend. also to break all prem norms by overhauling the squad after being promoted and staying in the PL
Not up to me really and I know a majority of people would want him. Personally I think we will need him going down, but he really needs to up his game if he hopes on taking on the prem. Having said that when our team was fully fit we were doing very well considering how quickly we came up. I would say yes I'd give him one more crack at it. If he failed again I'd seriously look at alternatives to replace him in the top flight.
You gotta have faith!  Ginger Mourinho has made you lot tough to beat, especially at Goodison.
Everton aren’t going down. They don’t actually play ridiculously bad and Goodison will ensure their survival
Our defense is very error prone. They'll look solid for 70 minutes and then pull an absolute stinker. And we're toothless up front, never replaced Danny Ings with a clinical striker. But I agree I think the core of players would be able to climb back up if they keep the right mentality and stay at the club
Bazunu won't get a move, hes on an ok run of form right now but had the worst stats out of the top 5 leagues in Europe for a while this season
We will be looking to keep as many of our strongest players that we can going down. But we also get parachute payments and big Greek papa can bail us out of any financial nonsense surely to follow.
We have a bunch of younger players out on loan at various places as well. Like many PL teams.  We have 25 players. Neco Williams and Brennan Johnson don't count to that this season, and we left Steve Cook and Lewis O'Brien out.  We have a small number left over from the championship waiting out their contracts; Harry Arter, Cafu, Lyle Taylor- who are all out this summer. Arter being the worst, a 4 year contract and allegedly so disruptive he's been banished from the club for most of it.   No idea what the financial situation is if we go down; there will be liabilities but all the players have relegation clauses to reduce their wages and Johnson will go for decent money
Agreed but we fit the question.  We are in the relegation scrap, and  if we do happen to stumble our way into actually going down then we aren't bouncing right back
Agreed but we fit the question.  We are in the relegation scrap, and I firmly believe if we do happen to stumble our way into actually going down then we aren't bouncing right back
Yeah fair enough, if the club prepared for the worst at the start of the season then you may be safe, but who's to really know aside from those inside and at the top of the club.   Didn't know that about Harry Arter too... banished from the club on a 4 year contract. You couldn't write it
Yep, £40k a week (plus promotion bonus!) for 4 years. No idea what went on but I last saw him on loan for Notts County in the Conference, and they parted ways with him early too. Easily one of the worst signings in our history, but thankfully that 4 year contract us up this summer.
christ, if I'm not wrong and I've done the maths right, that's an 8 million pound contract. and assuming he doesn't touch the field for Forest again, that's about 600k pounds per appearance.
Yep, that's about the size of it. Horrendous deal at the time, a few years ago now. He'd just been promoted with Fulham, we thought he was going to marshall our midfield to promotion. Wasn't like that, not sure I'll ever know exactly what happened between him and Hughton.
Genuinely what is the point in this move? Why not just keep Potter or even his assistant in charge instead of bringing back an old manager that got sacked for a few months.
Bro falls upwards
Owari da
Should have been a week earlier. Lamps vs Klopp at the touchline would have been funny 😁
his press conference   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1k3NS\_iD7Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1k3NS_iD7Q)
This brings a smile on my face
Chelsea are daft.
Though this was a sacking statement not gonna lie
Just Todd Boehly things
Cause they can’t exactly go hunting for a manager to replace Potter if he’s still at the helm here. Also, Bruno seems like he just wants out and nothing to do with this mess ASAP
It's only until June right ? About 11 games to assess and clear the squad for the next manager .
1.Yes they can.  2.Lampard's contract ends after the final day of the season. Literally nothing stopping them from sacking Potter after the final game and then have plenty of time to get a new manager in
When has there ever been the case of a team actively searching for a new manager but keeping the under fire and struggling manager ?
Bayern like a week ago
Mourinho to Manchester United, Mourinho to Tottenham and Guardiola to City off the top of my head
Guardiola was announced as City's new manager for the following season in February 2016, whilst Pellegrini was still manager (and was there until the end of the season).
They were holding talks with and having numerous potential managers fly into Germany for meetings whilst Nagelsmann was still manager ?
Van bronckhorst didn't play enough in CM for me and I'd put Gullit in there for him.   Personally, I think Robben has to start but not bad all round there.
Where’s Karius? /s
Where is Wesley Schneider?
I hate xis which play players ridiculously out of position to avoid having to make a tough choice
Robben wasn't great in the PL, definitely not as good as any of the chosen forwards.
Wenger bought him as a center midfielder
Who do you think is ridiculously out of position ?
Not great? Okay, he was injured a fair bit, but he was always brilliant when he played. Him and Duff rotating wings was a nightmare for every defence.
I agree and disagree, if you're playing 3 up top, he's a far superior LF/LW or LW/RW to Van Persie. Overall, RVP was a better player within the PL but he's shoe-horned in there at LF/LW.   RVP played over 90% of games as a CF.   For me, it's overmars LW, Robben RW and RVN CF. If it was my choice I would play a 442 with RVP and RVN up top as both CFs.
Yea, he was bought as a CM to play beside Vieira but he tore his ligament and never really played there.  Just think Gullit is a much better choice.
Özil at right wing in a 4-3-3 or a 4-3-3 with Bergamkmp, RvN, RvN and Overmars.
How on earth can you not pick Bergkamp?
100% gullit was a better choice
Agreed, I fucked up.  Bergkamp would actually be my no.1 choice. I think I must've just looked at what was in front without thinking.
The word ‘if’ is doing all the heavy lifting here.
I hope so, keep him for a long time
Rationally, no.  But it's Chelsea, so I can't really give you an answer.
Does the name Roberto Di Matteo ring a bell?
No as one of the two leading candidates will take over in the summer they just don’t want to now
I would rather stick my dick into an airplane turbine
Chelsea is becoming a laughing stock.   Why sack Potter a proven manager and bring in lampard who's failed at every club he's managed ? just shows the owners are totally clueless and have zero strategy how they want to play and how to move forwards as a club.
Lampard doing wonders means not getting sacked before the 38th fixture!! He’s a joke.
Mark Goldbridge’s latest video is actually quite informative on this matter (yeah I know I’m a man utd fan and I watch him). Basically what he said is, with all those talented players around + players tend to play better for awhile whenever a new manager joins, if the team suddenly do well, it will not be because of Lampard, but the owner might thought it’s because of him and suddenly bam 5 years contract. When the team inevitably stagnates again that will be when the main problem begins all over again.
I think this is a better question to ask IF he helps them achieve those results.
I really like Lampard but for some reason I think it would go the same way it did for ole.
Only way he gets an extension is he laces up again
Ask John Terry
Frankie's at the wheel...
if my aunt had bollocks
I'm now seeing the word 'if' in a Rocky IV style training montage. Thanks for that.
I will hold you to that
To appease the fans maybe, many of whom thought that Frank was hard done by the first time round.  It is mad that a guy who's had little to no success as a manager keeps getting jobs
I'm far from convinced Potter is a 'proven manager'. Which of his achievements suggest that, the Swedish Cup?
Because Potter was Chelsea's worst manager ever statistically and is a hugely overrated manager in general. His teams are known for incredible streaks of poor form and an inability to score consistently. If you analyse his career to date, the trends are starting to develop. More work to do for him, but you cannot have that time at Chelsea. No doubt it was a particularly challenging circumstance but it is obvious Potter was never the man to manage it anyway.  Now, are the owners clueless? Almost certainly. But sacking Potter is not what proves that. They clearly have some form of ideas for how they want to move forward but you're correct, strategy is throw anything and see what sticks at the moment.  Edit - not sure bc why I’m being downvoted. This subs hard on for Potter is wild.
Chelsea fan here. All grahams proven is his ability to do well in short spurts and be mid table. What has he won in Englands top level?
Even if our owners aren't dumb enough to give him a permanent contract, I dread him going on a small run and then dumbfucks in our fanbase convincing themselves to give him a permanent contract. The last thing our new coach needs is people against him.
For what it’s worth Mark Goldbridge has decent commentary when he chooses to talk about other teams
😂
If we're listening to the dumbfucks in our fanbase who think Lampard deserved more time, we're truly hopeless
Are you really appeasing that many people though?   Boehly is just setting more money on fire. Tuchel and Potter on the books, now you have to pay someone else to caretake while offering way too much for the next manager because their in a bad spot
He's a lot more proven than Lampard lol
Todays take is brought to you today by cocaine.
Because Potter was Chelsea's worst manager in history   You find me another manager that was given 18 players in 7 months. Players he probably didn't even want or need and then show me their success.   Many say it takes around 6 months for a foreign player to move to the prem, get settled, learn team + setups, learn language and culture, get accustomed to best league in the world plus adapt to our awful weather. Therefore Potter getting so many players and barely reaching 6 months as manager is not his fault.   Todd Boehly wanted to flex his cash with big names that HE wanted and Potter paid the price.
Potter has proven that he doesn't need riches to improve a team. All he needs is a squad to motivate and improve and bring youths into the team like he's achieved at other clubs.  Everything that happened at Chelsea is not what he's accustomed to and put him out of his comfort zone and brought added pressure so Boehly made Potters job a lot more difficult than it had to be.   I know Potter was never good enough to get that Chelsea job but he doesn't deserve all the flak he's receiving.
Haha I'm just trying to think of reason why they'd go for Lampard. That's all I could come up with
I don't know, I was just speculating but I do think a lot of Chelsea fans would prefer Lampard over Potter. One of their own and all that.  >Tuchel and Potter on the books  Well, neither are on the books as they've been paid off but it is pretty ludicrous how much cash Boehly is just throwing about
Didn't say Lampard was a proven manager either.
Cause Bruno is essentially Potter lol
There were more options than just Bruno or Lampard
post this in r/coyg
Gabby
Jesus. But Nketiah in less crucial games and Trossard should start but not at striker, or come off the bench, he is a fine playmaker
Jesus. He's the man to lead us to salvation.

Agbonlahor?!!! Good call!!! 😂😂😂
Lol Chelsea
Hhehe
That people say the league is stronger than ever , I disagree I think it has more crap teams in it than ever , why so many can go down , some of the crap I’ve seen lately , maybe 4 or 5 teams in the league play good football , I was watching united v brentford last night , everyone was saying how amazing brentford are , they were rubbish ! Just another stoke
The shot from behind as the ball goes in is even better.
Fuck sake, I don't need to see this again. 😂
The meme potential is strong
This was my reaction to seeing the Frank Lampard news to be honest
I haven't watched the game,what am i missing on this picture?😅
The ref is so far behind play that he is still running while these boys have in combination, rushed out, lost the ball, collected it, taken the shot and are stationary watching it go in.
Looks like Fabianski knew.. :D
I love Fabiański, even when he (rarely) makes mistakes. I will greatly miss him while watching Prem once he's gone
lmao
Quality football right there
Flappyhandski
Fantastic photo
Well, Fabianski dunt.....he's got his eyes shut!
In the highlights it looks cold af
No context needed
Context? Haven't watched the game
The ball is going into the hotel
Isak just shot. They're watching it go in.
Fabianski rushes out, clears the ball as far as Isak who scores from well outside the box. They were both standing like that already as the ball crossed the line.
"Checking in sir?"
Lmao thanks mate if you are not trolling😂
Room for one ? No luggage sir ?
Meant goal, not hotel
Leicester if they get relegated.. Big money for Madison surely. Maybe Barnes too.
If you adjust for inflation then the west ham side that was "too good to go down" was probably the most valuable. This west ham side would give them a run for their money though should they go down, prpbably £200-£300 million if theres a mass exodus, rice alone will fetch about £80million   Burnley made about £75 million last summer from the likes of Collins, cornet, McNeil and pope, and thats before losing tarkowski and mee on free transfers and loaning out weghorst. Not to mention selling wood to nrevastle in the january.
Nufc 2016?  Wijnaldum, Sissokp, Jamaat, Cabella, Cisse, Thauvin probably more
Leicester will surely make a lot of money when their entire starting 11 ask to leave when they’re relegated
It would be more of a loss, no? I mean, if they survive and sell those players they'd no doubt get more for them than if they sell after relegation.  Declan Rice at West Ham for example was being talked about as a 100-150m player last year. If West Ham get relegated and he puts in a transfer request I certainly can't see them getting 100m+ for him anymore.  Anyway, I think Wolves have the most potential value in their squad if they were to sell players off. I don't think they'll get relegated, but they're only 1pt off so you never know.
West Ham: they could sell Rice, Antonio, Paqueta and maybe Soucek and make at least £120/€137 million euros
West ham watch out cuz we are coming for Declan rice.
Fuck you.
They won't go down
Rice is no way going for 80 mil if they get relegated. If they don't there's a solid chance tho, but players in relegated teams go for big discounts cuz they have to clear up that wage budget
The only club who would pay more than £50-60m for Rice is Chelsea and apparently they've done their spending. West Ham should have cashed in when they had the chance.
Rice can be ours.
Sorry buddy... To be fair.. I said "If".. Not "when"..
I only said "If".. I don't think they will... Southampton,  Bournemouth and Leeds is what I feel. But Leeds won.. So...
I bet they do
Fuck you twice.
Southhampton Bournemouth and west ham are my picks
Madison and Barnes on big transfer.. Tielemans on free transfer.. Vardy to retirement.. Ndidi and Mendy sold too...  Wout Faes gonna be captain..   Go ahead.. let's keep fucking!!!
You’re a baby
This year.. almost all teams are either fighting for top 4 or fighting against relegation. Just Chelsea, Liverpool and Aston Villa chilling with popcorn.
>west ham   Inshallah
It’s a joke, you child.
It was lame as hell lol
Im not sure u/bigsexyballer98 has a right to call anything lame
I’m not surprised the man who’s idea of comedy is “fuck you” has nothing better than to just write my username
Fuck you.
 Conceding the goal to Bournemouth 10 seconds in
Leicester: Faes brace vs Liverpool
This season
Everton: 90% of January - battered 4-1 by Brighton, lose to Nathan Jones' Southampton, bottom of the league for 20 minutes which was humiliating, board claim fans headlocked DBB and told they can't attend games, fans stopping Mina's car, lose El Sackico, Moshiri promises a striker if we need one in a interview (we need one and we don't get one), Kenwright has an embarrassing interview post West Ham game, Gordon debacle goes nuclear, Spurs steal Danjuma last second and don't use him, only team in the league with no new signings   Only good thing is the changing of manager
Tottenham:  Their manager calling out the entire club for being spursy.
You can't think of anything embarrassing for the team currently sitting bottom of the league so you picked losing to the champions away 4-0? They smashed united for 6 at home, if anything, that's one of their more respectable results.  They got knocked out of the fa cup by bloody grimsby at home! and lost at home to wolves after going 1-0 up and wolves having 10 men for most of the game. Those 2 things alone have happened in the last two months.
Tottenham had a chance for a trophy. 🤔  Are you serious?
Forest: 'Playtime' tweet before the Wolves game earlier in the season, only to lose 1-0 and Wolves post 'Playtimes over' in response?  Bottling a 2-0 lead to Bournemouth at home?   Getting smacked 4-1 by Blackpool in the cup?   Spending 15 million pounds on Chris Wood   There's a fair few and I just hope that's as bad as it gets
 Southampton : whole season is embarrassing
Brighton - Sanchez comically dropping a cross allowing Palce to equalize and steal a point in a game they showed nothing.  If we miss out on Europe, this will be the reason.  Also, cost Sanchez his starting role.
Man City: against Brentford, their attacking gameplan resorted to diving to try to win a penalty.
No shame in losing to Sporting with a heavily rotated team, and using 2 subs in 15 minutes due to injury  There is shame to conceding a kick off routine to the worst team in the league in 7 seconds
Liverpool:  yes
I'm still waiting for the annual 9-0 thrashing 😂
I'd say our defeat to Sheffield Wednesday in the FA cup is definitely our worst moment this year.
Leeds: Going into the season with a manager who didn’t believe in having a plan.
I was more embarrassed by the 4-0’to Brentford than the 7-0.
I agree it's our worst! He 100% needs to go, but I can't see them sacking him, unfortunately...
Imo pathetically losing to Bournemouth was far worse than losing to Real Madrid, at least Madrid is a good team!
I wouldn’t say losing 5-2 to Madrid is overly embarrassing, Vini and Benz can pull any team in the world apart, certainly not the low point of our season anyway.
Southampton - Losing to 10 man Wolves after being 1-0 up, after which Jones said they were at disadvantage after Wolves red card
Mad that Liverpool have still inflicted two other teams worst points of the season.
Everton game away for Arsenal
can think of loads for leicester. the 5-2 loss againt brighton, the 6-2 loss against spurs, getting dominated by crystal palace for 90 minutes, conceding 2 own goals and losing against a very poor liverpool side on the night.
Losing to Tottenham, most embarrassing thing this season
Chelsea: Appointing Lampard
They not sacking moyes
Arsenal still playing Partey is a bigger embarrassment than Europa knock out
Villa - Stevenage at home!! Woeful!  Edit - my bad! You said premier league!! I was looking at an overall.
United's was definitely only beating Brentford 1-0. Christ, we are better than that
For Arsenal, It's gotta be everton loss.
Chelsea appointing fat frank.
Even though Nick Popes red and Liverpool game was bad. I'm still annoyed at drawing with palace 0-0 three times this season. Think our xg was 8 over the three games.
I was literally going to say our (Forest) one. Chanting “Champions of Europe, you’ll never sing that”, against multiple time (and current) Premier League Champions Manchester City when 6-0 down.
What a rollercoaster that game was
We scored 9 seconds into the 2nd half last season away to Fulham aswell but I wasn’t expecting us to go 1-0 up after 9 seconds.
If you think that was our most embarassing moment then you've clearly not seen much of us this season!
Gotta be conceding a hat trick to an out of form Son Heung Min in like 13 minutes... literally half the goals he's scored this season
Fuck I should’ve remembered that, would’ve found it funny but it happened to be against Liverpool lol
Bro almost scored a hat trick of OGs too.
Fuck I forgot about the Mina incident and the others you mentioned, all good examples
Lol I felt like I missed so much when making this post, I guess the FA cup loss to Sheffield is part of the Spursyness, but having a manager speak like that says a lot about the club
Plus the entire Nathan Jones era! He could’ve picked a ton of things for us.
Again, I couldn’t think of much for Soton off the top of my head, if I remade this post now the loss to Grimsby Town would be the worst moment  The Wolves game too but they have some quality players
My take from the list is that OP is a Southampton fan trying to slide last their whole embarrassment of a season
Ironic coming from a Newcastle fan.. no?
Looking at it now, the Playtime tweet is the most embarrassing Forest moment, I completely forgot about it
That’s a good mention
... Oh yeah. Still a relatively less embarrassing moment than certain seasons, and indeed I'd argue Cambridge last season was worse, but that was still quite a bit of a humiliation
I think the loss to Leeds at home and Forest away is up there too, Liverpool are usually a fortress at Anfield but idk what happened in the Leeds game
sheesh, for someone wearing a Chelsea badge you really take every opportunity you get to make fun of us, eh? Your negativity is radiating
Why is that so?
No it’s overall moments from each team, I mentioned some non-PL moments
9 seems like a pretty significant number for your club 😁
ha yeah plenty to choose from
That month was an absolute depression rollercoaster
You must've missed the part where I was hopelessely deluded because I thought Graham Potter wasn't the anti-christ.
This one is perpetually embarrassing.
Ah, well, yeah, Stevenage at villa park! Emery had just come in and there was hype around a ‘cup manager’… reflected well!
Pretty significant to Fulham too, once you include the above, the number of players they had left on the field in the FA Cup QF, the number of games that Mitrovic hasn't completed due to his ref push...
Lol
Brett Pitman one of our own wore number 9 aswell during the great escape season. 🍒
Only team I feel so far that sure to go down in Southampton. Points difference between 20 and 17 position is table is keep on increasing. Sad that they are playing visually beautiful football only to be let down by lack of quality finishing...   Based on Form Leicester and West Ham are too there.. But with their individual quality and difference of points between 14 to 19 is too less.. They can actually survive with just one or two wins here and there
My money right now is on Southampton, Bournemouth and, sadly, Forest. They have not been showing up lately.
The way we’re playing I believe we will go down unfortunately but it’s bloody tight so anything can happen.
I personally would feel really scared if we appointed anyone but dyche. But he has been there so many times I think Everton will be ok
Newcastle fan, nowadays i call it 'realistic' instead lol
Palace fan here. Our run in should see us okay. I really think for all teams that goal difference could be massive. Really surprised by West Ham’s performance. They we’re not doing too bad in regards to that but to loose like that could be massive on the last day.
Yes, 2/3 of the potential teams survive, but I think the point is that it could be any three of us. Everyone is equally capable of going down or surviving, that’s why all the doom and gloom.
I feel like half the replies in here aren't actually from relegation threatened teams. I'm pessimistic yes the emotional investment I've made only to be destroyed by shitting injuries.
I've had Bournemouth dead set for relegation but every once in a while they clamber out of there.  Meanwhile with Leicester throughout the season I thought they'd be quite shit but just not shit enough to go down.
I have my money on Southampton and Forest, Southampton are in very bad form where they only get goals from free kicks and Forest has got one of the hardest runs out of all the potential relegation teams and they have one if not the worst away form in the league.  Has for a third I can't say, I think we might be safe if we can pull a win out this Sunday against Palace but if not we also have a bit of a hard run so it could turn into another clenching end of the season for us.
I'm an arsenal fan but I hope Bournemouth stay up I really do we will loan you our rejects if u want.
What about big Sam lol
Hey thx for rice btw :)
We’re good at great escapes to be fair mate.
Drink it in mate
I hate this sport
Agreed, a lot gets said about the money but Howe has done a great job improving some of your players. Longstaff, Almiron and Joelinton look levels above where they used to be and I think we're now seeing the impact of him taking ASM out the starting line up for a bit and coaching him in a slightly different role. Plus, the money that has been spent has been spent very wisely - Bruno, Trippier, Burn, Isak... could go on!
Howe and recruitment been unbelievable. Look at Chelsea. Can spend money and still fuck it up.
Does anyone think champions league will hurt them moving forward?
Meanwhile ...
Even with the money spent, I think noone expected this. You play fantastic football, and I imagine you’ll just get better.  You absolutely shut us down the other night. Hats down to Howe.
I’m hating football right now
Fair play, Newcastle looks great rn
Toooooooooooooooon Army!!!!!!!! Congrats on this year's outstanding season
Yo lemme hold some o' them points?
Honestly you guys deserve it especially after the not-to-be-named previous owner. But we really got to get a win at St.James Park and that is the game I am most nervous about, especially after last season.
Enjoy the highs, endure the lows, sport is great.
I remember when this Newcastle team went toe to toe with City at the start of the season lotsa people were calling it a off game for City - that was BS. Newcastle has a good squad - that back 4 is solid and now they look very good up front too.   If Newcastle can spend smart like they have they will become title contenders in a few years.   Ngl I hate this ownership but one has to admit they’re doing things right.
Liverpool fan but happy for you. Big fan of Eddie Howe, who I hope will coach England at some point. Doesn’t seem like the owners have splashed crazy cash yet and you are already this good .
Genuine question, why are so many people supportive of Newcastle right now when City started their crusade in a basically identical manner?   Someone said above that Chelsea proves that throwing money around doesn’t work. I get that people will say it’s because of the allegations against them for FFP but City developed good youth players and did smart business before the allegations came out and they were still hated by most of the rest of the prem.
Fair play mate. You've had a brilliant season. Hoping we can have our derbies back soon because there's no way you're ever dropping down again
Happy for you ☺️
Right there with you. Been a Fulham fan since we landed in the UK in 2006 and will take top 10 all day long.
That Jacob Murphy chance that was saved, nearly one of the goals of the season, great play all around, Newcastle are saucing right now
Ah yes, the "and this is why i support Newcastle United moment"
I was hoping for Top 10 and a decent cup run, nevermind a final and possible Top 4 I still can't get used to it. It's been such a roller coaster seeing improvements in such pivotal characters that are from the Ashley era too, I'd written off the likes of Murphy, Willock, frustrated that was all we had on the bench, now its a breath of fresh air. Such an insane turn around.
Enjoy it.  I thought that when they hit the skids a couple of months ago that they woke up near the top and started believing the hype and forgot how they got there.  They seem to have recovered from that in the last few fixtures. BTW - Almiron is one of the players I really like.  It would be nice if you could help us out and beat Southampton, Leeds and Leicester and let us win.
Howe manager of the year
Newcastle has been a good watch that's for sure.
As a Chelsea fan how Staveley and co have handled the takeover and transition from the diabolical Ashley era is something Boehley and Cleargate should look at very closely.  Really good to see the Toon doing well again. One of the best stadiums and environments in the world to see a football match at IMO
Enjoy the win man. You and Man U are setting the pace for the top 4 and closing the door for the chasing pack. Huge 3 pct (more for Man U), I knew you would do it
It's been brilliant.  Long may it continue.
Great to see. I think the infesting thing is the success of the recruitment and the way they have brought such a variety of players not established names. Who’s behind the recruitment?  Compared to our situation at Forest I think we’ve also got a manager who’s a great coach and can get a lot out of players but we haven’t got the recruitment right and have taken too many risks.
I have loved the journey! Good luck for the rest of the season. Turning it on after a little dip is the sign of a strong team.
Really happy for you lot! 🙌🏼  Both Howe and the signings have been great. The football overall looks great too. The club finally looks like going in the right direction after all those dark times under Mike Ashley.
This is why sportwashing works. It doesn't matter who owns the club at the end of the day. When the club is winning, the fans are happy.
Amazing what blood money can get you
Enjoy your blood money from a country that doesn’t allow women to drive a car and chops up reporters who speak out against the regime.
[removed]
My US domestic squad has won the last two 6-1 and 4-0... I feel like I'm dreaming right now but it's been a helluva high to ride.
Rival fans used to love Newcastle as a great club with great traditions but they sold their soul to buy success with dirty oil money.   I think Newcastle will become hated just like man cheaty are hated
I’m not being salty here, I’m a city fan - it’s a little bit funny being in our position right now reading this post and the comments. Newcastle fans just giddy with joy and excitement, checking the table and seeing their name in 3rd, watching their highlights back beating Man Utd easily. Rival fans saying ‘people talking about the money, you guys are doing great and you’ve got to give it to Howe’. I get it, City are a lot better and have been doing this much longer so are winning a lot and everyone’s bored of it - but for angry rival fans suddenly suggesting it’s all about Howe and his excellent strategy of the wonderful recruitment as apposed to just being all about money is ridiculous. If it is for City or previously Chelsea, how isn’t it now? A raft of recruitment that clearly wouldn’t have happened under previous ownership now appears to just be good management and not money money money. By the way - I agree, that’s what City have been doing. There’s no mistake that British people watching the PL hadn’t heard of Cancelo, Dias, Rodri, Sane, Alvarez before they signed but turned out to be incredible signings, or that De Bruyne and Gundogan flew entirely under everyone’s radar but City noticed it and paired it with great management. And as a result, incredibly smart purchasing combined with incredibly good coaching has led to success. But I’m not wrong in thinking that in City’s case, everyone discards that and suggests it’s just pure money and that the club have bought our success. I have no doubt that when Newcastle win the premier league several times after Pep that everyone will hate them too - and that people said this about city in 2011. But still, it’s hypocrisy.
All it cost is the club’s soul.
Honestly mate i was hoping you guys do well this season enjoy while you can
Amazing. Howay the lads!
Only 100M spent. That’s nothing in modern football. Eddie is a fantastic manager. Congrats to all Newcastle fans.
Nah. You're not allowed to enjoy it, you were bought out by somebody who has at best very questionable human rights issues and despite you as fans having zero control over that you are expected to now turn your back on your club and act as bastions for human rights.  Enjoy yourself whilst you can because the second you actually win something at the expense of the established elite, the vultures are just waiting to pounce.
Yeah how long have you been a Newcastle fan?
Yeah how long have you been a Newcastle fan?
I am a Liverpool fan
I know they keep their form, would love to see them get top 4
I think the money spent has been smart.  Tip of the cap!
Get ready for the hate . Newcastle ruining football will be a familiar theme.
They are looking great 👍. Confidence is ripping out them
if you’re loving this season, wait till the latest one for “all or nothing” drops in august
It's great to see Newcastle bounce back after the shit you went through with Mike Ashley. People can bring up the money but Howe's been so smart with his signings and you can't fault your recruitment and how he's developed the players already at the squad. Really hope you get Champions League football, your fans deserve it.
Newcastle have had a good season without spending Millions unlike Chelsea 🤦 and as for Arsenal winning the League NO CHANCE.
Still have the best keeper in any final Karius
A lot of Newcastle fans came out of the grave after the Saudi takeover which isnt surprising considering the dire years under Mike Ashley.
Newcastle united fans are actually world class , travelling up and down the country in their thousands always making a noise. Respect
Signing Nick pope was outstanding.
Enjoy it cause football is wild. But for perspective, Liverpool, Chelsea, Tottenham have been absolutely rubbish this season. That has definitely helped.
It's absolutely fantastic and I'm delighted that Arsenal is currently winning the league hope you guys win the title this season
Same
Idk how a team like yours is in the relegation position.   Defensively you're horrendous, but the rest of your team is comfortably top 10 and higher standard.  Rice looks great, but surely you know its for the best if he leaves in the summer?   On a side note, I think you'll stay up, but cannot see Moyes lasting.
How are you guys performing so badly this season? You were a solid top 8 team for ages, you signed Paqueta and have some really class players, I'm ootl about what's happened, is it Moyes or are there other reasons?
What stands out the most to me in the signings is that Newcastle have hit on nearly every defensive signing from goal, left, center, right and even CDM. A lot of which should also be credited to Howe, because he has as system in place setting them up for success too. Perfect match.
I'm just excited for the summer if we get champions league football. Big summer ahead getting rid of deadwood and replacing them is gonna be fun. The squad under Ashely was stagnant for years with some utter rubbish in our depth. Matt Ritchie has some game time for us this season.
This could be a bit cynical, but I have a sneaking suspicion that Howe is going to be a victim of his own success. *Especially* if they get UCL this season, he'll be on a small margin of error and be gone as soon as they go on a run of poor form. They'll want a higher profile.   Which would be a shame, because Howe has just been fantastic. Who knows though, I could be way off!
Sven botman and nick pope absolute bargains
Totally agreed, I'm Chelsea and.  . .erm . . .yeah
I think it's way too early to say Chelsea fucked up, but it's of course a hot take because Potter was just sacked and they're in the bottom half. Personally, I think it's way more nuanced than that.  I actually think they recruited well. Fofana, Badiashile, Enzo are *excellent* signings. Felix has immediately improved them and gives Mudryk more time to settle. Mudryk will get better as the overall team form does and literally any team in the league would have signed him given the funds and opportunity to. Malo Gusto isn't even with the team yet. While in the dumps now, they could still have built what will develop into a dominant team given some time and the right manager.  I mean, did anyone expect U21s to fix the team in the short term? I think Chelsea new they wouldn't and were okay waiting it out, but Potter just couldn't hit that floor of minimum performance to keep the fans patient enough to see through the transition period. Kind of a shame to be honest. That I think they did F up, I can't fathom how bringing in Lampard temporarily is better than sticking with Potter.  The root of it all is they haven't resolved a #9. There aren't a lot available, so they probably felt they had to wait until the summer. Kai Havertz is a good player, but he's clearly out of position and bang average as a CF. Anyways, that's just my thoughts.
Still owned by human rights abusers tho
I think we will likely take a hit in league placing next year but it’s going to help a lot with FFP and will make it easier to negotiate with players this summer so I’d call that a wash short term with long term benefits if they land a few high quality signings like Maddison and Diaby
It effects everyone but we're slowly buiilding some squad depth now. So hopefully we can compete in both
Sigh
Howe somehow pulls all the right strings, and he's developed the hardest working side in the league.  Unbelievable job out of the front office to pick and choose nearly all of the right guys to bring in.   I don't know if management as a whole could realistically be doing better right now... It's been an absolute dream.
We'll let you have some points for jwp? 😂
No, shoo we need to secure our CL spot.
I know!  Instead of some Big-name managers, his appointment was almost unexpected after the takeover.  So surprised that he is doing this well
Possibly because people remember Newcastle competing for league titles and UCL football in the past. There's a sense of them being "back where they belong".  While for Man City, the last time they were competing at such a high level was before a lot of people here were born. There's no nostalgia involved in seeing them near the top of the league for most people.  Plus, a lot of the Man City hate came from Man Utd fans. It's understandable they'd dislike seeing City doing well more than Newcastle.
It wasn’t always this way.   It’s when we started winning so much. It’s the natural flow of the game. People don’t like dominance. It’s why United are basically disliked by everyone, less so now days but ten years ago either you supported United or loathed them. I remember when City won its first prem in 2012 with that moment, everyone seemed to be really happy for us, lots of other fans were happy for us.  So if Newcastle keep this up and start winning a few trophies then yeah the sentiment will start to change.
Wouldn't say it was identical exactly. City were 9th before their current owners took over. They had a top coach in Sven Goran eriksen and the previous owner had already been splashing the cash on players.  Newcastle were plumb bottom before the takeover with no wins in 14, Steve Bruce in charge playing dog shit football and an owner who'd made next to no investment in the club, and had isolated the fans. We were much more the underdogs with an underdog manager in Eddie Howe and in the UK, everyone loves an under dog!  Given how far behind Newcastle has fallen to the 'top six' in terms of money spent on transfers and wages, no one thought we'd be 3rd in the league 18 months after the takeover.  We've spent a lot, but did really good business. We've been sensible. The only player we brought in who's consistently played at the highest level and won things is Trippier, maybe Botman at a stretch. Compare that to city's first 18 months and they bought literally a whole new squad with proven top players like Tevez from man united, kolo Toure and adebayor from arsenal, Sylvinho from Barcelona, Patrick viera from inter, Wayne bridge from Chelsea, Robinho from real madrid, 21 players in total.  Howe's far exceeded everyone's expectations, and he's partly done it by getting the best out of the players already there and getting the new transfers hitting the ground running. He's quiet and thoughtful and pretty easy to like as a rival fan I guess. We play entertaining attacking football and St James park is a great place to visit. The atmosphere is electric. Back in the mid 90's we were everyone's second favourite team known as "the entertainers" so a few older fans might remember those days and see similarities to today's team.
The same people (who aren't Geordies) that are currently sucking Newcastle off will be the ones slating them if they turn into another City.  I'm happy they didn't go down last year, but I can't say I'm happy with things given the circumstances.. but alas my opinion is exactly that.
Everyone loved city when we were shite. Then we started winning things and the bitterness arrived
You say man cheaty developed good youths. Don't recall seeing many make the 1st team since being bought in 2008 so couldn't have been that good
Probably because when City first got bought, people loath another Chelsea who buy superstars to dominate the league. The splashing cash around is probably true for first few seasons.
He'll be runner up I reckon. Arteta will win it if Arsenal win the the title
Dan ashworth is the sporting director at Newcastle now and Steve nickson is the chief Scout currently at Newcastle. Dan ashworth is such a shrewd signing by the board brings experience and knowledge
Fans can be happy and still despise human rights atrocities? They're not exclusive.
I don't think this is really doing anything to enhance Saudi's reputation, is it? All it's really doing is causing more people to ask questions and become more educated on how the Saudi state operate. I haven't seen any Newcastle fans acting as ambassadors on behalf of the Saudi state saying "actually, they're not that bad".  Also - as the likes of Chelsea and Everton have evidenced - spending truckloads of cash doesn't guarantee the club will be winning.
Same for Man Utd and the Glazers. Only an issue when they lose.
I imagine the only time you’re concerned with ethically sourced products is when a rival football team is doing well
Knew it was only a matter of time before a retarded comment like this came through.  The blood money bought us Brighton's 2nd string centre back, your point?
Then you should stop watching WWE because they do business with the Saudis lol.
Their "blood money" got us Brighton's 2nd string centre back....
You want a pint of bitter
Let them be. It will attract more big name players to EPL. Just dont do it like Chelsea, half a billion zero results
But what success we haven't won nothing yet, currently in top 4 with smart business and good coaching. We had to spend some money to improve the squad
You are so obsessed mate. You comment all day is about City. Maybe secretly want to be fan. Who could blame you with Loserpool being run so poorly
Is this a Miguel Delaney burner account
Mike Ashley tried his best to get rid of it for sure but thankfully the soul is back and better than ever!
“While you can” will unfortunately be a very long time considering they have an ungodly amount of funding which they can exponentially funnel into the club over the next few seasons.
Where on earth have you pulled that number from? Isak was €70m, Botman was €37m and Gordon was €45m. That’s over €150m on three players alone.
You a man city fan? Newcastle have had Ollie Holt and Miguel Delaney attacking the club since the takeover and the fans. You learn to ignore them
Since I was kid I've been through the two relegations and the subsequent promotions  👍🏼
Newcastle aren’t city. We filled out our 52k seater stadium in the championship. Now on the other hand, how long you been a Chelsea fan? 2004?
We're not Man Utd fans, we don't just quit supporting a team for who ever is winning at the time.
Can you please talk to Eddie about that? I'm scared of you lot
I hate this comradery ugggh
this exchange is sooo sweet and wholesome, gives me faith in this sub
Hey West ham thx for rice appreciate it.
Rice is ours, thank you very much. He wants champions league.
I only watched the highlights of last night's match so I could be talking out my arse here, but it looked like the West Ham players didn't even care for most of the match. They looked so defeated
You might be right, our owners haven't really been tested by a bad run of form yet. They've been sensible otherwise but it would be too soon to say
I think and I hope you are wrong about Eddie Howe being gone soon. In fact the consortium that bought Newcastle last year knows that Eddie Howe is their most valuable asset right now. Howe has done a fantastic job with the talent he’s got and he’s built a foundation that can compete for the Title as early as next year.   If Newcastle can get CL football next year, that will be the massive attractive draw that could enable them to sign major players in the summer. I’m thinking of players like Declan Rice Mason Mount, Julian Alvarez, Ilkay Gundogan, Youri Tielemans,  Jude Bellingham, Ngolo Kante. They certainly have the means to sign some very influential players who are tired of their current teams but want to compete for trophies.
I don’t even think it’ll take a bad run of form tbh, when the owners have that much money & want success they’ll usually go for a higher profile manager anyway. 🤦🏼‍♂️
I wonder who Newcastle will sign in the summer window
Botman was a hidden gem but I'm surprised you got Pope so easily and cheaply, he's been a top keeper for years, I really thought there would be others in the race for him
Gordon though lol
Historically speaking, name me a club that spent 650m in 1 season(including a new manager) and did not reach the top 3/4 of their respective league. Honestly if you can answer that it would substantiate your argument better. Otherwise it's just 'future' talk and hoping for the best.
You've got it spot on with pretty much everything. I reckon things will get better as Boehly gives more power to the people who know football and a proper manager is established and is able to have a pre-season and get rid of deadwood.
I would agree with you - they are all good signings, and they will improve the team - just not all at the same time! Against Liverpool for the first time this season Chelsea really looked like a cohesive, attacking force - and I think it's no coincidence that Kanté, Chillwell and James were back as they made the whole midfield tick. Fofana had a great game TBF but you guys are screaming out for a striker.   Instead of spunking half a billion on FIFA Ultimate Team loot boxes you could have just offered Real £200m for Benzema - job done!
Your factual statement is not welcome around here
Good analysis. Thanks for the answer.  I hope it doesn't happen like that.  Hate hate hate.  This is a great season even with Chelsea in the lower half of table.
6 physical points and the 3 from our upcoming game and you've got a deal.
Fair points. City is one of the older clubs but didn’t have a huge glory period till now.
A club whose last trophy was 1955 “back where they belong”.
I think you’ll find if you do some research the city academy has been well respected for a long time. Since before the takeover actually.  Edit to add: I wasn’t just referring to academy players who moved into the city first team. I meant in general.
You say things 😂
Still not sold on arsenal winning it. If they dont lose the city game its theirs i imagine
Ashworth didn't come on board until the summer. He's been behind the more recent signings such as Gordon and Isak, but the initial five that came in last January were basically Eddie Howe and his team identifying targets and Mehrdad Goudossi and Amanda Staveley negotiating.  Ashworth's role is also in overhauling the development system and implementing a scouting system that will allow Newcastle to recruit and develop the best youth prospects. I'm sure he's being well paid, but his acquisition, as well as Darren Eales, the new chief exec, are arguably as important to the long term strategy as Howe, and will prove to be as important as Trippier and Bruno.
The avalanche of downvotes whenever human rights abuses are mentioned would suggest fans don't care and don't want to hear about it! That and mentioning money are sensitive topics fans want to ignore
>I haven't seen any Newcastle fans acting as ambassadors on behalf of the Saudi state saying "actually, they're not that bad".  Lol you must've missed the thousands wearing tea towels on their heads singing about how great they are!  >Also - as the likes of Chelsea and Everton have evidenced - spending truckloads of cash doesn't guarantee the club will be winning.  Using Chelsea as an example there is hilarious. They've literally been one of the most successful teams of the last 20years precisely because they've spent truckloads of cash. You conveniently leave off Man City
I’m all for ignoring your dodgy owners but by allah this is some fucking almighty stretch
Glazers haven’t really spent any of “their” money though have they 😂
It's human nature. Look at the Americans condemning the war in Ukraine while having no issue with their own invasions in Vietnam, Korea, Middle East and the like. It is easier to judge harshly upon others than to do so upon yourself
Nope, Big money has ruined football for me
Ignore the haters. Though my team (Liverpool) is doing so bad this season, I’m so happy for Newcastle and what they’re doing.
whatever helps you sleep at night
Good point.

It will kill the league  Man cheaty dirty oil money   Toon dirty oil money   Next man utd dirty oil money   These 3 will spend anything to buy success so other 17 won't be able to compete. The prem will become a super league for the oil rich.
Smart business lol  You're likely top 2 on spending this season so spending more than others increases chance of success, it's not smart spending lol
Oliver Holt maybe. One of them for sure.
That cunt is the one who sat in a room with Mbappe for 1 hour and was bigging up all week he was going to quiz him on human rights, then walked out of the room saying "there wasn't time" to ask him about it...
I have no idea who that is.
Mike Ashley at least wasn’t a sportwasher guilty of killing journalists and LGBT peoples.
No, I don't support any team in the premier league which gives me a non-biased nor bitter perspective on it. You'll be applauded for any moderate success, people like a fresh face at the top then the moment you actually win and win at the expense of teams that usually expect to win, you'll have the mouthpieces of those clubs come after you and then the social perception changes.   Exact thing happened with chelsea when abramovich first came in, everybody absolutely loved that period where chelsea were buying everybody and anybody, the duff/robben era, then the moment they actually won and reached the top of the food chain, the mood changed. Same thing happened to city when they got tevez/aguero.   I think its going to be a lot harder for newcastle, its never been so crowded at the top but should you lot manage it, it will happen to you too. And it will happen to the next team after newcastle that find themselves with new, very rich dubious owners.  I personally find it refreshing to see newcastle up there ahead of the likes of spurs, Liverpool and united and hope you make top 4 to shake it up a bit. Would love Brighton to join you too although that seems a bit of a stretch
Dang that’s honestly incredible. Happy for you man I bet this is a great feeling
and City didn't??
2004 would be a long time but I have been a Chelsea fan even longer. My family is from that area and moved to the states they are obviously Chelsea fans too.
Don’t worry, we won’t bother you for the title this season.  I really hope you win it.
Game's gone
He'll get it at Newcastle.
Yeahhhh West ham thx for rice I think he will enjoy north London very much.
They're in a weird position of being too good for a relegation battle yet finding themselves in one. Every other team around them is prepared whereas West Ham find themselves from qualifying for Europe twice in a row to this.   It's a totally different mental battle they have to fight. Often happens to teams who aren't the Sky 6 when they get European football. It's just extra strange because they are in their second consecutive year of Europe
Watched the full game and this is bollocks.   Rice, Paqueta and Antonio did very well and did not give Newcastle midfield a moments peace. Some awful capitulation to high pressing and Newcastle taking their chances is where the score comes from  West Ham actually have a decent spine, but they are not playing as a team- which points to coaching. If you wait to move Moyes on then you risk better players leaving in the summer nevermind the fact you lot have Arsenal, Liverpool, Man Utd and Leeds as final home games. Get Potter in I say
N'golo Kante??? Gundogan??? Bellingham??? **Alvarez???**  &#x200B;  What fifa level signings are these?
Honestly, in all his cameos so far Gordon has looked great. He seems a Howe type of player and at 22 he’ll still improve.
Name me one that spent that and did finish top 4. Has any team spent that in one season? Unfortunately, Chelsea do have brilliant players and we have followed the league enougg to know we can never write them off. Them being top 4 next season won't be a surprise
Potter unlucky that Kante has been out injured this entire time too. Would things be different with him available? We'll never know, but it felt like a dominant game over Liverpool in the midfield tells us it could have bought more time.
We all saw Liverpool and Man U fans twerking for Middle Eastern owners when the rumours were abound. Both sets have supporters have seen incredible success in their lifetimes too.  We just wanted Ashley out
We'll give you some of our points for Lavia. Never mind you already got all 6.
1969* and we were always around CL places before Ashley and but not winning trophies.  We are around CL places with no trophies.  What point are you trying to make here lmao
We’ve been leading the league for so long, people think arteta shouldn’t win manager of the year if we get second. If we had been in city’s place all year he’d be getting the same plaudits as Howe because nobody expected this from us. Now anything but winning the league is seen as failure. Manager of the year should be the manager who wins the most manager if the month awards, surely that makes sense?
Typical scouser
Its just not the right forum IMO. I can't speak for anyone else but myself, but the downvotes I think are more to do with it being a lazy go to response, when people want to talk about football.   I love my team, and football in general. I don't love the atrocities that countries/large scale companies/mega rich are guilty of.   I can feel both. The world cup in Qatar, for example, I really enjoyed the football, but it doesn't mean I turn a blind eye to the horrendous approach to human life. If anything, it highlighted the abuse and means I personally will never go there.   I will never go to Saudi. But I won't abandon my enjoyment of my boyhood team that I've watched for 30+ years.   Ultimately it seems to stem down to the current polarising approach.  Todays society likes to think everything is black and white (pardon the pun), but its far from it.
Over 1 billion pounds on new players and new Managers. Shit owners, lol.
I sleep fine knowing my team has gone from fighting relegation every season to 3rd.

U want success u need to spend.
Looking at Chelsea I would say spending a lot and getting results must be considered as good business
Is LiVARpool 1st? Even you spent more. According to transfermarkt, we spent some 185m euros(Botman and Targett from January last year included, 130m without them which should be taken in consideration).  Meanwhile, Liverpool last 2 windows(where we spent 130m) spent 137.5 mil. So, more.  That's without Chelsea and others.
Might be wrong but Merhdad (Iranian), Jamie and Amanda (British) haven't murdered anyone and LGBT people are allowed to enter St James Park as they wish. Mike Ashley on the other hand used his warehouses like Modern day slaves and used sport to solely promote his company for his own pockets!
Best you close all your social media accounts, then, son. Saudi oil money invested in all of them.
Man city stadium capacity 2007 was 48,000. Your highest league attendance was 47,000. Your lowest was 21,000 (pathetic) and your average was 42,000. So no, you didn’t. Off you go now
That’s good for you. Can’t say the same about 90% of your fan base.
He means that Arsenal still have to play us. Dropping points could cost then the title. Especially as they still have to play City.  EDIT: Spelling
Not scared of Newcastle to steal our title mate no chance ,just that we have to visit St.James.  It will be poetic tho to derail your top 4 hope like you did to us last season.Karma 👀
But he would get it better at Arsenal. And besides, who wouldn’t wanna join the title winners?
Fair enough mate, as I said I could be wrong. They just seemed a little lacking in enthusiasm in the highlights
These are simply some top quality players who are at the end of their contracts and will probably be available in the summer. Except for J.Alvarez whose contract situation at City I don’t know ( they just got him though). I rate him as simply one of the best Forwards in the world but he’s playing behind arguably the best #9 in the world right now ( Haaland). Alvarez deserves to be a regular stater for a top team and he’d fit right into that Newcastle lineup. Heck their team shirt design is so close to Argentina’s design.
That's fair, but agree to disagree. I have a hard time looking at a 60m fee for a forward-playing player and calling it "successful" only to not see them contribute via goals or assists. He's never shown a propensity for that, or even passing for that matter. Have a look at his stats. He's literally bottom 1 percentile in multiple passing + assist categories and bottom 15% or so in another dozen.  He fits Howe's system very well, he's the definition of tenacious and you'll see him pop off the charts on pressing and defensive actions, but but he needs to become more dynamic than a skillset so limited to only just that. You may as well throw a full back up there for less than half the cost. That and with such limitations his value to the team could drop significantly if it ever changes.  Shrewd business was Everton clipping him for 60m and hanging on to what would probably have cost 20m in Dwight McNeil. Have a look at their stats and watch him play. He's a very similar mold of player, also a pacey and a defensive minded forward-playing player, but has one of the leagues better crosses and corner kicks. His hype died out of the media with relegation and Lampard, but he's already looking much improved back under Dyche. He's only 1 year older.  All that said, it's just for fun. I could be wrong, I'm not a scout or a professional in any context. Might have a point or I might also be eating a big fat humble pie in a year or two!
In 2009, Madrid spent about 250million(in current inflationary transfer spending terms it can easily amount to twice that) to buy Galacticos. Pretty sure they finished top 2 immediately.
Another PL example: in 17/18 Pep spent around 350-400mil, broke transfer records and went on to win the league immediately
But I’m pretty sure Newcastle fans berated Chelsea, Man City and PSG when they spend and we’re successful  Can’t keeping hiding behind “we just wanted Ashley out” Your owners are probably the worst of the lot
“Back where you belong” my fat arse. Overinflated sense of worth.   Say this for City - the tie Dan’s went with them when they had the shit times. I’m old enough to remember how empty St James got.   Oh, the Fairs Cup. How could I have overlooked that…  Runners up in the PL…twice. It’s not exactly a pedigree, is it?
Who cares about manager of the year? Harry Redknapp has one.
Not sure how
Yeh what I meant was it’s not really their own money 😂 they borrowed the majority of the money for the takeover & then used money that United would of made whether they were there or not. Shocking owners who’ve thrown a lot of money about in the wrong places 🤦🏼‍♂️
aww cute
How does that justify murder?
I'm telling you the league will suffer with so many oil clubs. Transfer prices will sky rocket because those 3 will overpay to outbid each other which will drive up fees for everyone else.   Other countries will increase transfers fees as they will want as much cash from the prem as possible and other teams will suffer.
You wouldn’t be where you are now if you had Ashley still owning the club, don’t act like you’re not spending money. You’ve just not fully unleashed the purse strings yet, that will come in the next few windows
Sure the PIF has no links to the Saudi royal family.   On a unrelated note I’ve got some magic beans to sell you.
The fact that you're trying to make Mike Ashley out to be worse than the Saudi state is crazy.  Ashley is a cunt but I don't remember him executing 81 people in one day
Congratulations you’ve acknowledged that there’s no ethical consumption under capitalism. Now join me in overthrowing our capital overlords.
maine road??? also off i go where? you really think u said something important? damn
Yeah. It would be great if you guys just rested your players for our match. Give your u-13 team a chance.
Pay city? Haven’t they got enough money already?
Will**
The ghost of Tiote (RIP) is coming for you lot
Not really, you haven't been in the Champions League for years.  Granted he would choose Arsenal over Newcastle atm, but wouldn't say we're far off.
Yeah sorry dude calling bollocks was a bit harsh- it’s surprising sometimes just how much of the story highlights don’t tell
Highlights didn't do them justice, we went up 2:0 in 15 minutes through no small part in a bit of luck, when we went back 2:1 before half time I was genuinely nervous as West Ham played well for quite a bit of the first half. The third goal at the start of the second half just sunk things though I think, I don't recall them being much of a threat after that but I may have had a few cans by that point xD
Bro it was 40mil not 60. Not trying to say it like it’s nothing but 40mil for a promising 22 year old English winger isn’t crazy today. Also McNeil is nowhere near as dynamic as Gordon and you can’t just teach that
Fair. I just know this shit is only temporary and they'll be yet another team competing for top 4. They have a bad season every so often but they'll always bounce back. Bastards.
Yeah we did tbf   I guess being hypocritical is pretty universal
‘Old enough to remember how empty St James park got’  Aye pal it was full in the championship.   There was a boycott in the latter years of Ashley but there is a massive amount difference between a boycott and not turning up.  Before Ashley started asset stripping the club we were in Europe pretty much every other year since the start of the prem.  Competing for Europe (which we are now) is arguably where the clubs natural place is.   You keep referencing a lack of titles but nobody is saying competing for titles is where we belong, you’re arguing against something you just made up.  Who do you support btw
So were you livid when they brought back Ronaldo/Pogba, for example?
Hilarious. Would you stop supporting your club if the Saudi's bought you out?
How does that justify you actively supporting child labour?
Yep, it's happening now. The ticket will increase too so as per pay per view or tv rights.
He claimed we're top 2 spending this season, which isn't accurate. We even spent less than Liverpool, lol. However, even these shrewd signings wouldn't be possible with Ashley.  I agree we wouldn't be where we are if Ashley was still in charge, in truth we'd probably be fighting for the title... In Championship.  It's quite possible we will spend big in coming windows, in the summer if we get CL, but let's wait and see. I wouldn't take everything for granted with authorities tightening the grip on financial affairs of clubs. Let's see how FFP works on us. I doubt short term heavy spending will make stable CL team of us, it's too much of a gamble, see Chelsea or Everton.   For all our good transfers, we also had few misses and owners will surely be cautious, that much we could see so far. Don't forget we have facilities to improve too, so nothing is going to happen over night.
True but that's because Ashley was terrible. He hired his mates to do jobs they weren't qualified to do. He starved the club of money, he told players they could use the club as a stepping stone to other clubs if they done well. Theres plenty other reasons we done badly under Ashley, but I'm not sitting here listing them all off first thing in the morning. Ps look at the managers we had, steve McClaren, alan pardew, steve bruce, joe Kinnear, and john Carver. They all sucked bug time, and not even championship clubs would of took them at the time, barring steve Bruce, but that was because he was constantly bigged up by his media mates.
Of course they do. But I hate to break it to you that almost every major company and government do significant business with Middle Eastern Countries, including Saudi Arabia. We're no different in that respect. Unless of course you think Middle Eastern money is inferior to say, American money (nation that's bombed more countries than they've had years of existence). In which case that's a you problem.
Thankfully neither our chairman, board members or anyone at the club have murdered anyone so you can rest easy.  I'm a football fan not a politician. Mike Ashley ruined my football club, the current owners are doing everything possible to repair the damage. It's quite simple and I make no apologies!
Which alternative system do you suggest?
 ‘Newcastle fans shouldn’t support (consume) your club after the take over’   ‘But you consume xyz’  ‘Ahhhh but there is not ethical consumption under capitalism’  Every time man
Based
One night only... THE RETURN OF STEVE BRUCE!
Pay...back?
And you haven’t been in the champions league for even longer then us. Your point?
Too true, I guess a 90+ min match can't be perfectly summed up in 2.5 lol
You're correct, 40m plus add-ons. Got mixed up when he was previously linked to Chelsea for 60m! Cheers.
Oh, it’s not the lack of titles, it’s the lack of anything. You don’t get to airbrush the Ashley years out of existence and pretend they didn’t happen.   A club with an overinflated sense of self.   My teams in the Championship, with a perfectly nice ownership team who, at the last count, weren’t linked to a human rights abusing murderous regime. Unless her cream cakes has a hidden trail of bodies somewhere.   I don’t like your club. I don’t like the way your fans have embraced the Saudis. And I don’t think you’re a “big” club.
Not at all, was pissed off that he ended up leaving for free again.
I barely support "my club" as is it is now. So yes. I don't enjoy watching football as much as i used to.I don't care if they win lose or draw now.
I’m not supporting either. But you can’t respond to murder saying oh but your phone’s a product of child labor. Right?
Im a Liverpool fan and I'd love it if us and the other non oil clubs boycotted the prem to create a non state owned league.   If the premier wants to continue adding state owned clubs to the prem tarnishing the reputation let them have a 3 team league and the other 17 will compete separately.
There’s a difference between “Middle Eastern money” and money that directly comes from the crown. And yes I would have the same energy if George Bush, Dick Cheney or Raytheon owned a football club.
I propose a society based around The Shire from The Lord of the Rings.
I didn’t say Newcastle fans shouldn’t support their club. Just that the soul of the club has died.
I'm saying neither of us have been in the Champions League for ages.  You may win the title, but you cannot complete with majority of the teams around you wages-wise and you'll likely revert to going back to top 4 being your only goal.
ah sorry forget we arent allowed to celebrate a good season because Sitheref0874 thinks we are 'a club with an overinflated sense of self'.
You do in an argument on where the club’s natural competing place is as he didn’t seek to compete even without putting money in.   That’s fair enough, absolutely your right to
When they initially signed you thought they were a bad idea?
Why?
Actually I can. Because it’s pointless. I’m not supporting either. But I’ve been a Newcastle fan my entire life. I’m not going to stop being a Newcastle supporter based on who the owners are. The same way we’ve been raised in a society where we know the products we buy most likely weren’t produced by the most ethical standards. But we’ll still buy the newest iPhone or the latest Nike’s. The world is a complicated and murky place. I highly doubt you were an avid advocate for Saudi human rights pre takeover. If you were then fair enough but in reality half the people on here aren’t able to point out Saudi Arabia on a map, yet they try to instigate with crap like “blood money”, “oil money” etc.
I can hear the song.   If there's a heaven, that is it.
I’ll trust you that there’s no subtext then but you should see the amount of times that conversation plays out on R / Soccer
… we have a team average age of 24. We have amazing talent. We are not going to revert back to “top 4 only” we will continue to compete for titles. Saka, Martinelli, odegaard, smith Rowe, almost certainly rice, so much more talent, and your telling me that we will just go back to top 4 being our only goal? You know nothing about football clearly.
You should learn to fucking read, as I never said that.
Nah, why would I of, he was brilliant at the time but most players we signed were more for how much money they could bring into the club rather than contributing to success on the pitch. The owners are the problem & always have been, they were never prepared for the day Fergie left, they’ve always been clueless about football but great at business
I completely agree. I’m a Spurs fan. I hated City fans for some time when they started winning from the oil money. I’m a hypocrite too because I hated the fact that they won not that their owners abuse human rights. Tomorrow if Spurs get bought by oil money I wouldn’t stop supporting Spurs either. But as a human I would want these states to be answerable for their crimes and we can start somewhere. If through sports we can boycott them I’m all for it even if it means my team plays poorly. I don’t know man. It’s been a long day
You have a good core, would be a real shame if Man City came along and took them from you, like they have done many times before...
cry
Na, you guys have incredible owners and should be grateful for the amount of money they have put into the club.   If you had even 1 year of Mike Ashley, you'd quit football or support Man City instead.
Sure of course. But the reality for better or for worse is that we have very little to no impact on that stuff. Currently the uk and saudi are trading partners and on good terms. The only way anyone will make these states answer for the things they’re doing in their own countries is if they stopped producing oil or there was no need for oil. It’s sad but true. That’s why I don’t waste my energy with these political things and try to act like a white knight. Reality is I was a bit jealous of city for their takeover, I did call them a nothing club which they really are. Both things are true. But I never really concerned myself with what their owners did. Or what abramovich did. Idk, I just think it’s all a waste of energy unless it’s to get under rival fans’ skins. Which most of the time that’s the motivation behind these comments.
40 is the "magic number" but teams get away with lower hauls all the time.   The minimum to not get relegated in the past 5 seasons has been 36, 29, 35, 35, 34.  Technically, Bournemouth can still manage 54, so only City and Arsenal are mathematically safe.
I'll probably relax when we reach 40.
Usually it's bout 40 but this season it's looking like it'll be round mid 30s
It's usually 40 but it all depends on how well everyone else does
Usually I think 35
39
Based on maths rather than reality a team could get 63pts and be relegated. Therefore 64pts would guarantee safety.
at least 101
40?
It’s relative to what’s going on in the table amongst the bottom half— but usually 30 to 40 unless the bottom 5 or 6 are just dreadful and it’s all between 2 points and they’re all below 30 etc etc — it depends on what’s going on— I remember when tottenham was bottom last with 11 points after like after 8 to 10 matches. Appointing H Redknapp changed all that but the point is— it’s unpredictable as Fuck
Not exactly, because all the other teams between them also cannot win every game as they play each other. Anyone below Chelsea are at risk this season which is mad and exciting. But the more teams in the scrap, the lower the number will likely be.   You’re spot on that the traditional safe number is 40 but you hardly ever need that many to stay up. This season my bet would be that someone will get relegated with 35 points, what do you think?
It's usually mid 30s
2 Wins with our run in does not sound so bad. I still think we would want 38 as opposed to 35 though
Not this season.. I mean look at how tight the whole relegation scrap has been this siz.
40
I believe Boehly would like to have a word about being out of the risk zone.  Didn’t Lampard take Everton from 12th to 17th?
I thought it was around 40 my bad 🤦🏻‍♂️😅
True mate and because of how many other clubs in the relegation battle this season 35 should be enough
Well points per game for the teams in 17th and 18th (27 points) is about 0.93, which over a 38 game season would be 35.38. So it'll be about that number I reckon.
40 is the points total teams at the bottom will aim for as this pretty much guarantees safety. So you'll often hear 40 being the benchmark even though mid-30s is actually more accurate.
I knew I wasn't going mad 😂
How bad were West Ham? Saw a bit of the saints game and they were really poor. Not to take anything away from your boys of course.
We've got Bruno in the middle...
Saint maximin is class 👏👏👌
Heyyyy Callum Wilson!
Score line doesn't show it. But we were absolutely horrendous for the first half of the game. One of those rare games where we actually cash in on our xG. Hope we've got plenty left for Brentford!
On the one hand, I don't like your owners and what they've done and represent (and I'd also like to make it clear that, had Roman tried taking us over in recent years rather than when I was 9, I'd be against that too).  On the other hand, I'd been rooting for Newcastle fans for years to be rid of the fat parasite, so I can't help but feel happy for you to be back in the upper echelons. Probably comes at the expense of us, but there's an argument that we've had our time in the sun.
Loved the Trippier/St Max cross field link up.   Weirdest 5-1 I've seen, we weren't at 100%, but was great for Wilson, Isak and Big Joe to get their goals. Good to see Targett back.
Terrified of Newcastle killing Arsenal's title chance just like top 4 last season.
UP THE PREMIER LEAGUE WE GO!!!!! love that fucking chant. On to Brentford!
Good on ya! We played shit, and it's just getting worse for us 😂
I’m behind Newcastle . I like the whole morale, look and function of the club . And yes the chairman is a wealthy Saudi business man but I wish Liverpool was like this .
It’s actually E I E I E I O * :’)
Brilliant game
I read the title to quick because I thought the title of the thread was "O I L, up the league we go" 😂
"Spending blood money, ignoring Yemen.   So next season, we play in Bremen.   Dead journalists on the floor,   We don't care if we make top four."
UMAI EMERYYYYYYYYY
Grew up with this chant, singing up the football league we go. It always seems odd to hear "Premier League" instead, really doesn't work.
Title should be I 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 for how much you'll likely spend in the next 5 years with dirty oil money
Proper small time song this usually reserved for the lower leagues. You'll have to get yourselves some better songs if you stick around the top.
We were appalling.  I mean this as absolutely no insult or to take away from Newcastle, but 2, maybe 3, of the goals we literally gave to them with poor mistakes. Could've easily been a lot more goals from them too, they ran circles round us
West Ham were actually the better team in the first half tbh. They just made stupid mistakes and gave up after our 3rd goal.
Very bad
Don’t worry you have *checks notes* Frank Lampard coming back?!
LOL
State of this. World record fee for a keeper, world record fee for a defender, £85 million striker to make it over £200 million spent on forwards in 12 months, £100 million midfield duo of Keita and oxlade chamberlain consistently sat on the bench and you're 8th. newcastle are 10 points ahead of you with Jacob Murphy on the wing and longstaff in midfield.
I like Moyes but wow he’s doing an appalling job with that squad
Thx for Declan rice :)
Yeah just seen the highlights. Pretty poor mistakes, especially Fabianski at the end (not that it really made much difference overall)
You act like chelsea is playing any better dog lol
It could be worse, we could have tried to convince Avram Grant to come back, or someone most of us dislike, like Rafa (though I know you lot love him).
Bought coutinho for 12.5m and sold for 142m which bought Alison and VVD. 85m striker? You mean we've paid 51m so far and we sold Mane for 30 and Minamino for 15m so your 200m is actually 6m.   That's called good business and not selling our soul to a human rights disaster country.
Yeah same, he seems like a lovely man and was doing so well last season I'm not sure what happened - it's like he's suddenly lost. I think Noble leaving had more of an impact than anyone expected
Not sure you're getting him but sure
No, I don’t. My team playing bad doesn’t mean I can’t see how shit another team is. Sort your feelings out
No, i mean the £85 million striker. I'll educate you, basic accounting principles tell you that under the concept of prudence, you must assume maximum expenses and liabilities instantly. This means the £85 million striker is written down as the £85 million striker from minute 1. Doesn't matter how much is paid upfront or what the clauses are, until he's sold or there's literally no possibility he can activate the clauses  he's £85 million. This is indisputable.   I'm completely baffled as to how you can take £200 million, deduct £80, £35 of which has just been proved to be incorrect and get 6. I'm afraid I can't help you with that one, that's a special kind of mathematics only you can comprehend.  If newcastle fans are selling their soul, they should sell it to you, with your grasp of numbers they could make enough to buy back their club from the Saudi's.
So City have a lower net spend in the last five years then any of the big six, guess we’re just really good at business.
Thanks. Are the players still playing for him? Think he’ll keep his job? You have a squad that really shouldn’t be struggling so it’s hard to see why you’re down there.   Guess it’s a combination of players levels dropping and the additional midweek Europa league games?
I have no feelings at this point

Basic accounting lol   Everyone knows that a contract is phased over time. Liverpool paid a down payment of 51m with other payments when requirements are met. If those requirements are not met we don't pay extra so your "basic accounting" is all wrong as everyone knows you don't pay something that isn't required to be paid. Therefore he is as it stands a 51m player for which we  paid with sales of Mane and Minamino and didn't need to be sportswashed by a country with severe human rights issues and our club as a result isn't owned by a state.   You stick to your Barbie dolls
Good business lol  So just to clarify man cheaty were purchased in 2008   From 2009 onwards they're being investigated for dodgy accounts   Since 2008 your owners have used fake companies to over inflate your earnings spending 1.6B+ of outside cash on players. After spending that much cheaty had a squad worth around 2B so now when they sell players purchased by corruption and cheating it is classed as a profit where in reality man cheaty net spend since 2008 is around -800M. When was your first profit under Sheikh Ma Wallets? Around 2020? So 12 years of constant losses and you think that's good business 😂😂😂😂😂😂   I wouldn't class that as "good business" I call that cheating to buy domestic trophies and severely underperforming. 1.6B and no CL and only 1 final 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 good business 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I personally can't tell if he's lost the dressing room, or the team are playing to his tactics and it's not working but he's not changing them. Don't think he should but reckon he's staying till end of season now, each week I think 'this has gotta be the straw that breaks the camels back' and it never is.  I think so, I think Nobes leaving we lost a huge sort of managerial angle that Dec isn't really ready to step up into. Plus he is clearly leaving this summer so heads not in it. That and the midweek games and a lot of injury, but we're easy to predict now
Mate you’re owned by yanks. They don’t exactly have a sterling humans rights record 😂
Fuck me, I cannot imagine being this wrong and actually thinking you are correct, This is the purest form of delusion. I know accounting, you don't know how to count, sometimes you just need to accept other people know more than you and learn something.   I'll educate you one more time, then I'm going to have to start charging you as youre clearly a special case and even the basics are beyond your grasp. What you're referring to is amortisation, that deals with how an asset is written off in the balance sheet, what I taught you, was how an asset is valued, these are two separate things. He's valued as an £85 million asset to be amortized over his contract length via the straight line method. If clauses are not triggered then amendments to the balance sheet are made upon the end of his contract or sale.   This is all standard practice, anybody with basic bookkeeping knowledge will confirm all of this whilst laughing at how wrong you are for somebody that's so confident they're right.
We really get under your skin don’t we.
Well they only need someone to get them to the end of the season and let’s face it, they’re not going down and they’re not getting into Europe so why not someone who at least knows the club   I’m sure if their number one target was ready to join now they wouldn’t be doing this..
Hahhaha
Makes absolutely no sense to me. Why bring him in to be a caretaker? You've already got a caretaker FFS.   He was sacked because he had Everton going down but he's the right man to see Chelsea out for the year?   If any Chelsea fans want to clue me in please do but I'm scratching my head trying to figure out how this makes sense for anyone involved.
This is tremendous only in the EPL can a mediocre manger fail up.  Chelsea only 9 points above relegation scrap tho
Imagine having so much money that you could pay 3 coaches to coach. Why not keep potter as a dead man walking.
oh dear, so they sacked a champions league winning coach, now a person with less experience than sacked potter... scraping the bottom of the barrel?
Sorry. Is it me or is the absolute madness.   Surely there are better interim managers?
Ahahahhahahahahahahhahahahhahahahhahahahhahahahhahahahahhahahahhahahahhahahahahahahahhahahhahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahahahhahaahhahahahhaahhahahahhahahahhahahahhahahahahahahahahhahahahhahahahhahahahhahahahhahahahahhahahahhahahahhahahahahahahahhahahhahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahahahhahaahhahahahhaahhahahahhahahahhahahahhahahahahahahahahhahahahhahahahhahahahhahahahhahahahahhahahahhahahahhahahahahahahahhahahhahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahahahhahaahhahahahhaahhahahahhahahahhahahahhahahahahahahahahhahahahhahahahhahahahhahahahhahahahahhahahahhahahahhahahahahahahahhahahhahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahahahhahaahhahahahhaahhahahahhahahahhahahahhahahaha…..  Nah, but seriously, this is very funny and Chelsea are getting relegated…
Failing upwards
It's from Frank, to Tuchel, to Potter and back to Frank! LMFAO!!
Yeah the season is lost so bring in Lampard and at least we know he will have the locker rooms respect. BUT, why the hell would you not just let Potter play out the rest of the season? 🤷🏻‍♂️
This seems spectacularly dumb. I think he and Stevie G are destined to be on the same path. Great players and lousy coaches.
Never go back in football. It usually ends in tears.
Fucking hell Chelsea what is tb doing to you all.  Madness.
Boys I'm back to win the champions league.
They’re just trying to get to the end of the season. Performances don’t matter at this point. They just want time to plan for their next appointment.
Now go beat Real Madrid please
papa is back baby!!
Todd Boehly masterclass, make Chelsea the worst of the top 6 so he would get free publicity whenever they lose to Bournemouth at home
They’re definitely putting a scapegoat in place
LMAO
To quote The Simpsons, " No, no, dig up stupid"
At this rate Chelsea is single-handedly keeping UK's job numbers up  Kudos Richi Sunak
4th times a charm?
Frank is too much of a decent guy to take that poison chalice once more, loyalty or not
Scenes when Lamps wins the UCL
Now at Chelsea, Lampard is on a mission to repeat what he did at Everton. I'll take that
Why on earth have they brought in Lampard lol. He was only sacked by Everton recently. He’s suppose to improve things is he? Am I missing something? He could get them relegated.
🤣
>they only need someone to get them to the end of the season  We already had someone and we sacked him.
>so why not someone who at least knows the clu  Because he already showed not only in Chelsea that he is noway near good enough. Is this srsly a question? We are talking about million euros business.
We don’t have a caretaker. We have Bruno who only recently became a coach under Potter and has never been even assistant manager.   I’d much rather have Lampard take us to the end of the season than Bruno.
I think the rationale is to get a quick little PR boost with fans off the back of vibes.   Its a very weak and poor rationale, but its the only one I can come up with that isn't "They're braindead"
Bruno Saltor already showed in the Liverpool game he's not good enough. The guy took 80 minutes to make an attacking sub when the Liverpool defence was barely defending. That 0-0 was a loss in my eyes. I can't remember the last time I saw a Liverpool side that poor at the bridge and he was happy with a draw.  If Frank can just give a morale boost and use some common sense it's a plus. For a few months I couldn't give a shit who comes in just get away from this Potter mid table 'the boys gave everything' mentality.
I expect Chelsea to name the new permanent manager in the next few weeks. With Frank there till end of season it protects the new manager by giving them a clean slate for the summer transfer window, preseason and new start in the fall.   Say Enrique or whoever joins in two weeks and bombs the last 7 games. Fans would already be all over them and a dark cloud would hang over the summer into the start of next season. Chelsea is setting up the next guy to be as successful as possible and not make the same mistakes they have recently made.
It doesn’t make any sense, you’re right. It’s a joke. He had Everton in the relegation zone.
the teams below won't all pick up 9 points
12 points
He could put Chelsea in the relegation zone. Why in earth have they hired him?
4 soon i reckon, watch this space..
It’s madness
Exactly my thinking
Judging by that display the other night, I'd be more worried about your club if I were you...
They should appoint Gerrard as well, they can be co-managers together.
Gerrard was really good for rangers
Gerrard did have success with Rangers though. Beating Celtic’s streak and getting a decent way in Europe.
Tbh, this will bring decent vibes till the end of a season where we have truly been in the mud, a man who is well respected by the fans and players who idolized him growing up, I’m not sure it could be too bad till the end of the season surely
Then why sack potter
Well yes but that can’t or won’t be undone now so why not?
poter?
I know but somebody has to manage between now and the end of the season.. as I said they aren’t going down and they aren’t getting into Europe so they only need somebody to manage the team I doubt at this point they care about where in the league they finish
Yeah...I can see that. Shame that we're grasping for a rationale here.   Also, you lot deserved something from that match yesterday. I'd heard your finishing was dreadful...but wow.
call me a sceptic if lampard doesn't win or only 50% of the final games even temporary he could be sacked again as well.
I'd rather have Klopp as a manager than Lampard (this is in the abstract, obviously we are the last club that would ever have Klopp/Klopp would ever go to IRL)
Lmao seriously. .2 expected goals is shambic. Our future is much brighter than theirs
That’s true, but the Scottish league is just not the same, and Rangers are always up there.
For the fans, to show a reaction. Also so as not to attempt this search for a replacement in secret. And possibly on the basis of a performance stipulation within his contract that allowed for an easier/cheaper termination.
better question why hire Potter in the first place ...
It can't be undone but it doesn't change that this string of decisions is absurd
Some body? Yes. Some body taht proved he is not good enough? Hell no. Like, Lampard is not the only possible in the world.
Now with Lampard, their defense will be dreadful as well.
>Also, you lot deserved something from that match yesterday. I'd heard your finishing was dreadful...but wow.  Story of our season so far
Yup and could put Chelsea in the relegation zone
And going forward I'd rather have Chelsea's squad and owners than Liverpool's. Lampard will be temporary.
You missed the part about Europe. And Celtic did have like a 10 year streak prior to Gerrard. Calling him a lousy coach is quite ignorant in my opinion.  Edit: Lampard also had success in the championship. Seems like you don’t realise the world of fotball exists outside the top six teams in PL
Our fans are stupid so that's not a good reason
The club was trying to avoid finding a new gaffer behind Potter's back, seems like it was mutual respect that led to Potter leaving now. With the amount of leaks that have come out of Chelsea recently it would have been made public that Chelsea was courting another top manager while Potter was still in the job. Not a good look if you ask me. With Lampard we can properly interview a long-term replacement while the boys will get to know what it means when a legend's name is chanted at the bridge
Yes but who? What talented manager is going to come in, manage 9 games then hand over the keys   It’s got to be someone who needs to up his stock, like Lampard
I dont know, there would be thousands of manager in english football. Do sou believe that no one would také it? To manage PL and CL?
And which one with better experience and knowledge of the club than Lampard?
I dont know, already answered. But your logic is stupid. Lampard failed. He knows it, Chelsea knows it, fans know it. He knows the club? What does it even mean? New owner, new everything. Completly new starting XI.
Owner and players don’t make the club.. I’m not disputing he failed, I’m not even saying he’s a good manager. I’m saying it literally does not matter who it is to see out the season, it has to be somebody.  You still haven’t given me a name, you’re so outraged by Lampard getting this job but you can’t think of anyone better?
If it does not matter, it can be someone Who is not a complete failure as manager. Or if it really does not matter, I will do it.  Btw I answered twice that I dont know. I dont have books with english managers that are available. PL teams sacked like five already just this season f.e. Almost every ex player is free since they all suck at it. Hello guardiola, exception.
I love Rafa, and I get why the Everton board hired him as he's made a career of turning chicken shit into chicken salad. Was never going to work given the history though.   That being said, the game has past him and his tenure at Everton proved it. His mentality is old. His tactics are old. And he never was a player's manager.   Love the man, but he needs to stay on the couch.
hasnt managed for 4 years. thought he retired
Hahaha. Please be Martin O'Neil. A few weeks back in a thread asking who could potentially replace moyes and Rodgers, I jokingly said Harry redknapp and Martin o'neil. This would put me one step closer to being the fucking oracle.
This is so fucking embarrassing.
Might as will get Big Sam ??
Come the morning you can probably get Allardyce back in at West Ham too.
With due respect, he’s one of our greatest ever managers, and we’re linked with him every single time we have a vacancy. Doesn’t take a crystal ball.
Martin O'Neil might mean Roy Keane returning as assistant manager under him.
I'm not claiming I predicted it, as I said. I said it jokingly, the joke being they're both long in the tooth managers who have been out of the game for a long time now and you don't really see them getting back in anytime soon but despite that you know their name will come up should a vacancy be available.
Most likely infinitely better than watching the prem in the uk
Which means they are going to win the champions league
Kante would have played 4 home games under 4 different manager this season. Fucking legendary stat 😭😂
Mate, are you not a Chelsea fan? This right here is calm waters compared to last year when we were swimming in sanction waters.
When your 5 seasons into a career mode 😂
Chaotic in the PL, if you consider all Europe, that title belongs to Barça
This time last year we were saying the same about United.
Southampton are a poor man's Chelsea then.   - Stuck with manager over the summer who had lost the dressing room and split the fanbase.  - Spent £100m on ten new players.  - Finally sacked the manager after a dozen games.   - Hired a complete nobody, possibly the most deluded and arrogant manager in English football.  - Sacked him after 8 games.   - Spent another £60m in winter window.   - Bottom of the league and going down unless a miracle happens.  - But, despite all this, we still took 6 points of Chelsea. Kind of lol.
Chaos FC, the campions league trophy is looming again
They make us look like a well-organized machine, which is an incredible feat.
Juve has been relegated due to cheating, managers year over year, and could very well be relegated again.   The whole Red Bull saga, the whole City football group saga.   Everton having never been relegated.   FC Hollywood.   Barça levers.   Anything that happens in Millwall or Napoli.   Rangers.   The India football federation.   …  You’ve a narrow worldview.
They will win the champions league again just to knock fourth place Tottenham into the europa league. It was hilarious last time it happened.
As a chelsea fan, a year ago I was worried the club might not exist in 2023.  I’m just happy they’re still around, but maybe I’m speaking too soon.
"Arguably worst coach in chelsea's history"   Chelsea have been relegated 6 times. They were relegated as recently as 1988. Their pitch used to be lit by the car park. They were relegated in 3 straight decades. Let's get off the hyperbole. Potter was a bad choice for their club. Unfortunately they will recover eventually.
Chaos and trophies baby. I’m so tired :’)
Least hyperbolic post in r/PremierLeague.
To quote u/Adam-Miller-02  QPR  Leyton Orient  Charlton  Bolton  Wigan  Huddlesfield  Macclesfield Town  Bury  Birmingham City  Yeovil Town  Rushden and Diamonds  Ipswich Town  Cardiff  Watford  Notts County  Derby County  Reading  Scunthorpe  Oldham  Gretna  Darlington  Wimbledon  Coventry  Leeds  Crystal Palace  All those clubs have had much worse times in the last 10 to 20 years than Chelsea are currently having. I would kill to have Blues in the UCL, spending 100s of millions and in the prem. Yeah maybe they're not meeting expectations but it's sure as shit better than being in a relegation battle for the 8th time in 10 seasons, not to mention the owners who supposedly have debt to the triads which if you didn't know are the Chinese Mafia
We need Jose Part 3.
Call me crazy but Lampard becoming caretaker might work out. He seriously overachieved the last time he managed Chelsea, could make a late run to try for Europe. That said, Real Madrid just hammered Barca so good luck Chelsea.
We could easily have two more managers by the end of the season. You’ve seen nothing yet.
Everton don’t exist then?
Sacking tuchel for potter will go down as one of the most bizarre appointments of all time.
A bit chaotic? Yes. The most chaotic club in recent years? Absolutely not. You’re only 11th let’s not get ahead of ourselves
You’re god damn right, chaos fc baby. Bet we get another European trophy before the other London clubs. Churn and burn is the Chelsea way, money, managers, it don’t matter
It’s even funnier because Tuchel originally came in to replace Lampard. Boehly really turned this football club into a comedy club.
all is very true, Chelsea are in a strange place, but Enzo has been class and beyond worth that tag. If we can find a way to FINALLY finish chances it will be a very different team.
It’s been a wild ride since Roman got the boot that’s for sure but still have that UCL win in ‘21 which feels decades ago now somehow tho
 Only comment I have in Chelsea this season is, watching Boehly and co running the club is like watching a 5 yr old assemble a jet engine.
Last year it looked like we might be going out of business entirely, our owner couldn't dock his fucking yacht anywhere to get a WiFi signal, we couldn't sell tickets to games, nah man this is just a bit of a wobbly table leg right now, last year all our dinners were on the floor
Are you not entertained?
They’ve got an incredible trophy cabinet in recent years. They’re just going through a bad spell. Spurs on the other hand..
They are still small club.
So ummm, I’m not happy with our situation, but jeeeeeeeeez
Too much money  Too little class
Boehly is clueless
Thank you Chelsea from taking the focus off Liverpool for the laugh of the season.
I know its a Premier League thread but Barcelona take that title. When you actually look at how that club operated its absolutely insane.
I am delighted to watch Chelsea be a dumpster fire, but I do think that Potter was thrown under the bus
I'll take your Chelsea and I'll give you my Tottenham
They are a joke for sure
It’s what happens with a new rich owner taking over and wanting to set the tone. Chelsea went through it when Abramovich first took over. Man City went through it as well. Even Fulham went through it when the Khan’s came to town. The only team going about it quietly is Newcastle.
It's chaotic but man that team can win an UCL .. it's a Rollercoaster!!
*Laughs in spurs fan*
I’d say United was far worse, and they still haven’t recovered. Chelsea just won the champions league
Big 6 clubs when they have a single off season in mid table :  wE’rE cHaOtiC!!!11!!!1!!!  Honestly fuck off.
Valencia and Seville would like a word
You couldn’t write this it’s mental.
My sweet summer child.
Boehly has no idea what he is doing. Giving Americans bad rap
Enzo Fernandez was worth every single penny. Seeing him in a Man City or Real Madrid shirt next season would've hurt. Potter should've never been appointed or sacked in February. Frank Lampard is coming because Bruno didn't want to be interim in the first place and our players lack encouragement and our fans lack passion... plus we have nothing to lose other than a Champions League semi-final. Pretty normal for Chelsea if you ask me. We thrive in chaos.
Most successful English side since 2000
There's about 15 clubs in the football pyramid more chaotic, you've just got the title of shittest in the big 6
Some day when we're good again, this sub will have 0 posts per day.
Chelsea are not even the most chaotic team in london
Making jokes and calling it chaotic doesn't cover up how vile and deplorable they are as an organisation
And I fucking love it.  We somehow succeed in chaos and I’m hoping that means at least a champions league trophy 😂  Long shot but look two years ago
One of the best managers in world football having a final 6 month record worse than lampard? Why do people adore tuchel so much. He’s not even top 5 managers we’ve had.
Im just hoping they appoint Frank as caretaker and he does well so he gets signed on full time before their ultimate demise
Leicester won the epl most recently than Chelsea did and are fighting relegation
There's about 20 teams in the football pyramid who are run worse than Chelsea. Get a grip. You've had one bad season. Some teams are literally on the bring of going out of business
Lol at worst coach in history, you don’t know Chelsea’s history there
Sacking Tuchel was the best decision they could have made since he absolutly ruined the squad with 300m spent. Thats the point of this season people are somehow ignoring. tuchel is one to blame the most. Yes, Boehly is weird, winter was stupid and so was sacking Potter, but they basic of all of this is compelte fuck up from Tuchel in the summer.
Its interesting to me where the OP started and didn’t start with the criminal Putin invading Ukraine causing the UK government to freeze the club and force our owner into selling. Which brought down all stability at the club and led to Marina, Cech, and Buck to leave and Boehly to come in and make terrible signings during the summer window. The very window that opened later for Chelsea than other clubs due to the freeze and sale causing players like Raphinha, Kounde, maybe even Lewa to not sign as early as we could’ve signed them without the freeze as they signed elsewhere. Not to mention us coming in late to the game incentivizing other clubs to put ridiculous price tags on their players we bought from them with only two weeks to work with in the window.   This was the true start to our most chaotic and perhaps most unlucky season i’ve ever season. Potter was dealt a bad hand with all the variables that took place this season, but yes he also made mistakes. Already looking forward to next season with Nkunku and hopefully Osimhen and a better goalie + Nags as our coach 🤞
Of all the madness that club has done since Boehly took over, never in a million years did I think they’d bring Lampard in!  Man oh man is that club in trouble. The soap opera continues.
First question is, do we think he will last until the end of the season? Does anyone know if there has been a professional football team that's sacked 3 managers in one year?
Larcebona
If they aren’t producing an exclusive Netflix tv show
Went to the Arsenal-Chelsea preseason match in Orlando. Arsenal won 4-0.  At the time it felt like a shock result, but it really was a sign of things to come.
Idk, I remember the ban because of some weird transfer shit back in the day around...Gael K something lol. Then all the drama due to the perpetual manager carousel...  I would bet that amongst the top leagues, Chelsea have had more weird shit they've been involved in than a lot of other clubs, haha
I wonder about Chelsea and all these long term player contracts to get around FFP.  I mean most clubs have a player who's not good enough for first team but they cant get rid of them because they wont take a drop in wages at another club even if the club is happy to sell at a loss, but Chelsea could have a dozen. So all these players on the books, then if they want a new manager of note, he'll want his own signings, so this issue may start as soon as next transfer window.
You know the thing about chaos? It's fair.
Chaos is a fancy way of saying embarrassing
😦
Thanks for the inside scoop news update. Also, the grass has been green this season.
Loaning out a proven striker and then not being able to score goals is hilarious.
Chaos is a ladder
And I’ve never been more proud
Looks like the team is going through a lot.
Chaos and trophies. Usually.
Pulisic and Mount about to take over
I think they could lose 4 out of their next 5. Tough run of fixtures for them to finish the season.
Chaos is a ladder

No...just no  Try doing 2 back to back relegations
Wow, that does sound like a lot of chaos! But don't forget that every team goes through ups and downs, and Chelsea has a rich history of success. It's important to stay positive and support your team through thick and thin. Who knows, maybe Lampard's return will bring some much-needed stability and success to the club. Keep the faith!
You identified all of that chaos and poor decision making but you think Potter is the worst manager of all time for not being able to organize that chaos?
With the Lampard interim hire, I’m assuming Chelsea is going to take their time and try and hire a coach like Zidane in the offseason.
To be fair the last 2 transfer windows about 80 percent of those signings were made for the future rather than the here and now. Some of them are already playing but it’s important to point that out.
Would argue with the past comment. The funniest part was literally everything before now in the season
Outside of the shopping spree. I get the lampard hire but at the same time it’s insane. But you can’t push and bring Luis Enrique in now, seems like the top guys have demands and will take time. So do they stay and risk getting worse placement. Tough decisions being made for sure. With the right manager this squad will be dangerous next year. They’re stacked. They might even benefit from not playing in any big tournaments. That’s the only reason arsenal is doing so well. They’ve been on vacay all season just focusing on the premier league.
The chaos is really why I watch.  It is completely wild to me that they are in a position to win a CL.  Anything could happen.
Us chelsea fans thrive on chaos.Trusting the process is boring
Almost makes you miss The Special One
please please please Lampard win all remaining games. Ole 2.0.
Wait til you hear about another club called Tottenham Hotspur
Indeed. Even if you tried to do this in the Football Manager game it would be too difficult and look ridiculous lol. Hope they find the meaning of football again.
Welcome to the Circus of Chelsea Fc but it always works
Mudryk should have went to us imo
how have you spent £300 million and have absolutely nothing to show for it
Frankly, it's a cluster.
Super Frank orchestrating a masterclass against Madrid with half an hour of prep time  It's written in the stars isn't it?
I remember 2012 UCL Finals when Roberto di Matteo lead The Blues in winning the Champions League against Bayern. He won it as a caretaker manager!
I mean both of their champions league wins have come in seasons where their managers have been fired.
That’s truly one to remember for future quizzes
THAT is a fucking stat
I’m curious if this is a record for most consecutive games with a different manager each time. If Kanté plays on saturday, history could be being made
Dude would be so lost
As in, he will get injured after one game?
I was getting worried that we weren’t going to have any drama heading into the final part of the season.   Chaos FC reigns supreme
Yes, but that wasn't our doing. This... We brought to ourselves.
Supporting this club in just the last two years alone has been a lesson in surrendering to chaos. I try to explain to friends and family who could care less about football all the plot twists and hurdles there’ve been, but end up looking mostly like that Pepe Silvia meme
This is the thing. I would rather have this chaotic season than the existential threat of last season any day.
Yeah my first thought was "wait untill someone tells him about last season"
My 5 seasons?
A different kind of chaotic really.   We need a chaotic cup. All the insane teams in Europe can come together and play for it
Chelsea are chaotic neutral, Barca are chaotic evil
For real - this subreddit just mines golden drama from whichever club is in turmoil or something — every club has issues or drama or chaos lol it’s just  brought to your attention because that’s what the media does
Ward Prowse fk took points off Chelsea
The other day, I was watching some classic Chelsea matches.  I had no idea JWP had been in the league since at least 2013.  10 years and he hasn’t left the club yet.  If you guys get relegated, is he good enough to find a transfer?
Remains to be seen. It is quite possible that Spurs next managerial appointment process also is full of drama.
Nah, well organized machines win trophies.  Chaos has reigned supreme for us over 2 decades.  Trophies haven’t escaped us, nor will they.  The terms “Spurs” and “organized” will never be synonymous.
Convinced Millwall blow the chance of a playoff every season, for the sole reason they exist to manifest chaos. Prem would stabilise the mayhem
Pretty sure that these days it'd result in 5 English teams in the CL.
To be fair, I don't think Spurs will get top 4 in the first place. It'll be funny to see United getting the rug pulled from under them.
My prediction of finishing 9th firing a coach and winning the champions league is coming along nicely but I wouldn't say that was especially bold of me.
Chelsea winning the champions league was anything but hilarious and I’m an arsenal fan. Awful club.
Tbf they should be liquidated and profits sent back to the Russian people
This. Can tell the OP isn’t aware of what Chelsea were pre-Abramovich.
Had to scroll surprisingly far down to find someone pick up on this bit. I assume OP has only been around for Abramovich era onwards if they think Potter is close to being Chelsea’s worst ever coach.
It's about expectations though. John Hollins likely didn't cover himself in glory in 87/88, but if you're handed a bad team you can only do so much. Look at Everton, you could stick prime Pep in charge of them and they'd still be where they are.  Potter was handed 600m worth of players and ended with a negative goal difference. 6 months doesn't make you a bad manager and I'm sure he'll do well elsewhere, but finishing with an average 1.27 points per game (relegation form) after all that puts you in the conversation for worst ever. Yes there were issues at the club and they weren't his fault, but 600m + 11th + -1 goal difference = in conversation for worst ever.
There's levels and expectations. Do you think Sean Dyche was a terrible manager last season when he got Burnley relegated?  Chelsea haven't really been a big side in English football until Abramovic came along.  They were realistically smaller than Newcastle at the time but on a decent run, which is why they got bought.  They had one league win, all the way back in 1955, three FA cups and a league Cup. That's it.  The standards for a Chelsea boss were much lower back then.  Potter had a £300m summer, okay he wasn't manager for it but they still spent that cash, then they spent another £300m in January. And he was still playing turgid football.  No Chelsea manager has ever been given that many resources
Yes but when crazy stuff like almost coming back happens I fleet energy from the chaos.  I’m also getting giddy at the thought of us stopping arsenal from winning the league like we did to Tottenham in 2016
And you didn't even include Brighton, whose plight caused FA rules to be changed about what chairmen can do.
"Hi Jose, here are 17 players i just bought for you. Good luck."
You need Jose part 1.
To be fair, we beat Dortmund who were on a 10 game win streak while we won 4/19 matches at the time of the match so if anyone can beat a team in good form it's us.
There had to of been some serious issues with him and the relationship breaking down with the ownership for them to bin tuchel.
It’s the Abramovich way mate - old mate Todd ain’t Abramovich. You got the burn part right though, he’s burning it right to the ground.
I guess it's been chaos since the start of 2022.
Small club with 5x as many Premier League titles as you.  And before you say "boo hoo, football existed before the PL",  A) We're in the Premier League sub  B) It's the metric by which pretty much everything in the modern game is now judged.
I'll take your Tottenham and give you Brighton.  (depending on how we define recent history).  Although, I guess Brighton have more trophies than Tottenham over the last 30 years, despite having no proper home ground for a good chunk of it, and being on the verge of bankruptcy.
How are Newcastle going about the original post quietly. They’ve not spent any of the insane amount that Chelsea have, but have brought in good management and strategised their future sustainability.
Giggles uncontrollably in 2 European Cups.
Man United fans after conceding a goal   Get the yellow scarves out
It's mad how, given they have the most money and consistently have the most success, big 6 fans seem to have the biggest meltdowns
Glazers would like a word
American owners already had a bad rep with running football clubs tbh
No. There will be extensive discussions about why Bruno did not get an 8 match ban.
Disgusting mockery of a club, always will be
lol not all of us will fall from grace as hard as Yanited did.  tough cookie
How ?
Or stairs to the ultimate demise??
Mason Mount revival with a game winning goal in the second leg against Real lmao
The Lampard vs Tuchel semifinal is also written in the stars
That was brilliant, only slightly marred by being forever tainted with Gary Neville’s commentary of “OaOahoAhoHoaaaaaaaaaa” in the high pitched mancunian squeak
Wow, do you remember something that happened the whole of 11 years ago?
Won it at the Allianz of all places.
Both of Chelsea’s CL wins came during seasons nobody gave them a hope to win it. 2012 was particularly interesting because the spine of that team should’ve won it long before then, and by the time they did it was a spine of 30-somethings just past their prime
And a PK slip away from happening thrice. Though I am 100% sure that is 2008 does not happen, 2012 does not happen
This season we fired our manager twice. We gonna win ucl twice this season.
we reaching pub trivia statistics
it has to be, surely for a player at the same team and in such a short time span.
maybe an injury prone watford player has more
The only context for a stat like this is   1. Extremely unlucky with injuries   2. Plays for Chelsea
I just call us Circus FC.
Two years? I would say twenty.
Lampard coaching resume I think!
Mate we were owned by an oligarch
Every time you think they’ve pushed the limits of negligence and immature management they somehow outdo themselves. A huge part of me wants to see them continue to lie and deny whatever controversy they’ve got going in the future, if only because it’s funny seeing how they’ll twist themselves even further
we need a circlejerk for this sub
It's drama from whichever big club isn't in the top six. How dare Brentford and Brighton and Fulham have better seasons than Chelsea
The media loves targeting Chelsea.
He's not a top 6 player, imo. Villa wanted him season before last and seems like a sensible option for him. Think if one of the big boys goes for him, he will just end up a bit-part player, and his career will fizzle out.   Would become a club legend at Saints if he stayed and tried helping us come straight back up.
If we hire Nuno to finish out the season I’ll agree with you
It 100% will be. But for now I’m gonna pretend we have a whole plan that just hasn’t been revealed yet.
They changed the rules? I haven't paid attention for a few years.
If Spurs finish 4th, Chelsea win CL and Man United win the Europa league as well then it would knock Spurs out of CL and into Europa
Unless they win the europa league. But yes, I agree it would be hilarious.
Tottenham fighting for fourth place and getting the rug pulled from under them isn't funny?
Lol
In a moral and just universe, yes of course, same with all billionaires and/or crooks to their communities of origin. But as it is - what good entertainment. (I’m Russian, all the 90s oligarchs are scum, to make it worse they were encouraged at the time and their dirty money welcomed with open arms..)
 yikes
I am going to assume, those coaches that got relegated didnt spend hundreds of millions
> but if you're handed a bad team you can only do so much  Almost good awareness there.   Potter was handed a bad team. It doesn't matter how much they're worth. They're worth that much because a moron owner who doesn't know football paid that much.
chelsea only started with those expectations when they were purchased with russian blood money. Prior to that they were a club that got relegated about every 10-15 years.
Tbf we have no idea how Pep would do with a team on a smaller budget as he’s never managed a Team that wasn’t backed with ridiculous resources.  I doubt he’d wind up 16th though. I suspect they’d be mid-table but not in the mess they’re in now.  In this situation the owner put Chelsea in this mess. It’s very evident that he was more swayed by what he’d read in tabloids over what he actually knew. Boehly is clueless he made all the wrong decisions and though the style football on the pitch is not his fault the hiring of the manager is. The best thing he could do right now is put someone in charge who knows what they are doing on every level and sit back and shut the fuck up.  In the 20 years of Ambramovic never heard a syllable or saw him jumping in front of a camera. He just put people in place and told them what he expected. And they delivered.   Simples
It’s Boehly who is spending the money. The business Chelsea have done since he took over has been absolutely bizarre
It’s not Potter’s fault Boehly overpaid for shit players
We shall see
You don't have 5x as many league titles as Liverpool. You are deluded.
You need a lesson in maths and what X means
Hey can y’all believe Mitrovic got 8 and Bruno got NOTHING?! I can’t believe it!
Coming from a fan of the club literally playing a rapist every game.
can’t hear you from 11th
Oh my bad
I put Mount in my FPL as soon as the news broke.
Chelsea will lose to Real
Love to see that lol
Goalgasm
Some stuff you just can’t forget
I always liked that the old guard got themselves proper send-off.   And if I remember correctly, Barcelona was slowly coming down from their first peak, United had bad season by SAF standards and Madrid were still in the process of becoming powerhouse.  And entire Italian football was in decline.  So why not Chelsea :)
Won it at the Allianz of all places as well.
Should have happened in 2009 too.
It's up there with Ronny Johnsen getting a winners medals in four consecutive games.
I just meant you don’t have to be a lifelong Chelsea fan to have experienced utter chaos. The last two years alone have had enough twists and turns to last a lifetime  Truly a roller coaster of a club that’s decimated my cortisol levels to bits. But I wouldn’t choose anyone else to support; lows, highs, and everything in between
I thought this was the circlejerk
It’s the same picture
If you do get relegated then James ward-prowse has to leave cuz like he is too good of a player to be playing in the championship imo.
Close Poch is going to finish the season for us temporarily
Yeah you need two teams to qualify through both European cups now. It got changed when they added europa CL qualification in I think, probably because it was actually quite likely a team won Europa without being in the CL
Nop, the top 4 remains, if United win EL being out of top4 it it will 6 english teams in the next UCL.
Only knocks Spurs out if they're 4th and Man U finish 5th in that scenario though, which doesn't look all that likely.
I guess that would mean Newcastle have the rug pulled then.
Not for that awful club who essentially ruined football winning anything.
I’m sure they didn’t, but I doubt Potter is responsible for most of Chelsea’s scattergun transfer business during the January window either.
True because Chelsea have bought so many people over the last two transfer windows that it doesn't give time for the squad to gel you can't expect potter and his players to just magically have a good team spirit that imo is what they were lacking.
Mate, that team should still compete for europe
A bad team by Chelsea standards, sure. Maybe even mediocre, though a lot of those same players won the CL less than 2 years ago. 6 goals in 2 months bad though? 1 win in 12 at one point? Come on.
Your blood money comment is very funny given your username because everyone in Russia knows Arsenal used to be part owned by Alisher Usmanov. There’s people in my family who used to work very low down in his companies, who had to compile investment reports for the higher ups, which included Arsenal’s performance!
Wise words from a wise man
Potter brought his entire team over, including the Head of Recruitment from Brighton, so it's definitely on him and his staff that he has a bunch of players and uses them incredibly ineffectively
What's 5 x 1?
Do you remember Samuel Eto'o? Marcos Alonso? The nonces who worked for chavsea and ran the academy for years? Do you remember your sugar daddy? I do.
What?? Who???  (New to football and know nothing about Arsenal)
Smart
By all accounts one of madrid, bayern or barca should've won it that year. That real madrid team was arguably better than the 3 peat team, but just got unlucky in the champions league.
Yes. But I wouldn’t trade the 2012 campaign for a win in 2008 or a win in 2009.   It was a culmination of every frustration, every heartbreaking elimination, from Liverpool, Barcelona, United in the final, it was a true underdog story. I feel blessed to have lived through that feeling twice, once with Greece in 2004 and once with Chelsea in 2012.   The feeling that there is something that just will not allow you to lose.
Yeah you'd think. Grealish stayed with Villa for three seasons in the Championship though, so it's not unheard of.
Poch won't accept a temporar job
Nope. Max teams from one league is 5.
What do you mean? Arsenal and City are in  Which leaves Newcastle and Man U, if Spurs makes top 4 it pretty much is Man U 50% of the time whose place they will take
Not when we finish 3rd 😉
You don't seem like you'd be fun to watch a game with.
I haven’t heard Arsenal fans chanting for usamanov to return though. We were 29% owned and he had no voice. So it’s not even remotely the same.
Usmanov didn’t ever contribute a penny to Arsenal. He just owned a minority stake which. It could have been the King of Wakanda holding that’s the and wouldn’t have mattered a single bit.
The head of recruitment wouldn’t work immediately. At Brighton it was about identifying talent before they reach their top potential. Chelsea need ready-made superstars. We’re not fishing in the same ponds so there will be very little overlap in terms of recruitment targets.
Chelsea were also underperforming before hiring Potter. Potter failed to turn around an already sliding club; he didn’t catalyse, cause, or exacerbate the slide Chelsea have experienced over the last 12 months. The start of the Ukraine war actually initiated the slide in Chelsea’s fortunes because it dislodged Abramovic who had obviously proven a capable owner. Boehly in comparison is clearly clueless when it comes to football. Ultimately the owner has the cheque book and therefore holds final power to authorise transfers. There is no method to the squad he has enabled to accumulate
Maybe his staff aren't experienced enough to be working in the big six.
Partey who plays for Arsenal raped a woman but isn’t able to be prosecuted due to a technicality.
Grealish was absolutely desperate to leave, he had failed transfers to Spurs and Manchester United
I get what you mean but grealish was young so of course he would want to stay there and grow as a player but ward prowse is different he isn't young and has so much quality he doesn't deserve to play in the championship we could get him or rice if you or West ham go down.
Duh, yes. That's what I get for posting too early.
He's saying if Chelsea win UCL and United win europa then you won't get UCL next season.
I found it hilarious, let's watch a game together
If he had 29% he had a very big voice, most companies don’t like selling 25% because having a quarter ownership gives you a seat on the board
I didn’t say it was exactly the same. Just funny to see Arsenal fans complain about Russian money.
Whatever helps you to sleep at night. I'm sure he only owned it for vibes, not any financial gains.
>Chelsea were also underperforming  They were 6th after like 4 matches.  It wasn't a great start but it wasn't atrocious.
He clearly wasn't desperate. He signed a new contract in 2018, while Villa were in the Championship. If he'd wanted to leave, he could have gone on a free.
Yeah I agree. Villa are a bigger club than us too. I'd be happy for Prowsie to have a shot with a top 6 club. He's absolutely deserved it. Stayed loyal to us when all around him jumped ship every summer.  Just not convinced he would cut it.
Unless we finish 3rd
We can watch the game on Sunday! There's usually a game thread on r/gunners so I'll see you there!
I’d love to watch with you and /u/beefshitz
We didn’t want it though. While chelsea fans absolutely do.
He owned it in the hopes of getting full control but Kroenke shut him down. Best to do some research before commencing nonsense.
I’m not sure they asked for it originally. Thus far the new ownership has been shit, hence the chanting. They’re not exactly chanting for Putin or Russia, if they were I’d see your point.   Your club has benefitted from “Russian blood money” quite significantly, I’m not sure why it’s hard to accept. 30% stake isn’t exactly insignificant. Usmanov was the richest man in the UK and in Russia at various points
He sold the shares for £550m after only investing £75m. That’s pure “Russian blood money”, multiplied, straight into the pockets of one of Putin’s long-time favourites. I’m not sure why you’re in denial about it. Everyone in Russia knows about Usmanov and Arsenal
Chelsea fans chanted for abromovich to come back. It’s well known.
I went to Chelsea-Brentford last year. Two months after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Chelsea still had Russian flags up over the advertising hoardings. A spectacularly cunty club.
Yea but Arsenal as a club didn’t get a penny of it. It was all money moving from Billionaire to billionaire. One reason Arsenal had a lost decade was because it was under spending on transfers. Kroenke is a stingy guy.
I don’t think you actually read what I said
>Alisher Usmanov.  Plenty of Arsenal fans wanted Alisher Usmanov to take the controlling share of the club over Stan Kroenke. It's well known
Do you have any pictures? Happy to be corrected. What is an advertising hoarding? And generally, are there any accounts of Chelsea fans chanting for Russia to win over Ukraine?
Simon Jordan, you can fuck off with that trash.
Ah, talkshite, the pinnacle of hard hitting journalism
Breaking: manager could get sacked if he hypothetically has two bad seasons
Watch Klopp win the league next season
Katie Price said that?!
Talk about stating the obvious
When did Katie start reporting on football?
Nah they won’t
I swear Simon Jordan pisses me off more than sir Alex used to do during the 90s.
Don't you tease us like that, top 4 will do nicely
The team who keeps a clean sheet and scores the most will definitely win the game.
after the shit behavior from your fans yesterday klopp wouldn’t touch your bottom club with a 10 foot pole
The forwards will sort themselves out. Once you get a solid midfielder you will be grand
Michael owen?  Is that you?
always the victims
Probably need a couple tbf. Thiago is injury prone, Fabinho needs competition/rotation and Henderson is physically finished. Keita’s guaranteed to leave and Ox  is probably gone as well.
go fuck yourself
You should steal players from relegation threatened teams tbh.
rattled
the worms are waiting u shithole of a human. go find them
same old scousers 😂
Revisit this discussion in at least a year from now, if not two.  Way too early.
Let’s be honest, none of these players are worth the sum that they go for. No one is worth these sums of money.   I’d argue Enzo will live up to the price tag that Chelsea paid for him. I think he’s the next superstar midfielder, he’s put in great performances for a Chelsea side that’s been poor this season. You also have to remember when you pay these sums you aim to have them for 10-13 years. Also it’s only been 2 and a bit months since he’s joined, give him time if you don’t think he’s been good but who’s been good on Chelsea this season? Not too many guys.   Imo Rice is slightly overhyped, hes great at what he does but if he was any other nationality he wouldn’t get the hype that he does. Is it another Zaha situation where it’s a big fish in a small pond?   FDJ has had mixed seasons at Barca, Amrabat only really got hyped going into the WC and is 5 years older than Enzo, Kante been injured a lot recently but as shown yesterday the best DM in world football when healthy, Tchouameni went for a lot and again is older.
If chelsea would have waited they would probs get him cheaper in the summer, but the competsion to sign  him would also have been huge
Have you been watching? His ability to hold the ball in tight spaces has been remarkable. The number of balls he’s played past the back line is incredible given how poor the players ahead of him have been.  The price tag was huge, but he’s 22 and they have him on a contract for 8 years. He’s already completely refreshed the midfield from some Jorginho staleness.  What else do you want to see from him?
I feel nobody should be worth $100m unless they’re one of the legends in their prime, like M, R, R, N, you probably already know who I’m talking about just by seeing the initials. Everything is so inflated nowadays, kinda worried about the future of football.  But on topic wised, Enzo is still pretty good. Definitely one of the better players in that squad right now.
Patiently waiting ❤️
I tremendously agree with you, no player is worth all that money. But given the players image rights and sponsors and all that, the club owner make Bs if a players is making Ms.   Enzo is not the next Lampard i promise you that, he does not have the quality and the persona of one. Even the reward of the youngest talent of WC was not adequate, other players shined throughout the whole cup but they were not south american / european to get that reward.   I would literally give that reward to OUNAHI, the moroccan player who been praised by Luis Enrique…   FDJ didn’t find the rhythm, i mean all barcelona couldnt find their rhythm not only fdj.  Amrabat is a beast, I watch him in fiorentina still, the guy is a heavy caliber no one literally stand in front of him in duels.  Tchouameni is only 23. Enzo is 22. What about Camavinga, he s only 20years old and a beast.   But we all agree that KANTE is THE GOAT literally, unbelievable player.
Win duels(specially that one duel against BVB ), hit the gym get stronger, (get a lil bit taller too 🤣)get his passes to their destination, work between the lines better( cut the field on 3 parts not 2 parts) be more assertive on defending…. And more !!  His ability to hold the ball in tight places? For 100M i want him to get that ball out of tight places like im having a MESSI over there !! What YOU TALKING ABOUT HOLDING BALL in tight places maaaaan Felix and Kai are poor players? Sure thing
We could list many players that got off to hot starts and faded....and the reverse.  There's just not enough data to take a concrete stance.
You say FDJ couldn’t fine rhythm when Barca when they were in their mess but Enzo is literally in the same situation at Chelsea. Enzo’s also been in 3 different teams in 3 different leagues in the last 12 months. Give him time man. He’s probably been the best part of this Chelsea side since joining, if not best then top 2/3 easily.   Enzo and Lampard are two different players and no one has ever claimed he’ll be the next Lampard. Imo he’s more likely to be similar to Kante type player than a Lampard. He’ll be a bit more better on passing and link ups then Kante was but defensively a bit worse. Getting between both boxes, getting stuck in to challenges and such.
Dont forget chelsea spent over a 100M on him, changing coaches throughout the season… we can say Chelsea financially dont know what to do with the money. And Enzo will stay an Enzo at the end of the day. He s not Kante or lampard, i was kind by comparing him to Lampard.. the guy cant even win duels, it s not about rhythm there. He cant get decisive passes through, he got a vision tho but not OZIL’s, he cant win ball in the air, not very strong.  Enzo is just average honestly. That price tag made him comparable to someone SPECIAL
City 2-1 Liverpool 2019
AFCB 4 Liverpool 3 because we were 3-1 down with 15 minutes left.
City 3-2 Villa
Nathan Ake
Ward Prowse🤣 he’s bang average and only good at set pieces
Andres Pereira
Onana has been immense for Everton. They'd be in much worse shape without him and I think he's destined for a top six move.   Pinnock for Brentford. If he was a bit younger he'd be the talk of town. Doesn't foul, immense in the air, and great with the ball at his feet.
Can i say HARRY MAGUIRE pleaaaase 🤣
Ziyech- chelsea doesn’t deserve him
I think we have to include some of Brighton's players tbh. Trossard even before he went to Arsenal, Mitoma, Caicedo, Mac Allister, March, Ferguson. But if I had to choose one, I'd say Mitoma.
Pascal Groß - great passer, steady presence, scoring goals where needed, undressing fools with his Cruyff turns.  If people could put his corner kicks in, he'd be unstoppable.
Fabian Schär.  Has been incredibly consistent in one of the best defences in the league. He puts his body on the line every game. I'm pretty sure he's had about 4 or 5 head injuries recently.  Is overlooked when people are talking about our defence as Trippier, Pope and Botman get the plaudits.  To top it off, he only cost £3m
Brennan Johnson's been putting in shifts. Remarkable first season at the premier league level.
Raya and Leno have been exceptional   Ollie Watkins has been on top level form  Ben Mee has also gone under the radar.  Btw, if you’re saying a player from a Big 6 club…probably not an underrated lol
Has anyone else wondered if this sub is just used as free content for fivr clickfarm copywriters?
Don't understand the people who say the only thing ward prowse can do is set pieces. If your a stat person then look at his stats and you'll see he's pretty high up for the normal midfield stuff e.g. possession won, progressive passes etc. If you like to use your eyes then it shouldn't be hard to see that he's not a bang average player, he's hardly iniesta but he's still pretty good
John Stones, hes the best CB in the leauge
Big fan of Pereria and Raya.   As a Newcastle fan, I'd say Willock. Sometimes I feel we have prime Yaya Toure on our side, with his ability to turn defense into attack, and stride through the middle of the park. Think he just needs a little bit more composure, as he is getting into brilliant positions but absolutely brilliant over the last 5/6 games.
Ollie Watkins easy. 14 goal contributions in 16 games under Emery. Could easily get third in the golden boot but rarely mentioned.
Allison
harrison reed   boubacar kamara   estupiñan
I think it’s Enzo Fernandez. He has been the best midfielder since January only reason people don’t know is because he plays that shit show Chelsea side. People think he’s a flop? Madness
>the most underrated player in the Premier League this season  >has been a consistent performer for Southampton for several years  That doesn't make sense. Your most underrated player **this season** is underrated because he's been consistent for **several years**  Surely, if you want an underrated player this season, it has to be based on performances this season?
Dango Ouattara joined us in January but already has 3 assists in 10 matches but he was class in Ligue 1 for Lorient at the age of 20. I wouldn’t be surprised if he ends up having a successful career.
As a City fan, I think Ake.  I've been impressed with Trossard too
Took over for cancelo who was playing well and had more minutes than any player on man city. ake hasn’t really put a foot wrong. He’s awesome and he’s been good all along but only got in for rotation. He’s been patient as well. So his attitude is also amazing. We saw cancelo get a few less minutes and implode. A great attitude like akes is immense for team cohesion. Also ake was great to watch for the Netherlands.
He was a legend at Dean Court just wish we could have him back.
Talking about underrated and you mention ward-prowse… missing the question here?!!
And I’ve just read the OP’s follow up statement, I get your comment now!! Sorry mate, my mistake!!!
Pereira has been exceptional. Seems to have been key in helping you boys this season.   On a different note I’ve been really impressed by Willian again this season.
Incredible for Fulham
Ziyech is fucking shit
Do not no why you’re getting downvoted he turned into Xavi against Liverpool, him and Dias being fit are crucial for us
Huh
I'm happy he's doing well... but c'mon "prime Yaya" 😂  not in his wildest dreams
🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
So what is he doing that's really good? When he got given man of the match for the game at Liverpool I was surprised because I didn't realise he played that's how unimpactful he was.
Most Southampton fans think he's been pretty poor by all regards.
Is shit or THE shit?
Deluded Liverpool fan
His keeper stats are absolutely atrocious...I saw something a couple of weeks ago that they'd have anywhere from six to twelve more points with a bang average mid-table keeper.
I'm not tryna slander. I'm tryna get an understanding of him as a player from someone who's watched him play.
He was a deluded Chelsea fan 😂🫢
He's the type of player that can dictate the tempo of the team with his long and short range passing. Doesn't give the ball away cheaply and Is hard to put him under pressure by trying to press him.
I know we joke about Americans knowing absolutely nothing about football but fuck me this is something else
So none of the good managers want to touch this (incredibly entertaining) shit-show till season is over and they get an entire pre-season.
People crying but not seeing the absolute movie script that’s about to be written when Lampard comes back and wins the Champions League.
Haha! Well I guess at least it’s not just us who are a shit show this season.
I guess this means when Roman left he took Guus Hiddink’s phone number with him.
Hey fellow relegation battle dudes can we all agree to start winning matches so we can give Chelsea a bit of a scare down in the bottom
20 years of Romans Money… 20 years of financial doping  I’ve dreamed of times like this, I truly have.
If you are going to convince people that you are crazy, why not go full hog?
Lamps would be a triffic appointment, exactly what the Blues need at this moment.  Guy gets the club, knows what its all about. Surround him with some other proper Chelsea men like, JT, Drogba, Emma Hayes, get Wisey in as Sporting Director and I have no doubt he will be a success.
Failing upwards, a classic Tory story…
Is Boehly the biggest fool in football at the moment? A monkey in a suit could do a better job.
You can take Maupay off us as well
Mark my words, Chelsea are going to turn into arsenal during the decline of Wenger and the post Wenger years or United post Fergie  When you have someone who's a massive presence in the club, in this case it's a Abramovich and then Peter Chech and Mariana along with him, them leaving is going to create a massive hole that can take years to recover from. There is an entire ideology and spirit about the club that gets taken out overnight. Guy at the top is clueless, and I think we're going to see Chelsea be outside of the top four or five for a while going forward. Sure they may occasionally challenge for a trophy, but the era of basically being guaranteed to win something every 18 months is over.
So is the idea to see how close they can come to the drop zone without going under? Sort of like one of those old game shows where they guess the price?
I think this is bait for Levy to pull the trigger. There's nothing as tempting as an ex-Chelsea manager...   We've had AVB, Mourinho, and Conte so far. Tuchel was on the list but Bayern beat'em to the punch... Potter's available, so maybe...
Guy sacks Tuchel replaces him with Potter then sacks potter and cant find anyone willing to take over now so brings back a the guy that was sacked for Tuchel. Then to make it worse hes the man who was sacked by struggling Everton, it’s actually hilarious.
Lmaoooooooo
No way LMFAOOOO
What a bizarre thing to do  Boehly really seems clueless
NOOOOOOOO
This has ruined my day. He’s going to play mount and Gallagher at the same time no doubt. We’re going to replace arguably the worst Chelsea manager ever with the person who can also be considered the worst chelsea manager ever.
Jesus fucking Christ.
I’d take Lamps for the rest of the season over Enrique full time. Naglesmann is ideal and I’d rather wait for him.
Are people on this sub this fucking redacted? We've brought in guys like guys hiddink multiple times in the past to see a season out how the fuck is this any different?
Peak shithousery
Why couldn’t have they have done it before the Liverpool game!!!
WHY?!
They've also opened talks with Ranieri, Rodgers Gerrard  & Conte
I hope he tells them to piss off.
😀😀😀😀😀😀
The Ouroboros club
This is PERFECT! I can't wait for the last 9 games of the season
Chelsea want to do real life Richmond or what. Do a relegation season and a comeback. Boehly wants the full merit experience hahaha
From tuchel- lampard what a odd season
I heard the deals done..JT as assistant till the summer
What a Super Billy decision!
He's like Gerrard couldn't manage a piss up at Butlins hopeless.
🤣
Wot
Relegation calls
Had to check the date when I read this.
Let them cook 😀
Yaaay
You say you joke, but most of the time it is true. Didn't see us having a good time with him as owner, though I didn't quite expect the wheels to come off so early.
Boehly giving American owners bad rap. Why even fire Potter?
Thank God for Chelsea, FSG is embarrassing enough for us American fans but at least we don't have to deal with that
This lot are unbelievable . It’s a complete circus .
I never get up votes for saying this. WTF. Been saying it since the takeover. People don't believe me when I say I predicted a bad season for Chelsea. I'll up vote you tho.
Naglesmann may be waiting for Madrid?
They should have called back Di Matteo then!!! Lampard ain’t even better than this guy haha
And takes Chelsea down to the Championship on 39 points.
Uefa is getting very creative with their writing as of late
Misery loves company lol
You Were Never Alone
Just keep Boehly occupied in LA 🙏🏽.
Is this trolling?
Baldrick….. that’s an exceedingly cunning plan.
LOL
Chelsea sacked Lampard not too long ago so your logic is flawed lol
That's the one.  How many chances is that clueless arrogant fat \*\*\*\* allowed?
Nah it’ll be far worse  Arsenal issue was overpaid bums who didn’t care. The faults were never institutional, and once the Kronkes got the stadium refinanced, we moved onwards with Arteta / Edu. Especially after learning a very expensive Pepe lesson.  Idk how you come back from wasting 10x that in 12 months… even PSG, a clown-fest themselves, called this new Chelsea A Circuis
Please don't anyone tell Todd Boehly, but I believe he thinks you get a better draft pick for Endrick if you finish lower in the league.
English manager, with Premier League experience, who knows the club and is available for free, so no compensation needed  … there’s only one other person who I can think of who fulfils such criteria and that’s Potter. Lol.
How exactly is this bizarre? We've called up guys hiddink I'm the Roman days more than once to see a season out after firing a manager. This sub is just full of morons who just started watching SOCCER.
Your tears sustain me
Lol
How can you not see the difference?  Hiddink was a good coach, won an FA cup with Chelsea.  Lampard has proven himself to be fairly shit as a manager and you sacked him previously.  Seems pretty obvious.
Why not? They have fuck all to play for this season. Home environment is toxic with jeers and boos. Lampard is a club legend who would help reduce that toxicity. Maybe win some games. His record at Chelsea has been better than Potter. Meanwhile, the board gets enough time to vet the options and make a decision.
And not with Ole?
From Lampard to Tuchel to…Lampard in 3 seasons.
Arsenal, Man U, and Liverpool all have American ownership. Man City and Newcastle have Middle Eastern owners. The only "Big 6" team with an English Owner is Tottenham and you see what issues they're having.
PSG he’s talking to them according to the papers .
I would be very wary of taking on the Chelsea job. Guardian wrote the other day that Chelsea might run afoul of the FFP if they don't qualify for UCL next season. No UCL means a financial hit of around 70m depending on how far you reach in UCL. Guardian said they could be forced to sell more players than they'd really like and no big transfers in. I'm not surprised some managers could be reluctant to come to Chelsea.
You’re assuming Madrid want him…
Spurs to hire Poch till end of season next.
Maybe we just load up a fm Chelsea save and let him think that he’s working?
I completely approve of this absolutely serious plan
r/whoosh
>Arsenal issue was overpaid bums who didn’t care.  This is it right here. We had shit players making too much money on long contracts. That's why some had to be paid to fuck off. Once that was done the team fires.
Sounds about right... maybe he really wants Conor Bedard...
Rodgers?
Bizarre because you sacked a manager that’s actually better than the one coming in for the rest of the season.  Literally no point sacking Potter if it’s just to get Lampard in and you’re a moron if you can’t see that.
This season is done. CL is highly improbable and I’d rather the right coach than the expedient one. Lampard can at least instil a bit of the club culture back into the squad.
Ole won't work again  He'll just end up doing after dinner speaking on THAT goal at Man utd functions....possibly do stadium tours
To be frank, our owner has been fantastic. They've built us up from a lower half club, to a financial powerhouse that usually qualifies for the Champions League.   We have a chariman that is terrible at footballing decisions, however, and that ruins everything.
Arsenal, United, and Liverpool, all clubs that have had protests levied at the ownership to some degree, all clubs that would have been more successful over the last 10-20 years with actual football owners (even with the varying degrees of success that each have had, they should have been more successful). Liverpool went from leeching American owners to slightly less problematic American owners, whose only saving grace is the fact they managed to acquire Klopp and Michael Edwards.  As for the other owners, particularly the English owners, fuck knows why you brought that up when I didn't say anything about them at all. Seems you're trying to draw your own conclusions from scenarios that you've made up in your head.
If he chooses PSG, he deserves the shit they'll put him through.
Can't he do both? Do the other one via Zoom?
Worst option for him
I’m looking at Ozil the lazy fucking waste of skin
>players making too much money on long contracts.  Chelsea doing the same now.
Lmao potters the worst coach we've ever had. It's not even close.
You can’t be interviewing managers with a permanent manager in the club. That would be absolutely moronic, which you are suggesting here
It was more that their statement of American owners not knowing football has no basis in reality when the only major team with English ownership hasn’t had any of the success of the others. Honestly I prefer Spurs to the others still, but that’s due as much to the fans as anything.
Ha ha! Frank. I get it.
I'd take the PSG job over Chelsea. Someone like Nagelsmann can quickly improve them, Mbappe is a generational talent as a coach I would always want the chance to manage him. They play in UCL and have lots of money. Realistically they are 3, 4 good transfers away from challenging in UCL. If they lose Messi, Ramos and Neymar in the summer they'll have a boatload of freed cash to sign 3 maybe even 4 top footballers.
Long may they suffer
It took Ferguson 4 years to win a trophy at United.  Some things take time. Potter is a significantly better coach than Lampard.
Because of your idiotic new owner that decided to lump 10+ new players on him at once and expected it to work especially since he had never had big club experience before.  Potter is clearly a better manager than Lampard
No he isn't. Lampard is a much much worse coach
How have you come to the conclusion that’s what I suggested lmfao
1.Yes you can.  2.We will literally be doing that. We'll be interviewing managers while Lampard i sunder contract
Again, I haven't fucking said anything to do with English owners being better or preferable. Stop making shit up to force your own agenda.
Not saying he should take the Chelsea job over PSG. Imo both are equally as bad.   3-4 players away from challenging for the UCL really? They’ve got 3 of the best players of their generation, Donnarumma in goal, and a really good group of mids and defenders. Mendes and Hakimi are top 3 in their position in the world imo. They’ve upgraded their midfield alot last summer. What else do you want from them? They should be challenging for the UCL now.   They’re battling FFP, so I don’t know if they’ll able to spend a lot in the summer. Messi and Ramos they won’t get any fees for, also lowering their income because they no longer have sponsorships for Messi.   Who’s buying Neymar? Chelsea’s owners are the only idiots that would pay a fee for him and pay him big money. I don’t see anyother big European club going in for him and I doubt he’ll wanna take the Middle East route considering he’s only 31 and after he’s publically said he wants to retire at PSG.
Statistically speaking Potter is the worst coach we've ever had.
Lampard is not a permanent appointment though. He knows what he signed up for, which is not the case with Potter. They absolutely fucked up by getting rid of Tuchel and appointing Potter, but this decision seems reasonable, at least not stupid.
Wow you’re a salty one aren’t you? I wasn’t even talking to you, sit the fuck back down.
Their midfield seems to be worse after all these transfers. Even if Neymar stays they'll free up collosal wages by getting rid of Messi and Ramos. They need another defender although Skriniar will help, a versatile midfielder and a striker. Ideally 3 new midfielders provided they'll find a buyer for Soler Ruiz Danilo and Sanches.
And yet Lampard still manages to be worse overall. Odd.
Irrelevant. There's no rule stopping us from looking for managers while already having one
You responded to me originally, peddled your lie that I somehow only want English owners, proceeded to ignore the reply where I called you out for your lies, and then continued pushing the idea that English owners are somehow desirable to someone else, based on *my* comment.  Get the fuck outta here with your fucking bullshit you cunt.
I mean statistically he absolutely wasn't. I am really not sure what you're arguing. Frank got us top 4 with one of our worst teams in a long time.
I should’ve expected you’d be illiterate based on how much of a fucking idiot you are and I’ll be damned if I wasn’t right. You trash American owners but have no leg to stand on and get mad when someone calls you on it. I’d feel awful seeing you born so daft if you weren’t also a self righteous piece of shit.
The statistics are irrelevant because Lampard's job came during a much easier time and because he wasn't trying to build to anything. Obviously a short term job will have better statistics over a short timeframe than a long term job.
The fuck are you even talking about? Lampard was here longer than Potter... Potter was the worst coach in Chelsea history. Did you start following us last year?  Not only that lampard came in in the middle of a transfer ban and kept us in top 4 with a bunch of shit players. He brought Reece, and mount who at the time was looking like a stud into the fold. It literally sounds like you have the memory of a goldfish my friend. You always have shit takes so this is no surprise.
We haven’t won there in 11 years so feet are firmly on the ground
We could win or lose 4-0.
It’s hard to predict honestly.  On one hand Arsenal should win comfortably based on the performances of both teams this season.  On the other Liverpool at home in the big games can still put up a big performance like we’ve seen with City, Napoli and United.  For me if Arsenal do win this then they’ll go on to win the title because it’s such a big task no matter how poor Liverpool are to win at Anfield.
Someone’s getting a humping. I just don’t know who.
It won't end well for us. Our season is done and regardless of whether or not Klopp rotated last night eith an eye on Sunday we just aren't up to it.  If we give arsenal the number of chances we gave Chelsea it will be a cricket score 😱
If Chelsea had a player who could finish then yesterday they could have scored a hatful. Arsenal have Martinelli, Saka, Jesus, Odegaard, Trossard, Xhaka... many players with multiple goals this season. If Liverpool keep a clean sheet it'll be surprising.
Liverpool are great at home and it will not be an easy game but I think Arsenal can and will beat them 2-0 or 2-1. Our form is too good whether it’s home or away at the moment. This team is different.
2-0 Arsenal
Arsenal 2/0 winners Liverpool have been  🐕 💩 this season.
Arsenal to win 5-0 probably 🤷‍♂️
IF Arsenal win they'll have 1 hand on the trophy.. IF Liverpool win I expect Arsenal to shit the togs and City to win the league. Draw and it's anyone's ball game (but probably City)
Either Arsenal steamroll them 4-0 or Liverpool win 1-0
Won’t pretend that Anfield is ever an easy place to play. But a huge part of the intimidation factor is how insanely good the home team has been in recent years. That’s not the case this season. No reason Arsenal shouldn’t win.
Arsenal to score early with a bit of luck, dominate the game with no end product and the match to finish 1-0
I'd take a draw, but hope our boys snatch the win in the 95th minute 🫣 🔴⚪
Liverpool will win
Arsenal will easily win that. Don't think Liverpool fans understand that they're not the same as they were a few seasons ago. Classic Liverpool fans thinking they're better than they actually are
Arsenal will win comfortably.   Liverpool are abysmal right now, they got pumped by city who gave up after 60 minutes but more worrying is they got battered by chelsea last night, chelsea just couldn't finish otherwise it could have been 4/5 again.   They did beat city at home earlier in the season but city weren't in great form then and city were the better side in that game, they beat newcastle with a very controversal goal, United fair enough they annihilated them but that's a rivalry that arsenal and liverpool don't have and united aren't anywhere near as good. Arsenal will win with ease.
I’m very nervous for Liverpool winning that one. maybe 1-0, or could be a tie. I hope Arsenal win though, probably would be 1-0 or 2-0.
Arsenal will win, liverpool are so poor ATM
Anfield is lots of teams’ kryptonite in fairness.   Luckily, Trent was rested vs Chelsea so he should start against Martinelli. In 8 of Liverpool’s 14 losses, the opposition right attacker has been motm. If Arsenal are to win, Martinelli needs to cook Trent.
Well a certain Diogo Jota hasn’t score a goal for Liverpool in basically a year. He absolutely loves a goal against arsenal I could see him getting a couple
Liverpool have been quite good at home this season. Reckon there will definitely be a lot of goals in this match. 3-2 or 4-3 Arsenal
For whatever reason, our home and away form are night and day this season. All joke aside I fully expect us to beat Arsenal and then lose away to Leeds the following week.
Arsenal about to get Man United by Liverpool. Jk,  but that would be the story of the season
Liverpool are the perfect team for arsenal. Just break their midfield one pass or dribble should do it which they are very good at and you’re just facing their back line
Arsenal wins 7-6 ... Ramsdale screamer at 93' to break the 7-7 tie.
Chaos. Chaos unleashed!
All outcomes are possible. Arsenal winning is likely
They've been dire all season and none of their fans want city to win the league. So it's got 4-0 home win written all over it.
Interesting game!!!  I take Arsenal 3:1
I am so sure that Liverpool win and then drop points next game
Spurs fan Hopefully Liverpool   Probably ArsenalArsenal
Could be a win or a draw for either side I reckon
Napoli 0-4 Milan  Barca 0-4 Madrid  …
2-2 draw with one of the teams equalising in the 90th min
Liverpool 0-2 Arsenal - Odegaard and Trossard to score
To be far, before this season we haven’t won at Spurs’ stadium in 9 years. It’s possible.
Arsenal are the best they been in 11 years, Liverpool are the worst they been in 11 years . I'd be very surprised if Arsenal don't win.
This is how I'm going into it as well lol.
This is the correct answer tbh your home form has been good but arsenals away form has aswell, going to be a cracker for sure
Can we agree to no 7-0, no matter which way it goes?
Facts. I feel like this game is the ultimate test to see if Arsenal can indeed be champions this season
Why would you rotate against Chelsea?
Haha as an Arsenal fan I hope so but i can’t see it
100% agree with all of this.
Actually Liverpools home record this season is really good. Only dropped 9 points, only lost once, (to Leeds 0-1) unbeaten against the top 6. +25 goal difference. 9 goals conceded (only Man utd have less) Liverpools away form is worse than Southamptons... but at home they've basically been as good as anyone. Only city and arsenal have picked up more points at home and they've both played 2 more games.
Every year I just know we go Anfield and get pumped but this year is different.i know Liverpool fear arsenal this year first time in a long time.
Yank here 🦅 expect a Leeds United States of America masterclass
Correct, I’m honestly not trying to be negative I’m just trying to be level headed
Worst In 11 years? When did you start watching football?
Liverpool worse they've been in 11 years ? Get your sh*t together mate ,before Klopp came 7 years ago they were even worse with Lucas,Moreno,Sako,Mignolet,Clyne,Texas,Kolo Toure,Sinclair,Skrtel,Lallana etcs and that is one hell of a finished squad.
I take that deal, do you take that deal?
6 of our last 10 are at home, and the away are Leeds (13th), West Ham (15th), Leicester (19th) and Southampton (20th). Granted we’ve still been poor against lower half but it’s still a favorable situation.
I think the thing Liverpool fans fear is Liverpool.
I’m not optimistic either with Paul Tierney refereeing too, but this season we’ve done what we wouldn’t have expected
More than 30 years ago pup
I think the dementia may be creeping in then.
Yeah i found his punditry interesting for sure and i really liked him. To be honest i think its a mix of him giving decent analysis and me being happy to see a new face.
He’s likeable and charismatic, seems pretty knowledgable too. I’m sure sky will beat that out of him eventually.
Anyone is better than listening to Souness
thought he was brilliant and also way cooler than I'll ever be
Really liked him on Sky, as a pundit Sturridge to me comes off a bit refreshing and doesn’t say things for the sake of it to get sky clip it for views or be a funny guy like Micah Richards.
Current or recent players generally make far better pundits than these dinosaurs who pissed their millions away and now spout dated nonsense on Sky for a living
Feel like he could easily have been just a “there for the vibes” pundit like Micah but found what he said quite interesting.
Came on dressed like a combo of Michael Jackson and Prince, talking in a fake, hybrid, gangsta/US accent......  He was 'trying' far too hard  Needs to remove the 'Prada' gear as well, if you're going to 'drip' in designer, you don't need to 'advertise' the brand....we get it, you have cash to burn....can't buy class  Edit; Minus 5 for this🤣🤣🤣, yet nobody has actaually made a contradictory point.   Did he have Prada written over everything?  Was he wearing 'matching' jacket and gloves....which looked like he was about to commit a burglary?  He was born and raised in Birmingham- please explain the accent - and I'm from Wolverhampton, lived in Scotland, Wales and Germany for way longer than this clown has left Birmingham- my accent is still the same.  Does he have a unique style? Nope, just borrowed from those who have  It all just 'stank' of effort -
Sky - "So, Daniel. We need you to say that Osimhen won't ever be able to make it in the Premier League."  Sturridge - "But I do think he has a genuine chance of doing great thin-"  Sky : *Tuts while making the cut throat gesture*
You sound salty af lmao
You sound 12
1980s Premier League? Hmmm.
Tony Adams
You mean Division one
Paul McGrath
Franny Benali  An absolute hero on and off the pitch, and today seems to be on track for a future knighthood (for whatever that is worth)
Tony Adams.
Steve Walsh.
1980?? Maybe he s talking about FA cup.  1980 Premier League is like saying State of Israel in 1944 🥱🤣
David Kilcline- that tache and ferocity.
Gary "Rambo" Briggs
Alan Hansen was unbelievably good
Are you asking about a centre Back from the Division One who still played in the Premier League?  Or just an 80s defender from Division One   The only answer is Tony Adams
There was no Prem in 80s, but best first division CB I'd be tempted to say Mr Arsenal Tony Adams,... but really would have to be one of the Liverpool CBs Alan Hansen or Mark Lawrenson. They provided the stable base for Liverpool to dominate in the 80s.
Mabbutt, beautiful human being.
The "Premiere League" doesn't exist. The Premier League exists. They aren't the same word, they are even pronounced differently.
Who’s he?
Netanyahu
Cool
If you say so
Nah Potter replacing Tuchel obviously
Of course it is! Gerrard was clueless and Emery is a top class manager with a proven record in Europe too.
Emery is a top manager replacing an out of his depth inexperienced manager in Gerrard. Easily the biggest upgrade
It's a coup for villa to get a manager the quality of emery he has turned them into a team chasing Europe. De zerbi has also improved on potter at Brighton for all the managerial changes this season there's more positive than negative.
De Zerbi replacing potter was great for Brighton 🤷🏼‍♂️
Gerrard really was complete garbage
Lampard to Dyche has to be in the conversation, look at the difference on the pitch
We went from losing 9-0 with Scott Parker to beating Liverpool 1-0 with GON! Thats quite an upgrade if you ask me!
In history I’d say! For any league, any year.
Nah, lampard for potter🤚
Whoever replaces potter
This season yes, last season Howe replacing Bruce must get the crown.
I’ll toss Gracia into the hat. If we beat Palace at the weekend, we’ll have won 4 in 7 with Gracia, compared to 4 in 20 with Marsch.
Both Emery and RDZ are top coaches so huge upgrade for both team !
I swear villa were in the drop zone when Gerrard got the sack.  then they got Emery and absolutely whooped united :(   **massive upgrade,** went from a dysfunctional door hinge to "good ebening"
Yes
Frank lampard leaving, not even getting dyche in, just getting useless frank the fuck out
Nah, it’s Nathan Jones to Selles   But Emery is top coach
Second biggest one
I greatly prefer not having a manager to being managed by Conte 🤷🏼‍♂️
Nope, Lampard replacing the guy who replaced the guy who replaced Lampard. In the interim. It’s a glorious flowchart
Easily. Emery is a world class manager who has trophies to back it up. In my opinion, he's in the top 3 for managers currently in the premier league only behind Pep and Klopp.
A reminder in what state arsenal was just two years ago. They made Emery look useless. Arteta has really turned things around and Emery cooking with that Villa squad. Hopefully they make some good moves in the summer. Top 6 competition next year is going to be insane including Villa.
Even tho its being highlighted now, I don't think fans of other clubs will grasp how bad it was under Gerrard. I'll often hear about how beale was "the brains of the operation" when we were utter shite when he was here too.    Some fans, like myself, never liked hiring Gerrard from the start, others dropped off after he won something like 2/14 at the end of last season, others dropped off on the first day of this season (losing to Bournemouth with watkins, mings and luiz on the bench), then for some it was the Home win vs Southampton (never seen such apathy at actually winning a game) and then for the one or Two left it was the loss to fulham.   My most hated villa manager in my life time, including mcleish, garde, Bruce, Lambert etc. Treated the players with disdain, blamed them constantly, treated the local press (who only ever softballed him) with disdain. The next Club who gets him better be preferred for regression while the manager acts arrogant as fuck    The difference between him and emery is night and day
Yeaah of course
The difference in quality between Gerrard and Emery as managers is the same as their quality as players
Lopetegui, an ex-Real Madrid / Spain manager in at Wolves was a big coup. Hasn't seen the results just yet but a top manager
[Definitely](https://media1.giphy.com/media/l0COIKNP1mpieUVkA/giphy.gif?cid=2154d3d76p2z5v0gs5bx4xe5xan6aoy8phujf5xn4lzs0an7&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g)
In history of PL
Emery is a legendary manager.
Lots of troll comments here….
Definitely.  Although Lamps being replaced by Dyche should also be in the conversation.
Marco Silva to Ancelotti has to be up there
In name no, but in difference of coaching from Steve Bruce to Eddie Howe is up there.
Steve Bruce to Eddie Howe gotta be a close run thing - Tripper and Bruno aside
To think, Gerrard probably wants the Liverpool job when it becomes available. And I can even imagine him getting it
Villa have done better obviously but believe me Gracia replacing Marsch feels fantastic
In some of the more mature clubs, which includes Villa unfortunately, managers are given the role of 'head coach' with less autonomy and there are other staff responsible for scouting, signing players, training the team etc. While the manager takes the flack from the fans, in many cases there is little they can do because of the org structure and division of responsibilities. This was the case at Villa last decade or so, but I think the owners have stepped in and given full autonomy to Emery.  Gerrard was exposed when Beale left, and others before him were below par for top 10, but I think the distributed responsibilities at some of these bigger clubs make it much harder for managers to build a successful culture. It's basically the same team that played under Smith and Gerrard, but Emery has worked closely with individuals and transformed the mentality of the players.
Yeah
So glad the nightmare is over 🥲
Villa is super lucky to get him.   I am still wondering why did he turn down Newcastle earlier?
It really was but Potter was still doing a decent job whist Gerrard at Villa was atrocious. They went from fighting relegation to almost comfortably sitting on the top half of the table with Emery
Potter did have Brighton getting great results and they were challenging for Europe. The only problem was it was only after 6 games.  Gerrard had Villa as relegation candidates and Emery has Villa as qualifying for Europe.
So de zerbi replacing Potter at Chelsea then?
This is pure revisionnism.   Potter was great with Brighton he had a great system and had great results in comparison with his budget ( Brighton was in top 4 this season before Potter left)   Hell even Guardiola called the best english coach in the PL last season.
De Zerbi has improved Brighton but not to the degree that Emery has improved Villa. De Zerbi moved Brighton up maybe three or four places, and that’s huge, but Emery moved Villa up like *10-12* places. That’s the difference between relegation and Europe.
Potter was doing bits lmao
Villa was 17th they are 7th right now
Bournemouth is 18th in the league. Villa has climbed ~10 places since hiring Emery.  Southampton lost 9-0 to Leicester and then beat them in the return fixture. Those are just freak results
You mean GO
> In history I’d say! For any league, any year.  A better upgrade than Rioch to Wenger?
Ya just got Lampard
That gets the all time crown. Not sure there's ever been a big upgrade
Wait on it. Roy masterclass and we’re on our way to Europe   On a serious not, don’t think we’ve won at your place in recent times tbh so I’m not expecting much
Think if either of us win that one we’re safe
This is pure revisionism. RDZ has improved brighton yes but it isn't that big of an upgrade. Potter was in the top 4 with brighton before he left. They were playing incredible football. Let's not change history just because he failed at Chelsea
Legit we were 17th when Slippy G got the sack and in his first game we go and get a result nobody would have thought would have happened. This man has completely changed the mentality of our players and fanbase.
Honestly how villa fans felt pre Emery it was just get rid of Gerrard as it can't be any worse
Lmao and now he’s back at Chelsea. Managing is an old boy’s club
This is an insane take. Emery’s league record with every team he has coached has been average. Valencia was arguably his best showing with a fairly stacked squad and he took them to three third place finishes before dropping to fourth. With Sevilla he averaged 5th. Despite the French league being a one horse race he still managed to come second with PSG and fifth with Arsenal (12th when he was sacked).    His claim to fame is his Europa league record, but he’s an average league manager who could snatch a draw from the jaws of victory.
Really throwing out the term world class now aren’t we
Damn I think you're right. If Tuchel and Conte were still in the Prem he'd be way down the pecking order but now that they're sacked he's gotta be the third best
Top 3 in terms of all time or current?  I know it's early but I would put Arteta above Emery
He's not a world class manager lol
Not sure too many Arsenal fans would agree that Dick is better than Arteta.
Ya ma was in my top 3 last night
I don’t know whether it was just incompatibility between the squad and the manager, or a lack of experience in the PL, or what, but the difference between Emery’s Arsenal and Emery’s Villa is night-and-day.  Following up on Wenger was always going to be an impossible job, similar to following up on Sir Alex, so maybe it was just that. Moyes certainly went on to experience more success after leaving United—until now, that is.
People forget we went 14 games unbeaten when Emery took over. It all went to shit when he bottled top 4, we lost 4 of our last 7 games and finished 5th by 1 point. So everything was pinned on winning Europa and we got absolutely smacked by Chelsea and Emery (and Ozil) lost the fans and the dressing room  The whole club turned toxic again. Ozil fall out. "Senior players" mocking his English. Emery then only won 3 from 15 games and got the boot.  Good manager with a few questionable tactical decisions but overall solid. The whole club was in shambles though, so I think any manager would have failed
We went from 17th to 7th… you haven’t escaped the relegation battle yet although I do believe you’ll stay up
You sure about that?
I don't think Lampard is better though 🤔
You must have missed Lampard being appointed.
Now you understand a little bit how Man Utd fans feels during the last few weeks Ole at the club.
I think it was something family related at the time and Villarreal were in a different position at that stage also
Maybe he has a conscience
If villa continues their form and Brighton manchester united or Newcastle United or tottenham stumble on the finnish line, they can potensialy reach europe.  With Key matches Newcastle home Manchester United away Spurs home Brighton home
Potter was actually doing very well at Brighton.... it was a move that ruined pretty much both potter chelsea
Potter was doing an amazing job.
In history of PL
Why would he take the step down?
Chelsea fans would never want another Brighton guy after the first one
It was the same thing every season with potter at Brighton, good spells, followed by really poor spells and a lack of goals….Hence why they finished mid table every season…I think it would’ve been the same for them this year had he stayed
With a much better team tbf
Emery's had more time with the team, since October.
Im messing around, not being serious
I think it’s more reasonable to say the best upgrade in the PL in the last twenty years.
To be fair though you also had big squad upgrades. Emery has only signed one player for the first team and has climbed 10 places.
In a caretaker position lmao he’s doing us a favor.
6 trophies with PSG, 4 European trophies with Sevilla and Villareal. You tell me a current manager with more European trophies than him. There's a handful and they're all world class. Arsenal never gave him enough time.
I think Arteta is better, but he has to earn that for the masses to accept it.
No not yet
Top 3 at the moment. SAF trumps Klopp, but would say there is an argument to have with Pep.   Arteta is not on Emery's level - at least yet.
That’s crazy. you’re right I forgot about that. Arteta had to clean house because of how toxic the whole team was. Regardless worked out for everyone now, Emery has gotten to redeem himself (so far) and Arsenal will win the league.
Yes emery has done fantastic
He’s done way better than potter with a worse squad, what you talking about
Ole who finished second and third in PL?
Villarreal were lingering in the bottom half when Newcastle came in for him, while they were looking to be top 4 contender when Aston Villa came in for him. I think that he probably felt that he had done everything that he could for Villarreal after that UCL run last season, which hadnt been achieved yet when Newcastle wanted him.
Fair point but I reckon Bohely can give him 30 million reasons.
Based on nothing. Potter had more points per game than De Zerbi. Brighton’s problem was always that the players themselves underperformed. This is the best Brighton squad, I think the players would perform better than in other seasons
I agree but we are talking about coach upgrade not team quality.  Gerrard had a better quality but was in a lower position only means that Lampard performed better than Gerrard thus the gap between Gerrard and Emery is wider than the one between between Dyche and Lampard....
And a transfer window
Tuchel from Lampard.  Ancelotti from Silva.  Klopp from Todgers.  Ten Hag from Wally.
Not even the best in the last two years
Couldn’t agree less. He’s a good cup manager and short term manager. He’a a very defensive coach which doesn’t suit the Arsenal philosophy and was a yes man. Arsenal needed someone with to lay down the law taking no prisoners. They needed Arteta or Klopp or someone with that charisma, and to get rid of Raul who’s transfers lined the pockets of his agent friends.  Emery is a cup specialist and possibly the best one out there and I’m happy he’s doing well at Villa. He seems to perform better as the underdog and does particularly well year 1.
Agreed
Could your view on arteta being at emerys level change based on how the next 2 months play out?
I know Emery has had a wonderful career but is there not something to be said for Arteta doing with Arsenal what Emery didn’t?
Sorry I meant top 3 all time currently in the prem, so SAF and Mourinho are excluded
30 million to age 30 years in 30 days
??
Winning multiple cups/trophies, especially with the likes of Sevilla (3 in a row) and Villareal - not the biggest teams in Europe. Managed a top club in PSG and won the league. In my opinion, he may not be the most charismatic, he has a proven track record to over archive with his respective clubs. In my opinion, he shouldn't be judged on his tenure at Arsenal, but should be judged on his medals - the guy is a winner and you cannot deny that.
Maybe, but didn’t Emery finish 5th in his first season? Arteta has finished 8th, 8th and 5th?
Well is it all time or currently in the prem it can’t be both
Mourinho shouldn’t be getting a sniff of top 3 of all time anyway. Putting him above SAF or Wenger would be an absolute joke, and there’s not really an argument for him over pep.
Steve Bruce was Newcastle manager 18 months ago
Thats what i said, he’s a cup manager. He won the league with PSG but who hasn’t. His league record and finishes leave something to be desired.
Context . Emery finished 5th after a wenger side who finished 5th and then got arsenal to around 12th before he got fired. Arteta then got arsenal from 12th to 8th and won fa cup inheriting that mess. The second season was the covid season and then last season narrowly lost out on top 4 due to injuries (part and parcel). There is nothing to suggest Emery is better in the league or in cups apart from In Europe where based on his achievements is comfortably better.
He did but there was no suggestion or sign we were going to improve on that   With Arteta, when he finished 8th we all knew we would do better the next year (can’t do much worse)  Then when we finished 5th last year we knew we’d do better again, we threw it away in the first and last month of last season but September to April we were getting better by the week  Granted none of us saw a title race coming but we were all fairly confident of top 4
Newcastle have had the benefit of squad editions as well to be fair
Poch didn't win the league with PSG, at least for one season anyway. But that's like saying Pep when he won the league with Bayern. At Sevilla/Villareal the biggest thing he could have won was the Europa League - he was never going to beat Real/Barca/Atletico to the league. You said he's probably the best cup manager out there.. if that doesn't put him in the world class bracket then I don't know who is.
And Aston villa already had a good squad that should have been around about 8th-12th
Pep wins the league everywhere he goes, he’s world class and his teams consistently put out some of the best football we’ve seen.   For me world class managers can either have a high level of output for programs for an extended period of time. Or they come in and improve a team drastically even if it’s for a short 1-2 year period.  Think about what Klopp did for Liverpool. Klopp is arguably a tier higher than Emery as a manager maybe even 2.  Klopp is world class as is Pep, Emery when he won 3 Europas in a row certainly deserved consideration for the PSG job can’t argue that but he hasn’t sustained or surpassed that level imo.    You’re entitled to your opinion but if i really think Emery was world class he wouldn’t be at Villa right now
Fair
I’m just too lazy to do so.
Because then I can make statements without being judged on the club I support, and without being accused of being biased
You’ve not seen unflaired until you’ve seen Emile Heskey try and do stepovers on a World Cup pitch he had no business being on
I dont so i can have civil conversations about football without fans of rivals dismissing what i say based purely on the team i support. Plus i cant be arsed lol
Because you have a better chance of having a genuine conversation with someone. With a flair there is a higher chance of them just claiming bias when it isnt the case and acting like a twitter troll.
Some people dont live on reddit.
You know what, Stan, if you want me to wear 37 pieces of flair, like your pretty boy over there, Brian, why don't you just make the minimum 37 pieces of flair?
A number of reasons. Reddit has non-intuitive UI so it's hard to find. Many people simply don't care. Some don't want to be judged and have all their comments viewed through the lens of a fan of a single team (see: "____ supporters are delusional" comments in every thread).
 I didn't know I could be flared!!
Why does it matter, I only have my flair because I like the aesthetic, but who cares if they don’t
Unflaired? Been watching English football for 30 years, support my local top division side, never heard that word!
I don’t know how to get a flair lol.
You kind of said it. I’m not a big team supporter. I like watching players and support players. I’m a fan of Haaland since I’m Norwegian, so therefore I’m kind of a city supporter. But still like to watch other matches, so when arsenal plays I root for them because of Ødegaard, even though theyre in front of city.  I just think that since I basically root for every team in the prem i cant flair since Im not a die hard fan.
A lot of people don't even know how to flair!
Dont know how. Dont care.
I have no idea how to do it.. New to Reddit
Did you just assume my flair?
Unflaired? Lol.   Wtf
I like it when people have a flair because you can then judge their comments with more information.  But, most people either don't realize you can do that or are too lazy because it really doesn't matter that much.
its got fuck all to do with you
I'm also too lazy
Cba
my team aren’t in the prem
Exactly this
Laziness I see...
Of course a Forest fan would say that.
Thank you! Finally a genuine response
Fantastic reference 👏
lmao
Easy. Go to subreddit page - click the three dots button - click change user flair - select flair - click "show flairs in this subreddit" or smth like that and youre done

Overall? Yes  This season? I’d say Odegaard
No I think it's Mohamed Elyounoussi.
This year it’s Odegaard. KDB over the last 5 though.
Well, on current form and other stats some names might drop in. But in my opinion he has been the best midfielder in the League for the last many years. He is right there with the greats like lampard,Scholes etcetx. In my opinion he is a big part of Peps achievement at City. Work rate, consistency, and vision all at the maximum...what a player.....Am an Arsenal fan me, but a football lover first...love to watch him anytime
Well since he is the best in PL history, I would say yes.
This stopped being a question about 4 years ago didn't it? Undeniably the best and by a huge distance. Apparently some are saying he's having a poor season and odegaard is having an amazing season, well odegaard has 8 assists, kdb has 22.
Odergaard is 10-7 goals and assists in 28 premier league games starting with a match rating of 7,4 in the prem  KDB is 5-13 goals and assists in 23(3) starting 3 from the bench with a rating of 7,6 in the prem  So… yeah it’s KDB.  odergaard if he keeps his form up, and stays in the prem, can definitely challenge all time best Attacking midfielder once his career is over.
As a purely attacking midfielder, its ødegaard.  As a midfielder overall, probably KDB
Ya this season odegaard
Odegaard is best right now. Arsenal doesn't have the same talent City has, Odegaard does more with less. Odegaard is also nowhere near his peak and we can expect further improvements season on season as he matures and the Arsenal squad mature. They are practically babes at the moment. KDB is as good as he's ever going to be, there's no further upside.
KDB, Mitoma and Odegaard coming into my mind.
Odegaard on form
Well if we’re talking the best right now it’s Ødegaard
he is the best in the world
Best PL attacking mid fielder of all 🕰️
I think you meant to say Granit Xhaka  /s
Fair Enough.
Kdb has had some bad periods, But Ødegaard had been insane. As a Norwegian i love watching the prem right now. Will have a norwegian in the pl winning team, and both of them are contenders for pl player of the year. But Yeah i agree with this comment. Ødegaard has been more consistent.
I concur!
Definitely Odegaard this season overall kdb.
You mean Elnenyounoussi? Most complete player I’ve ever seen
Doesn’t he play as a Forward ?
Sorry for being that guy, But i dont understand this comment. I assume it is a joke?
It’s still KDB
Have you ever watched Odegaard play? He also isn't feeding Haaland.
If you’re gonna give a match rating, you have to provide a source. It’s not an official/quantitative stat. Every site and publication makes their own.
Mitoma’s a winger isn’t he?
Mohamed Elyounoussi
We have a player in the squad named Mohammed ElNeny
Not this year. Odegaard has been better this year.
Yeah I have, he's a good player, very good infact but he simply isn't in the same league as kdb who is still in his prime and is already regularly mentioned as one of the all time greats. Different levels.
See my other comment.
FotMob
Love how Scottish commentators used to pronounce his name whenever he scored
No… he actually hasn’t. KDB stats are better. Odergaard 17 GA contribution in 28 games. KDB 18 GA in 23 (3)…. So yeah it’s definitely KDB
Nope it’s KDB keeping up this level of consistency is phenomenal, arsenal are now only fighting on one front whilst city have a potential treble and KDB will be firing across all comps, Odegaard is slick could see him as a potential KDB replacement but he’s no king Kev
All you've done is list out stats. Odegaard has been doing a lot more than that, and De Bruyne really hasn't been great for large parts of the season. Career wise, it might be different levels, but this season absolutely not. Also, one has Haaland in front of him, and the other had a misfiring Jesus and Nketiah for most of the season.
But fotmob has KDB at 7.76 and Odegaard at 7.73.  I think these are from whoscored? Either way, highlights the point that match ratings should have their source listed, otherwise its just a guessing game.
Maybe it's not all about stats? Also, one is feeding Haaland while the other has been feeding Nketiah for a large part of the season.
Stats aren’t always a good indicator
Look at my original comment
They're attacking midfielders who play similar positions, they're primarily there to assist. whatever  you want to claim odegaard does in addition to that, kdb will also likely do at city. He's got 22 assists. You dont get that many if you're not having a great season for large parts. Nevertheless, if all he did was stand still for 89 minutes of every game but gave you 22 assists you'd still take it above every other player in the league.  The haaland comment is funny seeing as the exact opposite is said on here to try and discredit him too, he's got 40 goals or whatever it is but it's only because kdb is behind him and now according to you kdb only has 22 assists because he's got haaland in front of him. Both equally ridiculous comments.
That wasn’t the question.   The stats are the fundamental essence of a players performance. So I’ll just add that as a match rating Odergaard has a 7,4 and KDB a 7,6. So that takes into account more of the contributions that a player makes other then just goals and assists
And match ratings? Because KDB is higher at 7,6 compared to Odergaard at 7,4.
I already replied to it
Please link a comment of mine where I said Haaland only has goals because of De Bruyne. This sub isn't one person, and what others say has precisely nothing to do with me.
Match ratings might be an even more laughable metric than goal contributions. Also, you're ignoring the context where one has Haaland in front of him.
Match ratings and stats aren't always totally accurate. Match ratings especially get affected by biases and too much importance on specific stats. A player can have a real shit game, but score a couple goals and their rating will be inflated.  Likewise, stats need to have context with them. Who were they playing for? Who were they playing with? What's their playstyle like? How influential were they in other phases of play that didn't impact their "important" stats? Etc.  Stats do help paint a picture, of course, but the rest of that picture needs to be followed by watching players play. KDB has still had a great season, but Ødegaard has just edged it a little bit with everything he does.
Stats are important.  Stats are NOT the fundamental essence of a player's performance.  They are stats.  For a midfielder, stats only tell part of the story and no, I don't consider match ratings as stats.  They help, but they are subjective.  KDB is the best attacking midfielder in the world as far as I am concerned, but Odergaard has been better this year.  And the ultimate stat is that Arsenal is 8 points clear at the moment.  Frankly, for a midfielder, that is the most important stat since their primary job is to control the game which gets reflected in the score.
Lol if you think “stats are the fundamental essence of a players performance” and then only reference G+A and an unsourced match rating as your stats, I don’t think I can help you understand the game
Bruh what’s a match rating based on and what match ratings are you looking at? Almost every site has their own match ratings. For example, on FotMob KDB has a 7.75 and Odegaard has a 7.73. I could make up my own match ratings and reference those if I wanted, it’d have as much validity as yours since you didn’t mention a source. They’re more subjective than stats you mentioned, which also don’t tell the full story without the necessary context.
Then you should realize that I said over the last 5 years KDB is definitely the best attacking midfielder. This year though, it’s Odegaard. Saying anything else is just wrong.
Didn't suggest you said it did I? Making the point that what you're saying is the exact same thing as that and equally as nonsensical.
If that’s how you feel… I’m just giving an objective measurement of performance.  But seeing as you are so keen on comparing with and without haarland. Last season in 30 match’s KDB got 15 goals and 8 assists. So last season he was better the. This season with Haaland in the team
Stats are important. And match rating measure different parts of a game that add up to that rating. They take aspects of the performance to make it up, such as positive progression, forward passing. So it is a measure of just that, how good a performance is.  Just because someone has a shit game and then scores two goal, doesn’t mean they had a bad game, clearly they scored two goals which can be very important.
Yup, helping the team win is the best.  Match rating using data sets are pretty close to judging a performance though. If using data then yeah they aren’t that subjective as everyone is rated on the same thing.  I’m not talking about match ratings from subjective people. I’m talking about stat based ones.
Thanks… I don’t think I need you to help me understand the game thank you, I’m well aware of how it all works.  I see you have two comments so I’ll just answer this one, whoscored, which in turn uses Opta to compile its data. If you don’t know who that is then I don’t think I can help you understand the game.
As long as KDB is playing he’ll always be too
So you think it makes absolutely no difference whether Eddie Nketiah, Jesus on a goal drought or Haaland is your striker? Talk about nonsensical.
It's not objective at all
You know all the pundits drool over kdb though. He could have a quiet game but as long as city win, guess who’s getting a great score
Understood - Football is a game where stats are good, but they don't really describe the game very well.  Obviously Goals and Assists matter, but the fluid nature of the game doesn't lend itself to statistics very well.  I have always wished that assists for assists were tracked as sometimes the first pass that breaks down the other team is two passes away from the goal.  Having said that, no matter what you do, statistics in football are only suggestive, not definitive.
Lol really zinged me with that last line. Because I totally inferred I don’t know who opta or who scored are.  Frankly, it doesn’t matter where whoscored sources their data from. Saying it’s from opta does not give the match rating any more validity. They take that data and use their own algorithm to create a match rating. That algorithm is subjective because it weights different contributions based on how whoscored decided they should be rated.   IMO whoscoreds match ratings weight goal contributions far too heavily. I’ve watched many games where a DM or fullback has an excellent game, and a winger in the same game is mostly poor but will score a goal or get an assist, and the wingers whoscored rating will be higher. I wouldn’t use their match ratings as some definitive source of truth.
Top
That might be the stupidest thing I’ve seen on Reddit. Kudos.
Arsenal are top of the league mate, hes not playing for some third division outfit with semi-pros on their side. He's got saka and martinelli either flank to feed, who both have more goals than any city winger, you going to mark him down for that?
Kdbs best assist season he had jesus and sterling in front of him. It makes a difference but not a 8 - 22 assist difference. Kdb absolutely does similar off the ball as odegard. If its less its only a little less
Jesus in a goal drought? He hasn’t played in months… I wouldn’t call that a drought - I would call that injured. Nketiah is toilet, great championship player though.. Odegaard has played way more minutes that KDB, I agree odegaard is key to arsenals success but De Bryune is on another level as mentioned above
Ok
I’m not talking about pundits. Pundits suck at actual game metrics, plus they usually have basis. I’m talking about match rating based off data.
So they are tracked. It’s in the data set from opta. So are thing like progressive carrying of the ball and balls into the box etc.  Contribution is to the team is what most of the rating is made up of… so it’s there but often not analysed.
I know, it’s almost like I stole the line from some other smartass.  Actually it does. I’m not just using Gary Neville’s match ratings of the week.  Yeah and the algorithms rate players on the difference things they do in the game. All players are rated against the same set of data. So it’s only as subjective as a data set is considered important.   Your example is subjective to you. Are you saying you are a better judge of players then a team professionals that do this for a living?   Also in your example of course a goal or assist will be worth more. It’s the aim of the game. Though a DM will be judged on his defensive contribution as well, such as tackles per game or interceptions.  So really, my friend, you have an opinion on what is important to you, and that’s how you view the game. That’s ok but it’s far less objective
[removed]
22 is in all comps. Stop these disingenuous comparisons.
I was obviously talking about before he got injured. He started well and then didn't score for ages. De Bruyne is by no means on another level this season at all.
Best I can do is lamps
I’d be more worried if Chelsea got Enrique than Nagelsmann, both are good options to have obviously but Enrique is the more experienced and successful manager.  Enrique’s Barca was ridiculously good as well, the quality of football they played was top stuff and it wasn’t just slow possession football they were great on the counter attack.
I think Enrique fits the old mold. Short term success. Nags is better to build a project around. But won’t be as effective initially. I do like his flexibility after tuchel and potter.
I'm leaning towards Enrique, for two reasons.  1. We need rigidity more than flexibility. Someone who is dedicated to a style and will push the team to play a very specific way.   2.This is just personal, but I'm extemely bored of all the lazy, one note discourse about "proven winners" and shite like that. I'd really enjoy having a coach where we don't have to hear "Bayern reject" after every loss for once.
I think Nagelsmann’s career has the smoothest upwards trajectory, Luis Enrique started out pretty average with Roma, did okay at Celta, did the treble with Barca and then perhaps completely forgivably underwhelming at Spain   I think Nagelsmann will be better, if he can get the respect of the players
Im not a Chelsea fan but i think they would be better off with Luis Enrique. He is more experienced and i feel he will get more respect from his players. Nagelsman is still just 35, he is undoubtedly talented but the players need someone theyre going to listen to and work hard for immediately and a lot of that comes from the manager being experienced and respected.
Enrique hasn’t done shit without Messi in his Xl
We've had enough of flexibility. We need a defined style.
This is why it’s lazy to call a manager bad. Different teams need different managers at different times.
I mean the teams he’s managed outside of Barca were really poor in quality for the most part and he wasn’t at Roma or Celta for more than a season
See I disagree with that. Tuchel stuck to the wingback formation even when we lacked the players for it, and that was a major part of the poor results during his last 6 or so months. Needs to be a fine line between flexibility and disorganization.
I never called him bad.. it would be completely mental for me to call Enrique or Nagelsmann (whichever one you’re talking about) bad
Sorry, is that an argument for him?
Tuchel stuck to the wingback formation because it was the best formation to accomodate our team. He was being flexible.
Yes that wasn’t directed at you, it was just your example shows he wasn’t the right manager for Roma at that time but for Barca he was. That’s the same for a lot of managers and that’s probably why we get so many changes.
His achievements with Barca are the argument for him
Messi. Argument over.
How dare a manager use good players well!
Ah yes great argument that is  And what about the years Barca won nothing with Messi?
You’re an embarrassment.
Go look at Messi’s time at Barca. They won something every year he was there.
Sorry to disappoint you mate
m8 i see u all over this sub and not one time have you had a good take. educate yourself
Did they win the treble every year?
Apology accepted.
The 69 in your username takes all the weight out of your opinions. Run along.
That’s your barometer? Fuck all the way off.
As someone that does not live in England, nor in Europe for that matter; Manchester United is possibly the single biggest footballing "commodity" to come out of England. David Beckham is the only other comparable thing in terms of football, and he played for United.   The Premier League going for that TV deal in the 90s and exporting itself across the globe was a master-stroke, and Manchester United were at the forefront of that owing to their success and iconic personalities (primarily Fergie, Cantona and Becks in those formative years of the Prem going global in the 90s).  You see kids in impoverished townships over here wearing United jerseys.
They’re the biggest club in England, but most importantly they drive the most clicks and engagement.  What would it look like if they weren’t “untouchable”?
You weren't around in the 90s and 2000s were you?
As a United fan (my opinion, may be wrong) is that it's got pros and cons. We get the most attention and there is plenty of coverage on everything which happens at the club but therefore everything gets magnified a lot more. Any problem or crisis is examined and criticised a lot more than at most other clubs.  Look at the way Chelsea and Liverpool have been performing this season and compare the amount of critical coverage they have received in comparison to our season last year.
Really? We went five Prem games without defeat, even more including cup competitions and Europe, and when we lost it went back to "Utd are finished" "Ten Hag isn't a good manager"
No it’s the quite opposite and everyone apart from united fans hate united
Could have said the exact same about Liverpool during the pandemic and Quad run.
Now imagine being a fan of any of the other 14 teams in the league who are only ever mentioned in the context of whichever big 6 club they're playing next weekend
I dont feel like this at all. They are still the most popular team in england and will therefore be talked about the most.  But i think theyve correctly endured a good amount of scrutiny since fergie left. I dont feel like the majority of their coverage over the last 10 years has been positive at all and rightly so
The more fans the club has, the more demand there is to have them talked about. Not necessarily saying its right, but if sky sports do a bit on man united, people are gonna care more than if they talked about a mid table club.
And more recently Liverpool. Willing them to win the league in recent seasons.
Imagine saying this when the majority of football punditry and media over the last 30 years was filled with either former liverpool/arsenal players and arsenal/Liverpool fans, and in general people who hated seeing United winning back in the 90's and 2000's.  Yes. I'm talking about media and punditry before the time of Rio ferdinand, Hargreaves and Paul Scholes. But even united pundits like Keane, Scholes and Gary Neville have digs at the clubs and players (unless it is Ronaldo)
Hell no. We get absolutely bombarded with criticism and are universally pretty much despised. What on earth kind of straw man theory is this..
You spelled Liverpool wrong
as if they weren’t gassing up liverpool to be the best thing to happen to football during their tinpot ‘golden era’.
It's not perfect but it's exponentially more neutral than the cover 15 years ago.Gary Neville will have his biases like all ex pros but I actually think he's one of the better pundits when it comes to calling a spade a spade.
Them and Liverpool, aye.
Not sure how we can be called Darlings. When we do bad, the media tear us apart. Liverpool and Chelsea are doing awful this season, worse than United have done in the entire time post Fergie.  Hardly anything is being said about it. Not even the state of Chelsea after spending 600M in one window. United have spent 1B over the last 10 years and often get the sneers at how badly we've spent it. Chelsea have done over half of that in 2 windows.
You must be new..
It’s the bread winner mate.
As a United fan this couldn’t feel further from the truth. We’re absolutely vilified and people are drunk on the delusion that there is some conspiracy where we’re paying the refs off.   Gary Neville is probably United’s biggest critic.  Don’t know where half of this perception comes from, honestly.
Overhyped players for a club that won 13 titles in 20 years. Yes, I’m sure they were overhyped for no apparent reason.
Look at the hounding of Maguire, Antony and sancho amongst many others and think about your statement again lol
Only if you watch it on Sky sports or BT it's only because lots of their ex players have gone into punditry. But yeah it seems overly biased at times.   Be a pirate and stream the American channels. I actually think Carragher in comparison somehow manages to come across more neutral than Neville and Scholes.   As a Chelsea fan Joe Cole is neutral even though he's a bit thick. Lampard was great. We need to get JT on to do some proper Chelsea bias.
Same for Liverpool & Arsenal, they have plenty of ex players as pundits and commentators and huge fan bases so it seems logical but it’s a bit frustrating at times.
United get subjected to a completely different set of standards compared to any other club - it's a product of being the biggest, most recognizable, and most popular club in the country / world.  Imagine the different pieces that would be written and produced today if it was United involved in that pathetic 0-0 between Chelsea/Liverpool last night, instead of those 2 "big" clubs?
It's one of, if not the biggest club in the world, and any mention of it gets clicks and interactions. When they aren't doing well, the media is the first to put the kick in. The real question here is, how many more of these boring and quite frankly unimaginative questions about United and their players must we endure on this sub?
No, I don't feel like that at all.
Man united existed in the perfect time in history to capitalise on their fame. If the club were established 40 years earlier or later noone would know they exist.
Are you new to the PL? United get harshly criticized sometimes but they have long been the media (and referee) favorites.
100%...I don't know if any other fans notice but referees and the media always favoured ManUtd, particularly in the Fergie era.   Every controversial decision swayed in their favour. Opponent teams were booked for the same offences the ManUtd players got away with. I saw their games against Chelsea, Liverpool and Arsenal, and sure enough the referees favoured ManUtd.  The media overhyped their players and underplayed the importance of their counterparts in rival teams. Will not take names, but even players who were objectively average are considered Premier League legends just because they were in ManUtd.  Just speaking my mind, please don't hate on me.
Lol there’s a reason the most watch game of the Year is Man United VS Liverpool….   Manchester United are the darlings of English football…
They are though.
It’s so obvious they do it
Them and Liverpool yeh
i'm not too sure about that actually, i think liverpool is treated that way more. for example, manchester united are getting cooked by the media for their away form when liverpool have literally been worse. i do admit that sometimes teams like manchester united, liverpool, and spurs are 'niced' in the media.
Just noticing?
Hell yeah they are ridiculously biased they are like 3 points better off than last season you would think they are 10 points clear at the top of the league ,
Yup. I see people wearing United kits who couldn’t point to Manchester on a map. Folks with no actual connection to the city, just knew they existed and wanted a club to keep up with. I imagine Wrexham will have a similar (albeit smaller) group of global supporters one day.
It clearly is, privileged, and regardless of team sympathy.
They are
What in the nuts are you talking about. Yeah everyone talks about United but by god United gets lambasted by pundits and the media nonstop just as much as they get lauded. As many others say - you talk about United you generate clicks.  LOTS of them.
We dominated for so long that the cool-down period for us not being so popular will simply be a lot longer than normal.  I’m football whoever is currently winning is always the best of all time and the best there will ever be and if you have sustained success then eras and dynasties enter the vocabulary.  In 20 years time it might be city or someone else and United will be one of those “big clubs” like Villa, Forest, Newcastle etc are always described
I really don’t mind how many people love Utd. I get it Fergie deserves all the work he did to get them to the monster they are.   What I have a problem with is how this love is reflective ON the pitch, Utd historically get away with the dumbest shit, and when the players also act like they know this (Bruno being the biggest offender here) is what pisses me off.   A normal Man Utd fan has a seat at my table any day of the week, I don’t care, the wild “we’re getting the quad this year” after a few run of wins are the people I also can’t stand.  But I’m like that with even the same fans who love the same team I do.
No they're not the darling. They get a lot of coverage because of the amount of engagement it generates. However, any little controversy gets blown out of proportion and the media will go on and on about contentious decisions given for United but rarely bother discussing ones which go against them.
In a way, Man United being "England's team" gives the same aura as the Dallas Cowboys being "America's team".  Both are rather similar.
HA! NO!  Everyone loves to shit on us, especially the media.
United are the biggest team in England. Media will exaggerate the positives and the negatives. It drives your interaction when it's on the positive side because you don't like Man United. It drives your interaction when it's on the negative side so you can get in on the Man United hate.   Whenever there is an opportunity to talk about Man United, the media will take it because it's good business.
It's easy...out of nowhere, all of a sudden a post about man utd came out. See, man utd getting a lot of talks from everyone. Like this post.
Sky Sports I mean Eric Ten Hag news .
They definitely were treated like the darling of English Football during the Fergie era. These days they're more like Donald Trump--love them or hate them, they're guaranteed to bring you engagement.
Liverpool and Man U both.
Sky sports northwest
Dunno. I’m watching from the US, and have no real affinity for any team. I feel like the treatment of Liverpool varies from excessive fawning to furious masturbation. It’s vomit inducing.
Name them? Name the pundits on tv that said Arsenal.   I’ve just done my research so we will see.
It's more like: the amount of stupid shit & bullshit speculation around Manchester United is turned up to 9000 compared to anyone else.  Why? Because they say it sells. I'm not sure, but that's what they are betting on.
Thank god I’m not the only one!!
They always have - always will. They’re the most supported club in the UK (although I suspect the number of Liverpool fans ain’t that far behind). So it’s easy to boost ratings by pandering to their fans with rage click bait rants or fawning over them. I actually think it’s worse in other countries though. The Spanish media make everything about Barca and Madrid and the German media is utterly dominated with discussion of Bayern. I suspect we get more respite from United coverage than fans in those countries do of those clubs   It’s honestly less annoying right now when they’re actually doing alright. Was far worse when pundits were calling it a tragedy how they’d fallen off when fans every other club found it hilarious or were apathetic
How old are you? Do you not remember media coverage of United not playing in the FA Cup in 1999 after the FA asked them to play in the Club World Cup instead to boost England’s 2006 World Cup bid?   https://theathletic.com/1498500/2020/01/02/fergies-calls-to-alastair-campbell-hang-gliding-in-brazil-and-trying-to-sign-rivaldo-the-year-manchester-united-pulled-out-of-the-fa-cup/?amp=1
You’re thinking of Liverpool……
But they are the darlings off English football. They've always been been the poster boys of the premier League.
Corrupt six media it’s boring and it’s been known
Cause they are
-Bruno touches a ref with no reaction from the ref himself -The entire footballing world for an entire month goes crazy and compares it to Mitrovic looking like he wanted to kill the official
Spot the noob.
United are, but United are trashed all the time
I think they do, but they blow up the success AND the failures. When the team has a bad run, they love nothing more than to absolutely destroy them. And eveyone piles on like its a national sport! I dont know how some MU players cope with it, playing badly at other clubs wouldn't get you that kind of scrutiny.
Well cause they kind of … are
No shit. Liverpool and United are the only names who can attempt to hold a flame to footballing giants' names like Real, Barca, Bayern, etc. Of course British media is going to favour them for that reason
Does “darling of English football” to you mean “a team I hate and think is shit, but other people on TV who have way more experience and credibility than I don’t seem to hate them as much or think they are as shit as I do, ergo they must favor United”? Because that’s really the only explanation that would make sense.
Sky sports literally grill Manchester United whenever they could.
Not really, they used to for sure but it’s changed a bit with City being so dominant recently, and now Arsenal getting some well deserved recognition. The media darlings getting more attention than their recent history deserves must be Liverpool.
It's Englands; Real Madrid, Juventus, Bayern, PSG, Benfica Ajax etcetera..  Every country has a club like that regardless of form.
It's Liverpool.
No. Instead they put pressure on united the most and want it to be a role model for English football by their standards. Literally they want harry Kane to join united , and pushing it from every end possible.
You’re joking right? We’re the most hated team in England by far. And I wouldn’t want it any other way 😘
Yes. Full Disclosure- I’m Leeds
They are. 😊
Not without reason
SkySports are terrified of Neville, they HAVE to let him commentate on Man United games.  Like when we (Forest) play them at the City Ground next week, if we pull a shock and beat them, it won’t be praise for us from Neville it’ll be another tiresome rant about United.
WFT!!! No way
You see impoverished kids wearing United jerseys in England too!
TL:DR - Yes
In India, they had Man Utd pubs, especiallly in malls. At one point, Man Utd jerseys represented upward mobility in India.
This...  I live in Canada. Most people here don't care about soccer. If you asked them to name one team, it'd most likely be Manchester United
The reigning champions at that time were Leeds
Exactly man, we're literally the biggest English club itw, that's not even me being biased, I think the only ones that come close are either Arsenal or Liverpool, if they mention us they get clicks and that's all they want
United is biggest in terms of popularity. Liverpool is biggest in terms of success.
Liverpool is better success wise but Man U are more marketable and have more fans over the world
In fairness your season was the final conclusion to a year's long narrative around the club and there was a lot of drama around it with Ole sacking, the nature of Ragnicks tenure and the Ronaldo question. For Liverpool at least, yes, it's a very poor season, but there's still credit in the bank for manager and players. If the issues continue into next season then expect it to ramp up massively. Especially as Klopps place at the club will be a huge talking point with him being the longest serving manager.
Liverpool were called the “worst champions ever” despite being nowhere near that. Liverpool and United definitely get it worse than any other team. Chelsea especially seem to fly under the radar.
We don’t even need to go back to the critical coverage of last season. Just look at the critical coverage of any United loss this season vs how Chelsea and Liverpool are discussed in the media.
Same applies to english players, look at the talk about Maguire in comparison to no talk about lindelof not getting game time
To be fair “when you lost” was a 0-7 defeat to your biggest rivals, the joint largest defeat in your history. It wasn’t a little 0-1 game to Villa
Exactly
On the other hand, Luke Shaw has one good half of football… “Best right back in the game??”
\* 7 Hag
Yeah… because of how glorified United are by the media. If the media didn’t lick their asses so much then they’d probably not be so hates by the rest of the teams
it's pain being a villa or forest fan
They told us Liverpool had the best PL team of all time just last season. And VVD the greatest CB of all time. Fucking joke.
I disagree, neville is incredibly bias but it goes both ways. I remember one game earlier in the season and neville would faun over dalot doing the most basic shit. But then he's also uber critical when things aren't going united way. I don't really think of neville as a pundit anymore, for me he's more like aftv and other fan channels.
Hated, adored, never ignored.
Tell me how you were treated like scum ? Tell me how everyone dunking on Chelsea THIS year is any different ?
Don’t sell your club short. Chelsea’s dumpster-fire season is getting plenty of coverage.
Lol that’s just you looking through jaded eyes…
It’s not though
A little different to poor kids in a South African township/informal settlement, most of whom have no access to the internet or satellite broadcasts of Premier League games. But they know who Manchester United are.
There are banks like ICICI who issue manchester united branded credit cards
The exclusive reason I became a City fan as a Canadian in the early 2000s, was because EVERYBODY I was a referee with was a United fan, and I wanted to be an asshole to them.
And I'm letting you know as someone that lives outside the country, since the 90s Manchester United has been the biggest footballing brand "exported" outside the country, with the most recognisable manager (Fergie) and player (Beckham) thrown in for good measure. Their media profile and impact is massive and they drove the popularity of the League.
And?
Liverpool is closer to Utd than Arsenal is to either of those.
Arsenal?
Idk why you’re getting downvoted. People try to invalidate Liverpool’s success because it was either in the past 5 years or 30 years ago. Meanwhile United’s successful years ended a decade ago and hasn’t resurfaced lol.  Liverpool are a more successful club. They have 1 less league title, 3 more Champions leagues, and 3 more overall major trophies than United. Any other way of looking at it is picking and choosing what to notice.
There’s little between the clubs in terms of trophies. But most of Liverpool’s league success is at least 30 years ago barring one PL title. Think it was 1989 before that when they last won a league.  United have by far the more modern success in the PL era.
Erm. No.
Sure that's fair and makes sense. I'm also aware that maybe I think there's more noise as naturally I consume more content around my own team than rivals. But I do still think that the media can tend to exaggerate with United more than others (problems are worse and when we're doing well it's immediately to are we back) perhaps also similar to how Liverpool were looked at prior to the Klopp era.
That would be quite the statement considering he’s…not a right back.
He's a left back and clear
They usually at least get his position right tbf
That’s just football in general, it’s incredibly reactionary. People jump on bandwagons and jump to conclusions thinking that performances go in linear fashion.  X team wins 10 games in a row, best club in the country, they are gonna win trophies vs X team has lost two games in a row, already a failure of a season.   It’s the same with players, it’s essentially the hot hand fallacy in football, X player does well, everyone then expect him to keep doing well, and then once X player drops form he’s, “finished”.   It’s the same for all clubs and all players.
remember when Arteta came 8th in his first 2 seasons.   Arsenals fans wont remind you of that
No, it’s because united have destroyed millions of peoples childhoods so now they have been on a bad patch for quite a long time people are feasting because they are hurt.  The media don’t ass lick united, that’s your delusional mind.
Being a forest fan is a pain for more reasons than that right now, sadly.
It happens whenever Liverpool find themselves in a title race. From 2018-20 their squad was apparently the best thing to ever grace the Premier League, they had the best players, best fans, best manager, best stadium, etc.   In 20-21 they dropped off for much of the season and everyone shut up about them.   Then in 21-22 they were the best thing to ever happen to football again, even though they lost the Prem and UCL to City and Real teams that were nowhere near as good as the City and Real of late 2010's.  And I'm sure if they recover themselves and get back into a title race next season we'll start hearing it all over again
Highest ever points haul is 100. Liverpool got 97, 99, and 92. Won everything possible in a span of 5 years. And people pretend they aren’t in the conversation of best side of all time LOL.   Meanwhile VVD went 65 games without being dribbled past and apparently it’s crazy to call him one of the best defenders. I can’t with football fans sometimes
He has a total blind spot with United - I hate whenever he is co-commentator on their games
There's that punditry after they got smashed by Liverpool where he insisted that United were the better team in the first half and Keane, Micah, Souness and Carragher where trying not to piss themselves and he looked like he was gonna cry 🤣  That's bias. He will defend them to the moon which is expected.
Nobody cares about Chelsea, plus they’ve spent over half a billion in ONE year and 11th in the league! If that was united it would be 100x worse than what Chelsea are getting now.  Why isn’t mudryk who has been awful getting shit from the media like Antony is? Bare in mind Antony has scored against Barca, city, Arsenal and played pretty good in a lot of games yet he’s the one being crucified.
Chelsea hasn’t gotten half the scrutinization they deserve. All we’ve heard since Fergie retired is how much United have spent, and Chelsea gone and spent half that in 6 months to be sitting 11th in the table.
Chelsea have gone from Tuchel to Potter to Lampard (again), signed a truckload of players for over half a billion via accounting loopholes, and are the bottom of teams not scrapping for relegation.  They have definitely been done no favors in media coverage, but it’s hard to argue that they don’t deserve it.
Agreed fellow arsenal fan
One clear instance I recall...Chelsea lost a match 3-2 and finished with 9 men against ManUtd. Fernando Torres was sent off for a tackle from behind. In the same match Giggs went in two-footed from behind and was not sent off! In another instance, Chelsea had won a match at the Old trafford 2-1. Macheda scored with his hand clear as day. Another instance: Liverpool vs ManUtd...supposedly world-class defender Nemanja Vidic was pulling Torres' shirt which stretched for 3-4 feet for atleast 3-4 seconds. Referee did not blow the whistle or book the barbarian Vidic (though Torres scored). Hundreds of such instances...Even recall an Arsenal player posting Howard Webb's photo in ManUtd jersey too. And now Bruno Fernandes gets away with anything.   And let me just take the names of their overrated players - Rio Ferdinand was an absolute clown. Paul Scholes does not stand a chance in front of Lampard or Gerrard as ManUtd fans claim. Also recall ManUtd fans pitching Evra against Ashley Cole (LOL).   Fergie era was truly very toxic!  Thank God VAR is here.
It is with Neville and co always in punditry instead of someone who actually plays for the clubs. I mean I’m watching Arsenal and they start rambling on about Utd when the game becomes a bit stale. What more do I need to say?
Just sounds like Salford tbf that
It was a joke about United supporters…
Manchester United are the biggest club in England too, that and Liverpool. I grew up down south and mostly knew Arsenal, Chelsea and United fans (some other clubs like Liverpool, West Ham and of course my beloved Fulham too). I moved to Manchester 8 years ago and I’ve met exactly one Mancunian Arsenal fan - the only Manc person who supported another club other than United, City or the occasional Liverpool fan (Irish or Scouse family always).   United and Liverpool are supported absolutely everywhere in this country
I got that all the first time. I hope you enjoy supporting a club in a different country.
This is true. For all the shit talk from Liverpool fans about United supporters not being from the region or there being massive bias in the media, they're the only club that can hold a candle to United. Strong support base across the UK and the world, lots of former players in the media etc. Domestically Liverpool are alleged to have basically as many supporters as Arsenal and Chelsea combined. Huuuuge club.
I'd read somewhere it was either Liverpool or Arsenal so I wasn't sure lol, I just knew it was another Red team in the top 6
Yeah in the modern era United have been more successful.  However, overall United aren't that much superior to Liverpool in terms of domestic success while Liverpool have double the European success of United.
Yes I think you're right with similarities to Liverpool. I think both clubs more than any have a huge number of fans and a huge number of people who actively dislike them which is perfect for the media in terms of driving clicks. It could well be that you're right about the way the media treat Utd and I just happen to support the other club that is covered most similarly so it doesn't seem unique to me.
It was funnier when the first guy said it lol
Lol you are right
Nah, it’s faster w/ United, Pepe was written off after 5 games, Sancho was worse and people still believed after a year
Arteta has also spent nearly £400 mil since joining. But let's focus on United flops not Arsenal ones
And won an FA cup...
Garry Neville ‘arsenal will definitely finish third… united will definitely over take them’
They’re not in that conversation. Only clubs in that convo are ~2009 Barca,  ~2016 Madrid, and that disgusting 80s/90s AC Milan team. Liverpool is like 3 tiers below them lmao.  And sorry but it is crazy to call VVD one of the best defenders ever. He is not even close to top 10 all time maybe the edge of top 25. Had a great three year run but that’s it, no longevity or capability to adapt to a different system. Liverpool fans bro you guys kill me
Agreed. Neville is awful on any ManUtd game
They were arguably the better team in the first half though, how is that a statement worth mocking? They had similar xG, they had more shots on target, and the same amount of big chances. It was a close game until Liverpool's second.
Mudryk has played 8 games and joined in January that's why. If he joined in the summer then fair enough.
Neville is the first to criticise a player if they are playing bad or speak bad about united if they are a playing bad. Where you making this stuff up from? You got it in your head cause he’s a ex united player he’s biased?  I’ve never heard someone say that about Neville. Sorry you’re wrong here.
The "nicer" part of Salford
Had a 10 year old ask me for a cig a few days ago
About the same over here (South Africa). United have far and away the largest support, with Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool the next up.  EDIT: Solid amount of Spurs fans about to be fair as well.   We do have a lot of old generation fans of the likes of Palace, Spurs, Leeds, West Ham and Everton, mostly because we have (had) a significant expat population over here, but you don't see too many younger fans outside of United, Pool, Arsenal and Chelsea.  And even with all their success, you don't see too many Man City fans.  The rest of Africa follows a similar trend, although the appeal of Arsenal and Chelsea increases the further north you go because of the high profile African players they have had over the years, and I believe Arsenal has a strong following in Francophone Africa because of their strong French connections with Wenger and the players he brought in.
The only place you won't find a red shirt is Northumberland. Everyone in Newcastle and the surrounding area, as well as pretty much everywhere north of here is Geordie through and through.
I had someone the other day trying to tell me that Leeds were more supported within England than Liverpool, and I think even hinted towards believing they had more than United too. Suggested that because Leeds is a one team city, and that Yorkshire would (apparently) rather support Leeds over other Yorkshire teams, that that meant they had more support, completely forgetting that Liverpool and United have had huge reach throughout the country for decades, and you can't go anywhere without bumping into a fan of one of them.  This is most evident in London and the South East, where there are just so many of them.
Agreed. United and Liverpool are comfortably the biggest 2 in the UK then they are followed by The Old Firm, then it would get to teams like arsenal Chelsea etc.
i’m not claiming we are same level as those 2 but arsenal definitely has great worldwide support i’d say more than liverpool.
Why are you laughing out loud then? 🙃😮‍💨
But he isnt
Pepe wasn't, and Sancho was believed in cause he still has so much time, people forget he's only 22, he was terrorising the Bundesliga at like 20, he had as good of a season in the Bundesliga at 20 as Pepe had in Ligue 1 at like 24, people believed in Sancho cause he had (and still has) so much promise, Ten Hag just needs to figure out how to utilise him cause he did it in the Bundesliga for like 3 seasons in a row, he defo has the potential and has the time
Arteta also has 1 FA cup and 1 community shield in that same time and we all agree the community shield is a glorified friendly.   (And likely a prem but we won't count your chicken yet)   Ten hag has a league cup already in 6 months as manager. In 3 years we will re visit this convo
Ten Hag has stated that we bought Antony for what he could be, not who he is right now  But let's continue to label a 22 yr old in his first season in the prem a flop and compare him to Pepe who's gone back to France at 27
Right, and ten hag is gonna come 3rd 4th and has a league cup, still in FA and still In eufa.  But people keep saying he's a flop
Gary Neville isn’t the whole media also that’s a prediction that a lot of people who aren’t even united fans would have thought
clearly the greatest team of all time is the 1870s Sheffield FC
Bruh I’m talking about the PREMIER LEAGUE
Maybe if your being generous. But 7-0 . Fair play to Neville for not just going home.
He’s played 8 games and done NOTHING   Antony scored in his first 3 games?
Your the first person I’ve heard not say Neville isn’t biased if I’m honest  At the first chance he gets to praise Utd over anyone else he does. Biased af
I think the only Francophone country that you will find more Chelsea fans in is Ivory Coast, which should be fairly obvious why.
Not true. I live in Newcastle and know plenty of glory seekers. Man united fans, Arsenal, Liverpool etc
Yeah great shout
Leeds?
I’ve never seen a Celtic or Rangers shirt here in Australia. I’ve seen many of the ‘big 6’ and even Leicester and Burnley.
Outside of the central belt I don't think anyone really cares all that much about Rangers or Celtic. I know they sell out big grounds every week, but the biggest English teams have a reach beyond their matchday attendance that isn't matched by the Glasgow clubs.
I’ll be here when you say the same thing in 3 more years
League cup is a glorified youth team trophy. We got into the final against Birmingham one year and just let them have the thing because it wasn’t the league or an FA Cup
Maybe you're listening to the wrong people then, because that's fucking stupid
Based 😂
To be fair, I think the Antony hate is a bit overstretched. Some of Mudryk's games have been 10-20 mins so he couldn't really do much. Also he does have an assist.
Ok prove it, show me where he’s being biased. There’s 100’s of clips on YouTube of him in the sky sports studio… I’ll apologise if the video is biased.
Me too, most of them that I know are from south of the river though
If he's still in this position in 3 years then it's a very different story, Pepe was a player approaching his prime who had previously impressed in a league some don't even considered a top 5 league, Sancho was a 20-21 year old who had taken the Bundesliga by storm over 3 seasons, there's a difference
Mate if you’ve watched 20 minutes of Sancho and Pepe you can tell they are miles apart in terms of quality and also style. There’s absolutely no comparison. You’re also just wrong? United players get written off as flops quickly all the time, just look at Antony
Hahahahahahhahahahahahaha "we lost to Birmingham because we didn't care" shut up no that's the best thing I've heard in a while  Your starting line up  Szczesny Sagna Koscielney  Djourou Clichy  Song Wiltshire  Nasri Rosicky Arshavin Van persie  Literally 95% your strongest team that season hahahahhahahahahahahhahahaha   "Gave it to em" no..you fucking lost with your best team out lmaoooooooo  20 shots 1 goal  12 on target  56% possession   You just didn't win. Don't give me that shit hahaha  Edit: naaah I'm still creasing at this comment man, I can't believe what you said
For example, as soon as Utd were playing well he predicted they’d end 2nd with Arsenal 3rd. He said Utd played well against Arsenal when if you look at the stats or if you watched the game you can see Utd were dominated and yet again got lucky. He also said Arsenal would finish 6th this season in his beginning predictions after the aftermath of the previous season while putting that Ten Haag-less Utd in the top 4. So many more examples too. Not just him either, a few seasons back Cahill tried to praise Arsenal against Utd after they played them (Arsenal won that game courtesy of an Auba pen iirc) but Keane interrupted saying something stupid over and over again just to interrupt Cahill. It’s obvious
I think Pepe would have been good if he went to Liverpool back then instead of Arsenal. Our team was in shambles when we bought him. Our style didn’t fit him whatsoever.
You’ve let his views against Arsenal brainwash you so bad you think he’s biased.  As you said United were playing well and that’s not a bad prediction, Arsenal are known bottlers and even you wouldn’t have thought you’d be where you are now in the league.  So all you’ve shown me is he’s hurt you for predicting you to finish 6th and united to do better? Everyone thought the same sorry mate.    Arsenal finishing 6th before a ball was kicked was predicted by everyone not just Neville, every single pundit and fan thought the same so there’s no arguement there.   We battered you in the first leg when Antony scored that peach, the second game you won and was the better team how is that getting lucky?
I think he's an Arsenal fan cause he reportedly turned down offers from us and Liverpool amongst others  Edit: Also he would've been benched, Liverpool had 2 of the best wingers in the world at that time, makes sense he wouldn't want to benched
No,  To say that they would fall behind a team 8 points behind however is absurd considering who Utd had played and who Arsenal had played  Actually most predictions between us (Arsenal fans) were top 4. The majority put Utd out of the top 4 and Chelsea too iirc. Tottenham we’re the only one I remember people saying were nailed on with City and Liverpool   So no. That’s not true considering the majority  Oh your a Utd fan? That explains a lot. And you didn’t batter us. You split us open twice and scored twice, we dominated the game and the other leg. We didn’t deserve to loose that’s for sure.  Keep dreaming…
Arsenal are known bottlers that’s why it’s not a wild prediction, not one person even Arsenal fans thought they’d be 4th now never mind 1st  I don’t remember many saying Arsenal will get top 4 this season? Can you prove me wrong yet? Maybe one or two but majority didn’t have them in top 4 never mind 1st   And you’re an Arsenal fan? 😅 wtf you talking about I’ve spoke facts only  We beat you 3-1 and doubled your shots on target, passing the ball around and not able to penetrate a defence doesn’t mean you’re the better team, you’re not doing well here mate.
 We bought the refs deal with it
Because the FA hates you. Personally. They have made it their mission to make your life as miserable as possible.
7-0 was enough punishment
If I speak I am in trouble.  Last time I said my piece about Bruno I got my first ever Reddit suspension.
They weren’t close to being the same
If Bruno Fernandes didn't play for Man Utd, he'd be considered a sh**house by most fans. Some of y'all hate United more than your own clubs
Not even close to the same thing
https://imgur.io/a/6kiAJ0i  Can't believe Fabinho didn't get a ban either right?  Oh he's not Bruno I forgot, so we don't need to post every other hour about it
Bruno has so much real estate in people’s heads
Was Bruno pissed about something like he always is? Yes. Did he aggressively smack the back of the line judge to get around him? Yes. Did the line judge say anything to the referee? No. Why? Because it must not have been an issue to the assistant referee.  Did Bruno yell obscenities at the assistant referee? No. Did he shove him? No. Did he have to be forced off the pitch by his teammates? No.   There’s a clear difference between the two incidents and hate boners for Bruno. Some of you can see the former, the others need to quit letting Bruno live rent free in their heads.  Edit: My brain: line judge = linesmen = assistant referee 🤦🏻‍♂️
The way Bruno and Manchester United live rent free in people’s heads…it’s been a month now ffs, and they weren’t even the same type of incident 🙄😒
>Can someone please explain why Bruno Fernandes didn’t get the same treatment  &#x200B;  1. Bruno's incident (a slight shove) wasn't as egregious as Mitrovic 2. The linesman initiated physical contact with Bruno 3. The Bruno incident didn't appear in the referee's match report, while Mitrovic situation did. 4. We're Man United. We'll do what we want.
Not even remotely similar incidents
I guess we don't have to wait till Saturday for the weekly Bruno post.  This obsession is just laughable now
Because they weren't even remotely the same
Imagine a Chelsea fan commenting on misconduct against match officials. Remember Bjorn Kuipers?
They aren’t remotely the same. There was no aggression at all by Bruno, it was simply petulant. Mitrovic was aggressive, in the referee’s face, trying to intimidate him. Big difference.
As much as I dislike Bruno... His was a petulant shove, Mitro lost his head.  Yes Bruno should have at least been booked. But they're very different situations.  Bruno shoved and walked away. Mitro got right up in the refs face and continued.
Ffs just move on now
Yes, they were obviously exactly the same in every way. It must just be Manchester United and multiple levels of corruption that are the issue, it couldn’t possibly be anything else…
FFS can we just make a Bruno Fernandes moan mega thread for people at this point..  Look up the numerous other threads started about the same damn thing and stop flooding the subreddit with this same shit over and over
Because there’s a massive difference between the linesman stepping across Bruno while he was trying to get the ball and Bruno moving him out of the way before carrying on and Mitrovic shouting aggressively at a ref, shoving him and then aggressively following him and continuing to shout at him so that United and Fulham players alike had to step in to defend the ref.   Next your going to ask why every foul isn’t punished equally.
Bruno was "touched" by the linesman first and he wasn't all up in his face aggressively trying to get him to change a decision he made. Mitrovic literally attacked the referee and none of us know what he might have said. The two incidents don't even compare.
I'm sure you can figure this one out yourself buddy.
Bruno grabbed the assistant lightly with no aggressiveness after the assistant had physically intervened with him first. Mitrovic was aggressive and abusive towards the ref and then instigated contact.   They are similar to not the same.   Also. Just to be clear, Bruno should’ve received a sanction, probably a game or two ban imo
Still moaning over this???  I'm buying stocks in kleenex seeing as all these wankers keep crying 📈💷
Ask the same about Aguero too. Touched the lineswoman in 2020. Of course you won't ask though.
Let me think.  Haven't I seen this question before?    And the real answer is that this sub would not have any posts if Bruno didn't consistently piss people off.
One was a nudge the other almost fought the refs. If you cant see the difference then you're just biased.
I guess every dream you have includes bruno
Totally different incident. Bruno moved the referee out of the way, after the referee had actually handled Bruno. It was more frustration.   Mitrovic was aggressive, using threatening behaviour and went too far.
Not sure what’s more difficult, Bruno whining or reading and listening to people complain about him.
We have explained it over and over same as everyone including other referees have explained but people like you will never listen and carry on in your fantasy that United get every decision going and world never win a game or score a goal with corrupt referees and the entire FA pulling the strings
They are obviously different situations and at the discretion of the ref involved
Can we stop ?  We discussed this at length when it happened, then when Mitro got sent off, now we're having the same chat again....
You have to factor in the ref initimadtion involved. Anyone would laugh off an approach from Bruno, which can't be said for Mitro
Bruno is one of those players where if he plays for your club, you love him, but everyone else despises him. Suarez was the same.  I agree with the comments saying the two incidents were completely different, but Bruno probably should have faced some sort of punishment. The fact the linesman was fine with what happened says it all imo.
I don’t think they’re the same thing, and while I think Bruno deserved some sort of reprimand for what he did… I think intent comes into it when evaluating too.  Mitrovic is a house, and frankly, I’d be worried if he gets worked up he is liable to do something in the heat of the moment. And I think the FA also assessed a risk of someone who’s actually liable to be a threat.  Bruno is a weasel. The last thing you’re worried about with him is he’d actually follow through on something. At worst, he would instigate and then run and hide behind someone else on the team or fall down and roll around the moment you touched him. Dude is Charmin soft. I don’t think the FA is worried about him confronting anyone.
Because he looks like a rat and people have fond memories of Ratatouille.
I thought it was my turn to complain about Bruno today
Because Fulham is the smallest club in Fulham
Instead of wondering why Bruno didnt get the same punishment as Mitrovic, u might wanna take a look at the problems in ur club first mate
Because the referee began the contact, Bruno just pushed away his hand.
Cos he plays for United mate
Most original r/premierleague post
How about Bruno during their match vs Southampton. Every time the whistle blew, he screamed at the ref.
If you're still trying to compare them then the problem is with you, not the FA/referees.  Seriously, see a therapist if you're still this troubled by it.
ill tell you why, because they wasnt similar at all
Yawn. It’s like all people can do these days is moan about Bruno.
Why are people acting like the two were even alike it's a massive reach
And the reaching continues, sheer difference between Fernandes and Mitrovics actions are pretty clear. Take off your bias glasses and try to be subjective beyond “it’s United”
Mitrovic received a straight red card for pushing Kavanagh. That brought an automatic three-match suspension but the commission imposed an extra three games for violent conduct towards a match official – a charge that Mitrovic had denied – and two for using “improper, abusive, insulting and threatening” language. The Serbia international admitted the latter offence, which also brought the £75,000 fine.  So nothing like the Bruno incident….. move on
Wasn't even remotely similar, I'm sure if the linesman had felt that it was out of order something would have happened.
I wish I could downvote this twice
Because both of them Aren’t similar
I mean, Mitrovic’s ban is fair but Bruno definitely should have been punished as well, just not as harshly
On the real anyone that thinks what Bruno did and what Mitrovic did was the same is as dumb as can be.  Watch the #@%$ videos with an unbiased mind.
It's honestly hilariously corrupt.
😄😅 good one. I needed a laugh.
Yeah its crazy Bruno got away with murdering a ref
The twats that think Bruno’s push was anywhere near as aggressive as mitrovic need to get there heads checked. It’s like referees don’t book people for low key diving but the obvious ones get a yellow.  And the fact that we bought the refs.
  1. Mitrovic retaliated against a decision that nothing to do with him and also he was clearly rushing the ref getting his face and also pushed him.  2. Bruno was held back by the ref first for a pretty basic reaching for the ball issue after it went out. Then proceeded to passive aggressively touch the ref as he went by.  Not the same at all  Other factors too obviously.
God all this crying about Bruno. Stfu already. Let the FA deal with it support your team and live your life.
Here mate i found these in your head  🇵🇹🎩🪄
Because Bruno and Manchester United are paying the refs  Now everyone upvote me
People moaning it’s the not the same thing see right.   But Bruno still put his hands on an official in frustration and the fact that’s not a 1 game ban or retrospective red is a joke.   Yes it’s not as severe as Mitrovic but it absolutely sets the wrong example down to grass roots.   Seen other people comment other players have done it too…. Well, same applies.
One plays for united and the other doesn't?
Hahahahahahahahhahaha Yes, your tears sustain me.
Because context of the incident is very important.
1. Referee didn't see it to brandish a yellow 2. Wasn't even close to the same thing as the Mitro incident 3. He should have been given at least a 1-game suspension after the fact
Because Manchester United get special treatment. Always have and always will. It shouldn’t matter which club it is or what the score is.
If Bruno had any sense of fair play, he'd offer to serve 4 games of it.
More sketchy manu shit
Nowhere near the same, not even sure why people are comparing the two
Balances out casemiros ridiculous bans
I am sick of seeing Bruno crying arround the refs every match.
Massive difference between pushing someone out the way and straight up squaring up to the ref lmao
We still doing this?
The two aren’t the same. Quit crying about Bruno.
Shouldn't you be mad at your team first? Ffs I have seen this question so many times, it's just a meme at this point.
Bruno Fernandes still lives rent free in people's heads.
Stop moaning and start pushing
Ref saw it and dealt with it. So FA didnt intervene. Was a whole ass thing about it, use Google stop farming karma 🤣
To be clear Fernandes actions weren’t as bad. But if Mitrovic is worthy of 8 game ban (which I think he is) then Bruno is worth 3-5. But man united are the biggest club in the country. Still can’t believe that offside goal against city lol
Because one plays for Fulham and one plays for Man Utd
Because Fernandes plays for Manchester United and Mitro doesn’t.
Mitrovic made the simple mistake of not playing for united
Because of a technicality.
If Mitrovic gets 8 then Bruno should get 3-4
Cause MU is FAs team
Cuz nobody wants to see Bruno cry more.
Is Mitrović playing for Man Utd? Exactly.
Mitrovic is a full grown man and Fernandes is a baby.  One is a legitimate physical threat and the other barely qualifies a real man.
Man United fans are the first to throw a tantrum when something doesn't go their way. They don't even have the decency to admit Bruno shouldn't have pushed the linesman and deserved some punishment. We get common brainddead responses instead like " We ArE MaNUniTeD We Do WhAt We WaNt".
It is in Manc dna.
One plays for Manchester United, and the other doesn't.
The difference of playing for the Manchester reds and playing for the London whites
Man United bias obviously
The two incidents were different but both met the minimum for a red. If we’d seen  BF - standard 3 game ban, and AM - lengthened 8 game ban,   then no-one would have complained.   The fact it’s come out as 8-0 is very difficult to defend imo.
This is becoming it's own meme in this sub at this point.
Oh my god people need to let this go!!   Just LET. IT. GO.
The ref had an issue with mitrovic pushing him, the linesman didn't or Bruno would be banned too. Seems simple enough.
This is easy, he plays for Man United
Bruno attacks refs: Refs laugh  Mitrovic attacks refs: Restraining order
Bruno Fernandes plays for Manchester United.  This is a club that had a full on riot, broke into their closed stadium during Covid and had a game called off and all that happens for them was the match was rescheduled for a later date.   So…yeah 🤷‍♂️
Because there's levels to English favoritism.  If you're not on a "big club" and you're foreign, you better not do shit.  Know your role.  Manure squad.... Whatevs.
Because man United and we all know United bought referees during the fergie era and it still leaves remnants here and there in the referee corps
There's never been any bias in the Prem. Ever.   This make perfect sense and is in keeping with the highest refereeing standard know to mankind.   VAR makes everything better.
My personal view, it should have been 3 for Bruno, 10 for Mitrovic (Plus a 3 point deduction and a £1m fine, just to set precedent that this won’t be tolerated)  I don’t care if the ref touched Bruno first, they are not equals. One is an official, one is a player, and any uninvited contact should be met with the full force to the FA.
Wasn't Bruno's the linesman
£30 for a steak dinner and a Big Mac from McDonald's is only £5?
Actually an 8 match ban would've helped Man United to realize how much Bruno sucks. So it's good in a way. Cheers to the games where Bruno will shoot over the bar 4 times.  In fact sometimes I think he doesn't even know that he's supposed to shoot under the bar. He may be thinking he's playing American football.
Maybe if you post about it enough on Reddit the refs will see and give a retroactive ban
Surely a Chelsea fan has more pressing matters to be concerned with?
Answer is Howard Webb
cuz he plays for Man Utd
8 match ban wow never seen something like it
Tbh, Bruno is that type of sidekick in a movie you either love or hate. No in between
What happens when the OP looks at a photo of the actual incidence instead of watching the game.
Was only a Lino, they don't count 😂 there just ransoms off the street now that there's VAR 👀
A novel topic to discuss for the first time.
Are people still acting fucking stupid like it was anything similar or forceful or the fact the assistant touched him first? Yeah, no, fuck off.
Honestly it's because the ref initiated the contact.
Casemiro already suffered for his sins.
We own FA. Satisfied now ?
Different league granted, but Ronaldo only got four games for pushing the ref
Bruno is not scary mitrovich on the other hand looks like he could kill you and your whole family.
Think Bruno probably deserved a red and a 3 game ban but I don't think the officials are supposed to touch the players and I think that's what got him off
The aggressive words Mitro yelled at the ref are the main reason for the red card and the extended ban. Bruno didn't say anything aggressive. There's your reason.
They feel bad for United (7-0)
The assistant ref put his hand on Fernández first. The defence of any charge against him would have used that strongly and rightly so. Also does anyone with a brain think the 2 situations were equally aggressive?  Fernández was being a dick. Mitrovic was being threatening.
8 game ban is ludicrous tbh... he hardly pushed him, he swept his arm with his hand.. FA made it out like it was Di Canio on Paul Alcock.  A 3-game suspension would have been sufficient enough as a reasonable punishment.  The only thing I can think they deemed more ban worthy was getting in the refs face.
As a united fan, i am still baffled how he got anyway with it.  Bruno in that game was a embarrassment
I’m surprised he didn’t get a card to compromise with Liverpool.
Sky 6 mate
As a United fan bruno is annoying with the refs I get it. This whole sub is about bruno being annoying, cool. BUT that was night and day. The ref man handle bruno first, bruno gave that slight push. Also the ref didn’t see it he felt it, had he seen it could of been different maybe felt like a slight touch . Wasn’t ok I agree, and should of been a yellow or warning BUT to continue to compare the two makes no sense, night and day.
Go to youtube and watch the two "pushes".  There is such thing as within the letter of the law but not within the spirit.  When Bruno "pushed a ref" it was not within the spirit of the law.  When Mitrovic "pushed a ref" he was begging for a sending off and extended stay on the sidelines.  He might as well have just popped the ref in the jaw and walked away, it probably would have been a couple matches longer and more satisfying personally for him.
I miss the old Bruno Fernandez and mitrovic
Bruno gave the ref a lat on the back, Mitrovic tried to force the ref's hand down. MASSIVE difference.
Manu get away with it all the time
Eastern european problems in uk
Not this discussion again. Anybody who's been watching this sport for a while knows that bruno's incident is nowhere close to mitro's incident
If you need explaining it to you why then you probably wouldn’t understand the explanation in the first place.
So unfair, just cause one plays in United...
Bruno likes to whine and protest and complaint so often. Just like man utd fans. Thats why they see nothing wrong with the club captain acting such way. Match made in heaven.
Oh good, I'm so glad this topic isn't dead.  Aggression was the obvious difference, to me. Bruno moved past the official while moving the official to the side (you can imagine a "'scuse me mate" in a gruff tone, if that helps), while Mitrovic was far more aggressive and confrontational.  Bruno should have got something - a yellow probably - but they're very different incidents.
If people think the 2 scenarios are even remotely similar you're brain dead
Need some tissues there fella?
A little push versus what mitrovic did lol. Then again players do go down easy if that was them so fair play to the assistant
Best signing since Casemiro
Nice savings bundle there, well done!
Finally a United fan perspective I can actually respect 🫡
This right here!   Refs in our pocket.   Premier League in our pocket.   FA in our pocket.    We run this muthfkin league biotches!   Deal.
Finally a realistic yanited fan. Good on ye mate
And still you lost 7-0 😂😂😂😂😂😂
The ABU salt about this is hilarious, I love it  Comparing mitros actions w Bruno's 😂
At least you admit the truth.  Least delusional yanited fan fr. Kudos
this is why we win everything all the time.
This is the response we need to people who make these kinds of posts
The FA indeed does hate when your outfield player uses their hand in the box (fyi only the keeper can). Which then causes another player to blow up randomly, talking explicits at the referee who attempts to walk away and when the player isn’t getting his way puts hands on the referee. You’re right it’s all a perfectly elaborated scheme by the FA to make Fulham fans miserable and simply not a moment of lost heads by 2 players and a manager.
Fuck this response and the dumb c*nts who think it’s helpful or engaging.
Could’ve scored one more to match your current league position
Liverpool has done fuck all since then.
Not true man. That they were going to get even if he did not push the ref.
Calm down Slippy G
Highlight of our season beating a big club, it’s all we have left 🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥
Lol... Which sub? And what did you write??
Lol
When I said Bruno plays like a dirty rat, no one believed me I suppose.
Idk what you said but from what I saw the reason he didn’t was because the linesman touched him first
No they weren’t. Bruno doesn’t deserve an eight game ban, but he definitely deserved something.
He is a shithouser, nothing to lie about. Each club has at least one. He's ours 😅
biggest club in the country tax
Of course I hate United more than I hate my own club! Lol
Exactly, slight push vs verbally abusing the ref and going so batshit crazy you're about to fight him
Aguero in 2020. If we're all up in arms about touching the ref and taking retrospective action, he should at least be fined.
It doesnt suit their anti Burno agenda so they will ignore it mostly.
So you think Fabinho and Bruno things are same? Lol
Are you fucking retarded? That’s a bad camera angle which shows a tap on the shoulder at most.
He's clearly walking towards the ref. The ref stops abruptly so he uses his hand to avoid walking into him and move away.
He really does. I'm not sure why that is, because his whining and protestations have virtually no effect. He never gets anybody booked, all of the refs are on to him. He's really only doing it for the sake of doing it at this point. But he's great at winding up other teams fans.
That’s true, but it’s still a fair question.
Gonna call him Cranium Headnandes
And there's no fees or charges
It's a mental illness at this point.
Your use of line judge is living in my head rent free!
The line judge?
Shove is a strong word. It wasn’t a bloody shove, it was a slight push. A shove would indicate the ref was almost falling over.  Are people over reacting about Mitro like he knocked the guy out. Yes.   Did Bruno touch an official, yes. Is the rule you shouldn’t touch the officials. Yes.
precedent noun /ˈprɛsɪd(ə)nt/ an earlier event or action that is regarded as an example or guide to be considered in subsequent similar circumstances.  I'd you don't understand why it's a bad idea to touch refs you shouldn't say anything then. Yelling things at linemen - yellow, touching - straight red, anything over that - Mitrovic treatment.
No no, you don't get it.    You see Mitrovic had his hand on an official, so did Bruno = SAME. EXACT. THING.
Everyone ignores that the ref initiated contact with Bruno too
And it's these very people who won't,ever, ask about similar incidents in the past. Ask this guy about Aguero 2020 and he'll just shut up.
Spot on.
Do what you want? Did you want to lose 7-0 to your biggest rival. Not even going to mention the 5-0 and 4-0 last year lol.
They weren’t the same intensity but one got 8 game ban and the other 0 punishment, it seems weird if you want to set a strict precedent on touching referees
If a player touches you first and you respond, aren’t both of you getting carded?
Imo he should have been given a straight red and therefore a 3 match ban.  The assistant physically intervened because of Bruno’s behaviour. He didn’t just touch him because he was annoyed at Bruno or something.  Bruno’s little push was an act of petulance. It’s what you see from a toddler when they are being told to do something as they learn the rules of the world.   It doesn’t need to be overly aggressive imo. If you touch a ref in a act of frustration or petulance you should be getting sent off. It should be zero tolerance.
Hated, adored, never ignored
Because he’s a cheating, moaning, ridiculous twat mainly.
https://imgur.io/a/6kiAJ0i  So this is a red too yeh?  Or is it because he's not a united player  Or is it because he's playing against united?   I'd argue making a point of running up to the ref and doing the same thing is worse than doing it to get past
Well maybe the linesman should also get a 1 game ban too for initiating it.
Mitrovic bought and paid for his eight game ban. Bruno at most, at the very most, would be a one game ban for contact.
Boo!  Did I scare you? I'm 26th February 2023
Actually, if Bruno had gotten some game bans, we would see less of his face.
Wouldn’t mind a 3 game respite from Bruno rolling around in the grass.
And I suppose you qualify as a "real man" for sitting behind a screen and calling a professional footballer who plays in the PL a "baby"?
scouse too apparently since the donkey fabinho did the same thing
At this point I couldn't give a shit that everyone is complaining.
You can’t just make up rules.  The question people are asking is ‘why, within the context of the rules was one person punished and one not?’ Not what punishment should be given in your head  And the answer is that one was really a nothing incident - Bruno was held back a couple of times by the ref who then pushed him as he ran past - whereas Mitrovic pushed the ref to be able to get into his face and almost square up to him. If you think they’re the same then you haven’t watched both incidents
The problem with your point is the referee initiates the contact with Bruno. So does that referee get a ban as well? You cant have uninvited contact that's okay going one way and ban someone for uninvited contact the other way. The referees can't be seen to act as superior to everyone else involved in the game. They all need to work together to manage it properly.
Ooooh satire
Abusive language was cited as well.
And it’s not just that game. His attitude and behaviour his season has been atrocious.
This whole stinking sub has just become a “bruno fernandes is annoying sub”. We’re witnessing some of the best premier league football in a while. Post some good topics and convos. So much to cover. 3 managers just got smoked and ol’ lampard is about to manage Chelsea. Instead we wanna chit chat about ol’ Bruno. Jesus Christ.
Bought them waaaay before Casemiro
Who cares about winning the league when you can own the league
Did you just type with an accent?
A realistic arse fan would be one that realizes they’re not winning the league.
At least united aren't avoiding relegation on goal difference
How is this comment being down voted?? 😂😂
Lol valid burn. Wear those downvotes with pride 😂
United fans grumpy
And where does that put ur team?  Edit : Hurts being at the bottom half of the table init?
And fuck the people who post the same shit over and over again because they're *still* not over something that happened weeks ago, and are so obsessed with United that they can barely pay attention to their own teams.
or one less to match our ucl total
We could finish at the bottom and it would never diminish how much I enjoyed seeing that game live. 😎
You got beat by sporting....
and?
Exactly, let us have this moment please
gary neville is that rly u?!
Nice try. On here.
Me on Manu sub, they said Bruno is the first to throw hands when shit hits the fan and I said the only thing he can throw is fits, vile cheat of a player.
The lino should have taken the piss by throwing himself to the ground and rolling around holding his face. Taste of his own medicine.
Yeh agree with that. Maybe a yellow. Feels roughly equivalent to strongly complaining about a decision.
Yeah, in the moment maybe a yellow card. Yellow cards get missed all the time, what's your problem? You want them to start examining every incident and retroactively booking people now? Get over it.
Does the linesperson deserve something for starting that little tickle fight that you're all getting bent over shape about?
Idk didn’t the linesman touch him too?
Bruno got away with him because the lino nudged  him first  It's why he didn't put a complaint in
*world*
If De Gea hadn’t stepped in when he did Mitrovic would have probably done something worse.
I’m stunned that touching a referee with the clear intention of moving him outta the way is overlooked. Wonder if it would be an every match occurrence what Bruno done, it would be all good for y’all.
The slight push is besides the point. It's the principal. You can't put your hands on the ref. Yes the 2 incidents are at completely different ends of the spectrum. Automatic red card, players learn quick.
It's not an agenda. Bruno cheats in a number of ways: dives, fights the ref for a card every tackle and moans all game every game.   It's facts: he cheats because he knows he isn't talented enough to win honestly.
Read your Reddit username, read your comment, and reflect on your life you absolute weapon.
Yeah, a tap on the shoulder
He's easy to dislike. He's the type I'd had to play alongside.  Pretty sure it's about as shallow as that for most people.
It really isn’t even close to the same thing. If you wanna talk injustice, Casemiro’s neck ban (which was correct) when we saw two other players do the same thing in the same video but got nothing.
Not at this point, it's done.  It's been way too long.
We’re not judging his footballing ability, we’re judging his petulance.
Maybe Mitrovic is a weak shover
IDK, seems like the ref has decency, cause any player would have flopped to the ground from that 'shove'....
Don't even have to go that far back. Fabinho shoved the referee in the exact same game. Ask them what they think the punishment for that should be!
We'll do what we want.
Someone's nibbly today.
Congratulations on your 7up Cup
We wanted to lose obviously.
So they weren’t the same thing?  Glad we cleared that up.
Bruno didn't initiate. He didn't get carded. It wasn't even mentioned by the ref in the match report.  Mitrovic did not just haphazardly get an 8 match ban. The red card is 3, the FA decided to hand another 3 on top because he full on yanked the referee and was ready to fight him had de gea not stepped in. His insults and word exchange after (yet another thing Bruno didn't do) meant he received an additional 2 game ban, same as Silva got for the same reason.  Did Bruno deserve something? Sure. A yellow, maybe even a red, couple of games and that's it. But that doesn't negate how bad this incident is, and more importantly, how incomparable the two are.
But it depends on how you respond, Bruno lightly pushed the linesman and considering the circumstances of that game the ref was happy to let it slide. I don't see anything wrong with that but comparing it to what Mitrovic did is just miles off imo.
Also football doesn’t tolerate “response” if someone kicked you and you kick back: both of you get the red
>The assistant physically intervened because of Bruno’s behaviour.  You mean the behavior of trying to get on with the game?  Bruno hadn't even gotten to Trent to try and get the ball back, ref was already hindering Bruno from just getting the ball to take the throw in.  This ref could have done nothing, or perhaps told Trent to let the ball go since it wasn't a Liverpool ball at that point.  There was no separating of players because they players hadn't even come into contact, they never did because the ref got in the way.    &#x200B;  >It should be zero tolerance.  There are lots of things that are clear in the laws yet they don't always get punished accordingly.  Take for example unsporting play.  This whole issue started because Trent is trying to run away with the ball instead of let United take the throw, yet no card was given to him either.  How often during each game do we see play like this yet the refs just let it slide?  If more yellows were handed out it would happen less and the game would move on, but it's not.
If the red or var had led to a red I certainly wouldn’t have thought it harsh or unfair (not a United fan for the record). But as nothing was done I feel a sanction after the match would’ve been fine also. 3 matches? Sure  I wasn’t trying to trivialise or excuse Bruno. Just pointing out that the two circumstances were different.
Also Bruno wasn’t doing it to get past, even if he was… his actioned weren’t necessary
Yes it’s a red. Get your hands off the damn officials.  What’s hard to understand?
At the _very_ most he would have been yellow carded at the time. The ref maybe could have had a word.   But that's it.
You weren’t supposed to bite
Cause no Arsenal player would ever go down easy.....
Ah yeah because your players never dive do they
Everyone keeps saying this, but it makes the wrong assumption that players and officials are equals   They’re not  Was the ref wrong to grab him, yes, was Bruno even more wrong to push the ref back, yes. The red should have been reprimanded after the game, the player should have been sent off because 2 wrongs do not make a right.  In the same way being fouled by a player and reacting by a shove is a bookable offence
Not for this season bud
nø
Yarp
Indeed. I don't think we'll win the league. Our remaining fixtures are very difficult, and your blue masters will go on their typical run.  Would be pleased as fuck to be proven wrong, and either way I'm so happy with the team this season.
Aaaaaand there’s the idiocy we all know and hate from you morons. Had us going there for a second 🍻
Just the champions league
You realise you have one of the most expensive teams ever assembled right?
Ah yes, Man Utd and West Ham, very similar financial situations.
Because throwing stones in a glass house
Because of the amount of bitter mancs on this sub (although I hardly imagine many of them are from Manchester)
I will, the entire man utd subreddit came out here to downvote me 😂😂😂😂😂😂
8th
Says the guy who isn't even brave enough for a club flair 🙄
Considering the amount of money your club has, you’re underachieving
It puts our team without a 7-0 thrashing this season mate 😂😂😂
The banned was announced yesterday dude and that’s why that person is reacting now 😂
Boom
Actually you’re spot on. You have exactly 7 UCL losses to Madrid.
How did you put the  Liverpool badge beside your username
Is there a word to describe when someone else's failure means more to you than your own success?
I’d take the 7-0 just to see you not get champions league and lose out on Bellingham and other key signings!   Guess it’s worked out for us both 😉
We're talking about the Prem. Stay focused son.
And nothing.
Just want to clarify: It was removed by Reddit, so the suspension was for all of Reddit, not just this sub.
Was it the one about him being compared to kdb?
He can throw himself to the ground as well
I'm a united fan and to be honest I can't stand that side of Bruno I thinks it's sad and pathetic. And with that attitude I don't think he should be captain. Cassemiro or varane would be much of a better choice
If the lino was clawed in the face I’m sure he would have gone down
Shit I love Bruno but this would’ve been amazing haha!
I don't think we'd be able to complain if Bruno had gotten a red for it. But either way, there's absolutely no comparing that to what mitrovic did.
You fully agreed with what I said, then got angry at me over a strawman.
Downvoted to oblivion but from what I recall the linesman definitely put his hand on Bruno first which commentary also pointed out at the time.
Mfer probably put a hit on the ref
I don't get what you're on about, are you agreeing or disagreeing?
And the principle\* was that Bruno was moving the ref out of his way after he grabbed him so that he could continue play. Mitro was trying to attack the ref. We've seen players do what Bruno did a million times over the years to no punishment. Ref was standing in the way, Bruno moved him. Simple as.
Red touched Bruno. Bruno touched red. Both had the same force. This is a non issue
>you absolute weapon.  I love that the British repurpose mundane, everyday words as such brutal insults. You lot are all miserable bastards and channel all of that into purely creative profanity. I absolutely love it.
Ayew literally punched Fred in the face clear as day and nothing happened
You seen the size of the lad? I don’t think so 😂
Ref was also born and raised in Manchester and as Silva rightly said in his post match interview, we’ve had clear issues with him before. Namely the West Ham game where now one of their goals should have stood and the FA apologised to us after the match.
"It was a mishtake sir"
Obviously they arn’t the same, he even acknowledged that, he was pointing out that one got a deserved punishment and the other got away with none. I mean it wasn’t nearly as bad, but in what world of football, has it ever been okay to put hands onto the referee or officials? That’s the point people are making, not ‘why is Bruno getting away with it when he did it just as bad’
But it wasn't even remotely close to kicking someone, so this is a false equivalency
FA have already stated they can't give a red card after the fact, only decide the length of a ban when a red  and is given.  Because the ref dealt with it on the pitch and  o card was issued, FA won't just GIVE bruno a ban. Would be a huge issue for football if they could just remove players for what THEY see fit after the incident   Getting a red card and deciding the ban is fine  Giving bans even though the ref decided not to is not OK if you want football to be even remotely enjoyable.
Putting your hands on an official is only a booking? Are you are man united fan by any chance?
Your comment make it sound like all decisions are black and white. They're not. The ref was wrong to grab Bruno and that resulted in him slightly pushing the ref. The push wouldn't have happened if the ref hadn't got involved. There's a cause and effect.   That's where your argument falls down. You cant take the push without factoring in why he pushed him. That's why Mitrovic deserves his punishment and Bruno deserves no punishment.
You will have one of the most expensive relegated teams, oh wait you already have that honour
Great point West Ham has that Ted Lasso money now
West ham are repeatedly in the richest list, above clubs like Dortmund. They are underperforming for what they are valued
Hardly, the financial situations of the two teams are not even remotely similar
Yup. You lost 7-0 to 8th place.
Pot, meet kettle
Where's your flair then pal?
My bad there. Didnt notice i dont have one
Just accept that you lost this one, and move on.
Wow that’s a bad shout. Not even factually correct either.
For the moment you were kinda holding your own with the comeback then you fucked it 🤡
My schadenfreude won’t impact our standings either way. But considering it was my first live Premier League game and I flew across the Atlantic fully expecting to lose… it was a nice day.
Not specifically but pettiness is a good shout
They're not mutually exclusive though. Liverpool have been absolutely awful, and that's the takeaway from this season. HOWEVER, the United result was fucking hilarious. And it would still be just as hilarious even if Liverpool were doing worse.
yup both parties seem happy enough. would love to hear some tips and tricks about europa league since united have spent so much time there recently
Not sure why you’d feel that way. Rivalries can make the games more fun to watch, but I don’t want to see Man U’s competitiveness drop. The (relatively) more even skill distribution and resulting unpredictability are what make the PL so damn good.
Literally it’s hilarious 😂 but they need something to be happy about. It’s been a tough season for them, so the small wins matter just as much as the trophies.
You are doing well after a tremendous amount of time being shit, you got no leg to stand on giving Liverpool shit.
first top 4 finish in 7 years and suddenly every arsenal fan wants all the smoke. pipe down
*cries in no ucl*
Yeah fair enough I don't know how suspensions work. And yes it was a week ban which I appealed down to 3 days lol. Yeah for all of Reddit 🤣 I will behave now sir I swear.
I had it happen in /r/reddevils when talking about cigarettes (using the word fags), 3 weeks after my suspension was lifted I won the appeal to have my suspension lifted...
Like Gakpo?
I see flaws in all three of those choices.  Rashy would make a better captain than that trio.
Clearly, you should NOT be a United fan in that case. You just don't fit into the culture.
My captain <3
Even Dermot Gallagher said it wasn’t a punishable situation.
Yep, this sub is just more Anything But United hysteria
They put out the hit!
Bruno should at least get a yellow.
When have we ever seen a player push a referee in the back? And in what reality is OK for players to push a referee out of the way while he's trying to do his job. I would have been fine if Mitro had gotten 10 weeks. No one is disputing that. Doesn't change the fact that what Bruno did wasn't ok either.
Exactly. I was dumbfounded when I saw that. People are just mad a Bruno because he is so hated.
Cause no other team has had an issue with a ref?
Every ref in the league is shit it's not about you lol
So the thing with Bruno was not brought up at the time so it would require going back in retroactively red carding him in an incident that the linesman didn't even make a deal out of. The mitrovik thing was done on center stage for the world to see in the middle of a shitshow. Mitrovic didn't leave anyone any other choice than to red card him. These things are not even close. Also the Bruno thing could be construed as an attempt to get by the ref. When they say putting hands on a referee that is certainly not what they mean.    Bottom line is that it didn't deserve a retroactive red card for Bruno.
refs shouldn’t deliberately put their hands on players first, he initiated hand contact.
Both kicking a shin and touching the ref are prohibited actions, so no, it is not a false equivalence.
I disagree. Players can be cited after the match in rugby Union and it doesn’t impact the enjoyment of that sport.   I know the framework isn’t in place now, but it is possible to have at the top level of sport, and I’d argue it should be there for all sports
Why can’t they be black or white?  If you touch a ref without permission, red card, every time. This is the ONLY sport that tolerates Dissent and disrespect to officials…  So if a ref splits up a scrap, it’s fair game to shove them because it’s just a reaction? And they wonder why there’s a shortage of refs across the leagues… and why Ref abuse is so common, especially compared to other sports.  We need to fully change the culture towards officials in this League, adopting from rugby. Only captains to approach unless invited/instructed, microphones on, call them Sir.  It’s unlikely, but when we get the Gov’s independent regulator, I hope Ref abuse by players and Fans is a top priority.
And you have the record for worst loss this season, 7-0 😂😂😂
Nate Shelley is gonna come in and save us from the drop 😂😂😂
If you think West Ham have more money than Man Utd then idk what to say really
The valuation of a club isn’t equitable to the active financial station they have in terms of spending power for example, and the amount of people that have upvoted you is quite frankly bizarre lol. Lots of bitter mancs I guess
Apart from both being owned by dicks
Fair play for wearing that 'we're shit ' banner so well.
Don't support a prem team. And I'm not on here responding to comments slagging off other fans just for who they support
Don’t recall not accepting it 😂 thought we was all bantering. Guess when it comes to Liverpool not so easy for them to take it but I’m sure that beat ManUtd 7-0 will be an amazing highlight with the rest your trophies this season.
No one even thinks of you as a rival, move on.
https://m.aiscore.com/head-to-head/soccer-liverpool-vs-real-madrid
My guy, I can respect this as a United fan. I'd feel the same way if I was in your shoes.
30 years from now, nobody's gonna remember where Liverpool finishes this season, unless it's no. 1 or bottom 3. That result is in the history books tho.
It’s best to learn on the fly.. assuming you don’t end up In the conference league 😘
I think you’ll need tips for the conference league, united couldn’t give you any on that part. Good luck though 🥲
bold of you to assume your small clubs going to get in the europa league.
I’d rather a rival be below us in the league and not get CL than get it and potentially get Bellingham and an couple more big signings which then will most likely end up Liverpool winning the league and CL again in no time…
Small win? 7-0 against your biggest rivals?   It's crazy how many United fans, and even fans of other PL teams, try to diminish that result. (well United fans have an obvious reason to)... If that result happened in my country, the losing team would not hear the end of it, and for a good fucking reason
Actually I do because this is a Premier League football sub and you can give anyone shit if you want to. Don't be so defensive over banter.
I quit smoking 10 years ago. Nasty habit.
>And yes it was a week ban which I appealed down to 3 days lol.  Mitrovic was looking for you buddy.
Noo you gotta fight the power 👊🏻
Maybe you can help Mitrovic appeal
If I start seeing Gakpo do it every match I'll make fun of him as well
Ra7i0
Fr, Fabinho did something almost exactly the same and people don't even mention it, Bruno's is talked about so much more cause people hate him, its fucking mad, yes he maybe should've gotten a warning or yellow but I wanna see some of these reddit geniuses explain how Bruno apparently committed 15 war crimes with that shove or something while Fabinho did absolutely nothing whatsoever
I’m not saying a retroactive card is worth while because tbh he’s gotten away with it. I just don’t understand the limp wrist of the FA at times. I think the quality of reffing has increased this season, the diving is being largely ignored or even carded and the game now flows more seeing as the ref will rather give adv then stop play and I’m a fan of that. But it won’t continue if the FA are so wish washy. That’s all. People are annoyed and confused why at the time Bruno gets nothing and it’s not the same for others. Though true Mitrovic went about it like a truly unprofessional man baby. But still would it not be better if they both got what was fair rather then it be a wish washy affair 🤷🏻‍♂️ that’s all, I think that’s all what other people feel also
Cmon that’s such a poor excuse, what so it was self defence? Can the captain of a football team not keep it together when the ref is literally pulling him to one side to tell him to calm down? Instead he has to push the ref in response? I can’t see how so many excuses are being made. The reality is a player who is also the captain of one of the big six can’t keep his composure and then acts like a man baby. Pushing refs and diving like he’d been shot from the stands. Maybe not a 8 match ban but a red card was fair and yet wasn’t given, so people are understandably confused. The rules are simple and I thought everyone agreed that no hands are to be put on the ref, yet you have a bunch of Mancs crying that Bruno is somehow in the right or valid? It’s baffling
Exactly. If you shin kick the ref, you can get a lifelong ban not 3 match thing. Touching officials is much much much much more punishable than footballers
https://imgur.io/a/6kiAJ0i  So this is a red too yeh?  Or is it because he's not a united player  Or is it because he's playing against united?   I'd argue making a point of running up to the ref and doing the same thing is worse than doing it to get past    Bruno is rent free in your heads
Kicking a ref in the shin would easily get you red, kicking another player might just get a talking to.....
I agree. If only the Premier league was as good as rugby in these areas, let's start with mics on the refs so these arguments have some validity.
It's absolutely not the only support that tolerates it. Go and watch Baseball or Basketball and you'll see that they both also have people disrespecting officials.  Surely you can see how silly that would be? Someone accidentally touches the ref and they get sent off. That would be black and white as well as stupid.  It's not fair game to shove them but in the Bruno case it wasn't exactly breaking up a scrap. He stopped him following Trent.  The reason there's a shortage of refs has little to do with top level football. It's because of parents in kids football and idiots in adult football. Believe me I've experienced it first hand.  I agree with only captains being able to speak with them and then having microphones. I'm not sure calling them sir would have any point considering they're all adults choosing to be there.  Personally I don't see an independent regulator helping with anything but the financial side of football.
Flexing another team's win, could never be me
Not even, Liverpool won 9-0 first time vs Bournemouth. People already forgot?
Ye are flying lads, that goal difference is getting better by the minute
You are too good to drop this man!! I am so sorry Moyes was left to put crosses into east London for so long….
Fornals, scamacca and countless others were bought for way more than what the rest of the teams are usually spending outside top 6. Hey blame bitterness of others for your blindness
I’ll drink to that!
So who do you support?
The only trophy United have this season is a Mickey mouse cup and a bruised ego 💀
It might be a pointless trophy, but Liverpool do already have one this season. Your banter was good at first, but the quality dropped quickly. Let it go.
Liverpool has had a poor season, But somehow your poor attempts at a comeback are worse. Take what little pride you have left and run off.
Thanks for proving my point. There’s a 0-0 right there.
This.
right i figured you would want to keep the tips to yourself seeing you will be trying to win europa again next year : )
SOMEONE FIND ME A SPURS FAN

It’s a small win in the wider scale of the season. Does that sentence make you feel better? You’ve beaten United, well done. Here’s your trophy, let’s just pretend that small loss for United in the grand scale of the season is minuscule. As they’re achieving so much, possible top four and possibly two more trophies which would correct me if I’m wrong but would make Manchester United the most decorated club in England overtaking which club?
That’s fair enough. Good day.
bruno can blink and people on social media will act like he just done a genocide
this isn’t that deep to be writing paragraphs and i didn’t say it was self defence it’s just that when someone initiates hand contact first they’re already breaking that no contact barrier, bruno didn’t randomly touch him nor was their any malicious intent. Too show how dumb crying over this is: Fabinho done the EXACT same thing last season but instead ran towards the ref and lightly tapped him and as expected: no backlash or people crying about that.
and yet again, this all falls on the ref/officials if they clearly felt like bruno’s harmless tap hadn’t warranted any punishment then why are you guys sitting here bemoaning.
No, I’m only highlighting how bad Man Utd are compared to what they used to be, West Ham haven’t been good this season, but even we don’t lose 7-0 to Liverpool and it is a very funny score 😂😂😂
I said worst, not highest scoring, you kinda expect Bournemouth to get thrashed by Liverpool, you don’t expect Man Utd to get thrashed by Liverpool, therefore Man Utd’s score is worse as it’s all relative
Still not as bad as 7-0 though mate 😂😂😂
It’s ok, hopefully today means he either gets better or gets sacked
Now compare the last five years rather than one completely unorthodox transfer window for my club  Also fornals cost £28m, so not sure what you’re on about really
A team in non league
The only trophy Liverpool won is the beat Man Utd trophy 😭😭 and multiple bruised egos.
My bad dawg 🥲
[definitely you after typing that out](https://images.app.goo.gl/K933JYthCrhnBm5w5) but really and truly it’s not a comeback. It’s just a fact 🫶
You didn’t prove anything? You literally have lost to  Real Madrid 7 times? Are you like dyslexic. You said it’s false and I literally showed you the stats between the two clubs stating out of the amount times they’ve played. They’ve lost seven times lol
Naw we like to share to teams following in our footsteps 😁
aston villa scored 7 past you too, your point?
He's a great person off the field too I'm pretty sure
Yeah cause he is a scum cunt
I know I was saying that because it’s just a weird statement, like a child, we’ll be did it first type of thing. Bruno was being a mug and the ref was like hey mate stop being a muggy lil man baby, I think that’s fair for an official who officiates the game to do no? As for the fab, it was different, light tap like ‘hey cmon man’ not a push away like ‘fuck off’ I’m not saying have Bruno banned for 8 games but like a word or a card is fair, same thing with fab if that’s what happens then fine. Refs in the game get next to no respect so this precedent of now pushing them is not great to see so yeah, Bruno should of had some level of accountability
>No, I’m only highlighting how bad Man Utd are compared to what they used to be  And they say we are the ones stuck in the past
Ok fair enough.
One game losing 7-0 is zero points. Getting smacked  a weekly basis is consistently zero points. I think I know what matters at the end of the season but hey the championship is fun
This is an embarrassing look.
Anderson, Haller, paqueta all bought different years in the last five years for  40 million plus. All flops.  Nice try kiddo but west ham is richer than other prem teams but can't actually do good business on or off the pitch
They won the community shield which is included on the Manchester United website as part of their 'major honours'.
The only trophy United have won in half a decade is the Mickey Mouse version of the FA Cup
All good. Still love you.
There’s nothing factual about it.
Ah I see, I thought you said 7 in a row, my mistake.   FWIW, mixing numbers up would be dyspraxic, not dyslexic.
my point is 7
same fanbase who wank over suarez
Bruno complains to the ref a lot  One of your biggest cult legends is a racist who bites people  Sit down, you can't talk
fabinho one was different to bruno’s? how funny, just a second ago it was ‘NO CONTACT SHOULD BE MADE TOWARDS THE REF’ and yet somehow you’re ironically here justifying and excusing Fab for doing it himself, you can’t make this shit up, they both tapped the ref in the exact same manner and in the exact same way. This is ridiculous
Who tf is they mate 😂😂😂 Man Utd aren’t stuck in the past as everyone knows they aren’t gonna win the title any time soon
We literally just beat Southampton at the weekend, but ok mate, even if we go down rice is still going to arsenal 😂😂😂
5-1 is not good but it’s better than 7-0
Have you compared the past 5 years spending yet between West Ham and Man Utd?
Fair play. Always love this argument of what’s a major trophy and what’s not. The argument always settles down to my club won it so it is. My rival won it so it isn’t. It’s funny but hey it’s reddit
Feel like Liverpool fans forgetting that couldn’t win dogshite for 30 years. That’s three decades. That’s 6 half decades. We’ve stayed competitive lol
*over half a decade
There’s nothing factual about it. Then please educate us, how many times have Madrid and Liverpool played and how many times has Liverpool lost to them? I’ll give you a clue it’s [7 wins to Madrid](https://m.aiscore.com/head-to-head/soccer-liverpool-vs-real-madrid) [1 draw outta 10 (this source is eufa ;))](https://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/history/h2h/50051/7889/) and [3 wins to Liverpool](https://www.11v11.com/teams/liverpool/tab/opposingTeams/opposition/Real%20Madrid/). Now I’m not a mathematician but that’s multiple sources, even eufa saying they’ve played 10 times. Madrid won 70% of those games. 70% of 10 is 7. Not very factual? I think you need to have a word with eufa. Maybe the delusions are hitting and you think Ramos is still playing for Madrid and Salah managed to get his revenge 😭🤣🤣
No you’re dyslexic because you can’t read, not because you mixed up numbers but ngl I do appreciate you teaching me that. Thank you, because I think I might have that.
nope still not getting it
Literally watch either of them they are objectively different but equally if the ref thought it was a push not a tap to get his attention then I would back that decision 🤷🏻‍♂️ the issue is Bruno’s was a push to the ref because the ref was trying to tell Bruno to stop being a mug, Fabinho taped the refs shoulder because he didn’t agree with the call. They are objectively different. But again if the ref didn’t like it then i would back that decision but equally it wasn’t the same as Bruno who aggressively shoved the ref
Good to see. But in all honesty, who would replace him that is going to do better? And if you guys do go down, who better to bring you back up?
Perspective is so important. He's done a great job.
The fact Forest aren't down and out already is incredible. That amount of upheaval in one summer has never been done before and no one expected it to work.  I don't think Cooper is some top top manager in the making, but he's clearly done a fine job.
Love this. Hope ye stay up!
Don't particularly like your club, but respect for doing that. No one should sack a manager with less than ten games left, especially with no immediate replacement in mind.
Good to see. Wish we had stuck by Farke.
We love you cooper, we do
Nice to see that the club stuck up for their manager for once
They put out a statement? What's next, a vote of confidence?  (I kid, I want Forest to stay up - my best mate's a fan. But that's the "how to sack a manager" playbook being followed to the letter.)
It’s so tight at the bottom half that any of these clubs would be crazy to sack their manager, but especially those that have just been promoted. Forest have a Championship level squad and Cooper has done great things for them. Not like they’re sitting rock bottom
Forest will stay up.  Southampton are almost gone, Leicester are finished and Bournemouth lack any quality whatsoever.
I understand he did a great job last season but the form lately is alarming it's a gamble for sure.
Forest should really be on 15-20 points, Cooper has overachieved already.
Well done Forrest 👏
On the home form table, Forest are 12th.  One the away form table, Forest are 20th.  Seems a bit pointless, sacking the manager - he obviously knows how to get results, the team just travels badly. 2 or 3 signings in the summer, and you'll have a team capable of work away from home.
Forest aren't _badly_ run but they're definitely strangely run. Cooper has been almost sacked TWICE but he's he's signed a 5 year contract in between.  Who would Cooper be replaced by anyway? This isn't a great Forest team so not sure who'd do a lot better
Cooper is tactically inept and has sub choices are beyond all reason.
They’ll take points at villa park this weekend! Most ‘villa’ thing you’d expect.
Exactly.  I always think it's a stupid decision when a manager has worked a miracle to get you promoted, to then sack them when relegation looks likely.  We are probably going to have to fight our way back from the championship again, Cooper is best available to do that
I agree, but it's not our owner's usual MO.  Usually it's a straight sacking with the successor appointed within minutes or hours.
I don't think the squad forest have now is championship level , they have some decent star players in the squad
>Forest have a Championship level squad     The only players at Forest that were there last season are Worrall, Mckenna, Yates, Johnson and Mighten. So Hardly championship level
Booo. Booo this man!
Lol, that sounds familiar. Where have I heard that before?  Oh yeah, it's been said about every single Forest manager of the last 25 years.  I'll give you extra points for creativity, normally it's referred to as "bizarre substitutions" when a manager makes a tactical change the layman doesn't like or brings on a sub who isn't their darling
See Kompany next season. He’s now a great manager getting Burnley promotion. When they start losing and are near the bottom he’ll probably be a bad manager.
It's also been a difficult season rebuilding basically the entire team, and not really having a consistent starring group because of the frequency of injuries.
Yeah maybe I’m being a bit harsh but outside of Navas and Johnson I just don’t see it. IMO they’re in the bottom three based on talent
Cannot forget the ginger Pirlo Jack Colback
Yes master class subs like putting worrall on as a forward I applaud this genius play. I swear cooper is just having a laugh at the fans expense this season
When did he put Worrall on as a forward?
I think it was the wolves game
And you are wrong.  Worrall went into a back three. I was there
I believe he didn’t renew his contract with CBS and is now commentating on golf for the LIV tour
Yeah he never did come back for this season. He didn't renew his contract and instead went on to do LIV golf and iirc he does football for Chicago Fire.or another MLS club.
You mean NBC
I do indeed
Scholes ... He scores goals Paul Scholes!
They all played different roles. Scholes technically the best. Offensively Lampard was a freak. Gerrard was the best all rounder.
Gerrard   Most complete out of the 3, could play in both Lampard and Scholes’s roles and perform just as good if not better.
I think Steven Gerrard
I think for some reason Scholes' legacy has taken a hammering online since he retired, probably from people who aren't even old enough to really remember him. They just point to his rotational/utility role in Sven's England team as "proof" that he wasn't as good as Lampard and Gerrard.   Scholes was actually a magical centre mid, especially in the late 90s when he still had some pace about him. And Sven utilised him in other positions because his versatility was an *asset*, not because he was just trying to make room for better midfielders like some would have you believe. Fergie did the same thing now and then.  I think it's very difficult to choose between these three players as they all had slightly different roles and strengths which aren't actually all that comparable, but I think it's criminal how so many people discard Scholes from the conversation.
I can't comment on which was the best, but I remember watching Paul Scholes and how much he influenced the game with his quickness and how fast he could read and play the game.  He was a force in the midfield.
Me.
Who I want to say right now; Hendo  Right now; bellingham.  Who I want to say historically; Gerrard  Historically; Bobby Charlton
What role was scholes ?
AM in the early years, CM for most of his career.
Because until the midfield in front of him decided they didn’t feel like working anymore he was always an acceptable luxury in defence. Who cared if we conceded a goal every so often when he was in double digit assists and winning games for us on his own.   As for why he doesn’t move further forward? Lack of RB backup, our summer signing backup RB has been injured almost all season and has had no impact on the first team. Gomez is similarly unreliable and also not much better at RB than Trent.   Also Salah, why would you move Trent into a RM/RW position when you already have one of the worlds top RW’s in your squad. As for a right sided central midfielder? He’ll be expected to defend just as much there as he is at RB.
Because Klopp heavily favors 4-3-3.  Trent would really thrive in a 3-5-2 or 4-4-2 where he plays as the wide right midfielder, but Klopp doesn't like those formations.
Trents biggest weakness as a defender is his awareness. To be a centre midfielder one of the biggest assets is awareness, keeping your head on a swivel etc. If trent played centre mid he would get found out even more
He's not good enough.  He's not good enough receiving the ball in tight spaces on the turn, isn't physical enough shielding the ball with body positioning, isn't the best at carrying the ball.  He needs to be in open space deep in a channel or receiving the ball in space on an overlap or overload to be effective with the ball.
He is not good in midfield. His tracking is shambles, easily bullied, super slow in half turns and his close control is not that very good.. He is super good in attacking and half decent in defending but is totally unaware on positioning and opponent movements around him.. He needs to reinvent himself , he rode this for 4-5 years now.. people notice your shortcomings and use it for their advantage...
1. He is not that good on the ball, he is not holding midfielder, he has great technique from the wing, but thats just it, midfidler needs much more than that 2. You need to defend as a midfielder 3. Why would you create positions for players that are not goon enough on their spot? Just bench or sell and move on, In his current form, he is noway near starting XI.
Cause he's not a midfield player, doesn't have those skills. He only had half the skills needed as a fullback as it is. He is a  luxury player that Liverpool cant afford anymore cause they aren't dominating anymore.
I’d like to see it tried this season since we haven’t got anything to lose, play Gomez at RB and have him act as a 3rd CB like Walker has done at City a lot of the time and let Trent either drop deep and dictate your or get forward.  His ability to drive with the ball is genuinely underrated he just doesn’t do it often enough because he opts to pass it since he can get the ball forward quicker and more effectively that way but his dribbling is honestly at a good level even in tight areas.
He cannot track his man. He still can’t tell you were Vinny Jr is to this day. And tracking him was his ONLY job in that final  Now if you lose your man as a RB, maybe they get in a good cross, get 0.2xG… Becker probably saves it.  Now if you’re losing your man in midfield, you’re not blocking passing lanes, you will be getting sliced up with nasty penetrating passes straight through the centre of the pitch. That ball, over the span of 90 minutes, will be going straight to the striker at multiple points for high xG chances.
I don't think it would work at Liverpool.   MF need to defend at Lfc so if you assume he's bad at defending it doesn't make sense.  He has a good understanding with Salah in tight spaces but he needs more time on the ball to deliver those killer passes. Being a RB gives him the space to do that.  As he is asked to push up the field and press he needs cover. Atm our whole MF and defence is a mess, Robbo is having a good season and the lack of cover on TAA side is an obvious liability in the system for teams to exploit. We leak but we are also lacking goals so we need creative bodies up front too.  With time he'll know better and better when to push and when to play deeper, but atm the whole system isn't working and he's held accountable for far too much responsibility for it. It's because he was a big part of it when it was fine tuned.  Yet I do agree he's a conundrum and needs an adapted system partly revolving around him. England MF is also packed up, he should be a super sub for them. I'm french and couldn't understand why he wasn't brought on against France during the WC.
TAA would really be an assest to a team that plays 3atb...as wingback he would really shine more than a fullback
Because he only has one skill. Snapping crosses from the halfway line. Can't do anything else, and his only "skill" is crossing where he only uses to get loads of assist because he spammed them so often to Salah who was offside all the time but the refs wanked them off. Sorry for the rant it's an upsetting topic for me. Needed to let it out
Best reply to this question I’ve seen
Great take
I'd love to see that too!
It comes down to positioning too, which isn’t all on him, he’s expected to be a winger when attacking   Then the opponent wins the ball and attacks the space behind him that one of the mids is supposed to cover while he’s up. The mids are just old and not as mobile to do that  The ball moves faster than a player
I actually think his ability in tight areas is his most underrated attribute along with his dribbling, he just doesn’t show it enough because he opts to use his passing.  Edit: and I’ll also say that I’ve watched Henderson in midfield the past 8-10 years and he has never been good in tight areas or at dribbling and for the most part has been fairly good.
This has to be one of the worst takes on a really low quality sub.
It was tried in one game for England, he was not great there  I don’t think people should try and reinvent the wheel here.. get the midfield covering for him again so he can go back to his attacking best without being entirely exposed, or sign a right back capable of defending in the premier league
All his technical attributes are very good, dunno why people are acting like they aren’t on here it’s like they’ve never watched him.
I would agree but kieran trippier plays in a very similar role in the Newcastle team and copes very well.
I'm not sure if you're mega biased or don't watch football.  Trent is not press resistant and whenever he receives the ball in tight spots he either passes it directly backwards or loses the ball.  Henderson is absolutely good in tight spaces, receiving the ball with his back to goal and playing short one touch passes.
Haha...you're a real mean girl
I mean one game isn’t anywhere near enough time to be able to say it does or doesn’t work especially for England where creative players tend to suffer.  Getting a midfield that can actually run and cover will make a massive difference I agree but this season we might as well experiment and try something different rather than staying with the same thing that isn’t working.
If you think Henderson is good in tight spaces but Trent isn’t then it’s clear you don’t watch Liverpool very much
Other points were spot on but I don't think he's that bad in tight spaces. He needs time on the ball to shine but his one touch game is fine. With Salah back around 2018/20 and even with Henderson they were having wonderful link-up plays, even if it's not his main attribute
Yeah I mean if you completely lose ground on the top 4 race then why not try it? I just don’t personally think it will work off the ball, I think he could do a job in opening up defences but not sure his positioning is up to scratch
You ain't got a scoobie lad, have a nice day.
It’s possible it wouldn’t work off the ball but honestly it can’t be worse than what’s already happening in midfield it’s absolutely dire at the minute.
Thanks for proving me right
Coming from a Southampton fan PAHAHA
Probably watches Liverpool a few times a season and thinks he can know better than someone that watches every game
What does us being shit have to do with me watching Liverpool?
Mrs is a Liverpool fan, watched probably 80%
Now there is a great reply.  Well Done!!
Its pretty harmless but its also been handled fairly weird. Just a social media post no fanfare no award seems kind of pointless
I think it’s a good idea overall, however having this dribs and drabs approach to induction is weird.   In the NFL they have a whole day assigned to it, speeches, a bit of a fuss, if you’re aiming for a hall of fame, that’s the way to do it.   It could maybe be attached to the community shield?? Either day of or day before/after. Have the inductees out at Wembley to do speeches and take the awards before the game or something.   Like if you’re gonna do it, why do a half measure.   Also side note, saw Cole got inducted the other day and was shocked he had “only” 3 league titles, just feels like for a player who was so good for so long, I had in my head that he had like 5-7 league titles haha
It feels very american and all a bit pointless. I know some football fans who didnt even know it existed.   Its doing no harm though so we may as well keep it but its a really minor thing which hasnt caught the attention of a lot of people.
Personally I think it's pretty pointless. If you watch how the NFL handled the hall of fame they actually celebrate the players going in and make them feel special in one big event. The way the Prem is doing it is like it's trying not to be too American while doing something incredibly American. Why not just do it all at the end of the season and have a yearly presentation, at least that would be better than a tweet at a random time.
Trouble is, football existed before 1992.
It's fine, but I guarantee they'll dilute the shit out of it until it's not special any more. We're only in the third year of it and already the nominees are looking pretty uninspiring. Jermaine Defoe? Michael Carrick? Good players, but come on.
It would be if they fully committed to it and made it a big event. It’s always good to celebrate the history of the game & allowing new fans to learn.   Every Hall of Fame turns into a farce eventually with questionable names inducted, and the premier league already has a couple within 2/3 years of its existence. Fans shouldn’t be able to vote. I wish it was a more prestigious and exclusive club.
I think it's unnecessary. Everyone should know who HOFs are.  Just another way to make sure no one before 1992 gets any recognition or credit.
😂 How can you ask everyone to stop making low effort posts when that is exactly what your question is
You have become the very thing you swore to destroy.
This is the most low effort post I’ve seen
Ferdhinando
Ali Dia
Pre-saudi Ronaldo
Definitely Harry Maguire 😁
Pogba
De Bruyne
Me.
Casemiro
Ledley King
Emile Heskey
Jordan Zemura  Agree or argue with the wall
Yan Dhanda
This post itself is low effort lmao.
Guys stop trolling it’s obviously Dele Alli
Umtiti
this post is awful 🤣
Tom Cleverley!
100%.
Him.
Chelsea and Liverpool have more fans. And “If jt bleeds, it leads.” And Chelsea and Liverpool are gushing.
They pander to the size of the fan bases. Chelsea and Liverpool will have more global fans watching Sky Sports than all of the other teams that played yesterday combined.
Be glad your not Scottish, you'd think only Celtic and The Rangers were in the league
I stayed up after Everton-Spurs to hear a bit of post match analysis on the Newcastle-ManU game, still excited about one of our better wins of the season and they just talked about ManU the whole time.
Bigger teams get more coverage because that’s where the money is.   Also us being shite and Chelsea being equally shite and in managerial turmoil is a licence to print money for journalists/pundits.
Bigger teams have more fans and eyes on them so they get more coverage.  Big teams being shit have even more eyes on them so even more coverage
That must be terrible. I guess SPL supporters must not time in very much?  Just follow their own forums etc
Newcastle fans wanted to hear how good they were. All other fans wanted to hear how bad United were.
If you're moving to Chichester then you're best bet for a decent atmosphere nearby will probably be Portsmouth.   Best atmospheres are generally up north. St James Park, City Ground, Elland Road. Best in London is probably Arsenal right now but may depend if they continue their great form and tickets will be difficult to get.
Millwall
I am guessing you mean in the PL so I’ll go with Everton
Thanks a lot. I heard that crystal palace can be pretty good especially when playing against other London clubs? But maybe it is impossible to get tickets for this
That’s not exactly local lol
If you buy membership you should be able to get home tickets for Palace fairly easily
Palace have a good core of 'ultra' fans who keep it going. Not been to Palace myself but their away fans do keep singing all game so would a good shout as well.
Palace have the best premier league London atmosphere for sure. I would definitely recommend a trip, it’s a good time
Broja hurt - bad knee injury. Have theory that Potter was forced to not play Auba as club wanted to force him out. DD Fofana still raw and young. That being said, need to try something different because Kai isn’t getting it done.
I know right. The fans are such idiots. Why don’t they choose who starts??? It’s so simple!
Let’s see Toddles didn’t buy one . Obviously thought wingers could do it all .   Broja long term injury   DD Fofana  reserves   Auba  Having a good time somewhere on the planet as he’s being frozen out
Broja is out for the season. Comes back from injury late summer. Id love to see Fofana start more, he always look lively but he is also unfinished and we need experience to fight for survival in the Premier League. God that last sentence just hurts to say, but its the harsh truth
Broja is injured, Aubameyang is shite and on his way out and Fofana is probably seen more as a prospect
Another let's all laugh Chelsea post🤣 Seriously though we don't have any Prem level strikers. Bit of a oversight by Chief overlord Boehly.
they don't have a prem level striker. havertz the best of a very bad bunch
Don’t have one lol 😂 Auba is past it and DDF is too young and Broja tore his ACL
Fuck knows
hahaha youre so funny, great sarcasm   no need to be disrespectful bro, im just trying to understand why
He bought Nkunku so clearly that's waffle
I still don’t know why they’re freezing Auba
We are not fighting for survival. Calm down its already bad enough.
Who doesn't join until the summer. And is another Havertz/Felix position not a actual striker.
Only 12 points down to 18th and we cant score to save our lives. We better start hoping 39 points is enough to stay up at this rate. We cant even buy a win anymore either
>Who doesn't join until the summer  So?  >And is another Havertz/Felix position not a actual striker.  You haven't watched him, gotcha.
You crazy yank
I said so,because signing Nkunku isn't going to help us this season. Which is what op meant.  I've watched bits of him, tbh I don't watch every game in Europe! he looks like a improved version of Havertz and plays the same sort of position as Felix.  He can finish but isn't a proper striker like Haaland, Nunez, Costa, Drogba ect you really have only just started watching football Buddy 🏈 Gotcha.
Im not an american though
>I said so,because signing Nkunku isn't going to help us this season.  This season has been irrelevant since August.  >I've watched bits of him,  Highlights on youtube?
Yes highlights on YouTube. I don't have time or care to watch bundesliga 👍 dude you could get into a argument on your own in a broken telephone box .
Right so maybe don't waffle about players you have no clue about
Rashford vs Bukayo Saka who is the better English winger?
Too much work for something that can be extrapolated with your mind most of the time.
So you want a physics engine with 3d representation that completely accurately places the components into the field to simulate the flight of the ball knowing all variables such as shot power, ball striking placement, deflection placement etc. For free. From a random Redditor?  Mate if this was available sky or stat companies would pay thousands for it
I see Mudryk has joined Reddit
They do it in cricket. Ball tracking to review LBWs.
A Man United fan crying about officials being biased for Newcastle, we are though the looking glass now folks
Tranmere rovers super fan, Mike dean cant ref every match. In fact i think he is already retired
I'd applaud this half decent bit of ironic parody were it not for the fact I fully believe you're genuine.  Anthony Taylor is an incredibly well known united fan, he gets to ref games involving united, city and any other potential rivals to united all the time  and he's not the only one either.
Don't worry mate.Sir Alex influence is still pretty strong.
I think the only thing up there with the mistreatment of Man U from referees would be how unfairly society treats bankers. Truly, I say this with all sincerity.
I think it's hilarious that a Man U fan is claiming that they're hard done to by referees. You've had some decisions go against you - just like literally every other team in the league. It's the hundreds of little decisions that show the bias. For example, when we played you at OT and Sabitzer studded Faes in the thigh, the ref didn't give a foul and VAR didn't even look at it, even though everyone agreed it should have been red. Just after, Mendy put in a full-blooded but fair tackle on Rashford and won the ball, yet he was given a yellow because Rashford screamed and rolled around, and all the Man U players went whining to the ref. Where's the bias against Man U there?
As a Liverpool fan we often get refs that either involve refs born in the Manchester area or are publicly known United fans in games involving both Manchester clubs. Everytime we face United or City it seems we get these kinds of refs. I think it either happened last weekend when we played City or the last time we played United.   I don’t feel bad at all for United fans. You’ve gotten more than enough favorable decisions over the years
Yess, yesssss give me your man utd tears 💦💦 it only gives me more powerrrr
Aren't 50% of premier League referees from the greater Manchester area?
Same way that it's somehow okay that most premier league refs are from Manchester
They should bring refs from Scotland and Ireland tbh, that way, we can have unbiased refereeing in PL
Hahahahahahaha crying. Sobbing. This is too sad
😂 yeah Man Utd never get any decisions their way you’re right.
Amoeba playing a violin dot gif
I’m a United fan but where do you draw the line.
The chances of someone training to be a referee and not being a fan of a club is incredibly low. Throughout the season there will always be games that impact the referees team, it’s unavoidable. It just happens. You’ll never get a top flight referee who doesn’t care about football themselves. If you’re lucky you’ll have some who support non league teams or something
Whatever happened to shame?
r/soccercirclejerk ... you got another one
>I fear United will suffer at the hands of the refs again.   Hilarious.
How is it okay that, Michael Oliver, ~~a Newcastle United fan~~, is allowed to be ~~the~~ an official ~~in the match between Man Utd and Brentford, when Man Utd and Newcastle are fighting for 3rd/4th places~~?  🤷‍♂️
Jealousy clouds people's judgement and renders them incapable of differentiating right from wrong.
Truly a historic occasion
Yes that’s he’s shown so many red cards to United players over the years, right?
Taylor’s declared team is Altrincham.
>Anthony Taylor is an incredibly well known united fan  Lmao fucking delusion
We've taken 4 points from a possible 12 in matches reffed by Taylor this season. He was even the ref for our 0-0 draw against Southampton where Casemiro was sent off and we had several strong penalty shouts turned down.
What proof do you have that Anthony Taylor is a United fan? I don’t think he’s, otherwise he’d not be so biased against United in every United match he’s officiated.
Lol, that’s why we have so many decisions against us than in favor of us, right?
Lol, Sabitzer barely touched him with his stud. Yes, he raised his foot, but he was totally control and only just about had a soft touch.   This sub is unbelievably anti-United despite United being mediocre for years. Amazing levels of jealousy.
You guys are literally so favored by the refs until the term LiVARpool was born, wdym😂
Lol, you guys are the darlings of the officials. Since Klopp claimed “United gets lots of penalties”, we stopped getting penalties altogether, regardless of the foul occurs or not. Klopp has never been punished by the FA despite his continuous antics on the sidelines.  Referee’s Liverpool bias is a proven fact. https://www.empireofthekop.com/2022/01/25/liverpool-fans-will-be-shocked-by-research-on-referee-biases-towards-jurgen-klopps-men-and-other-premier-league-outfits/
No, they're all from Yate
‘Ireland’  Everyone there supports Man U or Liverpool lol the problem would be far worse
There should be foreign referees.
But in this case his favourite team is in direct competition - as in, they literally have the same amount of points on the table - with Manchester United with less than a third of the season to go. And the stakes are high: Champions League football is extremely important for both clubs.   It's very, very strange that he's allowed to referee this game. It's as if an Arsenal fan was allowed to referee City's games during the run-in.
6 including double yellows. Compared to the 11 he’s shown City and the 8 he’s shown both Newcastle and Chelsea.
Shut the fuck up?
Yeah because  if he declared himself to be a united fan he would be able to officiate about 4 games a season.  I know for an absolute fact he's a united fan. I knew his partners niece, this was before he was even reffing in the premier league and I was informed he, like the rest of his family are big united fans.  Isn't it more than a little strange that there's all these top flight refs, a good number of which are from the greater Manchester area and not a single one of them support the club who do nothing but go on about how many fans they have?
His family are season ticket holders at Old Trafford
Tell me you're a united fan not from Manchester without telling me you're a united fan not from Manchester. Everybody in Manchester knows he is a red you clown.
Can’t comment on the penalties but that Casemiro challenge was a red all day. A 4 match ban was harsh but it was definitely a red
You'll be down voted to hell if you say anything remotely in favour of United. That's the price of our success under SAF.
It always been like this. The top teams always have a bias. Remember Madrid Vs Man U? The Nani red? We also have some dodgy calls. Like Keane blatantly trying to injure viera getting away with only a yellow.
And long before VAR, there was Fergie time. Sit down.
United had plenty of matches that would not end until United scored the winning goal
Forgot football started in the last few years 😂😂😂
You’re basing this because of a study that says LFC gets issued fewer yellow and red cards?  Someone needs to fit you for a straight jacket and take that tin foil off your head.  It also shows Man U is preferentially treated if you want to swallow that pill.
Finally, someone with an objective opinion.
Depends on how many games he officiated between these sides. Also, United never really had brutal players like City had in Nigel De Jong and Newcastle had in Joey Barton. Brutal players get more red cards.
Well I heard from his cousins sisters ex that he actually supports City, so why should we believe you? A clearly biased city fan with a chip on your shoulder? Clown
Lmao calling me a plastic doesn't take away from you being proper fucking delusional. Absolute shite talk, everyone in Manchester knows he's a United fan aye? 😂😂
Not saying it was, just pointing out that it happened. If he was bias towards us he would have ignored it.
No. Casemiro got the ball. Lavia wasn't given red on the same round of games. It's always United players who are punished, other teams get away with it easily.
Happens all the time on this subreddit. The most annoying thing is people who just downvote without actually debating the point, they just see you're a United fan and go hurr durr United bad.
Yes and that’s the past, livarpool is still the present.
His cousins sister would also be his cousin, clown.
They didn’t call you plastic, try reading.
I didn't call you a plastic, you've done that entirely by yourself. At least you're self-aware.   He's born and bred in wythenshawe, anybody from manchester will know that's very much a united supporting hotbed area.   People from wythenshawe dont tend to support altrincham for a start, but even if you ignore that, didn't know he was a united fan and accept they did support altrincham, Nobody supports just altrincham.   you think he would grow up as a fan of football, surrounded by united and city with all his family and friends supporting one or the other and decide to solely support non-league altrincham? You would have to be one seriously deluded individual to believe that. It's like a diabetic obese kid saying he doesn't like chocolate or cake and only eats veg.
‘Getting the ball’ does not make any and all tackles legal
Correct.  United are the past and Liverpool are much more relevant
Depends. It was a 50-50 ball. He actually got the entirity of the ball. But the ball is round and at the same time it bounced off the other player, so his studs ended up landing on the player, but without any injury. It was a yellow and no more.   Lavia had worse foul but didn't have anything. But because Casemiro plays for United, refs know they have to punish them more, even if unfair, to satisfy the British media, to satisfy people like you, who are jealous of United's historic success.
That’s true, things change with time. We were great, maybe something during Mourinho, and now we’re not. Liverpool did great under Klopp, but having a slump right now. City has been the most consistent top performing team for awhile now, but nobody likes to accept that.
The bias is insane with this one, yes it was a 50-50 ball but the moment Casemiro jumped off the ground to slide tackle made it a foul as that action isn’t allow, it would’ve been a yellow but then he got unfortunate and rolled his foot over the ball sending his studs into the other players ankle with extreme velocity. It’s a red, an unfortunate red but a red nonetheless
Arsenal have been the most consistent top performing team this season, but nobody likes to accept that.
You said it yourself, this season. Try to maintain it for 3 seasons then we’ll talk.
Try to maintain it for 3 games, then I’ll accept your invitation to talk.
Get an away win
Where the hell have you found people calling him a flop?
Enzo is a really, really good player. I watched him a few times for Benfica and of course in the World Cup.   He will show his quality for any club. It’s just a pity he’s right smack bang in the middle of that skip fire that Boely built. Chelsea are a shambles at the minute and I don’t know who in their right mind will take that on and more importantly succeed. You need a really strong willed coach to grab that club by the scruff. Fortunately for the rest of us Chelsea fired that guy at the start of the season.
Oh I love Enzo he has been fantastic. People are calling him a flop? He has been the one positive light for me
He’s definitely legit
I think at a certain point we are gonna have to have a discussion about how players signed from the Portuguese league seem to generally settle better in the PL than those signed from the Bundesliga.   People consider the Bundesliga a much higher standard (which I’m not disputing) but the success rate for transfers from Portuguese league teams to premier league seems pretty damn high.   Like I know people will shit on Nunez but even he’s in double digits for us in G+A this season and honestly is one of the better performers in the team when we’re playing this poorly.   But even if you go back to when Bruno Fernandes was signed to United, he slotted in that squad and became the main man from minute one.   I hope more clubs take scouting there more seriously. I reckon Goncalo Ramos will be the next big money move over here.
I think you are mistaking him with murdryk
Really good player don’t know how he got man of the match though
Who the hell is saying he's a flop? lol
No one who has watched him has called him a flop. In fact, I haven’t seen anyone, anywhere call him a flop.   OP may have been speaking to a moron, who knows
Forgetting Haaland,DeBruyne,Gundagon,Akanje,Konate,Thiago,Havertz?
I didn't say anyone called him a flop. I meant there was the possibility he could have been a flop because it's quite common to happen to players we sign for high amounts.
I’d say that Haaland, De Bruyne and Thiago were far from Bundesliga made. Havertz has been ok but he’s hardly been anywhere near as good as expected.
O…k….
He could still be a flop. It’s only been what? 3 months and but since he arrived. Seen loads of players start good and then flop. He’d have been at Chelsea for 6 months and be under 3 managers, never know how he’ll be used under a new coach
That's a long record to hold.
Fun fact, no club has lost a game when leading at 2 seconds before the final whistle
They also let Liverpool score 7 on them this season
https://twitter.com/Betfred/status/1643569423150727168?s=20
No shit the commentators love to remind everyone every other week.
"Has never"......"since 1984"  Contradiction
Sketchy.
> never  > since 1984
What about Brighton 2-3 Man Utd when Man Utd were awarded a game-winning penalty after the full time whistle?
It's actually 8 this season in the Premier League - just 7 in a single game.
Lord 😂😂😂
Really? I've not heard commentators mention this before
Well I’ll be damned
They were tied so in conclusion, the incredibly shocking fact stands
When you look at it like that, averaging 4 per game is not bad. right? right??
1-1 on games  3 points each  5th & 8th
"Maths"
I was just clarifying the goals scored situation.
Turns out turning up at a club, and immediately ripping up the established leadership team and then handing one of the vice captaincy slots to a bloke who'd literally never played for the club before was bad for club morale! Who knew!
As a Leeds fan, I was gutted to see Gerrard go, he'd lost the dressing room and I knew once Emery came in, they were safe but he exceeded expectations.  Interesting few seasons ahead if Villa back him financially
9 points in 11 compared to 32 points from 16 for Emery. UTV
He’s a quality manager that’s why. Been around the block and knows his stuff. A proper manager.
We’re just quietly going about our business. It’s delightful. Southgate doesn’t want our players and the media prefers to write about our opponents than us. At the moment, that is suiting us down to the ground. The less spotlight, the better as we continue to climb the table. The football we’re playing is amazing. The defence is rock solid (2 goals conceded in this unbeaten run of six) and Ollie is firing on all cylinders.  It’s truly amazing what an actual coach can do. I don’t think we’ve had someone of this quality in my lifetime.
Villa team must have been so sick and tired of listening to all those clichés.   Gerrard as a footballer, great. But, from his interviews as manager and motivator, perhaps not so brilliant......
I mean emery is by far a better and more experienced manager than Gerard.
Goes to show you that a large part of why Emery failed at Arsenal had more to do with Arsenal’s poor management structure than the coach itself.
It's of no real surprise. Villa had a midtable squad with an inept manager in Gerrard. They sacked him and got a very decent one and now they're where they ought to be.   It was always very clear Gerrard was clueless but he's a liverpool legend and the scouse media machine is very strong so it took much longer than it should have to become obvious to everyone.
Gerrard was like King Midas in reverse. King Midas with a curse. Everything he touched turned to lead instead of gold.
He had won like 5 European trophies with like not the top top sides it has something about him.  What it’s doing at villa is really nothing but short of a miracle like
It was clear Gerrard was clueless but Emery is doing a fantastic job.
Emery is perfect for Villa.
The squad and team Emery had with Arsenal was not a fit. A Villa and Villareal are proof of his skill!
Emery is a very capable coach, making great strides with Villa. You'll still get people commenting just "good ebening" here though.
He is definitely a quality manager for sure. He has great great moments with us, but it was the second season where all went very wrong. I wish Mr. "Good Ebening" to become successful with his AV and add one more UEL to his name!
Emery is very good at making a squad solid defensively. He’s done a good job at Villa so far.
Difference between world class and rookie manager.
Unai Emery is an insanely good manager
Emery is a far more experienced manager than Gerrard. Also he changed the way the team plays, it will be interesting how they improve next season.
What’s hilarious as a Villa fan is the constant media talk about Chelsea and how they need to fight for Europe spots etc, when we’ve been on the same points as them for weeks and have now leapfrogged them and Fulham.
Shows how shit the Scottish league is . Shows Emery is underated.
I'd rather have Tim Sherwood than Gerrard and I'm not even joking.
Since Emery being appointed*
Emery is a good had coach. I just think arsenal was a massive project and after him the owners realized how big.
The very first game with Emery was already huge, I don’t know what happened there but it was clear the players didn’t want Gerrard and would never perform with him
Gerrard always looked out of his depth........
Unai turned Villa Park into Emeryvilla. Keep going so they end up in Europa ~~Conference~~ League.
Good Ebening
Good ebening
He was your typical English manager.
Tactically inept
Emery will likely get a bigger job offer if the good form continues before villa can really enjoy it. That’s the way it seems to go these days
Villa are ahead of Liverpool   **LMFAO**
Tbf the point difference in the mid table has been minimal all year so moving up 10 spots may not be that much of a difference in points as it seems but still very obvious the difference between a manager like Gerrard out of his depth and a great manager like emery
Unai emery hype I’m laughing so hard. All he’s good at is steading the ship at a mid table club
Lots in between there dummy
Unai is a fucking dog
Makes me angry we didn’t sack Lampard sooner. Dyche has us playing much more respectably.
I don’t know why anyone thought he would be an outstanding manager in this era of master tacticians. He was an unsophisticated, all action midfielder. Same with Lampard. The best managers are always those who played a more cerebral role or in a more sophisticated team.
You forgot Unai Emery. Far better than SG
I am sure that not a single Englishman can coach at this point. Newcastle fans I am sure he fakes being English. From Southgate to Gerard lampard they all play some shitty shit
Emery is a very good manager. Proven track record.
That's what good management will do for a team. Are you listening GARY O'NEIL?
I remember AFCB were in the league one relegation places in October 2012 under Paul Groves then Eddie Howe returned in October and by February we were challenging for the title just falling short on the title on the final day thanks to bloody Brentford.
Gerrard was a mid-table Championship Manager way over his head at Villa. I think he needs to park his ego and go get a team like Stoke or Sunderland promoted first.  I find it embarrassing when ex-players get an immediate Prem Manager job with like one season at a lower league. I also find it funny when they all do the same thing on the touch line; it’s like they learnt it getting their badges.  Gerrard had one of the easiest walks into a Premier League job; too damn easy in Scotland. Basically two Championship teams playing against a host of League Two teams.   Villa was too big a job for him, no offence but he should’ve gone to a small Spanish team or to a club like Reading and got more experience first.
Chelsea fans and potter
Wttttttfff
Ah yes. The whole thing with Mings “looking at him in the eye” made me pretty cranky.   He was just dreadful. Ughhh.
Wait who'd he hand vice captaincy to?
Unai is tactical genius,and serial European winner
He has an impeccable record with Villa's. I hope they snatch the last Europa League spot.
Arsenal fan. I hope you guys stay up. I like watching Leeds play.
He was at my club Glasgow Rangers only thing he done was stopping Celtic from getting 10 titles in a row apart from that he was fkn hopeless,  then he fucked  off to Villa the 🐍 and when he got sacked I was loving it he couldn't manage a brothel.
Yeah Gerrard was such a trainwreck of a manager. Emery is a revelation.
Emery has genuinely been one of the most successful managers of the 2010s. It’s a shame that he gets derided because of his accent and he wasn’t successful with Arsenal.  Take away what he did at his other “high profile” job at PSG (where everything he won was basically a formality) and he’s still won the Europa League 4 times, more than anyone else. We may not respect that competition as much but it’s still a continental knock-out tournament against arguably a more equal caliber of teams as opposed to the UCL
Watkins is 100% getting called up next international break.
They'll talk about them more when they either challenge for top 6 or are in relegation battle.  Mid table there's little story to talk about especially when the spotlight is on the above issues.  The other day someone on radio said only Chelsea and villa have nothing to play for this season. Now it seems you do.
Life of a none top 6 team mate. Brighton barely gets talked about but I think they’re in with a massive chance of a CL place
I think the media is coping on now
You had Martin O'Neill in last decade, Villa was punching over its weight with him. Small budget and top 10 finishes for few seasons.
>We’re just quietly going about our business.  Casually wins away at Chelsea and then Leicester in the span of 3 days lmao.
I remember Gerrard had a lot of weird interviews
By far is a huge understatement.
Yeah we never really blamed him. I think most Arsenal fans really rate him, he just had a very bad squad at the time and it all just didn't click. But I belive he's very well liked still.
I pity Emery and Moyes. They had to take over 2 legends and it was definitely not gonna end well.   Emery literally started a new game in the hardest difficulty. Could barely speak the language and there was a lot of deadwood on the squad. Having a translator usually means the emotion and the direct interpretation out of the words doesn’t flow through to the players. Looking back now it’s amazing what Bielsa did at Leeds considering he didn’t speak English too.
His biggest struggle was an unbalanced and pretty toxic squad. He's a great manager who had a lot of time for the fans and understood the club. But he was always up against with the players he had and the fact that there was a power struggle going on behind the scenes. Don Raul stitched him up terribly and once he lost the dressing room it was never going to come back.   Arteta almost succumbed to the same problems but luckily for him the structure above him was more effective and backed him.
I mean Emery wasn't good at PSG either. Got knocked out 6-1 by Barcelona in the Champions League and lost the Ligue 1 title in his first season.
He should of stayed at Rangers.   I hope Kompany sees what Gerrard and Lampard did and stay at Burnley for a few seasons. Get some experience before reaching for the top.
It was as soon as his coach left Micheal beale. That's when they started to play shite. He's at rangers now lol.
I agree with everything you said apart from the “scouse media machine” lmao what are you on about? The Liverpool echo and the anfield talk? True heavyweights, pulling all the strings.
It's definitely a surprise.  At the end of Gerrard's tenure it was clear he was having a bad effect on the dressing room. So Villa improving upon his departure is no surprise. But 17th to 7th is huge. So as much as you wanna shit on Stevie G, give credit when it's due. Emery has done an amazing job.  Also your disparaging comments towards Gerrard are made with hindsight. He did well in Scotland and had a good start at Villa. Things went badly, but it's specific to that circumstance. Gerrard might still turn out to be a good manager. Don't group him with Lampard.
King Shitas
Nah even lead is more useful than Steven Gerrard
I'd have to disagree. His style of football is perfect for mid table clubs like Villa, also SeVilla and Villarreal.
best manager we've had in my lifetime (which includes MON)
And SeVilla and Villareal
yeah corse
Well Viera was doing great
Viera was alright until 2023 and OGS can only claim to have the United job as the notable entry on his managerial CV, because it’s that or relegating Cardiff (while he was still developing as a manager that time) and managing Molde.   Gerrard did well at Rangers but how much that was down to his assistant Michael Beale doing the tactical work remains to be seen. Lampard is still finding his level and Parker has shown that he’s a good Championship manager but nothing more (how he got the Club Brugge job and manage in the CL is beyond me)
No don’t file Gerrard alongside them because Gerrard won a league title and did quite well in Europe. Much more deserving than the likes of Lampard.
Gerrard was averaging less than a point per game. Emery is at 2pg.
Leeds moved up like 4 spots just today I think lol
Punked your ass in the Europa though
One is Emi Martinez, the other is Diego Carlos. Diego Carlos, who they'd just bought from Sevilla and literally couldn't speak English.  Pundits didn't really notice, though, because he ruptured his achilles almost immediately, so he's been out all season.
Last night was unbeliebable…3 subs at once and an absolute worldie within a 2 minutes.
IF Emery can win the Europa League with Villa, they really have to name the trophy after him.
The Leeds arsenal game at Elland road was mad, they were playing us off the park and the noise was pushing us back, we were lucky to get away with any points. Itd be a Shane to lose that in the prem
Don't think you read it right.
Don’t think he said he wanted him to leave.
I am still sure that all “legendary English lads” can do is working on sky news post retirement. Both Gerard and lampard and Newill were TERRIBLE as managers
I was just LOVE for him to replace Klopp
I don’t think he was unsuccessful at Arsenal. Didn’t they finish 5th in one of his seasons? They had an utterly crap run of 4/5 games right at the end and lost out on CL. If he’d have got fourth place that year with the squad and the toxic personalities he had at the time, it would have been an excellent achievement.
And it’ll be entirely pointless, he’ll just be training with different players for a week. Southgate won’t play two strikers and Kane is his one & only. It’s like Wilson going to the World Cup. I’m not trying to say he’s better than Kane, but when you’re struggling to break through a defence in a knockout round and have a different style of striker on the bench to change things up, surely you have to use them?
I swear that was over a decade ago now?
Villa spent fuck loads when O'Neill was in charge
I mean, neither are good. Chelsea are a skip fire at the minute and Leicester are the same.   Makes me sad, I like Leicester and they gave us a game.
Someone asked him about Cameron Archer earlier in the season because he didn’t loan him and Gerrard asked if he’s mates with Cam’s family or something lmao
I mean I don’t blame him. Our current form has a large part due to Kroenke cleaning up the management structure of the club. If anything, his tenure helped  Kroenkes show badly the club was being managed
Almost all of us think it was right man, wrong time  Say Arteta left in 10 years, I’d not turn my nose up at him coming back
The structure of Arsenal’s board at the end of Wenger’s reign was very messed up. Emery didn’t just have the problems you are talking about, he had to deal with utter incompetence by his superiors. I, still to this day, felt that Wenger should have left two years prior, because he was too loyal to his superiors and this was getting in his way from finishing his managerial career in Arsenal on a high note
If Mourinho had taken over from Fergie there’d have been no such issues. It was a big job that required a big personality. The bigger problem was that in both cases, Fergie left at the same time as Gill, and Wenger effectively ran the football department. The entire footballing structure of the club/s walked out at once in both cases.
Moyes was unaccetably terrible even by those standards
Yep Kompany should do it like Rooney or Terry. The offer from PL team will come up eventually rushing things aren’t worth the gamble
Far too early to tell yet but kompany has every chance of being an excellent manager. He is actually a very intelligent man, big difference.
It’s difficult though. Imagine Burnley lose 8 out of 10/12 games next season, he’ll probably get sacked or if he stays there by all rights they should get relegated. Where does he go then?
To be fair I think Kompany is on a different level to either when it comes to tactical astuteness, intelligence, all-round competence...
He’s done enough in Rangers. That’s the lesson or the journey he needs to take anyway, sooner or later. He could’ve stayed in Rangers for another 10 years with maybe some crazy records but would still be a newbie once he steps out for PL. It’s just another league. He might realize earlier if he is the material (as good as Zidane or Guadiola) or just another Rodgers.
How many prominent in media ex-liverpool players do you want me to name?
Haha furthermore a lot of scousers can’t even stand the Echo anymore either. It lost a lot of respect when it moved to Manchester 15 years ago and it’s declined in quality ever since.
Are you living under a rock by any chance?   Jamie Carragher, Graham souness, Danny Murphy, Jamie Redknapp, Stan Collymore, Phil Thompson and Steve Mcmanaman are the first that come to mind. Not to mention the Klopp dick riders like Linekar and Abongla-whore.  They will not criticise the club or ex-players turned manager.   Garry Neville is a top class knob head but he is at least unbiased in his opinions on United and gave Ole a fair amount of stick when warranted.
He won less trophies than the St. johnstone manager.
wait a minute...
Lol Solskjær won plenty of leagues with Molde the Norwegian side….. also did quite well In Europe with them as well. Just doesn’t compare to the competition in the English Priemer league
I forgot they signed him! Was looking forward to seeing him play.
He has a habit of doing that,very good with his subs. During his Arsenal stint he made alot of subs at half time including double subs at HT when the max sub allowed was 3.
The Emery Challenge 🏆
Damn, you are correct. My brain put Villa were he said Leeds lmao
Yeah read it wrong somehow xd
I mean Gerrard at least did something with Rangers.
I wouldn’t say Lampard was terrible as chelsea manager. He did a half decent job with one hand tied behind his back (transfer ban not to mention losing Hazard who has carried us through most of the season before) and one could say he did a far better job than the guy who lost the job on Monday.
Really harsh to stick Lampard in with those two. In hindsight he did very well with Chelsea. Everton was a mistake at this point in his managerial career. Even dyche is gonna struggle to keep them up . Lampard would be 10x better for England than Southgate for example.
And he still technically improved over Wenger's last season (63 points, 6th) by finishing 5th with 70 points and only behind 4th place by a point
If he’d beaten Palace at home and Chelsea in Baku we’d probably demand a statue outside the Emirates
He didn't even drop kane for the pre world cup games.  Didn't even give the other two strikers in the squad a chance to show how they would gel if a plan b was needed or kane got injured.  Not saying kane isn't miles better but come on, at least have a serious look at the alternatives.
Yeah I agree. Our next games are much much easier though so I do think Watkins will start at least one.
Ikr. I feel old.
How do you feel about the owners now? They used to be as bad as the Glazers nearly, but I thought Josh Kroenke came off very well in the Amazon doc and things have markedly improved even if the doc itself was just a PR piece by the club.
10 years? That’s a bloody long time. What about if Arteta gets picked up by man city in summer 2025? Would you take emery back then if he continues to perform similarly at Villa?
I don’t know. I would say he was the wrong person, but was at Arsenal at the right time.  Personally doesn’t fit the style of play Arsenal should go after, but it was the right time in the sense that someone needed to be there to open up management’s eyes.  Wouldn’t really take him back, but not because of his quality. He should be managing a top 6 club.
Yeah, fans of other clubs, that weren't fully engaged with Arsenal couldn't imagine, that HE WAS Arsenal. Nothing happened without him. In a way, Arsenal has fallen back into the same trap. Not to the same extent, but Arteta, doing a lot more than Emery did.
He'll be managing a premier league team next year regardless. The real test is whether he can shoot them into mid table or if they'll yoyo straight out Norwich-style
Lampard is known as one of the most intelligent footballers, even moreso than Kompany.
Kompany signed a 5 year contract. He's part of a long-term project. He won't get sacked at the first hurdle in the PL
I thought he was at Rangers for only one or two years?
He meant the TV pundits and fawning columnists at national newspapers. Liverpool get smoke blown up thier arse by the media all the time. Last season and even this season they clearly had an expectation that Liverpool would present a huge threat to Madrid, even though they never do. BT pundits were stumped at last season's final and talked up even this season's away leg.   Lol at the Echo being based in Manchester, though. That's unbelievable.
The Echo should be just as hated as The Sun is for the part they played in the Hillsborough lie but for some reason I get people on my Facebook sharing their shitrag ‘news’ on their blatant-datamining-setup of a website to this very day.
Down voted for this abomination: Abongla-whore  Give your head a wobble mate
He won the scottish league? Or you mean at Villa?  In that case, he won the same amount of trophies as every Spurs manager for the last 15 years or so combined.  Same amount of trophies as Emery at Arsenal.  Such a meaningless argument why even bring it up?
Mentioned Lampard and not Ole for a reason. I knew Ole was at Miles but no idea what his career was like there. My point still stands, that Lampard was less deserving than either, so it was an insult to both to compare them to him.
I had to read it 3 times don’t worry!!
I'd do something with Rangers
You're ignoring his second season.   Chelsea spent £200m+ on Havertz, Chilwell, Mendy, Silva, Werner and Ziyech, and they were 9th when he got sacked.   Tuchel came in and took them to 4th and a Champions League win with the same squad.
It started really well with Emery, but there were some strange choices being made. The way he was playing Torriera is one I can think of.
But he didnt
Yeap everyone was delighted when Toney got called up but I knew he wouldn’t get his chance. Subbed on for about 15 minutes.   It’s a shame, we know Kane is brilliant, someone else should get a chance during relatively low-stakes qualifiers (Kane starting against Italy was a given but I feel Toney could have started or been subbed on a HT for Kane against Ukraine).   It’s a shame Gareth clearly has his firm favourites and won’t stray from them, he was brought success as an England Manager but it is a shame with the talent he ignores.
I still have some animosity due to our owner’s involvement with the Super League so I am fairly neutral on the Kroenke’s now.  Glazers are, were always on a completely different level than the Kroenkes though. The way Glazers bought ManU should never have been allowed by the league. That is a failure of the league
They will come up Kompany best boss ever spend nothing then when relegated or close to it sack him and blame him
The expectasion will be much lower for kompany he just got promoted so staying in the league will probebly be a succes, meanwhile villa always seemed to me like they wanted to push for europe
Burnley will finish mid table. They're a better and more dominant team this season than when Leeds or Fulham last won the league.
Yeah, he is to be fair, I was referring to Gerrard though.
Potter had a 5-year contract.  Means bog all.  Football is a "What did you do yesterday?" business.
And didn't the club stick by Dyche the first time you went down? (Though different owners).
Look at Cooper at Forest now. If he gets sacked is a top half team hiring him? I can’t see it even though he has done a good job there.
Cooper is currently on the brink at Forest despite signing a 5 year deal in October lol
Yes. But still enough. Longer than that in a low competitive league won’t give him much more. He gained confidence to be a decent manager and built a strong resume on that. Just need a steep yet painful learning curve to grow faster as he did.
Your a united fan talking about getting smoke blown up their ass… most protected team in the country.
Yes, yes I did.
To be fair the expectation for Liverpool to do well this season was mostly deserved. 4 goals away from winning the quad.  As for Liverpool being a threat to Madrid, I’ve heard a number of non-Liverpool fans admit we outplayed Madrid in the CL final last year and were robbed; if anything the pundits blew smoke up Madrid’s arse that day. They all said Madrid won it with their “experience” instead of just calling them for what they were; lucky on the day.  Saying that, there’s no denying Madrid totally outclassed us in the CL this season though.  I admit there used to be a lot of Liverpool bias at one point. Following the success in the 80’s, for most the the 90’s there was an ongoing anticipation by almost every pundit that Liverpool would return to top form, which never happened. Having two former Liverpool players, Hansen and Lawrenson, as the pundits every week on MOTD for years was a bad idea and I could totally understand why that pissed off a lot of football fans at the time. Their retirements from MOTD were long overdue, especially as Lawrenson was a shit pundit anyway. There are still a lot of former Liverpool players who are pundits today which is why I think there’s still a perceived bias towards us.  Man Utd have had many long spells of pundits fawning over them too though. The last couple of seasons with Sir Alex was really annoying as a non Man Utd supporter. He was all the pundits wanted to talk about, and interviewers fell over themselves to ask his opinion about anything football related, even matters that had nothing to do with Man Utd. After Sir Alex retired, there was this undeserved anticipation that Man Utd would return to be the best club, much like with us in the 90’s, and I don’t think that anticipation has fully died down yet.
This just in ‘local pundits try to promote match on their network as “potentially good” and “competitive”. Later we have an in depth field study that finally answers the difficult question “why do successful teams that have recently won lots of trophies get smoke blown up their asses? And does this happen often?” More at 11.
Have you listened to his so called punditry?  I stand by what I said.
Yes and the St. Johnstone manager won two cups on a budget that wouldn't have bought a single Rangers player.  Hired the wrong manager from Scotland.  Gerrard was a prick from day one and the braying arseholes who celebrated Dean Smith getting the sack for this mediocrity were even bigger pricks.
why include silva in this list lol
He also failed to adapt when things were going badly in a game. If things were going wrong, he just stuck with it. Then the whole 5 or something like it captains at a time thing …
To be fair burnley have form, stuck with dyche when they first come up and got relegated, he then brought them back up.
Potter also spent 600Million
I'd be quite surprised if Kompany's Burnley don't average more points per game than Potter's Chelsea.
I was more offended for sex workers than for him tbh, but either way it's just a bit unnecessary, however bad a pundit he may be. I don't listen to talksport, which I think he's on? Only rarely listen to their comms if it's a match that BBC don't have that I particularly want to follow.
>scouse media machine  Racist and ignorant
So true. I wonder how things would have worked out if he was given the same support as Arteta has been given.   I understood the principle of the captaincy group, but the implementation was so bad.   And Auba should never have been made the long term captain. We don't know what it's like in the dressing room, but he didn't seem like he wanted the job. He was just popular.
Auba struggling to score halfway through didn't help. 13 goals in the first 19 games, but 9 goals in the last 19. The last game was also the only time he scored more than once in the second half of the season.
Time will tell. But there is no argument, statistically, the average lifespan of a manager is incredibly short.   As I pointed out, 5 of 92 league managers have held their jobs for more than 5 years. And you can bet just about every one of those 87 sacked managers signed multi-year deals that they never got to see through because their most recent results were not good enough.
Correction, he only spent half of that. He wasn't there for the summer transfers.  There are only 5 managers across the top-4 leagues in England that have been at their clubs for 5 seasons or more.   56 of 92 league managers have been at their clubs for less than a year.  Only 8 of 20 Premier League managers have been in their jobs for more than a year.
Jesus. And I'm the one who needs to give their head a wobble.  Stop being offended by everything. You'll live a happier life. At the very least everyone else will. Fucking offended on behalf of sex workers lmao. Get a fucking grip lad.
The whole Auba saga is just sad. My interpret is that its more a reflection of both that the game has passed him by and that he has always been more suited to a counter attacking style team. Being the endpoint of a possession team has never suited him - nice guy though from what I read.
oh apologies he only spent 300 Million 🙏🏾
It was just entirely unnecessary. Changing negative perceptions and stereotypes means changing every day language and challenging usage. Keep saying things like this and it perpetuates negativity.
I don’t think potter had any say in those transfers, none of them suited his style. I’m not saying he’s a victim in this, Chelsea have been playing like a team bereft of confidence and that’s on the manager, but I don’t think the random transfers for positions that they already had quality and depth in helped.
You're fun at parties I bet.  Seriously, jog the fuck on you absolute fucking melt.  Edit-Lmao you don't even stand by your own words why should anyone else.
Wow, what a great point you've made.  Yeah, I totally see your point of view now and it is definitely not important to look at your own behaviour and see how that helps shape the world around you.  Not sure what I was thinking before, your intelligently put, thought provoking response has stirred a reaction in me that I truly never saw coming.  I am going to mark this day on the calendar so that year after year I can celebrate the anniversary of me becoming enlightened.
Jesus Christ, let this issue fucking die already
It's harsh? Punishing [this shit](https://youtube.com/shorts/QTPRuAe39aM?feature=share) is harsh now? He didnt just push the ref, he was trying to intimidate him and, had it not been for Willian grabbing him, I would have put my money on Mitro getting really physical. Have you seen his physique btw? This is not like getting threatened by Insigne, Mitrovic is a big (190cm) and strong (90kg ish) guy. Bruno just nudged the ref a bit, it aint pretty and should be punished, but Mitro should count himself lucky that he isnt being sent to some anger issues management program.  Fucks sake the state of some people
Not this again ffs
I wish we could ban this topic. Why do people feel the need to continuously bring this back up. The overall outcome of both situations is correct. And if you don't think it's correct you must at least think they're fair outcomes even if you would want slightly different. Jesus Christ this shit is so boring now.
Wow - A fresh take on this issue.  Good thing I saw this.  My life is not complete without it.
I’m not saying the ban is harsh, I’m saying one could argue 8 games is harsh. But regardless, the point is Bruno should’ve been sent off / banned, especially if you’re going to ban Mitrovic for 8 games for this.
[removed]
Should Bruno have probably had at least a yellow if not a red?  Yes but there would have been no extra ban.  It was a simple push.  Bruno was frustrated, he pushed, and walked away.  The difference between the two scenarios is that the ref in the Bruno scenario actively gotten Bruno's way whereas with mitrovich the ref is actively trying to leave.
Hurr durr. When a player runs away from the referee when the referee wants to talk to them the ref can book the player for it. Therefore since Mitrovic was trying to talk to the ref and the ref ran away from him, the ref should be booked. Right? That's your stupid "logic".  You appear to be thick as 2 short planks, so I'll explain that I wasn't being serious about booking the ref. I just thought I needed to say that since I was worried you might agree with me.  The linesman was stopping Bruno from reacting aggressively towards (I think) Trent. He got in between them, as all good officials will do. Once Trent had run back towards his position, Bruno was annoyed and shoved the linesman. That's different. One was a calming measure, the other was an act of aggression. You cannot be so thick as to not understand this.  By your amazing logic, every time a referee and a player shake hands on the pitch they should both be banned for "having their hands on each other" or whatever dumb phrasing you use.
>The linesman was stopping Bruno from reacting aggressively towards (I think) Trent. He got in between them, as all good officials will do.  The problem with this is that Bruno had not even gotten near Trent at the point the linesman started intervening.  Also the only reason Bruno is going towards Trent is to get the ball and actually move the game forward.  There was no actual splitting of players going on because Bruno hadn't even gotten close to Trent by the time the ref gets in the way.  It's the same reason that many x referees are not coming out publicly and shaming the FA for letting Bruno get away with it.  While they agree Bruno should have had some sort of punishment they also see that this is a very different incident than what happened with Mitrovic.
> It's the same reason that many x referees are not coming out publicly and shaming the FA for letting Bruno get away with it.  The former head of the PGMOL Keith Hackett has come out and said precisely that: that the FA should be ashamed of themselves that Bruno received zero punishment since it set a terrible example for all grassroots football where the referees have enough problems with player respect.
That's the same organization that almost never admits the refs make mistakes.  They will always side with refs.  Numerous other independent ex referees agree that there should have been a punishment but also understand this wasn't a big problem in the long run.
I’m sure someone told me that they have an algorithm that only 2 or 3 people in the club know. He also uses data to gamble in other sports right? Very data driven.
Honestly they probably have a really well developed formula for scouting the right kind of players. It's probably a bit of a trade secret of theirs (I'm not exaggerating, they probably use some kind of internally-developed algorithm for this).
They have one of the most promising team in the league.
Never mind Europa. They still have Spurs, Man United and Newcastle to play as well as two games in hand on Spurs. They are absolutely in this top four race.
Great management, great coaching, great talents. If they keep up doing what they are doing which i’m almost sure they will, the rest will be history.
Brighton are fighting for Champions League rn let alone Europa
Watch Ferguson, Caicedo, Mitoma, all of them leave in the summer and they'll spawn in another batch of world class youth talents
Won’t be surprised if they make a serious title push in the next few years
I always said if they had better strikers than Maupay and Welbeck under Potter, they would have done much much better.
Ronaldo was a winger when he was that young and his stats were very ordinary until he was like 21. That's why a lot of players (like Rashford or Welbeck) had similar stats to him in the first 100 games or whatever.
Here [watch this](https://youtu.be/zTeweNJAR3k)
The Potter build.
Some sky blue with Walt and Jesse , it’s gonna be popping
Hey Brighton can we have caicedo pls.
Yeah something like he owns a gambling company that has its own algorithm and data analytics for betting odds, and they essentially use a tweaked version of this to moneyball decent players
Much better algorithm than one used by Liverpool to buy Downing and Carroll lol
**[This video](https://youtu.be/zTeweNJAR3k)** does a decent job of explaining how they use their gambling background to recruit
Our owner Tony Bloom owns a analytics company called Starlizard (He is also a well know poker player and racehorse owner) I think he used to work with the Brentford owner and they have a similar system. I also read that we scout for positions rather than look in the geographical location.
What tends to happen with these teams is that they'll have a phenomenal season or so, and  then they get pillaged by the big teams.  I hope that doesn't happen with brighton
as a united fan, we got a trophy so i’ll settle for that 😭
Brighton is one of the clubs that shows how important scouting is, the power of finding the gems before the big guys come for them.
shit bro, that'd be amazing to watch  This is how football should be, super competitive and every team has their own little wonder and charm. Stoke had Matthews, Madrid had Stefano etc.
But will other clubs sell their players to Brighton for cheap again?
Enciso will be one of the stars in the making, Sarmiento looks like a decent talent too
😂 peak take
Or more likely go down to the championship. Same kind of thing happened with Wigan, they found a Palacios or Valencia for cheap and sold for a big profit to begin the cycle again. Thing is, only have to get it wrong, or your methods are copied, for a cycle or two and you’re in trouble.
i’m a united fan bro, can’t remember if caicedo is CDM but if he is, we want him ;)
I predict AI will lead player recruitment in the future. It’s interesting because Brentford has a similar money ball method, yet other clubs who had similar strategies seem to have struggled.  Southampton as an example, when they hired Jones as head coach, his teams had some good stats that married up with their style of play. HOWEVER… I believe there are things that are hard to measure (relationship with press etc).
The algorithm of Dalglish handing over a cigarette box with Carroll and Downing wrote on the back of it!!
I’d like to add that Bloom is born in Brighton and he’s a Brighton fan growing up. Therefore he’s more driven to make his boyhood football club to be successful given he grew up watching us almost get extinct due to some shitty owners
Brighton have also managed to sell players who whilst looking great in Brighton's set up but have looked poor (Cucurella), average (Bissouma) or even completely useless (Maupay) since leaving for big money.  As a club, Brighton remind me of prime ECW under Paul Heyman. They extenuate the positives of their talent whilst hiding the negatives. Then when that talent moves on some of them are great (Dudley Boyz) whilst some are just terrible (Public Enemy).
This sucks about modern football
Only problem seems your team stopped training after they won that cup lol
Brighton never get English talents, it's very rare they even get European talents, they mostly go to South America or Asia or not so big European countries, in these countries they could pay 5-6 mil for a player, that 5-6 mil is nothing for Brighton but goes a long way in those countries because the financial situation there isn't like Europe or the prem and the market's not inflated like the English and European market, so they'll always get their players for cheap
Don't know anything about them, so can't say anything   Where are they from? Who do they play for rn?
No way he's ours
Didn't the Brentford guy work for Brighton and know the algorithm or something like that. I think HITC did a youtube video on it not too long ago
I think the difference was Southampton would just find good generally good players and even managers. Which meant when they would eventually get takes from them the players would still be good for the team that brought them and Southampton would struggle to find a player who would give the same quality. Brighton have sold numerous players and have easily been able to replace them with no problem. About of Half of those players who have left aren’t showing the quality they did when we Brighton because they were brought in for that specific system. Obviously some of the former Brighton players are doing well in their new clubs but Brighton are still going strong.
That’s amazing owning ur childhood club
The fact that actually sold Maupay absolutely baffles me. I advocated for Everton scooping him up when he was at Brentford and banging in a goal almost every two games, but at Brighton he scored a goal every five games, give or take.   When you're buying a player under thirty and entering his prime years for seven million with more than a hundred Premier League appearances you've got to wonder why they're selling him.
W take
Yeah, absolute implosion of our form, its awful that the two players we rely on are 30+
Brighton are the IRL version of save scumming your fifa career mode. Every time a scout report comes in, they reload the save until one of the prospects is an insanely talented wunderkid.   In all seriousness I agree with your comment. Its something I wish United would do too. For example we want a backup left footed CB to replace one of Maguire or Lindelof, but we arent looking in the right places. Valentin Gomez (i hope i got that right) is a 21ish yr old south american, left centreback in the mould of Licha. Certainly not a proven talent or anything, but this is where like you say, Brighton are really good. They would be able to look at this kid, determine if he can be good for them, then sign him uber cheap by prem standards.
Brighton players who have shown glimpses of their promise from some of the games I’ve watched, in fact, Enciso scored in their previous game too
New fan?
Its probably because Maupay is nearly the biggest cunt in the league and they probably tired of his bullshit carry on and moved on to better, more disciplined players
Whilst Maupay is a fan favourite among us, he’s actually deemed surplus when the transfer window came. Danny Welbeck signed a 2 year contract during last summer (he’s also in good form by the end of last season) and we have a top scorer in the Belgian league out on loan last year (Deniz Undav) who’s coming back. Not to mention we also got Ferguson balling out in the youth teams. These things made Maupay fell down the pecking order, and he also only got 1 year left on the contract, so we have to sell. NGL I miss his shithousery
We basically need to nab up Brighton's scouting set up
Interesting, won't be surprised to see them get sold for 50 mil each in a year or two
I am actually I love how they opporate and play!
Here's the thing with that, anyone can buy all the analytics that come from star lizard, Tony bloom doesn't own it, people think as it's called lizard, it's his. But it's the algorithm Tony has that can find the talent
Yeah they’ll manage to find more South American and Ecuadorian talents in particular over the coming years lol
So what you're telling me is that the analytics company Tony Bloom owns and uses to find all these talents from the analytics of his company, those analytics are available to everyone in the world?
Would hate to see a Premier League mainstay (Leicester, Everton, West Ham) go down but I can't help but admit the shake-up that would bring would be awesome for the league.  I like Nottingham Forest personally but I dislike how they essentially brought in two entirely new squads after being promoted so I wouldn't hate seeing them go down.  I really hope Bournemouth stay up, I just have a soft spot for those guys
I wouldn't mind seeing the Hammers stay up--I really want Everton to go down.
United supporter with connections to Southampton, so while not looking likely I hope they stay up. Again, not likely but I'd probably pick Palace to go down if I had the choice.
I like watching Leeds so I hope they stay up. I could careless who goes down as long as it isn’t the Arsenal.
I’d love Leeds to go down, I just don’t like them. Southampton have needed to go down for a while now too.
I definitely want Leeds to get relegated. Their are so painful to watch while they are getting good score.
Any three from Leeds, West Ham, Everton and Leicester to go down for me. Would like Saints, Bournemouth and Forrest to stay up
Bournemouth and Everton to stay up, Leeds to relegate
I want Bournemouth, Southampton and Nottingham Forest to stay up and I would want Leeds to go down
Shame Leeds was not at least two up after 30 minutes like they should have been last weekend. It would be funny to see your opinion in such different circumstances.
James only didn't because he thought he'd be right back
His wingmen
Did he thank them for getting him fired?
Havertz just moved... forward with this
Don't quit your day job
It’s his own fault for playing two LBs at once
Not a 9, only there cuz Chelsea didn’t make it that far down the shopping list this season.   In all seriousness, hes not a finisher even at Leverkusen his goals came from playing off a 9. Buy a decent ST and keep him in the AM role and he’ll succeed
He was bad today but was solid against Villa and great before the international break. Borderline our best player over our previous 5 games. Obviously his shooting has been inconsistent but he’s not a striker and it’s unfair to judge him as one. He also has played almost every game since January. Almost is never subbed off. Great presser and tracks back when he needs too. Gotta respect him for how hard he’s been playing despite all the turnover and drama.
I'd love to know what professional managers see in him because I ain't seeing it.
A poor man’s Thomas Müller  A £40m player who went for double, who has been living off one goal for 2 seasons now. I had him on my own list of fraud-watch, and he’s not done well this year…
He’s mid. Not great, not awful just average. This is what happens when every other player is called “generational”.
He’s not a 9 sure but he’s not versatile enough either  Havertz is good when he’s playing behind the striker against teams with high lines that give him space. The moment it’s a low block he’s finished.   Havertz is just not good enough to be a consistent starter for Chelsea.
He’s shit
He’s shite. They paid huge money. 100% flop.
Perhaps the worst finishing striker in the PL.
For the Bundesliga he's quite good. But the PL is another Level that he can't compete with
I personally think he sucks.
He's the new old Timo Werner. All fart, no shit.
He’s not a centre forward. He is a number 10 but Chelsea don’t play with a 10 any more. With so much talent in the squad, I’m surprised they still play a back 5. To me their squad seems much better suited to a 4-2-3-1.
never a 9  probably not a 10 either  I think he would need to play as part of a duo up front, playing slightly deeper
I’ve been in the camp that the manager hasn’t got the most out of him. I was pumped to see him in the Prem. But the fact is he hasn’t shown anything that suggests he is a special player. I hope he comes good, but I have no fucking clue how that happens.  He should probably move on and put Chelsea behind him.
The problem is the 4 3 3 formation forcing a lot of CAMs/playmakers to play either as wingers or strikers. I'm going to enjoy it when that mania is over.
He plays a role which has started to die in modern football. A false 9.   For me personally. He's too slow and weak for the EPL. He also doesnt find a pass quick enough. Always needs to get settled first.
Misused, but he’s starting ahead of strikers by trade so obviously there’s something that now three different managers have seen
Must be shite, cause the rest of your players are doing great, right?
He's shit. Poor man's.. Wait he's just shit.
Kai, *the donkey-loving-skittle-eating*, Havertz  That should tell you everything!
His pk approach sucks and has to cheat at it.
He's not very good at football, but I think he's made into a scapegoat. People always talk about his disasterclasses (fair) but they hyperfocus on him and ignore atrocious performances from ither players.  Koulibaly was just as bad, but you won't hear a peep because Havertz is the target.
He is good with his hands
He should be sold out this summer. Unless he finds a good partner. Kai, Felix and Mudryk/Sterling make good front 3. With Kante, Kovacic and Mount midfield
I can see the talent in him tbh, think he really lacks confidence at times which comes from being played as a 9 when he isn’t a 9.  His finishing isn’t good enough as a striker but he’s physically quite good, has nice hold up at times and works fairly hard.
Either scores killer goals or plays like dog shit.   I mean even his goal in the champions league final was a fluke. His touch past Ederson was heavy (likely taking him out of bounds) and got a super friendly keeper deflection in order to score.
Kai les hizo ganar la champions
He's the German Dele Alli. Not the same work ethic or motivation issue, but the same positional/role issue. He can't adapt to different tactics and managers. I wouldn't be surprised if he goes back to Germany or even Turkey.
He’d be better maybe as an inverted winger? Probably most effective if he played just off the striker. Certainly NOT a number 9... his goal scoring prowess is just not it.
He seems to score more goals that get chalked off than any other player.
Best non goal scorer in the Prem!
Drogba 😩😩😩😩
If aubemeyang ST and we play Havertz CAM with mount and sterling on the wings we’ll play so much better
I think he’s too soft and has bad finishing. But otherwise, he’s ok. Like many others in the modern football, he needs others around him to play. I feel Chelsea are seriously lacking in teamplay and tactics in the final third, so they have to shoot early from bad situations. They could have smashed Liverpool yesterday, but they can’t create a free man in the box for some reason, so they shoot from all angles. To be fair, on another day, some of Felix’s shots would surely go in.
He’s decent
Would not take him in black and white shirt!
Hard to say what his best position is. At Chelsea we definitely don't use him correctly.   If we get a decent offer for him from outside the Prem we should take it. We need the money. We've got Nkunku coming and possibly make Felix permanent.
Comes across nonchalant on the pitch, he’s a cam for me not a ST.
Disallowed.
He’s shite 😅
he's playing very good if u analysis nicely.   he's creating a lot of possibilities for his team with movement without ball and with the ball too.  he's good when they're is a defender on him he can pass very fast and then create opportunities.  just analysis game and go to internet watch some stats too ;)
Piss poor player. Slow. My dad grandpa has more passion than him.
Best player at chelsea, performance last night was poor. Keep going with him - I could see him working well with lukaku, who surely gets one last chance?
I can understand why he was so hyped up previously in the Bundesliga. He’s 6’3”, very, has very good stamina (you can’t deny his work rate is good), and is a capable dribbler of the ball. That being said, he does struggle to fit in one solid position and role on the pitch…  You can’t play him as an 8 because his the type of player who only wants to go forward, he’s not effective as a striker for whatever reason and I haven’t seen much of him out wide so can’t really comment on that.  I think he could still be a very good player in that he has the natural attributes, but of course that is not all that matters. If I was a Chelsea fan I’d be pulling my hair out with the chances he misses.
OVERRATED
He's being relied on for the wrong jobs. That's the only explanation I have to him playing like a championship player
Wanker.
You don't need to be a 9 to have a decent shot or beat a player 1 v 1
Any half decent manager will put Havertz on the transfer market immediately. He has nothing to offer tbh, a couple of flashy goals but when you need him to be consistent he puts out shit performances.   Only reason he has last so long is because he lived on his CL final goal. Take that away and he is just another Dele Alli.
This is the correct answer. We also need to consider that current football is not AM friendly at all, so definitely tricky for him
He won't succeed. Playing in an AM role will not magically teach him to control the ball, dribble or pass.
This is absolutely correct he is a number 10
Agreed. His shooting is a thing to work on but he isnt the only one who has this problem. I have rarely seen people mentioning how bad joao felix has been in terms of shooting, they will say 'he would have had that many goals if he havent hit post that much time' but isnt it the whole point of having a good shooting technique that you are accurate in front of goals, same with kova. Our best players in term of shooting is probably both the wingbacks and enzo. Mount had some decent goals outside box but his form in this season well...
Eric Garcia was getting picked by Pep, Luis Enrique, and whoever was at Barca at the time. Now he’s bench fodder behind Christensen and Marcus Alonso being played at centre back.   Funnily enough barca are now 10+ clear at the top of their league.   Top managers make mistakes too, they must just be really nice guys
Liverpool gave him a LOT of space, they can't defend counters well. His finishing and composure was... well, not that great.
*Wout Weghorst has entered the chat*
Not a finisher, not a creator. Cannot even dribble past any defenders. Basically an eye sore.
Thomas Muller and Dele Alli played some of their best football in that not a 9 not a 10 role, just off the striker
or a lack of better choices
Do you watch the games? Not highlights...the ganes
Lol that would be Joao Felix lol 😂 I call him Hermano Havertz, he is Havertz with flair lol 😂
*6’3”, very pacey…
Listen to this guy he’s really good at FIFA career mode
Hard to disagree with this
So you think he’s made it this far and this high in pro football and not know how to control the ball or dribble or pass? Your deluded mate
I should’ve rephrased it that’s his best role but he’s just not that good lmao
Except Thomas Müller is a generational talent, and Kai is not, not even close  As for Deli, we’ll se saw what happened to him between being a system player outside your system, injuries, and a work ethic issue.
No. Yous are shit
100%
Given he fails to show those anilities every week, yes
Oh by no means am I comparing their careers, I just think Kai Havertz would play his best football in a role like that.. not that his best would be on Mullers level
Kai is talented though silky smooth on the ball. He needs a manager who will build the team around him. Maybe he's not as good as Muller but he's still a very good footballer.
You can say he’s poor at these things or in his current form is poor at these things, but you can’t say he doesn’t know how to. If he didn’t know how to he wouldn’t be a Prem footballer
He has played all 90 mins of 95% of the games...we have gone from he plays the wrong position to he us playing with the wrong people  At some point,you will realize how stupid these excuses are getting
He won't succed; he's very poor at controlling the ball, passing and dribbling.  There, happy?
If you look at the stats he's arguably having the worse season since he was 18. Most of his underlying shot and passing numbers are down, which goes hand in hand with Chelsea having a bad year in front of goal. Again put a good ST in front of him and he'll probably bounce back.  It's easy to judge a player in bad form. Form is temporary and class is permanent, his class will prevail if you sort out your overall attacking issue.
He's been in bad form for 3 years
Its easy to judge since he has hardly ever even played two good games back to back. He cant finish his dinner and he isn’t nearly creative enough and slows the game down too much to play behind the striker. Form is temporary and class is permanent doesnt work when you are shit more often than not
It is painful
Both teams are so shit at the moment. My eyes are bleeding.
By far the most boring matchup on the planet. I'm not even angry after watching that, just sad.  It's a shame because when both teams are in-form facing each other, it'd always be a thrilling match. What a fall from grace.
90 minutes of my life wasted. Arsenal will rip us a new one on Sunday 🤬
Depressing, even Anthony Taylor looked bored .
El shitico
L classico
The stoppable force meets the moveable object.
If I had to describe this match in one word, it'd have to be "constipation".  It's like two opposite ends of the spectrum. One team without the investment it needed to bring in reinforcements, and the other all transfers, no strategy.
It's always painful watching Chelsea but fucking shit. If Havertz had any finishing ability at all, it would have been a rout, so Liverpool's lucky to come away with a point after that steaming pile of shit they dropped.
Chelsea didn't trash us because they're shite too and have no manager, what a waste of 2 hours. Can't even say it was a Championship level game because the Championship is actually quite entertaining
4th nil nil between them in a row 🥱
Now imagine watching this 1-2 times per week since August between 3 separate managers.
Binman Derby
Rubbish match, snore fest, visual NyQuil
How is Klopp not getting more flack for this abomination of a side.
Sky advertising is as ‘clash of the giants’ but in reality it was like watching a Stoke vs Crystal Palace game from 6 years ago
Chelsea just need a finisher. Liverpool just look finished.
I wanted to gouge my eyes out
Peter Drury on commentary said that since 2017, Liverpool and Chelsea have won both the Premier League and the Champions League. To see them both where they are now is mental.
The lack of quality throughout is staggering. I remember when they were both full of quality and the only thing stopping record breaking scorelines was incredible defending and goalkeeping. The only thing that seems to be able to bring any sort of scoreline in this match is a defensive error.
Shit on a stick
Idk even know why I watched the whole game
Kai Havertz is embarrassingly bad
Had a fiver on 0-0, chelsea cant score and liverpool are shit away from home. Easy money
They have been a bad matchup for years
Both times we played...performances by all were just... uninspiring.
I hate chelsea but watching Havertz made me irate
I miss Mane.
#SAD & PAINFUL
Chelsea were miles the better side just can't finish their dinner, should have smashed liverpool.
That was the most expensive pile of shit I have ever seen.
That's one of the worst games of football I've ever watched
Massively boring game truth be told. Both teams are struggling this season and that’s not going to make exciting football.
I can't believe chelsea spend 600m for this embarrassment
Teams go up and down but liverpools crash has been intense! Seriously liverpool fans whats happened?
I'd just like to say that in 89 appearances for Chelsea, Timo Werner got 23 goals and 21 assists.
This game was like watching a boxing match between two amputee epileptics with thousands of strobe lights flashing all at once.   You start to wonder why you (or anyone else) would ever want to even watch the match.
4th 0-0 in a row between these two and 6th draw in a row
I for one watched this “Must watch game” and now I have trust issues
Madrid might actually 10-0 Chelsea
Thats four 0-0 draws in a row between them two if im not mistaken. What a dull game between two teams that are WAY past their best but still think that they are good. That was shocking.
 This is exhausting man, we were certainly unlucky, when will this end?
Nothing short of what was expected
What is embarassing is that one team had a proper Manager and couldn't show up against a team being led by someone inexperienced and couldnt do more tactically
Nketiah would’ve had a hat trick
I like how we're currently wank but still alive because everyone else is also terrible.
Lmao I love to see Chelsea struggle especially. Fuck them and their supporters.
Jesus, this is a dire match
First time?
Championship league
We deserved the win
Yeah. That's the worse thing about being a Chelsea fan atm.  The matches are boring as fuck and we also keep losing.  Losing sucks anytime, but at least I get an adrenaline hit if it's exciting.
Clash of the midtable non titans
This season doesn’t count
I was really depressed watching liverpool and Chelsea tonight,,, the classless performance in the final third is really shocking 😔😔😔 honestly
A team without players- Liverpool  And a team without manager- Chelsea  Painful to watch as both teams were just pouring water on sand
Remember Liverpool - Chelsea games back in the day when they had Torres and Drogba? Nobody would think they would fall off this hard.
Either I'm dead inside or that game was dead af. Looked  like two teams playing friendly with their substitutes.
Awful game but was anyone really surprised?
this has been the by far a really boring season IMO
Could put a baby to sleep Maybe Its because the teams have only had 2 days rest. Dunno
I for one turned of the TV
I thought they both will lose. Absolute garbage.
When you're starting Curtis Jones and James Milner is your fire power off the bench, you know you're in serious trouble!!
If ever there was 90 minutes to perfectly sum up two team's seasons, this was it.   What an utterly dire watch.
Not gonna lie, when they said 5 minutes of added time on the second half, I said fuck I have to watch five more minutes………..
Remember the 2-2 draw just 15 months ago. That was a rollercoaster.
I remember Kovacic’s banger last season and Salah vs Rudiger … completely different match today.
Pathetic, go hire the manager we want to hire before it gets even worse for you.
We’ll have to turn up because we know you will. It’s still Anfield and still Liverpool.  We read nothing into that match.
As an arsenal fan, I'd love it, but I doubt it. As much as I'm enjoying the season so far I'm not that kind of confident yet. Liverpool will always bring it against us and you rotated so heavily for this game against a midtable team just to be rested for us
Saka hatrick. Odegaard to deflect in another Jesus shot. Martinelli random fancy goal.
Nahh you’ll do us easily at Anfield
Its at home at least and we faired well at the emirates
Salah will shine Sunday, wouldnt count them out
He entertained himself by ditching out them yellow cards
El crapico was right there…
El Assico?
I prefer El Trashico but that is just me.
Shitpool
It's ok, you're playing at home next game.
I wish reddit still gave free awards to dish out. This comment deserves ome
Football matches really are won in the board room.
Acting as if klopp didn’t spend 85 mil on Nunez or bought gakpo for 37 mil….  Such a myth that Liverpool never spend
why do you say all transfer, no strategy?
At least the Championship has some absolutely crunching (or agricultural as I like to call them) tackles.
And it’s always the same story, a bunch of Chelsea disallowed goals and clear cut chances being missed…
Since August 2021. Fixed it.
He's got enough credit to have one dodgy season, if they have a similar story next season then he'll definitely be under pressure. Not saying he needs to have Liverpool back in the title race necessarily, but if they don't look like they're at least comfortably in the top 4 race next season (think Newcastle, Spurs and United this season) then I think he will start feeling the heat a bit
Name a manager that could get better results out of our squad, I’ll wait
Klopp only does 6 good seasons.....  He should be shown the door
Honestly I've been dreading reading the headlines to see him sacked.. idk what the problem at our club is at the moment.. but it seems that he's the only one avoiding any criticism.. somehow.
I'd rather watch Rory delap throw ins for 90mins then go through this shitfest of a game.
Now you know how we feel majority of the time like how do you not score that 1v1 you are more likely to score then not in that situation lol 😂
He’s not doing too hot either to be fair
Midfield is either below/near 20 yrs of age and inexperienced, or above/near 30 yrs of age and High intensity games of the past have burned out the entire teams’ strength. Injuries have been at a record high. New forwards are good but with the lack of supply from midfield they are having to do all the work themselves. Team tactics have been found out by opponents.
No one knows… you could feel it from game one of the season.
The person you described would be more mobile than our midfield to be fair mate
When Chelsea learns that they have to put the ball in the net to win, I mean you guys should’ve won, I’m a Liverpool fan and I think my team never got off the bus today
Fuck you too
we were that bad and you couldn’t put the ball in the net legitimately….. should be docked points just for that lad, we were honestly training cones.   Don’t deserve to win if you don’t score a goal.
From what I hear it should have been a -1 all draw
I love that they keep trying to push that we’re in the race for top 4. Any hope was lost with the Bournemouth result.
I was  Their game at Anfield was horrific No one expected it to get worse than that for sure.
And think about all the world class talent we have but still suck
Same I had a huge sigh lol
loool same
Felt like five hours. And i was watching the match at 3am midnight. Had to pinch myself to stop me from falling asleep.
I'll be sure to pass that on to Boehly, thanks.
>pathetic   *sees flair* 🤔
ouch.
And this is why I hope Liverpool wins 😂
They still have Jota and Firmino😭
I’ll be happy with a 6-5 home win!
6-5 then
Seriously, anfield is not a place many go to succeed
Elastico?
Fellow r/cfb member
Chelshit
Not everyone else will lose 7-0 there
List an individual fee to sound impressive all you want. We spend almost exactly half as much as clubs like city and yanited. We're getting outspent by fucking villa, wolves, and west ham. This is publicly available information. We're mid-table in spending.
Not gonna lie I'll be pretty damn disappointed if we look like Tottenham next season
If Spurs are in it, then Brighton are in it.  They've got 2 games in hand on Spurs and could leapfrog them.
couple years ago? yall were performing great, I doubt many could do better.  Right now? I think you could put a statue as coach and perform better. Maybe the statue wouldn't use granddad Milner to maintain a press on the opposition, and instead let the $65mil Nunez play a single full 90.
Who’s fault is it the squad is the way it is? The manager for the last few years culpable no? It’s his squad. It stinks.
Plus after so many successes some players are now taking their place in the starting 11 for granted, and have no real competition in the squad either to push them to do better when they're out of form (think TAA and VVD, mainly). It's very hard to be at your best if you think you've got nothing to prove.
Surely the lack of support from fsg is the issue? Klopp is an elite manager
Everyone knows. Shagged squad. Players either too old/too many miles on the clock or too young to be effective playin in a team with players too old you see where this is going! Throw in a couple of  signings who are new to the league and who can't settle easily and it's a shit show par excellence.
The ball was in the net. Twice.
Lmao love it when friends meet
8-5 Origi scores in the 93rd minute and we get a penalty at 95th minute and Ronaldo comes from Saudi and scores it
El Ass Tico
and liverpoop
I know fan from the team that spent over €500 million just to still be shit ain't talking.
It's even dire when you consider the [net](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.squawka.com/en/premier-league-net-spend-2022-23/%3famp) spending. This shows there are more outgoings as well, while not having enough purchases to compete with at least the top six sides.
I mean, my point is that Klopp has fund to spend, but is clueless where to spend them. had 150 mil to get some midfielders, but he loves purhcasing injury prone players like Thiago and jota  Liverpool fans can rave all they want, but Klopp makes awful decisions on transfers.
Haha, I just meant it as in they're still in the top 4 battle along with Newcastle and United. Though tbh if United don't start to pull themselves together again in our next couple of matches then I could easily see Spurs finishing in the top 4
These players are not playing to their level. Even on current ability. People can blame FSG all they want to shield Klopp, but as manager he holds responsibility for results on the pitch. It wasn’t FSG who went on the anfield wrap and started ridiculing fans who were calling for a midfield signing.
Im not here to fight, they were offside so ball in the net comment doesn’t make sense
Come back Divock, forget losing Mané, it’s big D we miss
Siuuuuuuu
Yeah but at least they didn't lose 7-0 there
Exactly. People like this fella always point to our transfers to say "you spend money, its a myth" Nobody says we spend zero dollars. The point is that we spend less than 10 premier league teams while we're supposedly a top 5 revenue club in the *world* as of 2022.   Klopp is also to blame though, dont get me wrong. He wanted tchouameni and nobody else. He stubbornly chose to let this midfield and defense go again this season, and he's paying for it massively. If we aren't back to a title race next season after heavy investment this summer I dont see how he can keep his job, as sad as that makes me.
You do realise Klopp isn't in charge of Liverpool's transfer policy? Like 90% of clubs they employ people for that. He might get a veto but really it's not up to him.
No. Your point was "its a myth that liverpool never spend" which got debunked and ratioed so now you're pivoting to a whole new point.
Bad choices like Mo Salah, Alisson Becker and Van Dijk?  What an awful take
Yea, of course top 4 is nothing to cry about but I'd like to at least be in reach of the title at this point in the season next year. It seems like every top team besides City and Arsenal are just trudging through the mud this season
Yeah, some of the results we’ve had this season show that we are in fact a capable team. I think that’s what is the most infuriating part about the season. We beat City 1-0 at home, we thrashed United, we played Arsenal very tight away, and of course the absolute hammering we gave Bournemouth. But then we lose games like Forest Away, Leeds at Home, Brighton away, etc, and it’s just absolutely infuriating. Like why can’t we string together a month’s worth of good football and get through the end of the season on a high note?!
Are you referring to my “ball in the net” comment or yours?
He will definitely not be sacked unless he finishes below 10th or something in two successive seasons. He’s the only guy right now who can make a team contend for a title with limited funds.  FSG are stingy, not stupid. They’ll never sack him unless it’s absolutely dire for two seasons in a row or something.
You seriously can't be that braindead?   You think they're just gonna purchase any player without Klopp giving the go ahead?
Show me where i said every transfer he makes is awful?
These players are either very complacent or they’re just tired of hearing Klopp’s voice. This is no different to what that Chelsea team with Hazard used to do to managers. Win the league, then the very next season fall off a massive cliff and only turn up for the big exciting games. Klopp needs to be very ruthless at the end of the season, because next season turning out like this again would surely be the end of him at Liverpool
I said he might get a veto if he really doesn't want a player. I remember reading on here that apparently Klopp wasn't sure about Salah,look how that worked out.  Mostly clubs decide not the manager for obvious reasons.
Willy Caballero?
Crazy to think that he played for both Man City and Chelsea in the past 10 years but yet missed out on winning the league!
Caballero?
Yes, well done! I’ll have to try and make the next one even more tricky!
That was way more than 1 second.
He could, but you never know with football because it's so unpredictable. He might end up going on a goal drought and moving to a worse team. Improbable but it is possible. He does seem to be on really good form at the 5 if he continues like this, big clubs are definitely going to go for him
I think he's at his level.  He's extremely valuable to Villa, but I don't see him being a difference maker with a move right now.  I'd like to see him stay and have them build around him Vardy/Leicester style.
The amount Villa would want and his age, probably not but wouldn’t be shocked either
Been waiting for people to notice what he’s been doing for months
Why would Villa sell? They don’t need the  money, they have Emery who has them playing better than 90% of the league and some of the ‘bigger’ clubs are skip fires - see Chelsea & Spurs for examples - so I doubt he’d want to leave either.   He’s at his level. He has a chance of European football and he’s loved. He’ll be going nowhere.
nah villa are very much on the up with emery and he will be a big part of that
He’s been bang average the 17 games before that. If he keeps it up then yes, but don’t think any big clubs will come calling just yet.
DOne!
Depends how quickly you read.
Tod Boehly has me holding his beer
Yeah. Villa are loaded and on the up, so don't see a deal being likely at all.
Mayby the potensial reason for his great form is because he is their main man right know, since he didnt perform on this level. When ings was their.
I mean as a player he’s gotten double digit goals in the prem for 3 years now, I know it’s not amazing compared to some of the other numbers we seen thrown around but for villa that’s a great number  Basically he’s a reliable player like Jimenez was at wolves before the head injury
Massive punishment for Forest, Southampton, Wolves here;  He'll miss games against Leeds, Leicester, Everton, West Ham and already missed Bournemouth
Mitro has a couple screws loose... just part of the package with him.
I dont mind this, players cant touch referees. I mind that Fernandes get away with similar shit with 0 games.
This is the correct call and deserved. Only thing I question is whether or not a player at one of the "big six clubs" would have received this punishment
Cool, so we're just making up suspension periods on the fly now? I look forward to when a player spits in another player's face, and they have to dish out an even harder suspension period than that one to be consistent...  Oh... wait...
Think Silva probably deserved more tbh.
Here we go with the false memories of Bruno...
I was expecting like 10, so I'd say this is actually somewhat lenient.
People love bringing up Bruno as if he looked like he was genuinely about to murder the linesman, getting all up in his face and rag-dolling him, then proceeding to stand his ground and continue verbally abusing the ref after he already got the red card, such brain dead people.
The whataboutism in this thread is off the scale!!
Insane how people think that mitro’s incident was similar to Bruno’s  edit: some people not all
I don’t know man, i think the red card should be the only punishment. 8 game ban is so over the top imo
Stupid Mitrovic, should've put on a red shirt before dling it and you would've gotten away with it
Good he’s a twat
That's quite harsh. I was expecting 5-6.
So when are they gonna punish Bruno?
What a joke! Bruno didn't even get a yellow for pushing a ref, and Mitro, 8 GAMES? Why are PL refs so protected while being one of the worst refs in the world? One of the worst FA decisions I've seen ever.
I have only one "fuck off" left.. whom should i give it to? Mitro? Bruno? FA?
Can anyone actually come up with a reasonable explanation as to why he got 8 and Bruno got absolutely no punishment?   Madness.
If he was United's player then there won't be any ban. oh wait it has already been proven
Good. Proper twat
This is about right.  The refs should take a harder stance on dissent.    Irrespective of how Bruno should get the same for slapping a linesman over a throw in, this is a good call for me.   The refs are shit for so many reasons and allowing dissent is one of them
Okay, no issues with that so long as it's consistent. What Mitro did was wrong. Now, what's Kavanagh's punishment for a series of terrible performances against us, and an explanation as to why Luke Shaw's clear shove on Mitro in the box wasn't given or reviewed by VAR?
Could he seen as Harsh but they had to make a statement, this can’t be accepted!
Fair. 8 game ban for Fernandes as well then tyvm.
This will severely ruin any chances of Fulham making a run for a top 7 finish, I liked to think these types of suspensions aren’t targeted but it seems awfully convenient to cripple a team like Fulham at this point in the season with this suspension.
If this was any other player no punishment.  I am not saying that I dont agree with the ban, but bruno fernan does similar stuff every other game and has not been suspended once.
The corrupt six league still calls itself the premier league?
Quite happy with this after he baited Douglas Luiz and got him sent off. Although Stevie G did get the chop the same night, so silver linings etc
Fernandes got a kiss on the cheek when he did that. Almost identical situation as well
He's their whole team 😳
The captain rule is a thing no? After the mitro incident they need to start carding all touching, br a soft shoulder look her mate or whatever.   Can we just get some consistency please?   This is in response to comments more so than the post itself.   I thought VAR would kill all what ifs, but it's just made it worse with it's piss poor execution.
Do he’s pretty much done for the season
What length ban did Bruno get again for the ref push?  I agree with the ban. You can’t touch refs. I just want them to be consistent
Ok now do Bruno!!!
You never know, Vinicius might remember how to be a footballer!
I’m baffled that was his first red card in 4 years at Fulham - remember hearing that somewhere
100% this. I think most fans would accept for players to receive lengthy bans for this conduct if it's consistent.
I keep hearing people say players cant touch referees as if they never did, and it sounds so weird to me... for example, this weekend against Forest, there was a decision after which, at least, 2 players from each team 'touched' the ref, as in, put their hands on his shoulder as if to be noticed, which is completely different from Bruno shoving the assistant, or Mitrovic going mental...  This is not saying I condone this. It has to be very stressful to have 10 guys touching you and knowing none of them is happy, but I just find strange how everyone acts as if _any_ type of physical contact with the ref is usually penalized, when it clearly isnt  Edit: for context, the moment I am talking about came after Podence _maybe_ spitted on Brennan, iirc. I cannot find the clip though
Context matters here people! Mitro fully squared up to the ref and pushed him. Fernandes does push the linesman but it's as Fernandes is running away. Yes maybe there should be punishment but those claiming the two instances are the same are truly ignorant.
"Similar" 😂
Not even retrospectively looked at and acted on.
Delusional if you think it was similar at all, honestly.
Hardly similar and the lineman shoved him first so the FA would have to crack down on him as well and that would never happen
Absolutely.  I'd love someone from the PL or the FA to try and explain why one incident is an 8-game ban and the other requires no sanctions whatsoever.
its insane how he's gone without any punishment, they jumped on Mitrovic real quick!
Nope, Fernandez vs us
You’ll be fine if no one sees the spit tho right Podense. Dirty little fucker.
Remember when Bruno punched the ref in the head and got rewarded with a penalty for United? Crazy.
Fa are appealing, so they must want 10+  Or they are trying to stop Fulham from getting it reduced.
you...just brought him up, you know..
He's a rat and deserves all the hate he gets. I used to hate Pepe and Ramos back in the day for similar reasons but Bruno is on a different level.
Wasn’t even close - Bruno kind of acted out a shove without any real force behind it. Mitro almost Darwin’s that ref lol.  Edit: from a Liverpool supporter
We don’t though. Mitro spewed some threatening comments as-well as the physical contact, which rat boy didn’t. 🐀
It was similar.  That doesn't mean they were the same.
similar or not he shouldn't put his hands on a ref
They’re obviously different, but both should be sending offs
Yep, one plays for a big team, one doesn't.
Yeah Liverpool get away with a lot.
I was expecting like 10 I think it should have been 6.  I think you just make it easy and say its 3 games for a straight red double for overly aggressive contact with a game official.
I’m sorry, are you advocating for less protection for the refs? Yeah, that’s gonna up the standard.
Cause Man Utd is propa British innit . The rest are continental foreign twats . Cause PGMOL is the equivalent of Brexit propa British lads innit.
Unfortunately the main reason I think is that he is from Serbia while Bruno is from Portugal...
boomerang to hit em all
Watch the two incidents and if you cant see the difference yourself, you're either stupid or purposefully being ignorant.
2 different incidents. It's not that hard to understand.
The scale is this:  * DiCanio style knock over a ref = 11 games ban * Mitro style aggressive push plus shouting = 8 game ban * racially abuse another player = 8 game ban * gently touch an official = 3 game ban * be Bruno = nothing.  For what it's worth, I think Mitro's punishment is about right.  It seems harsh, but that's what it should be to act as a deterrent to that sort of behaviour.  But as everyone keeps saying: you do not touch the officials.  So why do loads of players (not just Bruno) get away with it when surrounding the ref?
What a load of shite, United constantly getting fucked over this season by the refs, this conspiracy that refs favour United is such nonsense.
You won't get answer to that bc 1)refs are always right and 2)it's ManReds/big6.  VAR and other things may apply on them in irrelevant games, but when it really matters, they won't get bad decisions against the likes of you.   And Mitro's lengthy ban is simply refs pushing back for all shaming they got for poor performances this season(and any other tbh). They seized opportunity to present themselves as victims of violation, while in fact it's their incompetence violating the game all the time.  Btw, 5-6 games would be about right.
Poor refereeing also can't be accepted, yet, apology is always enough it appears. No punishment, and way bigger losses than some wankers pride. Refs are scum and deserve no sympathy, even in situation like this, where player is obviously wrong.
“Well well well, if it isn’t the consequences of our own actions “
No fucking chance
Baffled is right. If they'd had VAR in EFL PO finals, he may have got his first marching orders for FFC way back when: https://twitter.com/fulhamfcbrasil/status/1290994600304349185?s=20
And they both should have been sent off if this was the case  The rules should be south that ANY uninvited contact with an official is a red
Fernandes was yelling at him seconds earlier. Context is absolutly the same.
Yeah, better world would be the same.
the reaction to bruno is so over the top. im a city fan and i really don’t like him as a player but when i saw the ‘push’ it felt like such a non-incident. the linesman clearly felt the same way as if it were a genuine clash he would have said and bruno would have been dismissed.   mitrovic was far more aggressive and getting right up into the ref. clearly a far different incident
Nothing to be looked at see
Seriously! These fans are just haters and nothing else. Those are very different incidents.     The referee is also not supposed to get out of the touchline and pull Bruno either. Plus, the referee was on Bruno's way of taking the throw-in. Nothing else. He just shrugged the referee from the back to say "well, let me get going here now". Even the referee was not threatened.     Look at Mitrovic on the other hand. He was intimidating. And the referee was in no mood to listen to him post a VAR decision. Mitrovic's touch to the referee wasn't that bad TBF, but he was intimidating. I still do think 8 game ban is unfair though (1-2 games is fine for that)
:D :D :D Jesus christ.
Well the correct word is same, but I used similar for sensitive Bruno fanbois. Still not enough. :D
Ok, I will explain for you.    Mitrovic was arguing with the referee and interfering while he was reviewing VAR for a potential penalty and red card. The referee gave a bit of leeway and let this go.    As the referee was showing Willian the red card Mitrovic pulled him back and was _clearly_ verbally abusing him, right up in his face. This left the ref with no option but to send him off.    Instead of simply leaving the pitch with his tail between his legs Mitrovic doubled down on the abuse and at one point looked like he was actually going to assault the ref. Manchester United players actually got in between them and prevented the incident from escalating. He continued to bitch and moan as he left the pitch.    Bruno Fernandes did not do any of this.   Is that clear enough?
Because it's 2 entirely different things lmao..Mitrovic literally stirred shit with the ref while Bruno who was earlier touched by the ref was on his way to the pitch and shoved him a lil..he acts like a cunt make no mistake but you guys surely aren't the smartest if you think those are objectively even remotely the same
Real quick? It happened 2 and a half weeks ago!
First one that came to mind. I dont think it's just a Bruno thing tho I doubt the league would give Haaland a similar ban imo. Idk maybe I'm sounding too conspiratorial against the big clubs
Remember when he poisoned our water supply, burned our crops and delivered a plague unto our houses?
Could have killed him
you know what i meant
sounds like you need therapy buddy
He touched the ref end of story
>Mitro spewed some threatening comments as-well   What did he say?
Yeah, the issue is Bruno should have got a Red + 3 game (or more) ban,  it that Mitrovic should have been fair game
How the fuck have you actually managed to pull that out your arse
So you think bruno should be allowed to push officials?   Clear utd fan mentality.
If you don’t think bruno deserved any sort of punishment you’re either stupid or ignorant. Not as bad as Mitrovic’ at all totally agree so he shouldn’t get the same punishment in terms of games as him. But definitely had to be punished for pushing an assistant. Don’t touch/push a ref at all, now it’s fine if it’s not that hard of a push because why any other player should be punished for it?
So you think brunos was fine and shouldn't of received punishment?
I agree and I don't think bruno was as bad. But still Warrents atleast a sending off. I remember years back di Maria pulled   the ref and got sent off.   Well people don't get away with that. Arsenal have been fined 3 times for it this season.
Lmao true 😂😂😂
Lmao true 😂😂😂
Lmao true 😂😂😂
I am not disputing the rules, I am just asking why everybody is so shock when this happens almost every game
Thank god people like you are not referees
Maybe rewatch the two clips pal and tell me it's still the same.  https://youtube.com/shorts/tIMHr-ZQ0MA?feature=share
So if I walk past you in a pub and push your back then keep walking you're gonna react the same as if I get up in your face, push you, then square up to you while shouting in your face?  Fernandes arguably deserved a yellow, maybe there should even be a rule that _any_ contact with the ref gets a red. But the same? Nah mate.
Yes. Touching the ref ≠ touching the ref. The context matters. In the Bruno incident the ref touched him first and then got in his way during a heated stage in the game and that’s why the linesman didn’t really care. The situation was over with Bruno leaving the scene. Mitrovic on the other hand screamed in his face and showed violent intentions which is the key difference.  Give Bruno a yellow and leave it.  Also 8 games ban for Mitrovic seems way to harsh for my taste.
Couldn't agree with you more on this. 2 completely different situations that aren't even worth comparing.
i remember the ref doing a similar push to bruno as well. not that he shouldn’t have been punished but it goes both ways. i don’t think refs should touch players and players touch refs
Bruno lives in their heads rent free so they can’t use their brains objectively mate.
The fact the linesman and PMGOL felt is was a non-incident is part of the problem, and a part of the culture that allows them to be abused at lower levels.  In no other sport would that be allowed. None.
You seem to have misunderstood. I wasn't asking why one was worse than the other. What Mitrovic did doesn't excuse Fernandes' actions and Fernandes should have received a ban himself, in my opinion (maybe 3 games or something).
>and shoved him a lil..  Even in your defense you admit guilt.
Real quick,he said.
The Fernandez one wasn’t nearly as bad as Mitrovic’s. But still a red imo
You seen the recent interview with Putin? Apparently he didn’t even want to go to war with Ukraine, but guess who persuaded him. Good old Bruno Fernandez
No?
Gold medal for mental gymnastics mate. Well done!
Aguero should've gotten one too, for touching the female assistant ref back in 2020.
We’re talking about people comparing the bruno incident and mitrovic.  Clearly there’s a disparity. Bruno should have been off because you can’t do that, but he was no where near on the level of aggression that mitro had.
I don’t know what specifically, but its common knowledge he used threatening language. One source for you…  https://amp.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/04/fulham-aleksandar-mitrovic-eight-game-ban-shoving-referee-marco-silva
Give it a rest mate, putting a hand on someones back and gently pushing past them to get to the ball isnt a red card.   Players put hands on officials all the time, we see them get delibarately shoved out the way if they are in the way of the ball when its in play.
So you didn't see the linesman touch Bruno first with the same amount of """"force""" Bruno would use to """"""push""""" the linesman with?   Clear bias/wilful ignorance.
Where do you draw the line on push or touch? If the lino thought he had been pushed maliciously, he would've said that to the ref and it would've gone to VAR. Bruno was trying to get back to the ball/the pitch in general, and the lino was in the way.  I wouldnt have been shocked if he got a red though tbh, we've seen reds for less.
I think they're 2 completely different incidents
Lmao true 😂😂😂
Without a single doubt yes.
Dude, why would I need to talk about some bar situation when I can see both videos from exact situations we are talking about? :D If you push me in the bar, I will say its ok no matter what because I am not an idiot.
8 games is certainly too many. What's going to happen when you're in frontnof 1000"s of fans? You'd have to be Zidane to actually assault someone.
He got the red before he went mental. Players argue with the ref's decisions all the time. See the forest game about 38 minutes in. About 5 forest players grab the red, push his arm to get his attention, argue with him at the same time. 0 cars given.
surely even the extremely bias united fans can see he acts like a child… right?
Oh yeah fs it's fine to even ban him for 1-2 matches but his offense and Mitrovics offense is incomparable
the way you spell fernandes really irks me
Of course...
what on earth is mental gymnastics about what i said lmfao
That one was controversial and strange but not quite the same as the “shoving” a referee that the other two were
>its common knowledge he used threatening language.  using “improper, abusive, insulting and threatening” language.  You just picked threatening from that list. What did he say?
Lol no we don't.   Putting a hand on someones back and pushing them out of frustration is not the same. Clueless if you think that bruno did nothing wrong.
‘Where do you draw the line at a touch’  Umm… when the player touches the ref, it is a red card. Players keep a respectable distance, and approach one at a time, or when instructed to… follow the Rugby model.
Yeah that's right just avoid the question. Not hard really is it.
I fundamentally agree with my own statement. And i agree with you agreeing with it. Preciate you!
>why would I need to talk about some bar situation when I can see both videos from exact situations we are talking about?  It's an analogy to show how different the incidents were.
>He got the red before he went mental.  No  https://youtube.com/shorts/QTPRuAe39aM?feature=share
Look at my comment history and you will see me very recently calling him ‘king rat’. Doesn’t change the fact he’s rent free. Bruno could sneeze and you’d all lose your minds.
Fernanj
Typical yanited stuff mate
Wait,but you just specified about 'touching' and the aguero incident falls under that.
He said, and I’m slightly paraphrasing here but you’ll get the gist of it -   “PringleJones is a posh West London tosser who needs to move on, and stop dwelling on the fact that Fulham’s best player is pretty much out for the rest of the season, and their chances of European Football is well and truly over”  Hope that helps hun.   Im here if you need a cuddle xxx
Thankfully, i value your opinion less than the shit in my toilet, so i wont worry myself too much about being clueless.
On that we can agree, it should be the rule, however it isn't at the moment. Its down the officials discretion and if they determine the touch/push/shove is worthy of punishment.
No I don't think he should receive punishment. If it was really as bad as everyone is whinging about the ref would have dealt with it.   He didn't.  Because it wasn't.    Move on.
Stupid analogy since we have the same position in the bar if I am not a bouncer.
i guess the FA decided 7-0 was enough punishment for him. tbh fair enough ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
he’s rent free because he continues to act like a child as the captain of one of the biggest clubs itw. obviously his conflict with the refs was not equivalent to what mitro did, but surely there has to be some kind of punishment for putting hands on an official
so no answer? as expected, must be one of those people who learn a new term and start throwing it out whenever they see a chance, the most intellectual arsenal fan.
Yes I know and it sounds hypocritical but they are completely different incidents. One is still a shove and the other is… well idek what it is
Oh no really. I'm so sad about that.   Carry on with your delusion, little buddy.
Oh no really. I'm so sad about that.   Carry on with your delusion, little buddy.
Oh no really. I'm so sad that a full grown man with the reddit name Stevebrucesdresssize doesn't care about my opinion, lol so sad.   Carry on with your delusion, little buddy
Your deluded if you think pushing an official is okay.   Only reason you think that because your a utd fan.   Take off the blinkers it's such a obvious red card.
Emotional damage lol
Look at both incidents and tell me they’re the same. They’re not. Please try to use your brain, I know it’s hard because Bruno is in there doing keepy uppies with it.
Get it all out fella; a gush of wank words.
Ok buddy, if you say so 👍  >Your deluded if you think pushing an official is okay.   *You're
lmao read my comment before u freak out. “obviously his conflict with the refs was not equivalent to what mitro did” is that not me using my head??
Yeah resort to grammar when you know YOUR wrong lol. Child.
Can I just say as a Utd fan, Brissy doesn't speak for us. We're not all thick as pig shit.
So then why should he get a ban if you’ve seen it and know it’s not comparable? lmfao
😂
I go with 'top player' tbh, gives them due credit whilst not overdoing the praise
Sometimesmaybegoodsometimesmaybeshit  class
I’m finding the phrase world class more and more annoying. No one seems to know what it means.
World class  Continental class  Country class  County class  Rec league
I’m going with “just below world class”
World Class  Professional  Semi Professional  Amateur  Beginner  Legendary  Ultimate
Elite
World class – has a legitimate argument to be the best player in any game or in any squad, can lead their club or country to significant success, hard to definitively find anyone better than them at their position in the world (Mbappe, KDB)   Superstar – extremely talented player who can consistently be the best player in any game, can be the face / a leading face of a successful club or country, but who needs either more longevity or a higher peak to truly be considered world class (Saka, Pedri)   Star – really good player who consistently turns up, but may struggle to be considered the best player on a loaded team / may struggle to find significant success with a squad where they are the best player (Nkunku, Rice)
For me a world class player is someone who could get into majority of the clubs in the world from his position and has been a reliable figure since atleast 3,4 seasons Like, Mbappe, KDB, Kante, Modric, Kane etc  For players like Saka, Osimhen who has been doing very good since a season or two maybe rising superstars !
Genuine question, what team in the world does he not start in? Does Messi play RW? Even then, Saka is more in form right now.
World-class potential, that's what I go with most of the time.
A 'trent'
Elite
Now id say Saka is world class because hes actually been quite consistent lately, maybe your right another year or 2 to go. But leading a team to the prem, which we all agree is the hardest top league there is right? Well thats a world class feat no?   But my reasoning that hes world class is he does it on a international level too. That penalty miss is so irrelevant to ones overall ability as a player. He would start any team in the world bar one or 2 and that means hes world class
As an Arsenal fan,i say you're right to not rate him world class yet.he needs to keep up this level of performance for atleast a couple of seasons more after this one to earn it.Kane is indeed world class as he has been doing excellent for like 8 years now.
I think world class gets thrown around way too liberally.   For me world class means top 20 in the world (non-GK). Kane is in that for me personally, Saka is close and I agree he needs to do it for a few more seasons. I don’t think Bellingham is world class yet either, I think he’s also gottta do it a season or more. But we need to stop saying everyone is World Class, like ManU fans calling Bruno world class is outrageous, he’s great but he’s not top 20 or calling City fans screaming about Foden.  To me if you can’t put him in your top 20 he’s not world class, plain and simple.
For me Saka starts for every team in league.
World class for me is - can he get into the top 5 teams in the world.   Someone who is consistently world class, is probably say were legendary.   Kane is world class and will be classed as a legend.  Saka is world class but may not become legendary.  Edit: although I do like someone else’s definition of Saka and others like him would maybe fall in an “elite” category, rather than world class. For now!
Harry Kane

Harry Kane
Very good
You can use Harry Kane as a synonym.
"Valuable."  Meaning he won't break the bank, but he will bring you hardware.
Harry Kane may be world class but it can’t be confirmed until he’s playing for a successful team. Only then will we know if he can do it when the pressure is on in big games. In CL semis / finals. In league title deciders. His record in international tournaments for England is flakey. He doesn’t score when it matters. Scoring goals against minor teams in qualification is ok but doing it at the business end and dragging your team over the line is what makes a player world class IMHO. Messi. Greasy Ronaldo. Mbappé. Fat Ronaldo. Etc.   Let the pile on commence 😬
Where would England be without Saka right now? That is what makes him World Class.

For me ‘World Class’ Has been used for too many players  World Class for me means a player who would repeat the same records in any league he played in regardless of the team he played for.  So weirdly I don’t think certain players who got that tag deserved it. I can think of examples of (English) players from Div One/Premier League who have been labelled World Class but were, that weren’t and should’ve been labelled as World class:  Three that were: Lineker, Gasgcoine, Keegan  Three that were labelled ‘World Class’ but weren’t: Owen, Woodgate, Ashley Cole.  Three who didn’t get labelled ‘World Class’ but should’ve:  Steve McManaman, Glen Hoddle, Laurie Cunningham  I don’t know if I could say someone like Kane or Rooney would replicate what they did/do in the Premier League at Spainish or German club. That’s why I think there’s soo few World Class players.   Looking at some of the ‘World Class’ players who came to the Premiership and failed proves how few there are around.
I think people really use the term world class nowadays. As good as saka I would never put him in the world class category. A few years ago being world class meant being lewandowski, benzema, Suarez, Buffon. Now it means anyone is pretty good. World class should mean one of the best in the world. Should mean playing at the very top of the game. Saka is certainly nowhere near that, just because he may be one of the best youngster in England doesn't mean he's actually good enough to be top class. People work out world class by comparing to other players which is bullshit
Being pedantic, I'd argue that everyone playing in the Premier League is world-class.
Yeah that's fair to me. Who do you think are some top players who are on the cusp of being world class?
AKA the Trent Alexander-Arnold class
I love this, yes this is it.
I can’t remember a single shit game from saka in the last 2 seasons though. Consistency isn’t his problem, just longevity I suppose.
Totally agree, for me world class is a player who would get into any team in the world
How would you define it? I always thought of it as if you were putting together a team of the best 11 players in the world, they'd be starting. They'd be the best in the world in their position.
Don't forget solar class, galactic class, group class, supercluster class, and universal class
I’d add a hemispheric class between world and continental.
Let’s be clear the space between each is not equal lol
Yes, I like this.
Town class  Neighbourhood class  House class  Basement class
I feel your missing a category between professional and world class there are professional footballers in the national league
Yeah I like that ranking for sure and I'd completely agree with you.
Nkunku is a superstar lol
Kdb is not world class and never ever has been.
No way Kante or Kane are world class, I think you gotta be world class and top of your level for the rest of your career modric and mbappe on the other hand… has that ability… I think Kane needs to do it at a bigger club until we consider him world class, Kante only had about 3 years at the top level not his all career, KDB, Paul Scholes, Gerrard, Xavi, Iniesta, Maldini are my picks
Like you said in form, being in form doesn't make him better
Is he mores in form? All stats favour messi this season
Don’t think he’d be a starter for Man City. Maybe not Madrid either.   But yeah, you can make a credible argument that he could start for every team in the world currently. Man’s doing brilliantly
Trent is far from world class
I’d argue Bruno is higher up than Saka atm, but yeah I think top 20 sounds about right, which Bruno isn’t in my top 20. Foden is definitely not either.
Bellingham has got promise, insane talent and fantastic ability for his age. But no way near world class yet.
Yeah I don't disagree with that
Well at least you've made it easy for everyone else to know that you don't understand football
Well you've made it easy for everyone to know you don't understand football
For world class? I totally agree
Harry kanes record in international tournaments is flakey? You do know he literally has a worldcup golden boot right?
England would be Euro champions without Saka
He's our most inform player at the minute yes completely agree. Give him a year or two and he's world class. I'm not trying to suggest he's not a good player at all, just needs another season of consistency under his belt
I mean we’re unsuccessful with him or without him, not the lads fault we have a dinosaur in a waistcoat as a manager
Okay
Top top player = world class.
Cusp of world class imo would be the likes of Bruno G, Mateo Kovacic, Ciro Immobile, Lisandro Martinez etc., players who at certain points begin to beg the question of whether they are WC or not but that I personally don't feel like they're quite at that level. I'm sure at least 2 of those I mentioned will be world class one day though for sure!
Someone like Gundogan comes to mind
TAA is on his own in the mostlyshitbutoccasionallyputsinagoodcrossthusmaskinghisshitness class
Not really, not everyone would get into every team. Feel like this would only really apply to goalkeepers. Only players that would get into any team are the true best of the bests, ronaldo, messi suarez, neymar etc. I call those generational talents, someone so good that they would walk into any team and play aswell as they normally do, regardless of how the teams system is lined up. Not to say someone like kane is bad, he is an incredible player, he just doesn’t suit some teams systems
Everyone seems to have a different definition. For me I’d say first or second best in your position.
Except that clearly isn't enough because you could make the case for multiple players for a position and some players in certain positions are better than others in other positions?   Like are you saying if Suarez got into your world 11 then you wouldn't consider Lewandowski world class? Are the best LB's in the world better than someone like Kane?
Marcos Alonso was once best player at his position. Never was world class.
Why there's a "group class" in the middle of these interstellar classes
In Serbia lowest level of footbal is called, beton(concrete) League .
it’s FIFA degrees of CPU/AI difficulty lol
Feel like superstar is better than world class though, there’s plenty of world class players but only a handful of superstars. A superstar for me is the top 5 of the top 20 world class players and is a player that everybody knows ie messi, neymar, Ronaldo and so on. They’re more than just football they go beyond the football pitch. But that doesn’t mean there aren’t players of an almost similar calibre which would be the world class players.
Mate, I’m an Arsenal fan. Harry Kane is world class. Sit down and shut up.
The players you mentioned (except kdb closely) are above worldclass category, they are LEGENDS OF THE GAME.  While discussing world class, we mean current ones
You're thinking of "world class" as like legends. People use the term inconsistently but thats way too restricted. World class is meant to mean the best active players, not people who will necessarily be remembered.
Exactly. In form doesn't make him world class, but another season of this level of performance and I'll happily call him world class
He would absolute start for City. Put your crack pipe down.  He would also start for Madrid.
City would trade both Grealish and Foden for Saka *today* lol.
Ooo good luck with that call pal, I don't agree with you but I feel like a lot of people on here will have your head for it. But then I think brunos mentality is his biggest problem.
Bruno from 2 seasons ago against Saka this season would be a more fair comparison maybe, but Saka is playing considerably better this season than Bruno is.
Who currently gets the nod over saka in a world 11?
England's all time top scorer and could become the prem's all time top scorer- if thats not world class what is?. If he played for City and won loads of trophies everyone would call him world class.
And you've made it easy for everyone to know you've got no sense of humour
Hat trick against the mighty Panama in the group and no goals after the last 16. Looked bang average against Croatia in the SF. Same against Italy in the final of the Euros. Is that a big game player? Maybe a top player.
Also, here is a crazy idea… Pickford shouldn’t be so shit to let that goal go in. The back 3 of Maguire-Stones-Walker are even more culpable then Saka for missing his penalty because those 3 were on the field when the goal went in. Like seriously… fuck off with that bullshit.
I guess Kane should have scored goals when he wanted to score goals and he wouldn’t have been in that situation. Fuck outta here
Man really said Kovacic will be world class one day
Man really said Kovacic will be world class one day
It just shows its subjective. You disagree with my point and that's fine. You can agree that multiple players are top level, but theirs only one per position who are "world class" for me.
Galaxy group
Ah right lol
Good point. At least in NBA terms, all star is a top 15 player. Superstar is someone in the MVP conversation.
I see where you’re coming from for sure!  I’d definitely agree that there’s that inner circle of player that transcends even being world class… like (to build off of the comment below) Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is having a great season in the NBA & may beat Stephen Curry for 1st team All-NBA this season… but hey, it’s Stephen Curry, he’s just that next level of stardom.   I personally call those guys “megastars” I guess, but yeah “superstars” could certainly designate that exclusive handful.  I think we’re absolutely in agreement about the general range of how many players fit into each given tier.
I'm glad you said it as I would just be called bias! If anything doing it all at spurs is even more impressive as we are bad (and we were only truly competitive for 3 seasons maybe)
Over who?
Not sure about Mahrez, that ball-winning midfielder that masquerades as a winger could easily be replaced though.
Nope he wouldn't see below why
Haha, you’re right, I should’ve been more careful. I agree his mentality is whack. I’m not even a Manchester United fan, so I don’t follow him/them too closely to have to deal with his constant nagging lol, but I think it’s fair to say his tenure with Man U and Portugal thus far has been quite solid. The talent is there, I’d say.
I agree with you. But I don’t think just bc Saka is better this season means Saka is better than Bruno, as others have mentioned. They’re pretty equal though imo. Not going to argue any further with anyone who thinks Saka is better
Maybe Mahrez, maybe Salah. Is Vinicius left or right?
Touché, my bad you get a lot of dumb opinions on here
You can't say someone having a world Cup golden boot is flakey in international tournaments tho. Kane gets into any team in world football, unless they already have a world class player in his position (ie benzema)
I meant Licha and Bruno G mate
Courtois over Ederson. As a Liverpool fan I'm pretty sure I'm going to have nightmares about that man for the rest of my life
Ederson is not world class. He's just good with his feet (suits City's style) .
I’d put Thiago Silva with Mbappe, Mbappe, Messi, and don’t forget Neuer.
You're confusing best with world class. It's not as subjective as you're making it out.   Who is the only world class striker in the world by your standards?
Rodrygo and Hazard, certainly.
Saka has won the ball more than Mahrez, per 90, this season.  Pick another attribute to use as bullshit.
lol, Mahrez.  Vini is right footed, mostly. Plays on the left.
Vini plays right as mentioned. Mahrez and Salah for sure at the start of the season but now now? Probably not.  I agree though that saka needs to be top pick for longer than half a season to be truly world class.
My argument is that he doesn’t do it on the big stage in the big games. That’s what world class players do, like the Ronaldos, Zidane, Mbappe, Messi. They take the game by the scruff of the next and drag their team through big matches and to win big titles. Harry hasn’t done that yet.
he did it in terms of position not in terms of who is better than the other
Neuers not been great the last two or three seasons.
Woah there Teddy, you're allowed your opinion, just like I'm allowed mine. I hope you're ok mate.
At city? I’d argue Rodrygo is close enough
I'm talking about Valverde mate, his position is clearly in the axle, he's not great for the flanks. I  love Mahrez and Saka!
Saka is on or with Vini Jr. at this point, in a team that isn’t as strong and playing in a much stronger league.  Vini Jr is a lot, lot better than Rodrygo.
Saka would start over Valverde who as you said, is masquerading. Saka has put up better numbers and his ball winning numbers ain’t too far behind Valverde (bearing in mind Saka doesn’t have any minutes played this season as a primary ball winner).  Valverde is used on the wing because RM has a ridiculous number of central midfielders and Valverde, as a CM starting over Rodrygo on the right wing backs up what I said.  Put Saka in this RM team and he would be putting up Vini Jr numbers at the very least. If anyone is not so sure, ask yourself if that’s not the case, how is Saka putting up Vini Jr numbers whilst at Arsenal and in a much tougher league.  As I said, Saka would start in both Real Madrid and Manchester City.   I would agree he is on the cusp of world class, he only has this season and last season performing at this level, with these numbers.
Why because he is English?
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣no hes really not on vini jr level.  He doesnr start for city he doesnt have the dicipline, peps philosophy drilled into him or the tactical awareness etx.. the city wingers have learnt at city so nope he wouldn't start straight away for city. He'd struggle just like every signing weve made under pep bar 1 player haaland whos a freak of nature,  saka is a good player,  the main question is can hr repeat it over and over again. Time will tell.. good luck to the lad.
No, because he’s the better player.  Saka starts in this Madrid team, he also starts in this Man City team.
"Saka wouldn't start for City because he doesn't play for City" is all you said here.
It would take him a season to settle and get used to the system so he wouldn't outright start for city like people are suggesting. What happens if he doesnt adapt etc.. nothing is a given. Ive not even mentionee ball retentions and recycling the ball etc.. its a matter  of opinion both foden and mahrez are brilliant on the right for city even silva, it would be hard for him to be honest.
>All the evidence points to Ted Boehly acting alone   All evidence points to him acting alone because he was acting alone. The three people who handled transfers all stepped down at the beginning of the window before he had any ability to bring in a new office staff.  Don't forget, Chelsea hasn't had a DoF since Emenalo left. It's all been Marina, Buck, and lately, Cech. What's he supposed to do, not address any of the needs just because he doesn't have a technical director? In his conversations with Tuchel, it became clear that TT only wanted to focus on manager roles, and didn't seem interested in offering any advice on signing players. That's what led him to being fired, not his results.
Boehly is the typical owner who has a lot of money but is clueless about the sport. Chelsea would be scary with the resources they have if they had competent football people in charge.
He’s the man in charge  He also was the one that wanted to abuse a loophole in FFP so he could lump like 10 new players on a new manager that had never had big club experience before.  Clearly he hasn’t got a clue how football actually works.
Your next research topic should be how to spell his name
Boehly looks like a fucking bull in a china shop. He’s going to end up getting put in time out by the Clearlake board. This summer is going to be crazy.
 He very much reminded me of abramovic when he first arrived. He seemed to have his own lost of targets that didn't necessarily line up with the managers viewpoint.   He signed a load of players then sacked tuchel then signed more and Potter. You need to match a managers vision or find a manager who matches yours.
Yes.
Todd.
According to the Athletic today, which means it could be something  Matt Law made up on his  lunch hour? ( He was the former mouthpiece for Roman but Romano now seems to occupy that spot for Clearlake ) . Anyway Boehly is the mouthpiece but Behdad is the one making all the calls . That makes some sense as he is the Clearlake man on the spot . He and Boehly kept Potter on when the new directors wanted him gone after the Spurs game .
Surely that's something you sort out before you spend 3 billion in s football club.  Newcastle had interim advisors for sporting decisions been the takeover and Ashworth being allowed to join 6 months later..
They didn’t have anyone but Boehly until Vivell in January I think and the sporting directors in late January or February? I can’t remember, but they do actually have competent people in place now, which is why according to the rumors they all wanted a change for a while but Boehly wouldn’t admit his mistake. Abramovich was the ruthless success first owner, but damn at least he put people around him to make decisions. Lesson learned, real life is not football manager
So when chelsea goes for players, they must make sure to only buy players from clubs from the “big clubs” right? And if there’s nothing available, surely no transfers are better than transfers of players who don’t play on the top 5 teams in the world right?
Tedd Bolly*
Theadore Bouuly
Why would they need interim advisors when Marina, Bruce, and Cech didn't immediately hand in their notices? No Director of football or technical director would be available at that point because of summer windows.
No idea what you’re talking about tbh
Ted Bowly
>No Director of football or technical director would be available at that point because of summer windows.  Transfer window is for players  Evidently it has proven to be a bad decision
I’m asking you to reaffirm what you mean. Do you mean chelsea should only buy from the “top clubs” and if no players from those clubs are available, obviously don’t buy anyone right? This is my understanding of what you are saying
For example, enzo, is only from the mere Benfica. Would you say chelsea should have just avoided him, as he’s from benfica, which means he has no big club experience. Wouldn’t you say that it was a bad move to buy him, or Wes Fofana, or Badiashile, considering they all didn’t come from “top teams”?   Wouldn’t no transfers, according to you, make more sense
Technical Directors and Directors Of Football are the main drivers of transfer strategy. No team with a good relationship with theirs is going to let them go before the window starts is my point. Once Marina, Buck, and Cech stepped down he really only had Tuchel to rely on for building a team, and reports came out that he didn't want to take on that role.
I never said that?
I said potter doesn’t have big club experience
It just seems like Boehly overestimated himself. Should have got people in to advise on a short term basis.
“He was the one who wanted to lump in a bunch of players who don’t have top club experience, clearly he has no clue about the game”   Correct me if I’m wrong but you said this
But you said “he wanted to lump in 10 players with no big club experience”   I doubt potter is a player….
I was talking about potter not the players
You need to read it again
So Potter abused the loophole? I reread it, you are talking about Boehly and the transfers
Bruh
Fucking hell you are thick as shit
Yea I see what you mean now, my apologies
Without a comma it can be interpreted that the players were the subject you described as inexperienced
Harsh on shit
Arsenal winning the league. We'd happily trade all 3 trophies for the league title. I don't think we'll win all 3 though, City are still in the FA Cup and some decent teams still in the Europa.
Even as a United fan, I'd have to say Arsenal if they win the title
Arsenal, easily.   Cups are good, but they’re secondary.
In my opinion, Arsenal winning the league is more impressive. The aim was to originally to finish top 4, and many people even doubted that.   A club the size of Man Utd, with the resources at their disposal, aiming to win those trophies should have already been their objective.
As a supporter which would you prefer, those three trophies or winning the league?   For me it’s winning the league, and it’s not close.
I see OP asking everyone about whether Arteta has managed Arsenal better or whether ETH has managed us better, so to OP   First of all, your question is pointless because you cannot compare Arteta and ETH on an even playing field rn because Arteta is in his 3rd or 4th season (I'm not sure) at Arsenal and ETH is in his first season at United   This question is more suitable to be asked 4-5 years down the line when both managers will have been at their clubs for a decent amount of time
Arsenal winning the league hands down. Their costliest player is what 55M? Plus it's Arsenal. Look where they were last few seasons. This would something truly remarkable.  Very well recruited players (quite a few gambles there)  Young, hungry manager (first proper job and being properly backed)  Academy players playing crucial roles  A proper modern style of play (no counter attacking bullshit)   All boxes ticked off. Us United fans can only dream of ticking the above 4 criteria (for now)
Treble? The Same one they laughed at Liverpool for?   The league and the champions league singularly are better than the other three together
Sorry, is this a serious question?  1: United are in no way 'on course' to win the FA cup and Europa League.  2: A Premier League title is waaaaay above those other three combined. Anyone can win a cup, depending on luck of the draw etc. But winning a league is a great achievement, especially the Premier League.
Ide swap all 3 trophies and my nan for a premier league
I mean, the prem is bigger. Especially given Arsenal haven't won it in 20 years and that they weren't even necessarily favorites for top 4 at the start of the season.
Probably Arsenal as winning the title is the bigger achievement. However if United were to win all three trophies - given the season being disrupted by the WC and the Queen's death having to juggle all competitions is a massive achievement in negotiating all of that - especially given the knockout opponents in the EL. Personally don't think they will though.
This reminds me to this time last year when everybody tought Liverpool will win everything...
As a prize 1PL > 3 minor cups, but from where United were when ETH took over, to where they would be if they won a cup treble in his first season would IMO be a more impressive managerial achievement.  Arteta has done a great job, but he's had seasons to build the foundations of his team.
Top 4 finish +3 trophies is more impressive than one trophy.  Arsenal haven’t went deep into any other comp so they’ve only got the PL to focus on
Wow as an arsenal fans I was about to say getting a treble is more impressive.  But like why tf every thing has to be ranked. I’m sure if both happened fans of both teams are gonna celebrate their shit outta them. The world is not totally ordered
And its a league against a City with Haaland, de Bruyne and Guardiola nonetheless
Got to beat Brighton before looking at (probably) City, and I fancy them to beat us tbh.
We can definitely beat City in a one off as long as we have a decent midfield starting. I do agree we almost certainly won't win all 3, but I'd honestly be delighted with 2 trophies this season.
Ten hag challenging the culture at United though. He looks to make them relevant in every competition again.
So would you say Arteta has managed arsenal better than ten hag has managed United ?
As a support you would say the premier league. But what ten hag is doing at United is extremely impressively considering how this season began for them .
Both managers are currently over achieving.  My question is just on who is overachieving more this season.  If this was 5 years later and you ask this question with the same circumstances then the answer is obviously Arteta.  But because ten hag is within  his first season and has flipped Manchester United around from what was arguably their worst season In two decades. There is a question on which manager is actually achieving more with that they have. Arteta has had more time and Ten hag has spent more money.  I am an arsenal fan, but what United had been doing this season is impressive.
Brilliant 👏
Me too 😂
The prem is definitely bigger, but which side has been managed better ?
Ehh EFL cup we got exposed in depth and played an entire B team and saliba. Wouldn’t be surprised if arteta came out and said he didn’t care for that comp given such a poor team selection against Brighton  FA cup getting city so early on was annoying and it was a pretty close game imo but the better side won  Europa we just fumbled the bag  I think partly why United have gone far is a lack of rotation but luckily your players have mostly been up for it. But it looks to have cost you in the league.  But we were top when we were still in other comps too so it doesn’t make sense to say we’ve only focused on the league. We’ve been too for pretty much the whole season so it’s only recently where it’s helped that we’ve been knocked out of the cups
So would you take top 4 and 3 smaller trophies over the premier league ?
That’s exactly what Arteta has done at Arsenal
Arteta spent his first year clawing out the cultural rot that Wenger/Emery had allowed to grow
That's what United is, to be big competitors and favourites in every competition we are in, that's the United way and culture, he's slowly bringing that back, we had this under SAF
He has. The same group of players who were terrible last year look very good now. But, he’s not a miracle worker and we still have some much needed additions to this squad before we’re ready to put up a serious title challenge.   In many ways, this team reminds me of Arsenal last year or Liverpool in 2017/18. You can see that the ethos is there and the coaching is working. We can beat anyone (especially at home) but consistent excellence is still beyond us.
100% yes  We’ll see what ETH does with time, he’s on the right track. But Arteta is some way clear at the moment
Yes.
Can't say that because this is Arteta's third season at Arsenal I think and ETH is still in his first season at United so a very pointless question
It’s definitely an improvement and if he wins all three it will be a real achievement (long way to go). But it’s not a 90 point league season. That’s rarified air.
As impressive as Arteta taking a bunch of mediocre players and moulding the squad into title challengers?  I don’t think so
He is doing marginally better than Ragnick and marginally worse than OGS. And that’s after spending £300m on mostly bringing in his boys from Ajax.  To say that ETH is revolutionising United is the most delusional United fan take since saying you would win the league a month ago.
Both managers are overachieving.  Which one is doing better?  The one in 1st place, obviously.
Worse season in two decades?   Pal we had SAF till 2013, last season was our worst since 2013In the two decades you're mentioning we won numerous PLs, FA cups and Carabao cups and also the UCL     Agreed ETH has spent more money, but money without time is nothing, it's very rare that you spend 200 mil in your first summer at a club and go on to win the league title and multiple other trophies, the manager is new, the old players have a new manager and new playstyle, the new players either have a different league or different manager they're playing under, so it all takes time to settle down and get up and running, so time vs money isn't a good ground for comparison
Manchester United finished 2nd in 2020/21. They lost just 6 games. You make it sound like they had a mid table squad the last Seasons. It’s a billion pound squad
Manchester United had 47 points after 27 games last season. This season they have 50 from 27 games. +3 points up.  Arsenal have 18 more points that same stage last season.
Clearly Arsenal,bad teams in good days can win cups but consistency gets titles.
Don't get me wrong, ETH has done great. But Arteta took a meme team and made them champions. I'll tell you this, ETH's first season has obviously been far better than Arteta's first season.
I’d still rather win the Prem but a team competing and winning 3 different trophies whilst getting top 4 edges it for impressiveness for me.
Artetas 3rd season is up there with some of the all time great premier league campaigns. ETH is considered less until he has his own similarly successful campaign.  Thats how it works. Otherwise you can argue Potter at Chelsea was equal to Arteta at Arsenal if you look just at season 1.
What I meant is last season was probably United's worst season, comparable to 2001-2002.  The squad needed a rebuild similar to what last season needed.  Ten hag looks like he's achieving that
Arteta’s first season he won the FA cup, with a terrible squad and no transfer window.  ETH had the summer window and was able to sign players of the caliber of Casemiro.
Far better? Arteta won the Fa cup beating Man City and Chelsea on the way.
City are chasing down arsenal with a goal machine that haaland.   United are battling for top 4 between most inconsistent top 6 in years.   Would you agree the levels are different?
All time great is pushing it a lot in my opinion. Arsenal can now get a maximum of 100 points which is unlikely considering the would have to win all of their remaning 9 games. Since the 16-17 season all premier league winner has but one has had over 93 points. Hard to argue that Arsenals campaign been greater than any of those considering most of those teams also fought in multiple competitions to the very end, which Arsenal is not doing this season.
In what was was 2001-02 season bad?   For SAF United standards, yes finishing 3rd is bad, but comparing that to the shambles we were last season, not even close
And with a terrible squad to boot
And got 8th...twice in a row. ETH is favorites for the final of the FA cup having already won the league cup and is strong favorites for the EL too. Arteta was out of those both early.
I’m not saying United are better but I find when teams can win 3 trophies more impressive than just one.
Yes and over the last 3-4 years we have had most of the all time great campaigns. City spent 2x there rivals to do it. So it’s not so special.  Liverpool have been incredible and there title win probably would have been the greatest until covid stalled it.
Okay,   Last season was a horrible season. Ten hag has turn them around.   Is it as impressive as Arteta turn around at arsenal.  That's all the questions was
First half season— 8th having taken over when Arsenal were 11th and won the FA cup.  First full season was not great though.  ETH has also had the luxury of playing EVERY domestic cup game at home, 7/7. That’s never happened before. Also against sides below them in the league, every game.
Again, you cannot compare   Because Arsenal were better than United last season   If you compare both their first seasons, ETH's first season is more impressive than Arteta, I can't say anything more that because ETH hasn't been at the club long enough
It's going to be so bad both teams will lose
For a neutral this game will be absolute trash.
Mate, for the neutrals this game will most likely be boring as hell. I support Chelsea so I have to put myself through it unfortunately
Most boring 0-0 you'll ever see
El Shittico.
Why didn’t someone tell me this game is being shown on Comedy Central
As a neutral this game is going to be such garbage
The movable object vs. the stoppable force
Out of all the games on tonight, this one has the least on the line. But because it's two of the 'Big 6' it's guaranteed to be on TV.
There's 4 games tonight. This is by far the least interesting of them all. Proper mid-table clash. 11th vs 8th.
As a Liverpool supporter I predict this will be one of the worst games of the season. The 0-0 at Anfield was absolutely unwatchable. Just dire football from both sides. Now Chelsea have no manager, they're shit at home and we're significantly worse and almost never win away from Anfield.  Both sides will find a way to lose. Another 0-0 while everybody else leaves us in the dust with their 3 point results.  Hope I'm wrong but Liverpool - Chelsea league games are almost always shit. It's only when we face eachother in cup competitions where it gets really entertaining for neutrals.
Klopp will 100% make changes, the question is how many.  At the weekend he called out 4 players that had an 'OK' performance, all others were shit: Alisson, Henderson, Fabinho, Gakpo  If he went whole hog on it and replaced all other players you'd likely end up with a starting XI of:  Alisson  Milner - Gomez - Matip - Tsimikas  Oxlade-Chamberlain - Fabinho - Henderson  Nuñez - Firmino - Gakpo  I think that's a bit extreme and unlikely so we'll see something in between.   I still think we might see a big shock like Salah benched or even Virgil benched along with at least 1 of the fullbacks.  With Arsenal at the weekend he's a bit protected from the politics and optics of making a big call
Just to make things even worse, Anthony Taylor is the ref tonight. What odds on him making yet another howler? Almost certain, right?
Anthony Taylor is the ref, that’s not good for the team in blue .
Pool have there 12th player tonight Anthony Taylor
hope chelsea win I have £100  bet with my boss on nufc finishing higher than Liverpool
Could have put a top 6 team on but they chose the mid table clash.
This is such an unpredictable game. Both teams in very strange circumstances at the moment, both teams under pressure, Chelsea may have the home advantage and a “sacking syndrome” advantage, but their squad cohesion is almost non existent. It could end up 4-0 to Chelsea or 4-0 to Liverpool or any score in between. Essentially it could go either way and I wouldn’t be getting a penny on a match like this.
This game was shit as expected lol
What a thrilling game that was 😐
And somehow there will be 4+ injures between the two teams as well.
In a historic moment, the FA have ruled that neither team deserve any points and so cancel the match. Instead, the players will all be forced to do the ice bucket challenge, with all proceeds going towards the final ballon payments for Everton's new stadium.
This comment has aged like a fine wine in less than 12 hours. Well done
That would be better than their last encounter where they were so bad only the fans lost
What if I’m neutral in the sense that I like to laugh at both teams?
As a Liverpool fan…I’m not holding my breath for any sort of excitement either….the last time they played it was absolute garbage, except for a few chances that Muydrak made when he came on. And even then…not a good watch lol. I pity everyone who is going to subject themselves to watching this game
I’m hoping both teams will defend like they did at the weekend. That way both teams attacks will have a chance and we could get a goal fest!
Anthony Taylor won't allow us to keep a clean sheet. He'll pop up at the back post with a last minute winner if he has to.
This aged beautifully
Yep, as the Carlsberg saying goes..... probably
This is aging well
Assuming Liverpool don’t just gift a goal. I think I read that Alisson has faced the 2nd most big chances in the entire league this season
Lol
Fuck me . This game was horrible . This is not even funny . Both teams are in shambles .   I fell asleep 5 times during the 90
Think it’ll be Gomez at RB with Konate and Matip as the pairing
Klopp loves Salah too much to bench him, I really don’t see that happening. Same with VVD, but we could see Milner over TAA
But it IS good for entertainment for us neutrals!
Lol you can't be serious. Anthony Taylor is notoriously shite for Liverpool as well. He's just a bad ref.
Think you're safe either way mate
Might have something to do with Liverpool and Chelsea being big clubs and Brighton being small. You're 1 point ahead of Liverpool in our worst season under Klopp. Enjoy it while it lasts.
Great, now Thiago has hypothermia and is expected to be out for 6 months.
If you being bored makes you laugh, then have at it Hoss.
haha no
He also never usually substitutes Salah, especially when behind in a game yet he yanked him off with 20mins to go 2 goals down at the weekend  I have a strong feeling he'll bench him tonight
Is it? Two teams having a poor season and stuck in mid table. Screams 0-0 to me. Leeds v Forest is a must win for both. That's where I'd expect entertainment if I were neutral.
I highly doubt it, it's barely enjoyable for fans of both clubs.
Bore draw
"The problem is Thiago, yes he takes the ice well, and he looks good doing it, but he really slows down Liverpool's ice bucket challenge."
Nothing is boring about watching Liverpool and Chelsea play like shit
Holy crap you were right, I've been thinking about this thread for some time and the lineups are out and damn.
Very true, totally forgot he got subbed off against City. Would be interesting to see how we look without him starting
I beg to differ. I watched the last one and I wanted to claw my own eyes out.
Yeah I completely forgot about Jones.  Virgil is apparently ill but Salah benched is a big statement
Guess you just don’t hate Liverpool enough
very weird coming from a united fan
I'm excited as hell to watch this, new experiment from Klopp
Watching them play out 0-0 with barely any chances or anything happening in the game is not entertaining. I’ll definitely watch the highlights if they get destroyed tonight though 😂  Edit* oh look 0-0 what a thriller, who could have seen that coming 😅
7-0
Mendy  Fofana-Silva-Badiashile Chillwell-Kante-Enzo-James Félix Sterling-Havertz  3-4-1-2
I'd pick:  4-2-3-1  GK - Prince Adegoke (amazing name)  RB - Loftus-Cheek  CB - Chalobah  CB - Cucurella  LB - Hall  CM - Tauriainen  CM - Chukwuemeka  RW - Pulisic  AM - Hutchinson  LW - Mudryk  CF - Aubameyang   That's a team with zero leadership, lots of headless running and a sack of shit up front. As a rival fan it would be glorious to watch!
Only problem is the players who really stand out to me as their best performers (James, Chilwell & Kante) can’t stay fit for more than 3 games at a time.   Really tough when you’re trying to turn the ship around and you either have players who are unreliable performance wise or unreliable injury wise.
You have to play Sterling over Madueke he is their best forward
3-4-3 is the best formation for chelsea  Mendy  Fofana Silva Badiashile  James enzo kante chilly  Havertz felix mount/sterling
I’d slot Mount in over Madueke.
I'd pick - 3-4-1-2      GK - Kepa   LCB- Badiashille   CB - Koulibaly   RCB - Fofana     CM- Enzo   CM-Kante   LM-Chilwell   RM-Reece     CAM-Mount     ST- Havertz   ST- Joao
5-3-2  Kepa,james, fofana, silva, badiashile, chilwell, Kante, kovacic, enzo, felix ,sterling.  That's a top 4 standard team if it was fit and firing
You have to utilise james and chilwell in a 5 at the back otherwise nothing will work for them and as much of a knob as Aubamayang is id rather him start than some of their other dross up top that cant finish a rendition of Chelseaaaaaaa Chelseaaaaaa Chelseaaaaaaa
"GK - That one RB - That one CB - That one CB - That one LB - That one CDM - That one CM - That one CM - That one RW - That one ST - Havertz LW - That one"  - Todd Boehly, probably
It beggars belief that they spent 5. 2 trillions pounds and still manage to use havertz as their main striker.
It’s too late to ask now, Potter!
Bettinelli  Gusto - Ampatu - Sarr - Baba Rahman  Hudson-Odoi - Bakayoko - Zakaria  Lukaku - Aubameyang - Nkunku
Probably your lineup   Enzo next to Kante in a double pivot has the potential to be great, Enzo has always played next to a player that is a ball winner that is more defensive minded since he isn’t imo the best physically although he does contribute defensively it’s not his strength.
Assuming everyone was healthy, I’d go   Kepa James, Fofana, Silva, Badiashile, Chilwell Enzo, Kante Felix, Havertz, Mudryk
Mendy  Fofana-Silva-Badiashile Chillwell-Kante-Enzo-James Havertz-Nkunku-Mudryk   3-4-3
I’d do a 3-4-1-2:  GK: Mendy RWB: Reece RCB: Wes CB: Silva LCB: Badiashile LWB: Chilly RDM: Kante LDM: Enzo CAM: Mason LS: Felix RS: Havertz  Mendy over Kepa because he is a better shot stopper. I prefer him despite the fact that he is worse on the ball than Kepa.   The problem with this lineup is, on paper, Havertz and Felix is a good partnership, however in reality, they both play as second strikers. Neither of them are 9s for the other to feed off of. Also, they both struggle with finishing.  So, alternatively the best could be a 4-2-3-1:  GK: Mendy LB: Chilly LCB: Silva RCB: Wes RB: James CDM: Enzo RCM: Kante LCM: Mason RW: Madueke, Ziyech, Sterling? ST: Havertz, Broja, Auba? LW: Mudryk, Pulisic, Felix?  Too many attacking options with Nkunku arriving in the summer.
GK- Édouard Mendy  LB- Ben Chilwell  CB- Thiago Silva  CB- Kalidou Koulibaly  RB- Reece James  DM- Enzo Fernández (or Kanté if he proves he’s still as good as he used to be before his lengthy injury)  CM- Mateo Kovačić  LW- Raheem Sterling (could also pick Mudryk or Pulisić here as they are all as shit as each other)  AM- Mason Mount  RW- Hakim Ziyech  CF- Joao Félix
If everyone is fit...  Mendy  Reece James.  Thiago Silva.   Fofana.   Chilwell.  Enzo Fernandez.          Kante.           Kovacic.  Mount.                                        Felix.  Broja.
Would rather have auba up front, even if he's not hugely better than havertz he is at least a proven striker
Correct
I don't mind this either
Good team
Imo 352 would be even better  Kepa Fofana-Silva-Badiashile Chillwell-Kante-Enzo-Kovacic-James  Félix-Havertz
Yank here. What are you talking about? Puligoat the Lebron James of soccer ball will get the London Chelsea Blues to the final playoffs of the Champions Bowl, watch and see!
Absolutely agree. One of the reasons I feel sorry for Potter. Had probably the most amount of injuries in Europe at one point this season and games were coming every 3 days so he had to worry about fatigue etc Really was fighting an uphill battle.
You were so close until you put KK over Silva.
I think you can either have one of Kante or Kovacic. 3 center mids takes away a lot of creativity. I think you'd have to swap one of the 8s with Mount or Havertz
Lol
.....
That made me chuckle
Even with injuries our team should be in the top 6 with the talent alone.  Still feel sorry for Potter for him being himself which is bang average.  Potter's number 1 job is to motivate the players to play their best.  It is obvious the way they played the 2nd leg of Dortmund that the players can be motivated or they motivated themselves.  I believe the latter.
This lineup was for yesterday's match. Having a fit Silva and not including him in the playing 11 is a crime
Chelsea's best areas are the wingbacks so the focus should be on them, kovacic and Enzo as the 8's would offer enough in that system, both can do a bit of everything. Havertz isn't a midfielder and mount just isn't good enough
Edited Because maths isn't my strongest subject!  Although with 12 players we'd have a chance
then you should go to r/soccercirclejerk
Don Carlo would be fighting in the mid table scrap if he had 11 injuries at one time.
Havertz is more of a free roam player so I think Enzo and Kante/Kovacic would give him enough cover. Mount when he is in form is good enough. How he has been playing this season is the exception, not the rule.   352 isn't it.
Didn’t klopp manage to drag Liverpool to 3rd a couple of seasons back despite having millions of injuries and no CBs?
You cannot play a forward/false 9 in midfield with a free role and also have two forwards, They would get dominated, Havertz is a good player by the way but he would be one of the two forwards or on the bench. In this side, hes too similar to felix to play them both and id want the pace and movement of sterling instead.  This is an example of Chelsea's problem, or one of them, they don't have a defined system and players that suit the system, its just a collection of players from a bunch of different managers that have had different styles and systems that largely don't fit together.   Mason Mount is shit, I will die on that hill.
Are you talking the season where United, Spurs, and Chelsea were tripping over their dicks to not come in fourth?  Regardless of the other teams, its a different situation when you factor in how long Klopp had before that to have his system in place.
You literally don't know a thing about football lad.
The season where Man Utd finished second. Pretty sure Liverpool had to play Phillips and Fabinho as CBs. Don’t get me wrong, as a Utd fan jt was hilarious, but I seem to remember klopp dealt with it well.
Coming from the guy who thinks Havertz should get a free roaming midfield role. I will take that as a compliment as I don't want to be in agreement with somebody so clueless.   Have you seen the chelsea lineup tonight?  It's basically what I suggested with a couple of defensive changes and a not fully for sterling on the bench. Midfield 3 of Enzo kante and kovacic.   Don't know a thing about football...
Then it was Spurs, Leicester, and Chelsea who were doing the dick tripping.  Regardless, my point still stands that he at least has a team system in place to be able to absorb those kind of injuries. And it was less them absorbing it and more the teams around them playing like ass.
No, you said  ‘don carlo would be fighting mid table if he had 10 injuries at a time’, the point being potter got unlucky and that any manager irrespective of their quality would struggle. My point was that better managers have coped with far worse, Klopp being the obvious example. Whatever the situation at Chelsea, even as a Utd fan I accept Liverpool a couple of seasons ago had it far worse. Kabak and Phillips was not ideal.
Ah so you don't understand hyperbole. That's fine. Taken literally id still say that a manger of Carlos quality, in their first year and facing the injuries they did, would struggle to produce a top-four club. Your example of Klopp comes after at least five years of management, not five months.
Give Potter a mid/lower table team and some time and he will build something over time. The Chelsea job just showed that when he loses the Brighton scouting network and instead is asked to work magic with the half a billion dollars worth of players that Todd Boehly pulled out of his arse, he couldn't do it. But I doubt many managers would have been able to succeed in that situation.
Rodgers mostly likely goes to Spurs I think. Levy probably would want someone as far from conte as possible and Rodgers is that man.
Zidane seems dead-set on the France job and content to wait for it so I don't think he's really available
A lot of clubs will want them. They are both good managers
Well, Luis Enrique, Rodgers and, especially, Potter, all have a damaged reputation atm, and I reckon they are also a bit burned out, so I dont see them going anywhere before summer. Interesting positions that may open in summer are Real Madrid, Atleti, Milan, PSG, and also Chelsea and Spurs if they dont land anyone before. I dont see Potter getting in any of these, Spurs at best. Same with Rodgers. No mid table club in the prem openning up soon for this 2 from what I see and they are not that rated abroad. Luis Enrique is not going to manage Madrid based on sentiment, and Atleti based on idea of football, so any of the rest could happen.  Zidane and Nagelsmann are different cases. Zidane gets in any team he want IMO. I would bet PSG will give him the big bags, as they crave that CL. Nagelsmann will probably end up in R. Madrid or Chelsea, but I think both would be a mistake, he is still young and his name may not carry that power to inspire the big egos and achieve the immediate success both these clubs demand (he honestly wasnt doing that well in the league). I honestly think Nagelsmann to Spurs would be a very a very suited affair for both. Spurs get a manager that can elevate them, and Julian gets to try the most competitive league in a club that does not have such high expectations.
Specialists in what?
Got a strong feeling BR would go to Spurs.  GP to Leicester seemed somewhat likely until he said he had no interest in going there.
- Rodgers to Liverpool - Nagelsmann to Hertha  - Potter to swedish 4th division - Lucho to PSG - Klopp a German pensioner living in Ruegen  - Zidane waiting for better times
I think they have good values and promote a good culture, neither rely on huge budgets (although both struggled to manage them at opposite ends).  I’d say any club outside the top 6. I could see a West Ham taking a punt, big club with potential.
I think we would try for both if our owner makes a massive mistake in sacking Cooper. Not convinced either would fancy it though
Could see this kinda situation coming a mile off when it was confirmed Todd would be taking over. I really wanted either Jim Ratcliffe to take over, given he actually follows football so understands it, or preferably Martin Broughton as he's a Chelsea fan and his entire team were Chelsea fans.  We've had years of seeing what Americans have done to Arsenal, United, and Liverpool, and I really didn't want that for us. Not that there's anything inherently wrong with being American, but that they approach football from a completely different perspective and fundamentally see it as a business venture, rather than for any love of the sport.
Looks likely, Spurs lack character rn
Zidane is nailed on next PSG manager IMO, he’s got the rep for handling the sort of dressing room you get when you’ve got a lot of very, very well paid top players and big egos. I wouldn’t be surprised if PSG would bin off their current manager as soon as Zidane says he’s ready.
If Forest sack Cooper I’d love him at Palace
Pretty sure he’s come out a few years ago saying he’d never manage PSG because of his loyalty to Marseille.
Zidane has been tiped to be the new psg manager evry singel time psg have needed a new manager, but it never happens.
He'd be ideal, but hopefully it won't come to that. We would all be devastated.  The rumour currently is Viera to us if Marinakis sacks Cooper, which would be an insane appointment and probably one of the worst we could make. Totally wrong fit for our club in every way and would be one of the worst decisions made in our history.
He doesnt wanna go to PSG, he doesnt seem to wanna go to any club in England, Bayern is not available and I doubt any bench in Italy is gonna pay what he makes. Maybe he has retired?
Maybe this will be another approach to Real Madrid?  In Raoul    at the head of the crisis Real Madrid I don't really believe.
I liked Vieira with us, but he took time to settle and with such a big squad it wouldn’t make any sense to make that switch.  Can’t see any manager that you could get who would do better than Cooper - and he gave you such an amazing season last year. He deserves some loyalty from the owner.
I think a lot of people would argue he already is a Premier League legend based on how many goals he’s scored and the consistency he’s demonstrated over the course of his career.
Calling Harry Kane a loser is crazy, what on earth does it make me if that man’s a loser😂
Does he need to become a piece of shit to become an all-time great? Just like “the Ronald’s”?  Nothing wrong with being a decent guy who’s, like, really good at football.
I think he will go down as a great in the Prem. If he’d like to add more to his legacy he needs to go to a club that’s hungry for silverware & competing at the highest level. I think a chance of environment would help his hunger & potentially shift that mind set that you alluded to.
Kane is gonna be a spurs legend, and a premier leauge legend. On the same level as the likes of David Silva, Vidic, Aguero etc.
Yea he will be, his numbers are pretty much immortalized as it is, just because he didn’t win any trophies doesn’t take away from his individual successes  Who knows he’ll leave, bag a couple trophies at Bayern or something and then cap off a goal filled career. Hate how good his is, love that he never won anything with spurs so far
Worst take of the day, congrats
Probably have the same view on him as Shearer does. He's brilliant. Definitely a legend for spurs fans like Le Tiss at Southampton
Already is
Shit yeah I guess to be England's top ever goalscorer, Tottenhams top ever goalscorer and on course to be the premier leagues top all time goalscorer you must have a losing mentality for sure
Given Shearer is considered an all-time-great and I wouldn't exactly call him a 'serial winner' I'd also call Kane an all-time-great. Neither has won anything with England and Kane already achieved much more with an arguably weaker side. Also both played for teams that were good but not the best, but still consistently kept scoring. And who knows how many years Kane's got left. He's never been a physical player so he might have a lot of seasons left in him, enough to beat some records, maybe win something and overall prevent those kinds of posts from happening in the future.
It might be because I hate Spurs but I don’t enjoy watching him. I don’t find that he lifts the level of his team. He’s relatively low touch, isn’t particularly quick, doesn’t press that much. Has an impressive strike with both feet, is good in the air, and somehow always managed to nick a goal.  When he plays for England I’m always frustrated watching him. He rarely seems to rise to the occasion.
He needs to win something   And I say that because the one thing that Kane has never demonstrated in his career so far is that he can perform when it really matters - when silverware is on the line - because he always seems to bottle it on those occasions. That's what stops him being a world class striker let alone an all-time great because he lacks that mental fortitude that the best players have.
Well since he is not the best even in current PL, the answer is no. Great player, awsome striker, but thats it. And it looks like he is not so good leader.
he already is and will likely end up with the all time EPL goal record until someone else breaks it after him.
Doubt he will get near Ronald our his pal Untidy but he's still a great player
Yes. Next question
It’s hard to fathom how much better at football and life Harry Kane is than most people. Calling him a loser must go some ways to helping people cope.
Sometimes I feel like people have to just be trolling for clicks.
Greats need to have trophies. That's why they are greats.
England and Spurs' top goal scorer at the age of 29. He'd  certainly be an all time great for those two.  Given he doesn't rely on pace and has a good injury record he's likely to be a top player for many more years.  He'll also likely leave spurs soon then when he has a couple of trophies under his belt his detractors will have nothing to say against him.
That’s definitely true, he’s been insanely consistent thought the years and he definitely is a great goal scorer.
Loser is maybe the wrong what to put it but I definitely feel he has a losing mentality, he wouldn’t have stayed at Tottenham so long if he didn’t
No that’s true, but you don’t have to be a cunt to have a winning mentality. Look at kante one of the nicest guys in the prem, but Hes always fighting to win and he won it all in his career
exactly this, its almost asif he has no expectations of winning anything at tottenham, if he would ahve gone to City or comes to united, he should have that "nows my chance" attitude
That’s why I never did it, I’m too much of a winner
He will probably do what Rooney did and drop even deeper to prolong the career too
Shearer also won the Premier League and came 3rd in the Ballon d'or & World player of the year awards.   Kane hasn't come close to doing either of those
Wasn't Shearer a premier league winner, Balon top 3 and world record transfer. Many Newcastle fans would probably say he lived up to the hype. I think Blackburn also bought him for an English record fee too.
Harry Kane isn't a world-class striker in your mind?
For a club that loves Alan Shearer who didn't win anything with you it's weird that you'd think Kane isn't world class. Or do you think Alan Shearer wasn't world class either?
Do you think Shearer was a world class striker?
He is the best striker in the Prem and has been for more than 5 years
That’s the impression I get too
Maybe the guy is loyal to the club he came up through ? If Grealish stayed at Villa would you also call him a loser?
Kante didn’t do it alone, though. Kane has a winning mentality, but he’s also one guy playing for a team that isn’t known for winning.
Same with Vincent Janssen for us, he was too much of a winner to only score like 3 times from open play
kane loves to play deep anyway, he would be a great no.10
Gerrard also doesn't have a Premier League and that's while playing for a bigger club, so doesn't really prove anything
Nope. I recognise that's an unpopular opinion but I feel like the term world class is bandied about too much as it is - so to label someone who has never turned up on the big occasions as a world class player is just not for me.   If you think about some of the other strikers that are labelled as world class such as Benzema, Mbappe, Haaland etc they've all a) won stuff and b) turned up at the biggest occasions.
But he did win something. It's a shame it wasn't with us but he did win something
Yes and he won a Premier League with Blackburn just to head off the inevitable follow up.
Most stable? probably.  Peak salah absolutly different world.  Current season Haaland absolutly different world.  &#x200B;  Why Kane won the golden boot just one time last five seasons?  Last season he was not even the best striker forTottenham.
Ahaha finally something we agree on my friend!
grealish is a different story, hes never going to be in the conversation of one of the best,   the only thing letting Kane down is his lack of trophies and his 6 year contract at spurs secured that legacy for himself.   i don't really want him at united, and if he does come, i don't think we play the right football to make use of him especially since for Tottenham he likes to come back and sit where Bruno likes to play.
Kane's best playmaking period was under Mou when he would drop deep, vacate space for Son and play balls behind the defence.  Without that space and those transitional moments he'd struggle to be an effective no. 10. Against a settled, compact low-block defence, Kane wouldn't have nearly the same playmaking impact.
Gerrard won a Champion’s league in one of the most memorable game ever while being the major key of his team, can’t never compare him to Harry Kane who won nothing and missed the most crucial penalties of his career.
What does Gerrard have to do with it?? Other than being a salty response because I've a Liverpool flair.  You were comparing Shearer with Kane and left out two major points as to why Shearer is considered an all-time great. Kane hasn't come close to achieving these, so how can he be seen as on a par with Shearer?
absolutely agree with this. look at what mbappe did in that wc final compared to what kane did against france.
What big occasions has Haaland showed up in to warrant him the world class tag which eludes Harry Kane?
He's going to be the leading all-time goal scorer in PL history and is already the leading all-time goal scorer for the England national team... a team that has seen the likes of Rooney, Lineker, etc.
He won something in a side that bought themselves the league title, and didn't win anything else. Didn't perform for England or didn't win anything else. Your argument is very contradictory. If Harry Kane wins a league cup in the future but nothing else would he then be world class?   Kane is world class, look at all the list of players and Strikers to have won trophies, you'll get some fantastic names of course but you'll also get some absolute dross. Now look at the list of premier league top goal scorers and England's top goalscorers and see the names Harry Kane is in and around, he's world class and has achieved this in far inferior sides to the teams these other players played for (ie Rooney had Ferguson as manager and a plethora of talent with him)
Salah isn’t a striker   Haalands been here not even one season yet, Kane also contributes to more through his general all round play than Haaland in a much worse team.  He has two in the last 5 seasons as well, Kane drops really deep a lot of the team leaving Son the furthest forward.
No idea how your flair fits in all of this but ok :D
The 2021 DFB-Pokal Final (which is the German equivalent of the FA Cup final in terms of importance) in which Haaland scored a brace as Dortmund won 4-1 to win the cup
If he wins a League Cup and plays well in the final then yes I'd happily call him a world class player because he would have proven that he can do it on big occasions. Wouldn't have any qualms with that at all.
>Salah isn’t a striker  Ok, byebye. :-)
So he showed up in a single FA cup (equivalent) final and is world class? Is Youri Tielemans also world class because he scored the only goal in the FA cup final 2 year ago? Would it not make more sense to judge a player over the course of a whole season when judging who’s world class and who isn’t ?  What is your opinion of Thierry Henry? Was he world class? cause he has a very interesting record in big occasions too.
So you're letting one singular game dictate your opinion on someone's entire career of over 300 appearances?
He literally isn’t lmfao
Henry dominated the EPL and won silverware. He won a world cup while being the best scorer in 98 and made it to another final too. He also won a champion’s league while being a key player. Henry name should never be next to Kane, the "world class" player who never won anything.
You've built an absolute strawman to beat down there and you know it.   Of course I'm not saying that being a big game player is the ONLY factor in deciding what makes a player world class, I'm saying it's the factor that stops Harry Kane being world class and separates him from the strikers that are world class.   And on the Henry point - yes of course Henry was world class. And yes I know Henry never scored in a cup final but he also didn't always play as the out and put striker during his career and I'm 99% sure that if you compared Henry's and Kane's performances on the big occasions you'd very quickly conclude that Henry played well in those matches whereas Kane did not.
No that one game will be evidence that he can do something that he previously hadn't been able to do in the previous 300 odd appearances.
They’re both world class mate, sorry to burst your bubble.
That Pokal Final is literally the ONLY factor which you’ve explicitly said separates Kane and Halaand as world class, which I find stupid hence my tongue in cheek remark on tielemans cause you seemed to place such importance in a single one off game. Both Kane and Halaand have been incredible in their leagues the last few years with Kane firstly doing it a lot longer than Halaand at a much higher standard and as a result is currently the only realistic chance of a prem player ever out scoring Shearer.  Yet because Halaand has scored two goals in a DFB pokal final he is world class and Kane isn’t. You don’t see why I find this really stupid? And I hate Kane for the record.
That’s your opinion mate, sorry to break it to you.  Most people outside of England don’t care for him, good EPL player without a winning mentality, that’s it.
You asked me for evidence of Haaland turning up on the big occasions and I gave it to you. Simple as that.   As I've said Kane not turning up on the big occasions when silverware is on the line is, for me, the one factor that stops him being a world class player.   All the other strikers I listed including Haaland have turned up on the big occasions so (considering they have all the other attributes that make a striker world class) that in my mind is what elevates them above Kane to the World Class level.
Cool👍🏻
I asked for evidence of big occasions Haaland showed up in and all you could muster to me was a single DFB pokal final against RB Leipzig which suddenly makes him world class, lol.  We are Gonna have to just agree to disagree on this clearly. I think they’re both world class as Kane has at times single handedly carried a painfully average Tottenham for the guts of the last decade and is on course to smash Shearers all time Prem record. Halaand too for just being a out and out freak goal machine the past few years.   A single DFB pokal/fa cup isn’t going to change that when they’re consistently putting up 20-30 goal contributions every season. Is Marcus Rashford world class too? Just cause he scored in the league cup against ye and is having a stellar season in the league? He’s showed up in just as many big occasions, if not more, than Halaand.
Kane makes the most of it but I’ve seen players make a meal out of less, and it barely even gets brought up if it’s given as a free kick that leads to a goal tbh
Watching the game last night,2 minutes before the incident Pedro Porto went down theatrically and Don Goodman on Sky was complaining about the diving and theatrics, then when Kane got pushed and fell he was defending him saying he had every right to go down. It’s the hypocrisy that winds people up.
Football fans seem incapable of keeping their minds in check when discussing Harry Kane.   Their player will do the same thing next week and they'll unnecessarily rationalise it.
There’s not one player in the league who would’ve stayed on their feet.
Let's be real; if this was any other player than Kane, this wouldn't be a discussion point.  Replace Kane with Solanke and nobody gives a shit.
You’ve summarised what’s wrong with how the game is officiated. He shouldn’t have to go down, the ref can use VAR. pretty sure whoever Casemeiro shoved didn’t go down? Also, he stayed down longer than a boxer or UFC fighter after a knockout. The debates because he was fucking pathetic and fans are fed up of it
Because 80% would do it it doesn't make it right.  Footballers are disgraceful when it comes to how eager they are to go down and get an opposition player carded or sent off. It's a disgusting part of the game that should have never been allowed to fester in to what it is.  I personally love it when a player gets carded for diving/simulation. I wish it happened more often.
The job of pundits/journalists is to get people talking, clicking on the videos, reading the articles etc. Their job, simply put, is to drive engagement.  So, when Jamie Carragher and Gary Neville have an idiotic debate on the subject, they're not actually saying what they think - they saying what they need to say to get people talking. That's why there's so much debate about pointless things - the media drives these idiotic debates on purpose, because by keeping engagement high, you keep the value of the league high.
People hate kane. Simple as
Unfortunately you have to throw yourself for the game to be fair, that’s how it is. if diving makes the real fouls win free kicks or worse then I’d happily have diving. obviously some people don’t over do it and rather completely fakes the injury, they’re scum
The slow mo of it makes Kane look like a bitch, but it is the game, especially with VAR being an inconsistent mess, I don't blame him or anyone else making a big deal out of *actual* contact.
It’s because Kane has been painted as the media darling and this isn’t something the media darling does. The reality is Kane has always been dirty and a diver. He had a period where he’d endanger player’s careers by nearly breaking their necks and nothing was said. His PR has painted him to be someone who would never do anything unjust so when he does, it’s big news. Reality is that Kane is just an average footballer (not in ability but in terms of how often he dives and does other stuff).
Its a red card but Kane did kick two players first and pulled the shirt off Doucoure and nothing happened for any of those incidents.
Agree, think Carra and Neville were debating the wrong thing. Kane's actions are a clear reaction to the way the game is refereed. Referees are always keen just to play on and not make a decision. Going to ground in that manner forces the ref to make a ruling, and let's be clear, that should always necessitate a red card. It's exactly the same as going to ground in the box after contact imo. Can remember examples in recent seasons where players have tried to go on and then just not been given penalties. That change has to come from refereeing not from individual players.
Kane lives rent free in peoples heads, this is why everyone has their knickers in a twist.  I can guarantee 99% would do, and do exactly the same.  And you cannot guarantee a red card for that unless you sell it. I mean our own Romero literally grabbed someone by the hair and pulled them to the ground. VAR looked at it and said “nah, that’s fine.”  And we scored, so yeah, you bet your arse you should sell it.
Former referee here.  One of the reasons to get sent off is "violent conduct." The issue of rolling around like you've been shot or connecting with an opponent is irrelevant when a player does something that can be interpreted as "violent conduct." Once a player does something that can be considered "violent conduct" why on earth should such a player remain on the pitch? A referee would be mad to not show a red.
It should get called out more. Your average fan rails against it everytime it's just the media that are making a big deal out of this one like it doesn't happen every game
It was a deserved red, but Kane was a disgrace. A little shove to the face that wouldn’t have knocked a toddler over. Then a slight delay, then the theatrical collapse to the floor. This is Harry Kane, the captain of England. Record all time goal scorer. He should be actually ashamed of his reaction. A total embarrassment to be honest.
Think the commentators reaction doesn't help, he's there justifying him going down. If that's not an English player, they talk about going down easy
i disagree entirely doucoure would/should have got sent off even if kane didnt go down. it happened right on touchline in front of fourth official, and var had perfect replays to instruct the ref. instead, kane took diving to the next level and literally threw himself to the ground like he'd been hit by tyson. fucking pathetic behaviour and the more fans start acting like its part of the game then the more it becomes part of the game. yes many other players do it but it in no way makes it ok to do. notbthe first time hes dishraced himself
What a fucking fanny, douc should've slapped him properly after it.  It takes away from what a brilliant player he is, the penalty was superb.   Didnt win them the match though did it?!? Nice try Harry but Michael Keane take a bow son
>But if Kane just stands their and goes "what did you do that for?" to Doucoure then he doesn't get sent off.  This is where you’re wrong. A hand shoved to the face like that will always be a red card.   The issue ‘everyone’ has with Kane is that he goes down crying like a child to sell it, which is embarrassing behaviour by Englands best player.
The first time I’ve seen Harry Kane flop. Everyone needs shut the hell up and leave him alone. It’s bad enough he plays for Tottenham, he’s had enough.
I think Kane committed at least 2 yellow worthy actions during the incident and should have seen 2 and been sent off. But that is only really obvious from replays. I know it wouldn't happen as VAR doesnt advise on yellows and I don't think the ref could see all the incidents from his position.
It's the shithouse he does before where he two hand shove the guy and the back and then doucoure goes and deals with him. Kane knows it's coming and makes a peach of it. But who cares at the end is Kane dropping more points at a club he'll never win anything at. Class cat that man.
It was quite sad to see a player I respect play acting like that.   But it is reflective of flaws in the game and refereeing. Why does someone like Harry Kane do that, given there are VAR cameras that can be used. After all, it's a clear red card whether he pretends to be hurt or not?  Because he knows that if he doesn't make a big song and dance about it, there's a chance the referee ignores it completely, moves on with the game and doesn't even consult VAR.   It's a red all day, but players feel the need to emphasise and exaggerate the incident just to make it more likely the ref will look at it and give the right decision. That's the problem
Kane isn’t the problem; the officiating is the problem
I don’t like how dramatic kane made it look. Especially as he plays pretty much exclusively in games with var. he could’ve reacted appropriately and Doucoure would still have been sent off.   But players are coached to do it. Look at how many players go down holding their heads now, as the refs have to stop play if there is a chance of a head injury. It’s another way of disrupting breaks and transitions.   The game is systematically broken at this point. Penalties for simulation won’t change it. And no red or fa is going to start carding players for surrounding a ref. The Mitrovic situation was handled exactly how it should be in an ideal world, yet people still defend it when it’s their team
Harry Kane is the Golden Boy of English Football. Brilliant goal scorer but a genuinely unlikeable crayola eating, diving, cheating, trophyless pleb.
Complete disgrace … that’s why I think there’s debate.  Getting the red or a penalty isn’t worth one’s self-respect or reputation. Kane behaved terribly in the run up, committing three, clear, intentional fouls … gets mushed and then play acts as if Anthony Joshua hit him with a hook.  His family and friends ought to check him, if no one else will.
Can't see big Dan Burn going down like that in similar circumstance. Or Joelinton.  It's embarrassing. I would rather complain to the ref than go down like a sack of spuds.
It's embarrassing to watch. The prem is watched all around the world and they see players like Kane going down like he's been shot in the face when another player only touched him. It wasn't a shove or a punch or even a poke it was a touch on the face and Kane falls to floor and lays there for minutes until Doucoure is sent off.
Just because most players would do the same doesn't make it right. Kane deserved two yellow cards, one for the tackle prior to him being "hit" in the face and one for his over dramatic fall to the ground.
I think Kane dives and embellishes so much anyways that it’s extra polarizing. More on the league/officials to not reward the behavior and like you said they need to give calls when folks don’t go down in a heap to ever see it get any better.

Yeah diving being this prevelent is 100% on the refs. If you don't go down they don't do their job lol.
Where's that kane when he ballooning penalties over crossbars?
The reaction from opposing teams is always hilarious, they act like they wouldn’t do the same especially in a relegation battle.
Because Kane gets away with a lot of shit.  He should have been booked for the push that initiated the skirmish  But he regularly does this thing where he ducks under people when they are in the air, to win a foul. It’s highly dangerous play.  I think a lot of people admit he is a fine player, but pads his stats a bit with lots of fairly soft pens, and bottles it when there is actually pressure on.
It was a disgrace. Doucoure can't argue with his red. Kane should have gone too, a yellow for his part in the tussling and a second yellow for simulation.
Only reason is because the c*nts on this sub get a f**king hard on bashing Spurs
Coz Kane is I cheat
Kane is a bitch , a diver and a cheat . Don't like him , never will .  Role model? Cunt , more like .
This is similar to the nba- Lebron James is a freaking beast, but if he gets slightly touched in a way that will be a foul he fall to the floor in a dramatic way. It’s ridiculous really.
Refs need to start handing out cards for embellishment like candy. Doucoure’s red was fine, but I see no reason why Kane should not have gotten a yellow as well for folding like a cheap suit at the slightest touch while being a grown ass man and professional athlete in peak physical condition. I mean, embellishment.
Kane needs a 3 match ban too for that nonsense
Also Kane dives regularly while backing into players and it’s never called. Probably where a lot of the expectation came from. It’s clear to everyone he’s that type of player.   When your countrymen get in your face about it …
In any context other than the narrow interpretation of football rules, Kane should be punished at least as hard as Doucoure.  In the broad context of violent conduct, Kane initiated contact, he pushed Doucoure, he tugged his shirt, and he got into his face. When Doucoure made minimal contact, Kane rolled on the ground like the little whiny bitch that he is.  In football, any contact to an opponent face is a justification for a red card, but in real life, Doucoure would be justified to send Kane's nose up his brain, and excuse us of the presence of this serial diver.  Overall, for this level of contact and violence, the just call would be a yellow for both, but because it's Kane, and because it's a minor touch to the face, it was called as a red to Doucoure. Technically, it's correct, but it's still injust.  Britain is a nation ruled by interbreeding monarchs. Hence, applying stupid laws to the letter is the mode of operation. In Italy, Doucoure would make a pleading sign with his hands and would be forgiven. In Spain, Doucoure would get a red card because he's Black. It's all about the interpretation.

Exactly
Imagine if you did that in the streets ! Everyone would laugh at you forever , do it on a football pitch your a hero
To me,it seem nowadays Ref love to act 1st before analysing whether the action was correct.  I mean we need to understand why Doucoure acted like that. We don't know if Kane said anything to Doucoure.  Yes what Doucoure did was wrong,but i feel like Kane make a meal out of it.
Doucoure deserved red but Kane at a minimum deserved yellow on the play. Kicked at Gray while he was down and had Doucoure by the shirt. I think that's why there's so much debate. Kane wasn't innocent and then flopped like that. Awful for the game.
Was it a red card? Yes.      Was it soft? yes.     Did Kane make a meal of it? yes.       Could Kane have got multiple yellows to also get a red? yes.       Kane kicked the leg of the downed played, was instigating the incident with Dacoure and he dived like a sack of shit.
People act like it was a conscious decision LMFAO he went down because the dude hit him in the face , it was the right thing to do or else Doucoure might have gotten away with it? Yall want Kane to start slinging haymakers like he’s Tyson Fury or something edit: end of the day tho Spurs bottled it, that’s what Kane should be focused on
I don't know how any man that does that shit on the pitch can have any fucking self-respect acting like such a fucking pussy for the world to see. We've all got eyes, we can see how minor it was... all they're doing is showing the world how much of a weeping vagina they are.
Because most of the internet commenters have never been poked in the eye/face, had their foot stomped on, been tripped whilst running full speed, (or ever played anything) so they go on about how tough the players should act etc.   Is simulation out of control? 100% Yes. Does getting fingers raked across your face hurt? Also yes.
Is this sense.....on Reddit. No wayyyyy. It's correct, you must follow up with the theatrics or the other player or team won't be punished.
Kane's kicks on the lead up were probably a red.
He blatantly dived
Maybe unpopular opinion, but I feel what should happen here would be a red card for Doucoure and a yellow for Kane.  VAR should be able to intervene here without the theatrics (and I feel since VAR has come in, there has been a lot less of this sort of incident).  There does seem to be a bit more of a focus on it than normal, but I guess that’s because it’s the England captain.  Edit: I meant booking for the simulation rather than for the scuffle part.
His acting was superb. No delay between contact and going to ground, he did not roll around like a child suffering, he committed!didn’t look up while his hands covered his face. Brilliant 9/10
Watch the interview where Kane said that he never dives. That's why
Fans from other teams are biased. They wish they had a striker that banged in 20 plus goals every season for years. It's just opposing fan idiocy.
Was a blatant red and doucoure was stupid to do it, Kane went OTT but that’s part of modern game to win decisions
Doucoure didn't even seem to be aiming for Kaned face, he was pushing him but not even looking in his direction, soft move though and wnd up connecting with his face.  Wouldn't of hurt Kane in the slightest, but it was enough for him to know Doucure would be sent of second he went down, that's why he did. Kanes original foul was worse than Doucures push, but contact to the face/head straight red, can't complain really.  People generally annoyed, though, at Kane for how pathetic he acted and the manner he threw himself on the floor like a kid and lay there like he had been shot for a daft amount of time😂
glen hoddle would call this continental behaviour
Lol - docoure 100% gets sent off without kane's histrionics. That's the point. Also Kane instigated the whole thing + it's apparently difficult for the press to see these incidents objectively when Captain mouth breather is involved
ALL PLAYERS ARE CHEATS  end of.
Because it's not just the Kane incident.   Every team does it. The issue is you have a player who is legitimately fouled and doesn't go down and doesn't get the free.   This has led to players feeling contact and going down. Not every challenge is going to make you go to ground but with the pace of the game a player will miss out on a free or penalty.  Now it's gotten to a stage where a player will go down and stay down in the hopes the ref will call it.  What annoys me more is that someone going down for a legitimate injury will not be taken as seriously initially.   Kane was simulating an injury when he wasn't. He was struck yes and decoure was justly given a red. Kane went on to score a penalty so him going down added nothing to the game other than a sour taste in people's mouths.  I do believe retrospective yellows should be given at the end of game weeks. This kind of simulation can be targeted retrospectively and might stop players acting like they do.
There is no debate. It's as red a card as I have ever seen.
It just wasnt a red card imo. Looks to me that he went for a push and it happened to connect with his face. Dont think it was a punch or anything aggressive with intent.
I think it's just awful that players have to do this ridicoulos acting just to get the ref's attention
He would have still been sent off if Kane had stayed on his feet and not reacted embarrassingly. Take Casemiro hands on will Hughes, they hugged each other and laughed after it cooled down but Casemiro was still sent off. Kane let himself down with that reaction imo
kanes mentality encapsulated. who the fuck ever goes down to the ground from a scratch in the face. you literally never will go down from it, ever. The sad pussy who folds under ALL pressure and will never win anything ever, was rolling on the ground like he was on fire. Exact mentality expected from kane
I think he is getting additional criticism because he is the England captain, the basis for the additional criticism seems to be that young players look up to him.   Ultimately, until they take proper steps to stop simulation diving is gonna carry on.
I’m an Everton fan and had no problem with it. Doucoure blew it and is probably embarrassed. I don’t understand fans pointing fingers when every team does it. Don’t like it at all, but part of the game.
You have to make a meal out of it or the refs will just miss it.
Almost every player in every game embellishes when they get fouled because it's in their best interest to sell the foul to the ref. This isn't anything new, and it would have been stupid for Kane to not go down.
I don’t have a problem with it especially since Kane rarely pulls shit like that.  That’s usually Richarlison’s deal.  However Doucoure did put his hand right in Kane’s face and you just don’t do that. Kane going to ground ensures that the ref stops the game and checks to see what happened.  Unfortunately Spurs still couldn’t capitalize on a 10 man Everton team.
If you’re gonna touch an opposition players face, you’re gonna get sent off these days, so might as go full haymaker on em and make it worth it. Especially if it’s Harry kane you’re raising a hand to 🤷‍♂️
Not that many people are outraged about it imo those people are just loud and wrong
The problem clearly lies and how seemingly innocent Kane leaves the situation despite two back-to-back reckless actions.  While the whining and rolling around like a baby back bitch IS embarrassing and a terrible optic for the sport; it’s too common for someone to get too upset about that. I personally hated how Kane’s two “tackles” absolutely enflamed Doucoure there”
I'm an Everton supporter, and as soon as I saw it, I said, "That's a red." You can't hit someone in the face. 100% on Doucoure. No idea why there is any controversy.
Because he's the England captain he's expected to act like a honourable gentleman. That shit has held England back for years. I'm glad we embrace shithousery now .
I remember Andre Arsharvin immediately finger waiving off what looked like a penalty committed on him, letting the ref know it wasn’t. More of that and less if the other I say
Kane is famous for diving and looking for a chance to feign contact and fall over. Why is it surprising he's called out?
Kane gets away with so much dirty shit.  Just watch the compilation of him undercutting people jumping in the air
Neville making excuses for England's captain. Its smart play when an English player does it and diving when a non English player does it.
>Basically ALL players go down like they've been shot at the slightest contact and roll around screaming to gain ref favour.  Stop, I agree with you that a lot do but here is my main issue: I've accepted players like Neymar diving a while ago. If he didn't he'd get his feet broken every other week. At some point he's just too good for a defender not to just foul him. He's not going to handle getting fouled 50 times a game well.  My gray area is whenever you dive for a pen/fk. Again, this is not something I like to see but shit refereeing brought us here. Plenty of players not diving after a contact and losing the ball because of it brought us to today, where diving after a contact is seen as normal. Rules change needs to bring a culture change and it will take a while. For the moment we kind of have to accept these dives.  Now Kane might have done none of those two actions. If he dove because he eye hurt, sure, if he did to get the ref to give a card, then it would be a bit scummy. Which I think is why some people are angry.
Not all players go down like they’ve been shot at the slightest contact, soucek once went off for stitches and came back on with a bandage to continue playing
IMO - yellow card to Kane for first shove, red to Doucoure for the hand to the face, second yellow to Kane for simulation - no way he hit the ground as a result of that hand to the face. It was 100% acting. There ya go - Solomon has spoken - split the baby.
It’s not correct to say all players do this. There are many who do not. Messi for example has been absolutely destroyed throughout his career and is known for staying up and not getting the calls. Plenty of players in the prem like that.   Mo Salah, gets a bad rep because he has a habit of flailing his arms around dramatically when he’s fouled, but he rarely goes down easy. People who say he does do not watch him play and are delusional idiots. He is practically getting violated from behind in every game. It’s such a joke now because center backs know they can destroy him. Whereas with Kane, you see him going down when they slam him from behind (phrasing?)   At any rate- plenty of players don’t do this. You’re coping with the fact that the referees are so bad they aren’t smart enough to call a foul without going to ground, 90% of the time. That’s a really alarming problem in the league, because all players do NOT do what you’re saying so this leads to inconsistent calls across the league.
Kane should've squared up like a man. Nothing wrong with a bit of aggression I don't get why they kick the fire out of players with all these yellows.
It is basic gamesmanship I would expect nothing less from any teammate of mine. If someone smacks you in the face like that with all the cameras we have today - you go to ground. You get the foul. Basic.
The problem isn’t with players going to ground or exaggerating, it’s that they feel they need to to get the decision. They - rightly - don’t have faith in the officials to make decisions unless they’re left with no decision, even with VAR. The fact that people are claiming that Kane got Doucoure sent off suggests fans & pundits don’t have faith in the officials either. I don’t, and I think if Kane stayed on his feet, Doucoure would have stayed on the pitch.  A referee shouldn’t be influenced by whether a player goes to ground or not. Doucoure should have gone regardless, he pushed someone in the face. When players feel like officials can take appropriate action based on the incident itself rather than the outcome of it, there’ll be less need for players to make a meal of things.  Until then, I say fair play to them.
It’s because Kane fouls gray, kicks him a further time o nthe floor (albeit lightly) and then clearly provokes Doucoure by holding onto him.  The situation was manufactured by the England captain to draw a response from either player, but if the roles were reversed a foul is immediately called on Kane as soon as he goes down. It’s almost an abuse of his ‘immunity’ in that sense
It's because you've accepted this is where the games at that you don't see a problem. Many ppl including myself will **never** accept players throwing themselves to the ground and rolling about like they've been shot to get a player sent off. Kane stays on his feet and it's a yellow card at best. Kane should be embarrassed !
Diving is fucking pathetic and should be an instant red card. I've been saying this for years now.
It’s also annoying bc he commits to card-able offenses just prior to getting “face grazed”, and somehow he comes out of the whole sequence the victim.
I think it’s the cynical nature of the dive, before he got pushed in the face he was holding onto Doucoure’s shirt and was pretty aggressive so Doucoure responded in that classic “get off me, let go of my shirt” way that usually starts fights. It so happened that he then pushed Kane with the follow through, but the way Kane goes down it looks like he’s the victim of one-sided assault. I think Carragher said it best when he was saying if he saw his son do that, he wouldn’t protest on the sidelines but when he’s back in the car he would tell him “never do that again”, it’s the cynical way of getting someone sent off for something you helped escalate which has rubbed a lot of people the wrong way.
Is it a red yes, is it totally embarrassing from Kane yes.
Rivaldo would like you to stop now.
One Bruno Fernandez springs to mind.   I hate this in the game but it’s gotten to the point that If you don’t play up to a situation then you risk passing up on a possible advantage .  Personally I’d like to see a retroactive panel ruling on play acting with a possibility of up to a 5 match ban revolving specifically around the amount of Oscar worthy horseshit and the ref bothering thereafter
kane going down is to ensure he gets the ref and VAR’s attention. better safe than sorry with that kind of thing. he’s not the first and he’s not going to be the last to do it
I think Michael Keane's reaction to Mouras cowardly attempt at a leg break was far more in line with what we would all like to see.   No fuss, dusted himself off and smashed it top bins.  I used to have a soft spot for Spurs. My Dad was a Spurs fan. Not anymore. Since the Son on Gomes, since this pathetic and unnecessary bit of play acting and Mouras potential leg breaker I agree with many who think that they are a bunch of bottlers and cowards.   I do hope Arsenal have a very loud party when they win the league.  ( Edit: it must be really hard being a spurs fan. The constant failure at the last or second to last hurdle, never having won the league in colour, getting no where near the one trophy they are associated with for 32 years , then when someone makes a valid point about being a cheating, fouling, diving bunch of cowards and perennial losers all you can do is brigade somebody on Reddit all 20 of have just made me happy and illustrated my point perfectly, no bottle and now your captain's disgraced himself ,he let you all down and  you have no way to defend him.  Michael Keane showed you how to react when you do really get fouled and actually hurt, a man's reaction versus a pathetic playacting child who buckles under pressure. Iron Vs Marshmallow. It makes my heart sing and puts a big smile on my face having wound you all up so successfully, peace and love to you all and thank you)
It’s every English player. An English player couldn’t possibly dive. There had to have been contact. But when it happens to a foreign player, just listen to the commentators.
Also if iirc Porto clearly got fouled
I got downvoted for mentioning this in the match thread .
Same with City vs Liverpool. Grealish goes down easy and it's "you have to be so careful around him, he's just so clever". 5 minutes later Gakpo goes down easy and it's "that's just a dive, what a disgrace".
The irrational hatred for Harry Kane is one of the strangest football fan hivemind takes
But 95% would have 20years ago, 100% 30years ago. It's all theatrics these days and embarrassing to watch
N’golo is someone I can honestly say I would be surprised if he were to not stay on his feet
Because everyone else is allowed to have faults. The English media would have you believe kane is incapable of doing wrong. So now everyone over corrects where Kane is involved
Bruno gets shit on all the time for this.
20 mins later in the same match Moura put in a leg breaker on Michael Keane. His ankle & lower leg buckled under the force. He got up and got on with the game. Moura got the red card. Everyone accepted it. Move on.   Kane looked like a sniper had taken him out. Doucoure was getting sent off deservedly anyway. Kane just looked like a bit of a fanny by grabbing his face. Everyone accepts it. Move on.
Replace kane with any other player in the league and it makes zero difference to me. It's embarrassing for the game
Thank you for speaking sense here.  Var should check everything and when the incident occurs, even if kane just stands there with his hands in the air, Var see it and call over the ref.  There is no need for the pathetic fall
Oh I love it too but I don't think you can book Kane for that too
1000% agree but too many times I’ve seen players try to play on or not embellish an incident like this and the referee doesn’t step in. It’s on referees to change this. As of now, you’d be doing your team a disservice by not giving them the best chance to win.
Is there any other team sport where this is the norm? I can't come up with any.
This ☝️
People want to like him, and then he often does stuff like this.  Dyche was correct.
It’s amazing that Kane hasn’t seriously injured an opponent with his “back into you right after you’ve jumped off the ground to win a header” move that he does time and time again. That move bothers me way, way more than embellishing getting hit in the face.
Just like Bruno Fernandes or maguire for united, or man city when fernandinho was repetitive fouling and just I don't personally like grealish, or (as a Liverpool fan, look at the Salah foul statistics) James Milner's frequent "orange" cards, there is a very clear "different rules for different players" and Kane is the epitome of this problem. The tackle on Andy Robertson -and then people trying to JUSTIFY it - was and is insanity, and is still brushed off. The reason people call it out so much, and remember such examples, is because someone has to. To make sure that we are not being gas lit into thinking we don't understand the game when really it is just favoritism.
You're being dramatic
He got a yellow. The referee got every call right.
Played a man up for more than half the game, you got a penalty, and you still couldn’t win 🤣
Harry Kane is held to such a ridiculous standard lol. Every single player in the world would go down if they had their eye gouged like that and you know it
This.. it can be a red and Kane still being too much. Hate to see it but that’s spurs for you.
Any player should be ashamed of that display. Sadly it’s just how footy is these days . If you don’t fall over after a ‘love tap’ then you risk no getting the other player booked and/or a free kick. I strongly believe that this shit is coached into them
Shut up. Every player who gets struck in the face like that goes down. Question Doucoures behaviour instead.
I think it's wrong to assume if Kane doesn't go down like a diva it's still a red. We've seen worse not given. Footballers act this way because if they don't, referees sometimes don't even look at the contact. Mourinho said something about it once.
>A hand shoved to the face like that will always be a red card.   You'd think that but there are some diabolical refs in this league
A hand shoved into the face isn't always a red card.
Saka didn't do anything embarrassing  Watcho on about
i think the other issue is that people are completely ignoring the two violent fouls kane committed before the shove, the fact that kane was grabbing doucoures shirt and pulling him towards him even after the ball was dead and the fact that he sold it like a child's nativity play.
Exactly it's a red regardless of Kane going down quicker than a sex worker.
Embarrassing yes, best player, not anymore.
also at issue is the fact that immediately prior he shoved an Everton player to the ground then kicked him while he was down.
kicked the Everton player after he shoved him down as well.
I disagree it’s red. Doucore wasn’t going for his face. Kane had hold of his sleeve and it looked like incidental contact to Kane’s face as a result of that. Then Kane goes down like an absolute little bitch to get him sent off. This guy is a role model and this is what he is teaching the youth? He’s a leader on a team that can’t play right together and he’s more interested in stealing an advantage then, I don’t know, showing some fucking leadership? I support Arsenal and I’d be embarrassed if Ødegaard pulled this shit.
How is it PC in any way?
Lol most logical Scouser
Newcastle fan?
Are you ok?
Saka would be the laughing stock then
He got a yellow.
He got a yellow didn't he?
that was such a good take, it’s almost as if we don’t see this happen in every match
Do you say this about saka?
Have a word with yourself. Hope the wind isn’t too painful for you today. x
Thats exactly what happened
Bruh he raked him right in the eye..even mma fighters need to stop fighting after being poked in the eye lmao
Right, but why do I not see this debate every game. It happens every game. You see big burley CBs doing it, goalies doing it, touchline staff doing it. Then Lane does it and all of a sudden everyone is fuming
That was just embarrassing
I don’t understand what your trying tbh
Good take  I agree with the panel statement. I think in hockey they have a rule they can give penalties to the offended if they embellish
Yup be did nothing wrong, ref and VAR had the decision to make Doucoure was the one that messed up
He went down the way he did to focus the attention on Doucoure because by any sensible measure he should have got a yellow for the initial challenge on top of Doucoures red. And it worked.
Cool story, go take a walk outside
You might be a little bit salty
That’s cool man.
Exactly this.
 Ehh idk definitely some players like Grealish and Sterling get accused of diving all the time
Literally this
Saka must be French
A one-club (so far) family man never near controversy seems to get under a lot of people’s skin.
As a Toon fan, what he did to Lejuene was unforgivable.
The man who has montage clips of him doing intentionally nefarious and incredibly dangerous undercuts of players jumping for headers? I mean there’s some justification for the disdain.
His diving/cheating behavior doesn't endear him to people. Ask yourself how could it?
> irrational  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRsuT6egYeE  stuff like this is what drives the disdain for Kane. This behavior is game in, game out
Very embarrassing, but it goes beyond football. Look at the world and men around you.
Your literally just proving his point…
Whilst everyone does it, there are levels to it and some are much worse than others. Bruno deserves to get shit on all the time for it because he’s one of the worst for it
EPL hates it when foreigners dive, but the commentators fly to the defense of any English player who dives
He put his hand in his face. Once you touch the face it's over. Kane also got a yellow, so he didn't get away with anything.
Problem is VAR is unreliable. Just ask Cucurella.
think he got booked for the foul he committed before the incident. there is definitely a *reason* he went down so i don’t think it’s fair to call it a dive. he exaggerates it perhaps, but he was grabbed in the face.
Kane did very well. He grabbed Doucoure's shirt, he didn't shove him in the face for no reason. He was able to rile him up and then you can't blame a player for going down when shoved in the face. That's a red no matter what but you also feel if he stayed on his feet the ref might not give it. Don't hate the player, hate the game.
U seem to be a Tottenham fan though
I take you don’t watch the NBA?
Shearer ,mark Hughes and a whole load of other players made entire careers with those moves
He seems to have stopped doing it as much but I agree. That could break a neck
I’m an arsenal fan, and Gabriel did the same tackle as Kane used to and not a soul mentioned it. I found it funny as my friends are from Tottenham and only one of them spotted the hypocrisy.   Nobody makes a deal out of it unless it’s the England captain, it’s factual. As much as I hate spurs. He’s overly criticised and needs to move to a big club
That same move happens 2-3 times every single game. But it’s only an issue when Kane does? Hell I saw an Everton player do that very thing in game yesterday but not a word about?
Martinelli has a bad habit of doing this. He needs  to get carded for it honestly. It drives me insane
Should be an instant red
Tbf everyone knows how much annoying bruno can be so can't compare him to Kane whereas every pundit seems to kiss his arse
In regards to the James Milner and Fernandinho thing, it really feels like refs will let players with a ton of years under their belts off a easier.
Aren't you the same guys who lost to Everton away?   Idk, I'd consider a point better than no points.
You lost against them 🤣
He should be held to a high standard; he captains his country.
I think there is probably a lot that wouldn’t but it wouldn’t stand out as much
If you think Kane is bad then you should have a look at neymar
We've literally had Romero double yanking Cucurellas hair not get carded by VAR ffs. 3 years ago, we had Martial and Lamela lightly pushing each other in the face, Lamela went down, Martial looked like 'WTF'. Guess which one got a red and which one didn't.  This season, Spurs had a player shoved IN THE FACE by another player and the card was overturned by VAR after the Spurs player didn't go down in a heap ffs.  Players have to go down to exaggerate this or its a crapshoot on whether it gets called or not.
Exactly. Footballers don't go down because they think it's cool, they do it because it's needed to get what they want.  We've seen several times that if a player for example keeps going instead of falling after a tackle in the box, there is no penalty. This needs to change with the refs and VAR, then the diving will stop.
So just to be clear, Kane going down after being struck in the face is soft. But Kane pulling Doucoure's shirt and pulling him towards him are "violent fouls"? Right oh
To further solidify this point the tackle on Keane is eye watering to say the least and he just got up! but still equalled a red card, both cards were right, Kane would of come away with more credibility if nothing else.
Who’s the better English player?
That was my thought as well, that foul was given though
It's a red every day of the week and twice on Sunday.  If that happens at Forest, Bournemouth or Palace rather than a fashionable club that the media loves like Everton, no one even doubts it and hanging's too good for the player.  What Harry Kane does is irrelevant.  I agree it's not meant as a punch but that's what ends up happening. He shoves a player in the face with force which is a flat palm punch. Doucoure is a role model too and he resorts to minor violence with very little provocation.   In a game where we give a random free goal to a team because a ball brushed a defender's arm at 30mph, you can't seriously claim that wasn't a red card unless you are wearing baggy trousers, wig and comedy nose.
Nope :-) Chelsea fan :-)
Ooops missed it in the scuffle!
Can’t feel it through my protective bubble suit thanks x
He's not even looking at him though as he's pushing him, definitely never aimed for his face, but should of known not to start pushing him in the first place. No way that hurt Kane at all😂 can't blame him for going down majority of players would tbf, just the manner of how pathetic he acted got people riled up
Yeah i see your point, they should all be penalised for it. It's ultimately down to the refs that allow this to happen, VAR with it's multiple camera angles apparently sees less than the millions back home.i think Kane gets more abuse because he's doing similar things regulary.
[Probably means this.](https://youtu.be/c17aeF7JxAg)
kane did get a yellow for his challenge lol
I am so hurt.
Grealish “draws fouls”
lol
Harry Edward Kane  Bukayo Ayoyinka Saka
>**never** near controversy  Off the top of my head, he absolutely went through Andy Robertson and never got a red card. That was pretty controversial.
The man has played a lot of minutes. I expect him to have a long montage of pretty much every type of behavior. These are athletes, not angels.
Literally this, as a Liverpool fan I can’t stand that bottler. Everytime we play spurs he tries to snap our players necks when going up for headers.
Literally happened like twice times in 2020
Ummm you mean Kepa clutching his face because he got nudged in the shoulder???
Yep, very true 😔
This is the truth - if VAR could be relied on to make the right call, Kane (or any other player) should behave embarrassed for throwing themselves down like this.  But it can't, so he does.
Just ask Andy Robertson. Who was it that went through his shin with a tackle, again...?
This has been the most fair judgement of the situation imo
“Grabbed in the face” is hilariously accurate.   I saw a comment he was punched in the face - but it wasn’t really a punch, not a slap or even a hit… a grab is the best way
ima spurs fan, and what moura did was a red and what doucoure did was also a red,  appropriate calls dont wear team colors.
Well yeah, but the rules on diving is that there has to be no contact...
I do. Are you saying they have this problem? Not on this level surely. There are some problems with players deliberately going for fouls and arguing with refs but nothing like this.
If you make that move in basketball, you get your ass kicked.
I think they clapped down on that last year purely because of Kane
Saw Martinelli and Gabriel both do it one game and it never got mentioned
No, it's only an issue because of your whataboutism and failure to say "yes, you're right.  Harry Kane is a dirty footballer." Just eff off already with your crap.
And i’d consider 72 pts better than 50. Maybe it’s just me though
And you lost against us 🤣 Twice btw, in case you forgot
Arent you closer to relegation than arsenal?
Oh piss off lol. Wayne Rooney also captained England and the best club team in the country and used to get in pub fights or boxing matches at his house. If the refereeing was better, players wouldn’t have to dive at all but as we’ve seen time and time again they can’t be trusted to get decisions right without a bit of gamesmanship
His responsibility in that moment is to Spurs. Doucoure deserved red and Kane made sure the ref had no choice but to issue one. In theory his actions should have won his team the game but Spurs bottled it and Everton played really well at both 11v10 and 10v10.   I see so many Toffies angry at Kane without a word as to how dumb Doucoure is. He could (should) have cost you the game and as one of your best players could still contribute to costing you results during his ban.
Whataboutism is not a good defence
No, Kane kicking at the prone Everton players legs when the ball is trapped there and then kicking through doucoure before the fracas were violent
Your point is dumb because Ziyech pretty much did this same exact thing to Emerson and actually had a red card rescinded. VAR is a mess and everyone knows it
Players, Foden, Saka, Grealish and Bellingham. Kane is not a great player, he is very good, but already in decline. Or maybe I’m being unfair, of course it’s not an easy call as his club play such terrible football and this must impact on perception.
>The media loves Everton  Where? Which media is that? Never seen that before in my life
Ok. I am fine with your opinion on the call but that last bit was unnecessary.
It dosent matter bruh he raked his eye..thats a straight red lol when was that ever not
If memory serves, then there was a clip of Rivaldo peeking through his fingers to check how the ref was dealing with it all.
Yeh I’m not saying it doesn’t get remembered but it didn’t get all the media bashing this one situation has
Haha, fair enough
You’ve made that quite obvious
Grealish is "clever"
I should specify. More meant off the pitch.  But as far as on the pitch, of course I have my biases however idk that he’s much of a villain in terms of behavior. It wasn’t even until mourinho came around and instructed them to be cunts that I feel he dove and such.
🤡🤡🤡 hes literally done it 'twice times' in a single game before
Whatever you say boss
🤣
Probably the same game I’m thinking about.   English media crucifies the best England players. Kane, Beckham, Rooney, Gazza all in my lifetime. Saka will get the abuse when he doesn’t carry us next World Cup.   This country is messed up with how the media works
Yeah, we’re sooooo close to relegation.  Hopefully we manage avoid it. 🙄
Nothing could be less relevant.  Just because you named another big time English footballer that's got a bit to be desired in the class realm means nothing.  It's a poor excuse.  Do better.
An incident like that can at least be discussed though. Speaking in general terms. I don’t really remember how much kicking Kane did towards Gray. The entire issue is still Kane going down like a crying child for something which obviously didn’t hurt that much, but is still an obvious red card offence.
Violent? Games gone soft. The “kick” on gray he got the ball it wasn’t trapped at all. The “going through” doucoure was a 50/50.
You’re not being unfair you’re being stupid lol. Phil Foden is better than Harry Kane? Jack grealish? Lmao
So you’re unsure if he is?
The very fact that Everton fans can argue that the blatent red for Doucoure was anything other than a blatent red and think it's going to fly just demonstrates the point. You don't notice that bias because you are an Everton fan, you always get it and only notice it's absence when playing a club the media love even more
I'm not trying to be insulting per se so I apologise if it came across that way. But if you put all the red cards dished out across the professional leagues together, this one would be nowhere near the dicey end of that spectrum
😂wouldn't class it as raked, average person just rubs there eye there no bother haha  No ones debating the red, as I said it had to happen, just laughing at Kanes antics
That was David Luiz who did that. This is the one where a ball hit Rivaldo on the knee and he went down clutching his face.
Really?  Basically the issue is he is the England and Spurs  captain rolling around and greeting like he's been lamped by Mike Tyson when in fact spaghetti arms Doucoure has slapped him in a proper limp wristed fashion.   Harry Kane (who I personally have generally positive feelings about) has over reacted and looks pretty silly and like a massive wet blanket. Doucoure was getting sent off (correctly) anyway. This play acting nancery has brought him down in many peoples (myself included) eyes by quite a margin. It was totally unnecessary and not what we want to see from an esteemed and highly regarded person.   Gomes made half the fuss when Son deliberately broke his leg and ruined his career.
Well that was a waste
Grealish is a diver (i.e. a cheat).
>off the pitch  That's probably fair. But I can see why the fact he appears to be a bit untouchable on the pitch and in the media might rile people. It's like when Shearer avoided a ban (for quite literally **kicking an opponent in the head**) because he allegedly threatened to pull out of the 1998 World Cup.
Where did i say you're close to it?
Of course it’s relevant. If the only reason Kane isn’t allowed to make sure the ref gives a ref card is because he’s the England captain I can sure as hell reference a former England captain who was actually a piece of shit person
There was nothing violent about what Kane did. This sub is a joke, it looks like most of the guys here have never played football, to argue that Kane's action prior to going down were violent is ridiculous.
100% I feel both players should of seen a card. Kane's colour being debatable but not doucoures
Wait so you think doucoure on Kane had more of a chance to do serious damage to him than kan on doucoure?  Shades of SAF "he could have died!!"
He’s obviously using ‘violent’  to say intent to hurt mildly like how technically flicking someone is violent, he’s not accusing anyone of gbh
I’m glad your amused. You’re not letting tribal loyalty impact your judgment are you?
I’m glad your amused.
I’ve thought he has been in decline for a while but this might be him being limited by his current circumstances. If he was playing in a better side, including a better Spurs side, I might have a different opinion. I don’t think Conte helped his overall game.
Also, it wasn't even a light shove to the face. If you look at what happens, it's more like a grab/claw to his face.  It's definitely a red, not even remotely debatable.
Liverpool fan…lmao no wonder
No way he gets sent off of Kane doesn't react. Its stupid but thats what happens
I’m not saying he isn’t sad for it but I think him going down when someone is behind him is worse as doucore puts his hole hand on the face of Kane eyes are very sensitive regardless if it actually hurt him it’s an easy decision
Why you talking about relegation you tool.
I never said it was. I said incidents like the kicking, stepping over or whatever he did, is something you at least can discuss, compared to a hand to the face which is always a red.
It was reckless though, so the yellow was totally justified. Anyone calling for a red for that is a moron.
They did though? Kane received a yellow after the incident.
There’s a difference between potentially doing damage to someone when you’re trying to win the ball and deliberately trying to inflict damage when play isn’t even going on.
It’s not about damage. It’s about winning the ball. Surely you know that’s what 50/50 means.
Eh?
That’s the real problem here. It should have been a red either way, but Kane (rightly) doesn’t have the confidence in the officials to make that decision if they’re left to it.  Once officials prove they can make the big calls without being pushed into them, then we’ll start seeing the faith in them rehabilitated, eventually to the point where players don’t need to do that.
Come on dude, it's not what anyone wants to see.   Raise your hands on a Premier League pitch in someone's face and you are off. It just wasn't necessary for Kane to do what he did. He looks like a tit.  I think Seamus Coleman actually told him so.   Michael Keane was a shining example of how to react to someone attempting to break your leg, TOP BINS!
But which offense caused the yellow because there was potential for a double yellow for him.
I agree he looks stupid but it’s not like he cheated either so shame him but to bring up the incident all the time also feels a bit silly
Ok mate, peace and love to you and yours. We move on.
That approach only works when you have the money to make quick personal changes to suit the new managers when they come
The premier league model ✅ gets worse each season … dumb but hey?!  Somethings broken with scouting, academy & recruitment … been alot of poor players bought who never cut it   Positives are the stadium & training facilities … need to fix the rest urgently
I cannot put into words the immense disappointment I felt upon seeing the missed opportunity of using “contenuity”. I think I’ll see myself out…
They may have hundreds of problems but taking points from city isn't.
Dressing room overhaul. Infact, i would sell Harry Kaene as well......i think its the over stayed playing with bad influence over new recruits! Similar to Auba, Ozil, lacazette francas at arsenal
They should have kept Mourinho.
Tbf the last 22 years have been their most successful. 1 league cup trophy and a couple top 4 finishes is about right
This isn’t true, Harry Redknapp signed a contract renewal.   http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/t/tottenham_hotspur/8817116.stm
Levy gets a lot of plaudits for running the club well financially, but it tends to fall flat on its face when the footballing side is run so badly.
This is why that Carragher/Neville argument made no sense about the manager is the one that is supposed to change the culture, not the owners. No manager has even had one complete season since Poch.
Long May it continue!
Oh no, they absolutely have the money. Not on the level of us, City, or other clubs, but enough to actually make significant signings (and the club obviously has a revenue stream). Levy has just always been a stingey cunt. I actually somewhat feel sorry for Spurs fans in that regard.  With him and Lewis in control, they're never gonna be successful on the pitch.
Exactly
Eddie Howe is third and his first 11 feature players who were at the club before him and are not glamorous names
And when your winning
When everything’s broken it’s whoever’s in charge.
Brighton, Arteta might be bringing back the importance of scouting to everyone's notice.
That's sadly Spurs "Pochition" Now
Best comment of the day
How Pep gets scammed by Spurs is the biggest mystery. But I love to watch it
I'm ok with this as well. Especially since his contract is up after next season. Sell him on and use the money to rebuild the squad.   The only issue that I see is he won't move to a team outside of the PL, so we'd have to sell him to a rival.  He's made it pretty clear he wants to be the PL all-time goal scorer.
Lol
Does the Audi cup mean nothing to you?
Are you on crack. Football existed before 1992. Terrible L take.
It's not just money. Significant players would rather sign for their top 4 rivals as soon as they learn the history of the Tottenham.
I mean… Burn wasn’t at the club before him and Burn is definitely a first 11 player.
It's not what happens when the going is good, it's what happens when it's not.
Exactly that … look at Everton, Man Utd to name obvious clubs who need change
Didn’t the Brighton scout jump ship to Chelsea? Such arse the big clubs stealing & ruining   Arteta & Edu are doing a great job … not being held ransom Mudryk & Caicedo etc young players out on loan doing well … Balogun & Tavares
It's not even just Pep. They were our bogey side even before he was manager.
Its all down to players mentality and ofcos the direction of the club if those two issues are not properly aligned, then no coach will fix spurs! You cant tell what the directors want, its an awkward situation
Nah just thought it’d be funny 😂
Does my head in.  I’m sick to death of people saying this nonsense. Constantly giving enic a pass spouting this. Before Alan sugar and Daniel Levy we were one of the most successful clubs in English football.  Weirdly, through the last 30 years of only winning a couple of trophies we’re still right up there in terms of success. Which I think says more about the other clubs in football.
You mean the league cup in 2008 is not enticing enough?
Are you saying Dan Burn, a 6'3" baby deer of a bastard centre back full back is glamorous?
Like post world cup when we had a terrible dip? He kept work trate up and morale up, made a few changes and started again to win games.   This weekend is the best we'd played all season imo
glazers out
>Didn’t the Brighton scout jump ship to Chelsea  Now that's genuinely sad
Nah. You’re seen as a banter club. Only reason why you’ve finished anywhere near top 4 is because you’ve had one of the worlds best strikers
>we were one of the most successful clubs in English football.  By that you mean Spurs were a distant 4th behind Liverpool, Man United and Arsenal.   The other funny thing is that before Daniel Levy Spurs (one of the most successful clubs in English Football ) were tied for trophies with Aston Villa on 25. But that's only if you include the Charity Shield. If you don't then Aston villa was substantially more successful than you.
Your club's a joke tbf.  And I'm enjoying watching you lot being put firmly back in your boxes. Nice change of pace compared to all the shite that ye were collectively spouting since what, 2017?
If it wasn't for lying Arabs and Russians and their fake ad companies and illegally invested billions spent we d have won a lot more trophies. Solely on that alone we would have nvm baldies lack of investment.
Actually we won it in 1999 too. Surely that’s enough
Bring back whoever was talking about the Sussex championship last week
I think he’s fucking glamorous. I miss him🥲
That dip wasn't terrible though. And you guys were still in a good place position wise.  But I believe Eddie Howe has done enough so far to justify every vote of confidence he's getting. He's done a marvellous job.
Your mum is a banter club.
You are so dim.
🤣 suck my plums 🤣  And keep cheering on your rapist midfielder.
what was you doing in the 80s and 90s then before russians and arabs? , Leicester weren’t backed by russians or arabs yet have a more successful 21st century than you guys , never forget you finished 3rd in a 2 horse race . it’s the history of tottenham 😭😭
Whilst Manchester City are being charged for potentially illegal actions, Roman actually done nothing wrong.  But even if we were to remove Chelsea and City from any league table, starting in 03 when Abramovic bought Chelsea:  03/04: Sp*rs jump from 14th to 13th, Title doesn’t change hands  04/05: Sp*rs jump from 9th to 8th (still behind City as they hadn’t been bought yet), Title goes to Arsenal  05/06: Sp*rs jump from 5th to 4th, Title goes to Manchester United  06/07: Sp*rs jump from 5th to 4th, Title doesn’t change hands  07/08: Sp*rs jump from 11th to 10th, (Sp*rs once again behind City who have now just been bought) Title doesn’t change hands  08/09: Sp*rs jump from 8th to 7th, Title doesn’t change hands  09/10: Sp*rs jump from 4th to 3rd, Title goes to Manchester United  10/11: Sp*rs jump from 5th to 3rd, Title doesn’t change hands   11/12: Sp*rs jump from 4th to 3rd, Title goes to Manchester United  12/13: Sp*rs jump from 5th to 3rd, Title doesn’t change hands  13/14: Sp*rs jump from 6th to 4th, Title goes to Liverpool   14/15: Sp*rs jump from 5th to 3rd, Title goes to Arsenal  15/16: Sp*rs position doesn’t change, Title doesn’t change  16/17: Sp*rs jump from 2nd to 1st, Title goes to Sp*rs  17/18: Sp*rs jump from 3rd to 2nd, Title goes to Manchester United   18/19: Sp*rs jump from 4th to 2nd, Title goes to Liverpool  19/20: Sp*rs jump from 6th to 4th, Title doesn’t change  20/21: Sp*rs jump from 7th to 5th, Title goes to Manchester United  21/22: Sp*rs jump from 4th to 2nd, Title goes to Liverpool   So Sp*rs would have one more league title, and even then I don’t think Chelsea’s success was in anyway illegal, so it’s a reach at best to say you should have it.   In the cups, you’ve only been knocked out by City or Chelsea 6 times, 3 in the FA cup, and 3 in the league cup, and out of those 6, they went on to win it 3 times, but again most of those victors were Chelsea where the validity of claims their actions were illegal is a stretch. So being generous you would have another league title, another 2 FA cups, and another league cup. Whilst being realistic you’d have 1 league cup in that time.  Whilst Arsenal would have another 2 league titles, Manchester United would have another 5 league titles and Liverpool would have another 3 league titles.  But again that all based on the assumption Chelsea have done something illegal, which there is currently no indication of. Even being as generous as possible you’d have had another 4 trophies in that time, not a number I’d consider a lot more, but as a Sp*rs fan you may view it differently, having not won the league for 32 years and counting, and your last trophy being a league cup 25 years and counting
Sure, that’s football now though.  And we are the 10th richest club in the world. On par with the likes of arsenal, Milan, Juve.  But we have a chairman acting like and pretending we’re poor while increasing the value of his investment a million times over. With a great business strategy and piss poor football one coz he doesn’t give a shit about anything other than finishing in the top 4.
Ahh, forgot it was the Easter holidays. The kids are out of school.
What a clever comeback!
a) Find a comment of mine where I defend Partey; (you won't), b) Bissuoma.  c) Enjoy Europa next year because you're still shit🤭🤣
“3rd in a 2 horse race” is the shittest take of all.  We were never top that season, not once.  You know who was though? Top at Christmas and all that? Yes that’s right, arsenal. Like to keep that quiet don’t they.
Unrelated to whatever you said but if you're writing a long ass serious comment but behaving like a 10yo by saying sp*rs instead of spurs might as well stop. Its funny done once in a while but what you did there is dig a grave for the joke and piss on it
Ahh I didn't know the clubs around us spent 1.4bn on a new stadium in last 5 years or built a cat 5 top tier training facility as well as spending massively in last 3 years in windows. Must be my imagination. Levy backed Conte 100% and conte didn't deliver. That's not on levy
Says the child “bantering”
So dim….
a) can’t find one of you condemning him or the club for their continued support of your hero rapist.  b) bissuoma has no accusations of rape against him, how weak of you.  C) your home has been europa for years, and your club is a European joke. Even we have more European trophies than your pathetic showing.  d) suck my plums 🤣
the last day of the season you needed a draw or a win against a relegated newcastle to secure 2nd, you lost 5-1 . 3rd in a two horse race references how you literally had 2nd place secured but still found a way to bottle it, the history of tottenham proved its self once more and no we don’t keep it quiet however who’s top of the league now and achieved far more in the 21st century than Spurs has in the last 30 years? Arsenal,
It’s honestly muscle memory at this point, but if you won’t read it because I said Sp*rs, that’s much more immature
Oh Jesus Christ, not another one.  You deserve it. And under them this will continue so enjoy.
Lol, so much better when you remove two words and add three periods. Lol
[This](https://p7.hiclipart.com/preview/900/971/621/internet-meme-rage-comic-pol-antifa-meme.jpg) is how I imagine you look rn because you keep deflecting from the main point with this shit🤣.   We've been bang average for like 8 years now, thank you for pointing the obvious out- but remind me, what have you lot done in that same period?   Aside from winning the prestigious "finishing above Arsenal cup", of course, and building that stadium that you lot seem to have a massive fetish for.. because I seem to recall a number of finals bottled and a number of serial winners who left the club without (shocker here) winning anything.   You talk about European titles that you more than likely weren't even alive for and are going back into what the 80s?, whatever keeps you relevant I guess.  I know it's a hard pill to swallow, but if a "serial winner" like Conte calls out the culture of Spurs and if world class players like Kane and Son aren't enough to win even an FA cup then at some point you kinda have to come to terms with the fact that you lot being included in the "big 6" is extremely laughable and insulting to the other teams in that category hahaha.  Kane won't keep playing forever, and if he has any sense he will dip sooner rather than later from that absolute dumpster fire that is your team and you lot can slip back into midtable obscurity like you belong🤣🤣.  PS: You can keep saying "suck my plums" like a child, but they've clearly not dropped yet.
That’s nonsense. We finished on 70 points, arsenal on 71 and Leicester on 81. The season was finished long before the last game of the season you moron.  Get your shit takes and yourself back in your box ya melt.
Nah I read it and my key takeaway is that we now have a title in the last decade while all arsenal have is a potential title, suck on that bitches!  Edit: Just realized arsenal got one too
Lol
Ain’t reading that waffle mate   Suck my plums gooner melt.
someone’s crying aren’t they, and it’s not nonsense like i said it’s on the final match day you bottled it no need to insult bro it says more about you than me, sensitive? i see why you are so angry though considering your club is a laughing stock to the rest of the big 6
You ignoring the 14/15 title we would have won?
Arsenal has 3 fa cup and community shield in the last decade.all you have in this period is a audi cup.you don't get to talk about trophies.
TLDR; Spurs are shit, I'd bet money on you lot not winning anything of note in your lifetime beyond the League Cup and when Kane leaves you lot will be midtable again.   Condensed it for you, ya gimp.
I’m correcting your moronic take, which is wrong.  You can tell yourself you’re not wrong but you are, the season was over long before the last game. Leicester finished 11 points ahead.  We were never top that season, you were. And it’s arsenal supporters that perpetuate that “3rd in a 2 horse race” lie to hide this fact.
🤣🤣 this is too good
Thanks my good sir for letting me know how many trophies arsenal has, couldn't have done it without you. Also thanks again for letting me know what I get to talk about, real classy and thoughtful of you
