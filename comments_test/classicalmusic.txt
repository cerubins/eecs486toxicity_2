Eh I have noticed things on the harpsichord that’s not on the piano that’s for sure  And no, the two are not superior to one another
[The entire work, in a recording by the Dmitri Ensemble](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et8B79uR2Pk).    [Unusually for a choral work, it finishes with a 6 minute long instrumental as the strings slowly die away.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5KAyzsxSJw&t=488s)
Bach Cello suite #1 first movement
"That cello song" a.k.a. Bach cello suite no. 1 in G major, BWV 1007, I. Prelude.  ITS A PIECE NOT A SONG. CALL IT SO.
Thank you so much been trying to remember for two days
*Pretty please. In classical music we exclusively act like pretentious snobs.*  /s - In the vernacular, song works perfectly fine. Maybe consider extending grace and tact towards someone who has for all we know never learned a particular naming convention of a musical genre that has a reputation of being snobbish and hard to get into.
Yeah for real, and in music school all of our teachers are always trying to get us instrumentalists to “sing” through our instruments and think about what a vocalist might do for a particular phrase. So I actually love calling pieces like this songs.
I tend to listen to my favorites over and over again, so it’s been a long while (probably months) since a piece truly blew me away during the first listen. Looking back, it’s probably Ennio Morricone’s Nuovo Cinema Paradiso. The piano interpretations are rather popular, but the orchestral arrangement is incomparable in my opinion
First movement of Mahler's 9th.
My first exposure to Arvo Part was his piece [Spiegel im Spiegel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJ6Mzvh3XCc&pp=ygUSc3BpZWdlbCBpbSBzcGllZ2Vs) that played at the series finale of The Good Place, and exploring his work has been really good.
Howard Hanson. His symphony cycle is most pleasant.
Schumann's *Piano Quintet*. I knew I was gonna love it just from those fantastic opening phrases and love it I did.
Ibert's flute concerto pretty much grabbed me by the balls and did not let go until it was over. What an absolutely unexpected slice of joy and wonder from such an unlikely time as the bleak interwar period.
Florence Price, symphony no. 1.
Maslanka wind quintet n.3
Quite a few years ago I had the same experience with Khachaturian. I can't remember whether I heard Spartacus or the Violin Concerto first, but I liked the composer right away.
Respighi. Pines of Rome and Fountains of Rome are such vivid landscapes, very immersive. And the 6 pieces for piano are just charming. Immediately they give you the sense of idyllic Tuscan countryside life, in very diverse ways.
Mahler 9, Mahler 7  The ninth: Although at the first attempt i could listen to only the first movement, but that was enough for me to already love it.  The seventh: well, requires no explanation. Nachtmusik II is simply too beautiful.  Mendelssohn violin concerto: i had heard that opening melody many times before and loved the whole concerto on the first listen.
Ralph Vaughan Williams, five variants of dives and lazarus
Jesus dude I have so many…  Rachmaninov Piano Concerto no. 2 mvmt. 1; Rach Prélude in G minor; Handel Keyboard suite no4 in D minor; Prokofiev romeo and juliet dance of the knights; Dvorak serenade for strings mvmt 2; Sibelius Violin concerto in D minor  I’m definitely more of a minor key guy. Have played some of these in school orchestra and have always felt so lucky to be able to make such beautiful music. Also apparently when Rachmaninov was alive he played a concert at my school which is insane
My latest interest is Edward Top, his String Quartet 1 and 2 are ridiculously fun
It’s either Price piano concerto in 1 movement or Prokofiev 5
For me, it was Poulenc’s Concert Champêtre! That piece quickly led me to his Organ Concerto, Piano Concerto and Concerto for Two Pianos, all of which became fast favourites!  Before that, it was Prokofiev’s Sinfonia Concertante - absolutely amazing piece as well!
Christopher Tin (specifically The Lost Birds)—that piece has been played frequently the last few weeks.
Toru Takemitsu
Paul Dukas sonata 1st movement  https://youtu.be/tqHn1IVmvU4
One of my favorites is definitely Cypresses by Dvorak.
Bach Busoni Chaccone in D Minor
SOMEONE ELSE LIKES KHACHATURIAN VIOLIN CONCERTO LETS GOOO
Im Abendrot by Richard Strauss. I'm very familiar with his orchestral works but that song came on the radio while I was driving and I had to pull over.
Scriabin Sonata No.2. Mmmmm..
Shostakovich piano concerto no. 2
*Khachaturian's Symphony #3.*  But also *John Adams's Chairman Dances* blew my mind the first (second, third, ..., N-th) time I listened to it.
Dvořák. Serenade for Strings in E Major, Op. 22  performed by Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra and Milan Horvat
Prokofiev Rome and Juliet. Specifically Dance of the Knights, Death of Tybalt, and Romeo at Juliet’s Geave
Somebody on a comment recommended the [Matchavariani](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9dgK2b-xOIU) violin concerto and it’s one I’ve never heard before. Absolutely blew me away.
Sibelius Symphony No.1 2nd Movement
Fazil Say violin sonata. It was like a thunderbolt
Around the Clock Suite: Ten past Two, composed by Pearl Chertok. This is a harp piece, it sounds like you are shopping, and looking at glittering window displays! The other pieces in the suite are also magnificent
FLORENT SCHMITT!!!  Everyone needs to listen to Psalm 47.
Louise Farrenc symphony 3. Heard it performed a few months ago and haven't stopped replaying it since. Was very surprised not to have heard of her before.
I enjoyed Arash Safaian's Lara
Gotta go with Rautavaara here. I heard Cantus Arcticus and was just transfixed. He's got a palette and style unlike anyone I have ever heard. He mixes late Romanticism with modern techniques like tone clusters. I find atonality leaves me cold simply because I can't discern any reason why any note is used in place of any other, but with Rautavaara no matter how dissonant it gets you always have the feeling every note is placed and played exactly where it should be.
Every single work in Mozart’s catalogue
Vaughan Williams' symphony no. 2 (aka a London symphony). The opening movement is just so much fun!  Holst's Beni Mora. I was immediately captivated when it started and then blown away by the last movement.  It's so cool to hear the same motif throughout the entire last movement!
Jolivet Ondes Martenot Concerto. Just what? Jolivet makes me question so much and has rapidly ascended in my favorite composers. That concerto is such a trip.  Also Berg's Violin Concerto. Just a masterpiece.
Poulenc's [Nocturne No. 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITjoWz7Unuo)
Delius. I know some people view him as light pablum, but his harmonic style really is a one of a kind thing. The instrumental arrangement of La Calinda is a favorite of mine: [https://youtu.be/FP0DPB4IQow](https://youtu.be/FP0DPB4IQow)
The flower duet from Lakme
Prokofiev. Specifically the second movement of the Sinfonia Concertante. Blew me away as a cellist, listened to a lot more of his other works, and now he’s my favorite composer! <3
The most recent composer I really, really fell in love with at first listen was Jonathan Harvey. Through his [string trio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEJQTINEplI) in particular. But the more pieces of his that I listened to, the more my appreciation deepened. Every piece is a treasure trove of fascinating textures and colors and techniques, all while being coherent and compelling pieces of music.
"What music cannot music raise and quell" in Handel's Ode for St. Cecilia's Day. It's a song for a soprano, but also cello plays an important role. Very beautiful and peaceful. By chance I've met this song some months ago, and was fascinated by it, and for some days I've listened almost only to this song.
Sorabji, everything he did
RVW’s 5th Symphony
*And Birds Are Still . . ., Op. 72*, Takashi Yoshimatsu  It's soft, moving, and feels like it's telling me a story.
Shostakovich, Cello Concerto No 1.  They played the first movement only but l knew immediately that l like both the sound of the cello and Shosty’s music
I had never listened to any Bruckner piece until a few years ago when I went to a live performance of the 4th symphony. The finale of the 4th movement blew me away.
Iancu Dumitriescu. I think the piece was Sound Source or Hyperspectres. Some pieces make you remember why you love music.
I listen to BYUs classical FM channel a lot, and they played EJ Moerans - In the Mountain Country and it got me. I'm hooked. I've since listened to more of Moerans stuff and it's good.
Gorecki's Symphony of Sorrowful Songs.
John Luther Adams. I remember listening to the opening section of In the White Silence: impossibly vast (yet not loud) pandiatonic chords played by strings: no ornamentation, no vibrato, frozen in time until they suddenly stop, take a breath and then move onto the next chord. Each one might last 30 seconds or more. I couldn't breathe the first time I encountered it. Then the harp comes in and the whole thing starts moving slowly, but with determination, with interweaving patterns that don't ever seem to repeat as before.  Some other pieces that really stuck out to me were Become Ocean, dark waves, and Among Red Mountains.
Penderecki "Three pieces in a baroque style"  Aria.
A couple of days ago I was listening to the radio while getting ready for work. Had to stop everything and check what the piece playing was:  Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach - Concerto for flute & Orchestra, Wq22 in D minor (specifically the [3rd movement](https://youtu.be/9uWzjlSUaYg), Allegro di molto, but the whole concerto is recommended).
The first piece I heard by Rachmaninoff gripped me immediately. It was moments musicaux op 16 IV presto. One month later I bought my first piano. Absolutely adore Rachmaninoff's style.
Great Movie! Great Score!  Always makes me teary-eyed and emotional, and I'm a guy who tends to repress his emotions.
Last movement of Mahler's 9th was definitely one for me, but my most recent was Florence Price's 1st.
Ibert’s works are underrated! I especially like his chamber pieces
I'm partial to Jolivet and Liebermann for flute concertos, but I really do think Ibert's is the best concerto our repetoire has to offer.
i played price’s suite of dances my senior year as principal 2nd violin. amazing composer
Thank you. Great suggestion.
Her second is better IMO (not that the first is bad by any means).
Omg yes. The first time I heard this is burned into my memory like a religious experience.
Just got the privilege of playing it in state orchestra. Absolutely unreal.
Also any of Dvoraks tone poems, playing the Noon Witch was amazing and listening to the Water Goblin is magical
The last movement of Mahler 9 is the movement I still have trouble with. But I had liked the second movement of Mahler 9 the first time I heard it.
I like the Price too! I listened to it last year for the first time and enjoyed it very much.
Ugh I wish, I’m playing Tchaikovskys Romeo and Juliet Fantasy Overture and while it’s not the tame I love it
I think I heard the last 5 minutes or so before I heard the rest of it. I saw a video where someone mentioned it as a good example of symphonies that slowly and quietly, instead of with a sudden forceful full-orchestra chord. So I listened to the end, and then listened to the whole thing. I heard Price 1 for the first time a few weeks ago, and only the last movement, because it was on the radio. It reminded me of the last movement of Dvořák 9. I went and found a recording of the whole piece, and I really like it.
The last movement of the 9th can really emotionally exhaust the listener. That slow fade almost feels like Mahler knew this would be the last symphony he completed. I find it to be filled with pathos. Beautiful.
Here is the finale of Dvorak's American Suite.   https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-dQWGopS5hI  Compare to the finale of Price's First.
I really need about 20 minutes to just sit in total silence after listening to the whole symphony. Emotionally exhausting is right! It's a phenomenal symphony.
I agree! Silence is fitting, maybe the only response for a time after listening to such a work.
It makes me want to hear the rest of them
I remember the first time I heard this piece.  It was on a playlist in the background during work.  The high C cut through everything, broke my concentration.  Had to stop what I was doing and start it over.  Probably listened to it 3 or 4 times in a row.
With the Golden Age... I dunno, did they recommend you the full, actual thing (recorded by Gennady Rozhdestvensky), or the Yuri Grigorovich arrangement for the Bolshoi? They're quite different things in literally almost everything.  Anyway, I do like the adagio from The Limpid Stream (that greatly resembles Tchaikovsky's own adagi for his ballets) and the music for the comic Pas de Deux with a crossdressing "willis", and find the Bolshoi staging for that show quite fun, but the whole of it is... along with The Golden Age (the real deal), just kind of unremarkable. It felt like very disjointed, often rambunctious music with no apparent structure that Shostakovich was not really into, something you can't say about the most popular late XIXth and early XXth century ballets. Think of his Suite for Variety Orchestra, but stretched over two hours.
The [intro to Ballet Suite 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAvtLIlNibk) (Limpid Stream?) is my absolute favorite thing ever by Shostakovich
Appreciate it!
Where's Wolfie?
Who painted it and when?

Here are some of my favorites that I think everyone should hear at least once! (Sorry for the YouTube links, most of these are pretty easily searchable on Apple Music).  Vivaldi’s La Straganza: https://youtu.be/QP73569coeo  Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto 1: https://youtu.be/vtf63I5O9QQ  Glazunov’s Seasons: https://youtu.be/KLFX1ZWKemk  Chopin’s Tristesse: https://youtu.be/82okhQiaPs0  The Butterfly Lovers Violin Concerto: https://youtu.be/DK3jRo6aTbQ   Elgar’s Violin Sonata: https://youtu.be/TjeG-WRJC8w  Ravel’s Sonatine: https://youtu.be/Rd9-fRyCYf8  Faure’s Sicilienne: https://youtu.be/U5Y0uQLgriA
Try r/classicalresources
I just posted this in another thread as ad. I think it applies to you, too...  I'm not going to respond with "pieces that sound similar to what you already like." I'm going to approach it from your Michael Jackson example.  In pop(ular) music, we tend to see similar styles from an individual.  I.E., a slow Jimmy Buffet song and a fast Jimmy Buffet song still sound like Jimmy Buffet. It's done by genre (country, pop, rock, metal) and also by ERA. That's actually more important,  IMO. An 80s country song has more in common with an 80s rock song than it does with a 30s country song.  Classical is similar. If you like Beethoven Symphony #5, you'll probably like #3 as well. But you'll ALSO find contemporaries of Beethoven that you like. And some you don't. This gets more important the closer to modern times you get - music changed MUCH more between 1900-1950 than it did between 1700-1750.  What I'm saying is, search both ways. Look for composers who were writing when your favorites were. And look for similar pieces (symphonies, tone poems, etc) that you like, but by other composers from the same, and from  different time periods. You'll find things you like and things you don't. Lather, rinse, repeat with the ones you like. Soon you'll have thousands of favorite pieces!
Apple also released Story of Classical, available on the app. It’s a kind of Podcast/survey that’s just a wonderful historical overview.
I highly recommend “the story of Classical”, it's like a music history class I have at school but in a podcast, very cool!
I love Schubert's Impromptus! He wrote two sets, op. 90 and op. 142, but I personally like the op. 90 set more. You can also check out his "Unfinished" Symphony No. 8.   I also quite enjoy Mendelssohn's (which may be recognizable to you) and Bruch's violin concertos as well.
Rachmaninoff Piano Concertos (2-3) and symphonies (2-3), Tchaikovsky symphonies (4-6) and Romeo and Juliet Overture, Sibelius Symphony No.7 and Violin Concerto, Ravel Tzigane, Daphnis et Chloe suite No.2 and Gaspard de la Nuit, Debussy La Mer and Prelude to the afternoon of a faun and Piano Preludes, all Mahler symphonies (although they are very long, they are really worth it, maybe try listening in this order: 1,4,2,5,6,3,8,7,9 and 10 is unfinished), Chopin Piano Sonata No.3, Mendelssohn Elijah (very long and also religious), Dvorak cello concerto. I would continue but the list is already very long. Enjoy!
You might find a good classical music station that streams and just listen to that when you’re in the car or something.  That’s going to give you a little Whitman’s Sampler of different eras, types of pieces, and composers, and you’ll start learning what appeals and whether there are patterns.    They’ll also talk about the piece, the composer, and the performers, so you can learn as you go.    One is WETA in DC.
& a few more to add to what others said, some favs that come to mind;  * Corbetta - [Caprice de Chaconne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcciSWLUrf4)  * Purcell - [Music for the Funeral of Queen Mary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EruGzQnG2w)  * Telemann - [Violin Concerto in A, "The Frogs"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1Zsk55I2Ww)  * Gluck - [Dance of the Blessed Spirits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTZgMQ7TVes) from Orfeo ed Euridice  * Gossec - [Marche lugubre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_td2lvd9KXc)  * Weber - [Overture to Der Freischutz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9iaX9wWni4)  * Alkan - [Barcarolle in g minor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eav9lsYgsTk)  * Franck - Le Chasseur Maudit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r827MCIXNyE)  * Liszt - [Legend no.1 of St. Francis Preaching to the Birds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vROXOwpB5x8)  * Chabrier - [España](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_aCpAcK4l8)  * Sibelius - [The Oceanides](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7dlfuoJa48)  * de Falla - [Cuatros piezas españolas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivwu1Q-YnMo)  * Roslavets - [In the Hours of the New Moon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5IWId9sLdE)  * Milhaud - [Scaramouche](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3GZvRlblho)
The way I got into classical was by starting with solo instrumental works and then working up to larger pieces.  J.S. Bach has lovely solo works for cello and piano. Start there and see if it brings your further in.
There’s a radio station in UK called classic fm (it’s available online) and once a year it has a poll of listeners top pieces of music. The resulting top 300 pieces are played over the Easter weekend.        It started today, will continue tomorrow, Sunday and Monday with the number 1 at 9pm BST on Monday.      Some great popular music involved  Edit:- ps the programmes called Hall of Fame
>I’m a Classical Music noob  Same. I like to find pieces that I really enjoy, preferably with melodies I can "sing along" to in my head. The Chopin Etude 3 already mentioned is a great example. Also Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 27. Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 5.  It also helps to narrow down the multitude of options. For example, I like the piano, it's crisp and makes a lot of sense to my ear. I listen to less strings and symphonies because it's more abstract (?)  The truth is some pieces are quite complicated (for example Liszt and Rachmaninoff as many are mentioning) and it can be overwhelming to listen to it all. It's good to give it all a try. But just like with most passions, you can keep it alive by following what you like rather than what's considered important.  I'm like you, trying to deepen and further my appreciation. So I'll listen to my favorites with different conductors and pianists and hear how they interpret the piece differently. After a while, I found that it opens me up to liking a lot of other stuff, like some Liszt and Rachmaninoff.
Shostakovich's 9th symphony is really good and not as difficult to get into as some of his other work
Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto 1, I know personally three people who got into classical music from that, such a beautiful piece. Also check out other works by Tchaikovsky, he has a lot of great and accessible pieces. (Symphony 1-4-5-6, Capriccio italien, Romeo and Juliette fantasy overture, violin concerto)  Beethoven symphony 3-6-9, in my most subjective opinion, those are the best three to start with.  Dvorak 9, and then 8, absolutely incredible music.  Berlioz's "Symphonie fantastique", if you like program music (music which tells stories), but even without the program it is still great.  Schubert, "Death and Maiden", "the Trout", symphony 8-9.  Mussorgsky, "Pictures at an exhibition" (Ravel's orchestration), another program music, each mouvement represents a painting.  Sibelius violin concerto and his symphony number 7.  And so much more... Those are only the pieces that I think, will most likely get someone interested. There's a lot to be explored in classical music, and this whole genre has a  ton of variety. I have no doubt that you will find what you love in there. The only thing you need to appreciate classical music is patience (which a lot of people don't have today, unfortunately), you may not find it beautiful at the first minutes, but once you actually sit down, and are willing to listen, it just has so much to offer. That's why I think it is more than okay to start with pieces that some might consider "overplayed". These pieces are played a lot for a reason. They are arguably more "accessible". Sometime, it is also about picking the right mouvements, for example, Dvorak 9, second and third mouvements, or Tchaikovsky 5, second mouvement. Sometime those Youtube clips or videos like "the best melodies, the best endings, best moments" can also push you to listen to the whole piece.  When I first heard Mahler, Bruckner, R.Strauss, Shostakovich, Prokofiev, Stravinsky, Bartok, even Debussy and Brahms, I didn't enjoy them that much, but later when I had more patience and listened to more classical music, I found out how amazing they are. I get annoyed every time people say to me "Oh, I can't understand classical music, they are too complicated, too long, too old" and bla bla bla, they might as well say "I never really gave classical music a chance but I still think it is the problem of the music."  A lot of pop listeners tend to focus a lot on the melody (the singer). It actually limits your listening experience a lot. For classical music, it is even more important to stop the tunnel vision. An example, Beethoven 9, last mouvement, when the choir comes in, at first I just got amazed by the big sound, but now when I listen to it I found what the strings and brass doing so satisfying.
In case you don't want to sound like a newb, please call classical compositions pieces.
If Easter speaks to you, listen to Pergolesi's Stabat Mater (always performed in Latin, google for a translation), composed in 1736 and Dvorak's Stabat Mater (composed in 1876-1877).  This would give you an idea of whether you like those composers and their contemporaries.
Two come to mind, Haydn's 'Surprise' Symphony no. 94 and Beethoven's Piano Trio, op. 97, Archduke.
Just come to comment on the good taste of clothe Chinese piece.   In my opinion one of the only two good chinese classic music pieces worth listening (me as a native Chinese)
Tchaikovsky’s 1st Piano Concerto is my favorite from that list
Thank you.  Also why was I downvoted. Lol
Schubert's Impromptus are wonderful! Excellent door into the world of classical music.
no Liszt?
I second the Weber, Der Freischutz. I love Weber in general. Gorgeous early Romanticism.
I'm not sure. I think it's awesome that you have discovered classical music!  One possible reason is that classical music is a huge art form, so there are really infinite answers to your question. It's a bit like asking "I just discovered I like books! Which one should I read next?" The right answer is very subjective.

Seeing the well tempered clavier at 288 hurts my soul
You don’t have to clap for that long if you don’t want to! The artists will continue to return to the stage as long as people are continuing to clap. Generally you’ll get a lot of clapping if it’s a popular soloist, since people will want an encore.
My trick for big orchestra tutti sections (just in case you didn’t know - tutti is “all” in Italian, it means everyone plays) is to try and follow one melody or to find the interlocking lines from previous. Especially if you’re listening to music written before the “modern” era (the Russians are the exception, their composers stayed romantic longer than the rest of the world) the tutti will usually be a meaningful mix of all the motifs used to build up to it.   There’s some good analysis videos on YouTube that break classical pieces down, if you don’t mind “spoilers” of discovering them yourself, you can watch people talk about them and have a bit more guidance as you watch the show!
That's a nice program. I already heard the concerto live but would love to hear the symphony, it's one of my favourites.   It's interesting though, my experience is on the contrary that the sound is clearer through good headphones and good recordings than live. Live is like trying to listen to someone speaking across the room, while a recording is putting a mic directly next to their lips. But of course the recording needs to be good in the first place.   Same with the volume of sound. At all of the concerts I went to, in the first few seconds I'm always shocked of how quiet it is, even if it's a late romantic 120+ musicians orchestra.   It's true that some instruments are sometimes forgotten by the sound engineer though, there has been times where I heard things live than I didn't before.
❤️ First of many I hope. It's a world away from listening to a recording at home
That's very cool as a first orchestral experience! I've heard the symphony live, but not the concerto yet. Live sound is just so much better than hearing music in headphones!
Which orchestra/pianist?
I see, I thought it's a formality or an unwritten rule!
Are there any YouTube channels you’d recommend?
Interesting! Would it require a deep knowledge of music theory to be able understand all this?
Yep, I've noticed a lot of people in this sub saying that recording sounds clearer than live, which was why I was surprised by how rich the sound is at the hall. Maybe it's because I'm listening to the pieces via cheap earphones and YouTube recordings.  I feel the sound of the double bass is much clearer live. And also the sound of performers plucking their string instruments.

The audience claps to show they enjoyed, the performers bow as a way to thank to audience. It comes from when musicians were servants for the royalty and bowed to their lords.

I think from the list you gave you tend to prefer pieces in minor keys, often with flowing melodies or catchy with a strong rhythm.  I would recommend:  Verdi - Dies Irae from Requiem  Mozart - Piano sonata no. 8  Beethoven - Piano sonatas no. 8, 14, 17 (3rd mov), and 23  Beethoven - Symphonies no. 5 and 9  Tchaikovsky - Symphony no. 3  Rachmaninoff - Prelude in c# minor and g minor  Rachmaninoff - Piano concertos  Dvorak - Symphony no. 9 (especially 4th mov)  Bruch - Violin concerto no. 1  Sibelius - Violin concerto  Tchaikovsky - Piano concerto no. 1  &#x200B;  I would also recommend Shostakovich, although his works are more dissonant and contemprorary. Same with Stravinsky. For Stravinsky listen to Rite of Spring, and Firebird, and for Shostakovich try Symphony no. 5 or String Quartet no. 8.
You know, I really just want to sympathize with you for a moment here. In the past, many of the pieces you name were the kind that were in popular LP collections. Nowadays many of the selections you can find, particularly on this sub, assume people want to hear either more complex or more modern pieces, or both. That was not traditionally the case with people starting with classical music, and I think the older approach still has a lot of merit.  I don't have a lot of suggestions for you, but have you tried Grieg's "Peer Gynt Suites" (it's in several movements, which is what a track that is part of a larger piece is called in classical music) or Dvorak's "Slavonic Dances" (also a set)?
Your list shows you already like a broad range of music from the last three centuries, pieces with a strong melody, with a leaning towards minor keys. You might also like Beethoven’s symphonies, piano concertos and sonatas, and Chopin’s Nocturnes, but you seem to be doing fine already.
The joke about Vivaldi is that he wrote the same concerto 500 times, so I'd suggest looking at pretty much any other Violin Concerto he wrote is going to sound similar.  One thing I'll say is you have parts of larger pieces here, like Scheherazade, so it seems like the other movements would also be a good place to start. The same is true of the ballets, while there can be different pieces within them they do still follow a broader structure and you'll find the same themes throughout. While you have some more of Swan Lake in there, this is also the case in Romeo and Juliet and Sylvia.
Best thing is to learn about the history and the forms in classical music.  I recommend this course online--its free  : https://www.openculture.com/2017/08/how-to-listen-to-music-a-free-course-from-yale-university.html
You’d love Caucasian sketches. Istanbul has an insanely awesome recording.   Tchaikovsky 4-6 symphonies (Detroit made a great live recording)  Beethoven 6-7 symphonies  Dvorak cello concerto (St Louis and Starker)  Bavarian Radio performing all 4 Brahms symphonies   If you’ve not heard the greatest recording of the century for Scheherazade it’s crazy how they could get those dynamics onto, let along off a record onto cd.   Grieg’s piano concerto (off an album The Best of Grieg)  Paul Dukas fanfare  Stravinsky Firebird, Petrushka  Holst the planets (Montreal symphony)
If you like joe hishaishi, explore ryuichi sakamoto also:)
I'm not going to respond with "pieces that sound similar to what you already like." I'm going to approach it from your Michael Jackson example.  In pop(ular) music, we tend to see similar styles from an individual.  I.E., a slow Jimmy Buffet song and a fast Jimmy Buffet song still sound like Jimmy Buffet. It's done by genre (country, pop, rock, metal) and also by ERA. That's actually more important,  IMO. An 80s country song has more in common with an 80s rock song than it does with a 30s country song.  Classical is similar. If you like Beethoven Symphony #5, you'll probably like #3 as well. But you'll ALSO find contemporaries of Beethoven that you like. And some you don't. This gets more important the closer to modern times you get - music changed MUCH more between 1900-1950 than it did between 1700-1750.  What I'm saying is, search both ways. Look for composers who were writing when your favorites were. And look for similar pieces (symphonies, tone poems, etc) that you like, but by other composers from the same, and from  different time periods. You'll find things you like and things you don't. Lather, rinse, repeat with the ones you like. Soon you'll have thousands of favorite pieces!
Sounds very much like my tastes when I first started getting into classical!  Here are a few I haven't seen in the comments that I'd recommend:  * Liszt - Totentanz * Liszt - Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 * Liszt - La Campanella * Bach - Chaconne in D minor (and the Bach-Busoni piano transcription) *  Alkan - Le Grande Sonate, 2nd mvt (Quasi-Faust) * Brahms - Ballade in D minor * Brahms - Intermezzo in E-flat Minor * Rachmaninoff - Isle of the Dead * Scriabin - Etude in D-sharp minor
Thank you a lot! I will listen to the songs :) Also thanks for explaining what type I might like
Really great list. I was going to try to make one, then I saw this which has so many of the things I would put. I also like a lot of works in minor so a lot of these are what got me into orchestral music (I'm a pianist).
Seattle has an awesome live Dvorak 9
I don’t normally correct people on their use of the word “song,” but since you asked to be corrected, I’ll tell you. In the classical world, “song” is a term that is applied only to a piece that is sung. In rare cases, you might have a piece that is called “song without words” or something, but that is the exception, not the rule. In general, when referring to classical music, its normal to use “piece” or “work.” Otherwise, just call it what it is (i.e. concerto, symphony, sonata, etc...)
who are you and how do you know Clark Nichols haha  they a boss tho
Edward Gregson - Tuba Concerto
What service are you using to listen to it?  With Spotify, for example, you can go to Settings and turn on Allow Gapless Playback, so there's no gap between sections, movements, etc. I use Spotify, so it's never a problem for me.  A quick Google search tells me that Apple Music *doesn't* allow gapless playback, though.
I agree, doesn't need to be in a bunch of little cut up chunks. Since there are more-or-less sections to it, I wouldn't mind if it was divided into 3 or 4 parts accordingly, but I have yet to find recordings like that. There are recordings of it in one track, though, you just have to look into each album to see what you can finf
Thank for answering. I listen usually on Spotify on my wifi speakers. gapless playback is not an option then. Is there a way to do it?
There are recordings in more than 20 tracks! And, just like you said, I favoured the recording in one track, which is quite rare in Spotify, over choosing the record by orchestra or pianist
Spotify needs to fix that.  Lots of non-classical music needs this.  Usually Pink Floyd fans have the clout to make services address this issue.  There are dozens of recordings of the Paganini Rhapsody out there.  Some of them have that as a single track.  It’s not ideal, but in the meantime you could listen to one of those.
>I listen usually on Spotify on my wifi speakers. gapless playback is not an option then.  It definitely is. What you use to listen shouldn't affect it.  Have you gone into Settings (on Spotify itself)?  This is the mobile version, but desktop is pretty much the same:  Gapless https://imgur.com/a/vSUwDXG
>Spotify needs to fix that  It is fixed. Has been for years.  It's in Spotify settings:   https://imgur.com/a/vSUwDXG  >Usually Pink Floyd fans have the clout to make services address this issue  I listen to Pink Floyd, and Gapless Playback works fine. Albums like The Wall run straight through as intended.
I just checked.  Pink Floyd’s Dark Side of the Moon is fine.  The medleys on the second half of Abbey Road are fine.  Spotify does have the technology to address this.  I checked the Rhapsody.  Fleisher/Szell has it split into individual tracks and it sounds fine.  Maybe the specific recording you had was uploaded incorrectly?  Edit — I just tried Kleiber’s Beethoven 5 and the transition between iii and iv was seamless.  Must have been an issue with the specific upload.
This is the settings interface I have when I listen on the phone (iPhone). But when I listen on the speakers the button for gapless turns grey and is not pushable.
I will try to upload the app again. Thanks :)
It happens with many recordings. But, as I just said, since other people don’t have this problem, i will try again after re uploading Spotify
>when I listen on the speakers the button for gapless turns grey and is not pushable.  That is strange indeed.
The screen interface of the playback settings shows a clear statement when I listen on speakers “these options are not available when listening on another device “. These options are the playback, explicit content, privacy, and audio quality buttons. I thought everybody has that
Strange.  I can listen on desktop, phone, app, tablet, and am able to listen "gaplessly".  I'll try and find out for you what's going on.
Does this post help?  https://community.spotify.com/t5/Android/Settings-are-greyed-out/td-p/1578341
I am afraid not. The same thing happens whether I play Spotify directly from the speakers app or through Spotify app. I can’t think now of a third way
Damn, that is unusual.   I hope you find a solution!
Obliged for your support :)

Unsuk Chin!
Michael Torke - start with one of his oldest albums, Color Music.  Then listen to his newer clarinet concerto, "East"
Here are some composers that I really like, and a piece for each. If you find something you like, try some of their other pieces. Jennifer Higdon (Violin Concerto, Blue Cathedral), Steve Reich (Music for Pieces of Wood), John Adams (Harmonium, Nixon in China, Short Ride in a Fast Machine), Georgi Ligeti (Musica Ricercata, Sonatina for Piano 4-Hands), Henri Dutilleux (Cello Concerto), James MacMillan (Miserere, Symohonies), Magnus Lindberg (Piano Concertos, Serenades), Toru Takemitsu (Rain Tree Sketches), Micheal Torke (Colour Music) and some more obvious (20th Century) ones: Stravinsky, Britten, Shostakovich, Arnold, Bernstein, Penderecki.  Hope you find this useful! :)
John Rutter  Ola Gjeilo    Arvo Pärt   Joep Franssens   Steve Reich  Arturo Márquez
Caroline Shaw!!!!!
I’ll give you my favorites. Your mileage may vary…  -	Charles Ives -	Igor Stravinsky -	Henri Dutilleux -	Gunther Schuller -	Steve Reich -	Esa-Pekka Salonen -	Joseph Schwantner -	Michael Torke
Couple more:   * Andrew Norman ([Music in Circles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNg8eKWbnr4)) * Gabriella Smith ([Imaginary Pancake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpCgIdRSENE)) * Nico Muhly ([Etude 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWL7ig-2Sv8), performed by Nadia Sirota, who is an amazing violinist and tireless promoter of new music) * Edgar Meyer ([Goat Rodeo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7EcT5YzKhQ))  You should also check out the Planetarium album from Sufjan Stevens/Nico Muhly/Bryce Dessner/James McAlister. It's something of a gateway drug for contemporary composition. ([Live NPR performance of Mercury](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YG8wLT8SFiw).)
Two on my MP3 right now are Xiaogang Ye and Onute Narbutaite. Both still active and very listenable.
> I can't seem to find any decent ones.  What do you mean by "decent"? That might help us narrow down whom you are likely to like.
Thanks so much!
I’m happy to see Jessie Montgomery on your list. I’ve played a bunch of her (orchestral) stuff over the last couple years and I’ve always thoroughly enjoyed it.
Rautavaara passed away :(
Living composers, so contemporary classical music. Stuff from our time and age.
>Arnold  Glad to see someone mention Arnold. His name doesn't come up so often here.  He's probably usually dismissed because of the large number of "light music" works and film scores that he wrote, but the symphonies are very underrated and, in my opinion, form the best part of his output.  The Fifth is probably the finest (and such a great climax at 30:13):  https://youtu.be/21ci-mSDAtY  Relatedly, I found out a few days ago that the wife of a very good friend of mine has a walking buddy (they literally go for walks together) who is the niece of Arnold.
U R a Moron
No worries. I've tried to put a range of stuff there. Some you'll like, some you won't. Just find the stuff that sounds intriguing and dig further!
I know. As did Kanceli.  I included both as they both made significant contributions (I should have included the Kanceli symphonies, actually - I prefer them to the Rautavaara), and have only been dead the past few years.  Kanceli - Symphony No. 5: https://youtu.be/nHcYj6wYVxM
Yes but any particular recording probably isn’t
You can find some recordings that you might be allowed to used here. I don’t know the legal details, so make sure you do. Some are mentioned as being public domain, some are under a Creative Commons license. Those may be used in non commercial ways.  https://imslp.org/wiki/Preludes,_Op.28_(Chopin,_Frédéric)
What do you mean? I can use a recording of it?
You can play it yourself - the piece itself is not in copyright because it’s so old. But if you use someone else’s recording you need their permission.
I see, thank you!
>I see, thank you!  You're welcome!
An astute reader might come to the conclusion that the leaders do not in fact explain the new direction.   > We have Judith Yanchus in my first violin section; she is a retired Metropolitan Opera Orchestra violinist,” said conductor Raffaele Ponti. “My principal bass is Larry Glazener, former principal bass in the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra. My principal percussionist is the former principal percussionist with the Boston Pops  It IS funny and fitting that this Florida orchestra is made up of retirees from the Northeast!
Management didn't explain anything. This will not end well for them. Anytime an orchestra management attempts some boneheaded move like this it always fails because the management in question is a bunch of morons.
Wow, I thought I had bad timing. Poor timing for sure!   I’m an outsider to this convo, but they are throwing darts because the economic model is unsustainable.   They need new ways to generate sales. All those talented musicians have ideas, wisdom and passion. Seems like they need to “take it to the streets” and get the community engaged, literally and digitally.   Just an opinion from a amateur musician and life long business person.
 --------  **Episode 1/5, Visionary**  > Hildegard’s life is changed for ever after she reveals a long-held secret. With Donald Macleod.    > As Christians around the world prepare for Easter, Donald Macleod explores the life and music of two nuns who were also composers. Though Hildegard of Bingen and Isabella Leonarda lived five centuries apart, their stories and music are connected by their shared faith and their shared vocations. Both lived cloistered lives, shut away in convents and cut off from the everyday concerns of the societies in which they lived. Yet, they also enjoyed a profoundly rich and human connection with the world and with their God, revealed in the music and poetry they created and sent into the world.    > Today, Donald Macleod focuses on Hildegard of Bingen’s story with Hildegard’s biographer, Fiona Maddocks. They examine how her seemingly unremarkable existence, within a provincial German monastery, was rapidly transformed after she confessed to receiving visions from God.    > Hildegard: Spiritus Sanctus Vivificans   > Anna Sandström, soprano   > Armonico Consort, directed by Christopher Monks    > Leonarda: Sonata, Op 16 No 8   > Ensemble Giardino Di Delizie, directed by Ewa Anna Augustynowicz    > Hildegard: Columba Aspexit   > Grace Davidson, soprano    > Hildegard (ed Wishart): O frondens virga    > Emily Burn, voice   > Clemmie Franks, voice   > Emily Levy, voice   > Victoria Couper, voice   > Jocelyn West, voice   > Vivien Ellis, voice    > Stevie Wishart, director    > Hildegard: O frondens virga (instrumental)   > Augsburg Early Music Ensemble    > Leonarda: In Sanguine Gloria, Op 6 No 12   > Guilhem Worms, bass-baritone   > Ensemble Il Caravaggio, directed by Camille Delaforge                   > Hildegard: O quam mirabilis   > Hildegard: O virga ac diadema   > Margriet Tindemans, fiddle   > Sequentia, directed by Barbara Thornton   https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001kh9n  (Stream in your browser or listen in the BBC Sounds mobile app.)  -----------  **Episode 2/5, The Muse of Novara**  > Today, Donald Macleod shifts his focus to Isabella Leonarda, with singer and Leonarda champion, Candace Smith.

If you are new and don't know what to listen to, start listening chronologically. Start in any period that you love: baroque, classical, romantic,etc and simply go composer by composer.  PS: currently I'm at Mendelssohn and am grateful to everyone who recommended to go with Mendy instead of Paganini.
The new classical music app for the iPhone is fantastic. There are some great options for learning and listening
Absolutely. I heard a version with Stravinsky conducting when I was a kid and thought I'd never heard anything so exciting.
Abbado’s Chicago recording is my reference recording.
Also pairs nicely with Rimsky-Korsakov's Symphony No. 2.
Truth
I’ve been listening to Markevich conducting this recently. Also like Svetlanov.
I find myself listening to the 2nd more than his others. It's 1GB of pure Russian ear candy.  Russian National Orchestra conducted by Mikhail Pletnev. That album also includes the original, 1872 version of the 1st movement that's 5 minutes longer. I understand why the later version is more popular.
Yes - my favourite is Neeme Jarvi on BIS.
Not to switch subjects, but Bruckner’s Symphony #4 is no slouch, either. I listened to it in the garage this morning while lifting weights.*  But I’m a gonna dive into that #2. Thanks for the tip.   *Oh I know…creepy.
No it’s not
Is it on YouTube or Spotify??
Same here . I'm always using as reference recording
It is perfect. Even the cover with his sweater :)
I’m not familiar. I will have to look it up. Thank you!
[Here’s one from 1953 with the LA Phil](https://youtu.be/tw6wxHvYoRI)
Hadn't had a listen in awhile so put it on a few minutes ago.  Hope  you enjoy and yw of course!
Thank you so much!!
Plenty will argue neither and give you candidates like the Concertgebouw, Chicago Sym, so on and so forth. I just put them to the top tier of orchestras, along with some other orchestras.
Berlin is best and Vienna is second
They're both great. At a certain point (and this goes with soloists as well) the music js just simply good nothing more to it. At this level personal taste/interpretation matters. I listen to a lot of recordings and I don't care about the orchestra, just if I like it.
Depends on what rep they are playing I think. Obviously Wiener Phil does Viennese music, waltzes etc significantly better. Berlin Phil has a richer sound for romantic german composers. I think it probably comes down to personal taste in the end when comparing these top orchestras. My personal favourite is the Amsterdam concertgebouw. I think their unified ensemble playing and phrasing is next level. Also very consistent across all composers
I lean towards Vienna. Solti used them on many of his Wagner and Strauss recordings and the sound was rich and overwhelming.
I think the Berliner Philharmoniker is the best of the two - but for me it comes down to the conductor. Karajan was an absolute BEAST when he was with Berliner, and he commanded a powerful sound that sometimes even Rattle can’t ask of (imho). Granted there have been many notable conductors with the Wiener Philharmoniker, I.e., Gilbert Kaplan, Williams, etc.
It’s hard as these two orchestras are so different to each other despite being geographically fairly close to each other. While I do lean towards the Vienna Phil, my late colleague, Leon Fleisher, once played with the Berlin Phil (under Sir Simon Rattle, I believe) and told of a story of how his jaw dropped upon hearing the power in the sound of the BPO.
BPO certainly has the more substantial body of recordings.
The Boston Symphony Orchestra under the leadership of the taskmaster, Serge Koussevitsky. He was the best, and under him, they were the world's finest.
NY Philharmonic
I definitely do not believe in any one orchestra being the best in the world, there are so many variables to consider.  Vienna and Berlin both have had a shitty record up until two decades ago of excluding many great musicians of a particular gender so that's a consideration when considering the best, because you're not including what might be some of the best musicians in the world.  Conductors certainly all have varied tempos they use when conducting a piece with a specific orchestra so there's that to consider, along with how well they mesh with a conductor and yea, that's just the tip of the iceberg.  Just like there is no one pianist or violinist whom I considered to be the best in the world because they all have their warhorses they play best but then might not play other pieces quite to my taste, same deal with orchestras.  When it comes to definitive recordings for orchestral works, I have quite a varied lot of orchestras.
Berliner, London
With Herbert von Karajan that was the right order. But is it still today?
My favourite is Frankfurt Radio Symphony.  I always see myself going back to their top-notch performances. They seem to have really high quality recording equipment which is something I love about them.  For those unaware of this orchestra you should check them out! (Although I'm sure a lot of people know about them)
Important to remember that Karajan would double parts on recordings (at least sometimes). Tchaikovsky symphonies with 8 horns, for example. Easy to have a powerful sound that way
With all due respect, I think the NY Phil has declined quite a bit.   I also don't think the best USA orchestra can hold a candle to the best European orchestra. The difference aint that huge but European Orchestra take a lot more risk but still end up making less mistakes than their NA counterpart
in terms of raw technique, I'd wager that Berlin Phil has an slight edge because they take in more internationals.   But Vienna Phil will beat Berlin Phil hands down when it comes to opera. Berlin Phil only play opera once a year or so, whereas every musician in Vienna Phil is an opera player in the state opera.
Love that they put their live recordings up on YouTube
Try tone poems.
In addition to what has been mentioned so far, you can also check out things like opera overtures (typically purely instrumental and often including themes from throughout the whole opera, giving some variety) or orchestral suites taken from longer ballets or opera.  For example:   Overture to Candide   Any of Wagner's overtures (if you can tolerate him)   Firebird suite   Daphnis & Chloe suites
Tone poems/symphonic poems are definitely good suggestions.  Along with the ones by Strauss already suggested, I quite enjoy his Macbeth, and he wrote loads more. I like Elgar, so will suggest his Cockaigne; Falstaff; In the South. Others that spring to mind are Dukas’ The Sorcerer’s Apprentice; Saint-Saëns’ Danse Macabre; Mussorgsky’s Night on a Bare Mountain; and Bax’s Tintagel.   If you google tone/symphonic poems though I’m sure you’ll find lists and you can go from there. They’re probably your best bet in terms of a whole genre of 20-minute-ish standalone orchestral works.
Rhapsody in Blue, Firebird Suite, 1812 Overture, Pictures at an Exhibition, Rachmaninov Symphonic Dances, Sorcerer's Apprentice, and Tombeau de Couperin (def spelled that wrong) are some good names.  Honestly, look on a lot of pop classical playlists. Those tend to have shorter pieces, or movements from pieces that work in isolation.
Also try overtures of operas? They're typically one movement long. [The overture to Verdi's La Forza del Destino](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lBI2wu4OIc) tells a story, is dramatic, and is about ten minutes long.
Sibelius 7.   One of the greatest symphonies ever written, in just one movement, and clocking in at just over 20 minutes.  https://youtu.be/Bi9QiDrJJmw  In it, Sibelius says more in under thirty minutes than some composers do in more than one hour.  For shorter pieces than that which are not symphonies, maybe stuff like overtures.  Here are 29 to start you off:  https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoM4LAiKzCdWzoq7h5pyAfdmPum3bEFDD
frank wrote a single symphony and it’s phenomenal - i mean - really good. its about 30 minutes long and its great.
Academic Festival Overture by Brahms is a good one.
Dvorak wrote five tone poems late in his career. The Noon Witch, The Water Goblin, The Golden Spinning Wheel, and The Wild Dove are all masterpieces based on creepy Czech stories. There's another one in the group called A Hero's Song which isn't as well known.
I think that, given the period you mentioned (early 19th century), you should also give a listen to a concert overtures. These are not attached to operas but have the same feel and form. Mendelssohn was AMAZING at this. His overtures were really fantastic (Midsummer Night’s Dream, Hebredes, etc.). Beethoven also dabbled in this. He rewrote the overture to his one opera several times, and also wrote the Coriolan Overture. I like the Mendelssohn better, but if you dig Beethoven, give these a listen.   Also, branch out into large ensemble chamber music! Mozart, Brahms, and Dvorak all wrote incredible serenades for larger ensembles (but smaller than an orchestra!) of primarily woodwind instruments. I love me some wind serenades.   Enjoy, and happy listening!
If you’re asking for symphonies, Sibelius’ symphonies are usually pretty short and easy to listen to.  Dance suites or shorter orchestral works are always good. A good place to start is Ravel’s Daphnis et Chloe Suite No. 2and Debussy’s La Mer. Both are great gateways to explore Impressionistic music.  Hindemith has some great brass writing. Check out Mathis der Maler and Symphonic Metamorphosis.
Sibelius tone poems: *Pohjola's Daughter*, *The Oceanides*, *Finlandia*, etc. There's a complete BIS album with a lot of Vänskä recordings that's definitely worth having in your library.  Stravinsky: *Rite of Spring*
Lili Boulanger's Du fond de L'abime
Romeo and Juliet-Tchaikovsky
Sibelius symphonies tend to be quite short. Or you can just listen to selected movements. IMO, the first two movements of Mahler 5 is like a mini-symphony and is already half an hour of music
check out the symphonic poems by Richard Strauss:  Don Juan  Till Eulenspiegel’s Merry Pranks  Death and Transfiguration
Pines Of Rome, pick any movement
Consider the symphonies and other orchestral pieces of Martinů. Most of his symphonies aren't longer than 40 minutes, some less than 30.   His style however is more neo-classical generally, than romantic. His 6th may be his most romantic-sounding.   Rautavaara is another modern composer whose symphonies or concertos generally aren't that long. I really love his 7th symphony.   Though Rautavaara was a composer of the late 20th and early 21st centuries, he mostly wrote in a style that sounds like late Romanticism or early modernism. Often sounds like Mahler, Stravinky, Bruckner or even Sibelius.
Check out Felix Mendelssohn 's Overture to "The Hebrides" (Fingal's Cave).
Rhapsodies might offer something.
Rachmaninoff - The Rock
Each movement from elgars enigma variations could be a complete work in and of themselves and they’re short
Patience
Totally agree!  Tchaikovsky, Saint-saens, d’Indy, Karlowicz, R. Strauss, and Liszt all wrote some good ones!
Tristan und Isolde's overture (or "prelude") is quite beautiful!
> (if you can tolerate him)  You have to separate the artist from the art. He was a reprobate of the lowest order but he sculpted some fantastic sounds, as unique a language as any composer in their time.
This.  Also try Schumann’s Genoveva and Manfred. Weber’s Der Freischutz and Euryanthe.
Tragic Overture, too.
I really recommend that Hebrides Overture. It’s an excellent piece. I seem to remember liking Midsummer Night’s Dream as well.
Great stuff. Heldenleben, & Alpine Symphony too!
the prelude was an acquired taste for me but the liebestod was something else when i first heard it
Indeed, it is tonally complex - I had to sit down with the sheet music to see the unusual chord progressions
Cool piece but oof this recording.
This always seems like it'd be so much fun to perform.
I forgot just how much I love this movement!  Thanks for sharing!
The Dies Irae gets all the fame, but every minute of Verdi's Requiem is immaculate. The Tuba Mirum, the Salve Me, the Lacrimosa, just unbelievably good. Hands down my favorite piece of music ever
Majestic
Aahhh so relaxing....can't wait to sleep to it *and literally get taken down to hell in sleep*.
Outstanding! I always liked it when we did a full orchestra, not just horns and drums but the choir also!
Idk why I prefer la Donna e mobile
Probably even more so with a cimbasso in the house.
I’ve never been to a concert, even at the highest level, where a horn player hasn’t flubbed at least one note. It’s just a part of the business, and the reason these players are great is because they don’t let it affect them. They accept it and move on, attempting each subsequent note with the same confidence. I wouldn’t even call this a mistake or a mess-up, it’s just an aspect of orchestral playing.  If you’re talking like serious counting issues then yeah that’s a lot more rare at the professional level, but it certainly is known to happen. There’s a video of Michael Tilson Thomas on YouTube conducting Mahler Symphony No. 7 and the trumpet player misses his solo entrance twice. Personally I’ve seen a few counting errors in real life, but nothing egregious enough to make my jaw drop or anything. Again, this stuff can happen sometimes
Mistakes happen in every concert. Usually not huge mistakes, and in most cases they aren't noticeable to anyone except maybe the musicians sitting right next to them. But if you go to enough concerts you will definitely hear some cracked notes, missed entrances, messy transitions, etc. You won't hear them on most recordings because they fix them, either during the recording session or after.
[A hilarious example when organist hits transpose function at the cadence during Handel’s Messiah.](https://youtu.be/1DBAoWr-imY)
Heard plenty of examples of piano soloists messing up a note. Usually it's minor though, and not too noticeable.
It’s much more rare to have a flawless performance. Mistakes happen, although things like intonation discrepancies or sections (eg woodwinds and brass) being slightly out of sync from each other are much more common than just a missed note in a major melodic line
The sloppiest string section I've ever heard was the day after Thanksgiving. Most of the regulars must have taken vacation time yielding a group with tons of subs. Still worth it just to get out of the house and avoid the extended family though.
Yes mate, happens literally every concert if you go live. Can be edited in studio recordings. At the end of the day it’s rarely very noticeable and not at all what it’s about. Would rather see a convincing performance that takes some risks and makes some errors than a stock standard performance every day of the week.
Yes. Check out [this](https://petersplanets.wordpress.com/) blog surveying recordings of Holst's Planets. A careful listener can find mistakes in professional recordings.
Professional musician here. I have definitely missed notes in concerts. Admittedly, I am not a professional at the highest level (I have subbed with local symphonies and don’t have a steady position with a major symphony or anything) but even the best of the best make mistakes. It’s the DEGREE of the mistakes that vary. As you go from student to amateur to local symphony to top 5 symphony, the number of mistakes does go down, but I feel like the severity of the mistakes goes down by an even sharper margin.
There was a famous pianist whose name escapes me right now…maybe Anton Rubinstein, who said that you could write an entire symphony using only the wrong notes he played in concert
If you look up Evgeni Kissin's sweaty live version of La Campanella he must make like 10 mistakes. But if you don't know the piece intimately you might not notice. Either way you won't care because of the spirit and tempo anyway.
There's a famous incident where Bohm was conducting Beethoven's 7th, and the horn flubbed the (admittedly quite difficult) entrance toward the end of the first movement, causing Bohm to utterly deflate in disappointment.
Nobody bats 1000
A conductor I used to work with was performing a new commission and accidentally skipped a page while conducting. He stopped the ensemble in the middle of the 3rd movement, turned around to address the audience, and announced that they would start the movement over because the composer deserved it. They were recording it for the composer, so that also meant they could edit together a clean recording.  I was stage manager at the time and I legit thought someone had fallen off the stage and panicked, haha. But I thought that it was a really courageous thing to do and not every conductor would have made the same choice.
Yes, it happens, more often than anyone would like.
Idk about professional, but when I played in my University Wind Ensemble, our conductor would record our performances and we could purchase a copy for about the cost of the cassette tape.    One season, we played Mars from Holst’s the Planets At the very end, where it’s the entire group blasting out notes in unison, someone blasted an extra note, completely by themselves and it was recorded for posterity, so whenever I relistened to it, I would always be reminded, and feel slightly glad it wasn’t me.
It happens all the time.
I hear mistakes in almost every concert I go to, some more than others.
Yes, there are loads, with some very famous examples in numerous revered recordings. There is not really such a thing as a "flawless" performance in actuality.
You (and myself as well) just don't notice them.
There's a historic recording of a concert by Walter Gieseking with Mengelberg conducting Rachmaninoff 2 & 3, from 1940, where Gieseking hit a wrong note or two, immortalized on shellac.
I had a recording of Beethoven’s Fifth by NYP with Leonard Bernstein (Lost it somehow). In the third movement there was what I assume was a clarinet squeak.  I hear it in my head at the same point every time I hear the Fifth now.
I’ve seen multiple videos and heard multiple recordings of Vladimir Horowitz messing up.  Vladimir Horowitz. One of greatest concerts pianist who ever lived. If he can make make mistakes, so can the rest of us.  Rest easy my friends.
It's bound to happen sooner or later, specially with singers. Here's post-decay (but still in mostly good shape) Maria Callas [trying to salvage a High C](https://youtu.be/5MfPDWarOVc?t=533), and here's pre-decay Maria Callas simply [running out of air while trying to hit a Low F# during a cadenza](https://youtu.be/8Z6dOQ1OB-A?t=187) (a note well beyond the range of most sopranos, to be fair).  In the case of studio recordings and instrumentalists, something that stands out, that I can only assume was a mistake they couldn't fix for some reason, happens during Act I of Dorati's first recording of *Sleeping Beauty*. The brasses close the phrase [upwards](https://youtu.be/k8P3C1r678M?t=3449) instead of [downwards](https://youtu.be/9Kx9Vob7BzM?t=3908).
I would say it happens fairly often, but professional level players are also (typically) professionals at being able to salvage a moment and, if possible, maybe even make the mistake less noticeable with a little bit of improv. Here's Rubinstein doing just that: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VCaj7Oqcig](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VCaj7Oqcig)  Most mistakes glide off the music and never even get noticed. I will say that if I were a professional level musician, which I'm very far from, I would be terrified of losing my place while counting rests. The anxiety of the "was that the seventh or eighth bar of rest?" reality-questioning must be daunting when there's a lot at stake in getting your entrance right.
I went to a concert for Mendelssohn E minor VC. In the third movement, a hair broke and the soloist’s left hand caught it on the fingerboard. Surprisingly, he didn’t let it affect his bow as he used his left hand fingertips to simply break the top ends off, but his intonation went slightly flat for a short while. Barely affected anything.
Yes you have heard this happen, but you didn’t notice.  A little story (TL;DR below): In covid times, I sung with a nationally funded professional symphony orchestra. As a gift to our city, we recorded our national anthem, done in three parts due to restrictions - the orchestra as a fundament first, then two different choral sections.  So we heard the orchestral underlay and sang on top of it. As with many national anthems, the trumpets lead way into great highs, but…. At the last note of an important crescendo phrase, the first trumpet went BLEAOW - total voice crack moment. Of the three takes they recorded, THAT TAKE was selected. Next thing, the choral parts were recorded, the singers went home and the mix engineer set the levels. Hearing the final product on the national day, it sounded just… Great! Seriosly, just awesome, beautifully arranged and well played.  TL;DR/conclusion: You didn’t notice the trumpet blurt and the recording went fine. Why? The trumpet was never the main focus - in this case, the singers kept the listeners’ attention.  In a group of 50-100 people, it is hard to single out individual mistakes - they are easily concealed by the other sounds.  Strangest part of the experience was that no one of the desicion makers seemed to mind - neither lead conductor, choir master, producer or recording engineers.
It happens all the time
You can be sure that nowadays " live recordings" are a best of several evenings. Plus sometimes corrections. So that gives the impression of making less mistakes.
My favourite opera blooper : https://youtu.be/cUGfUPe8gWw
I remember a Laserlight brand CD recording of… I forget the piece, but what made it memorable to me is during a quiet passage, you could hear the alarm go off on someone’s digital watch… beepbeepbeep… beepbeepbeep…
There are plenty of sloppy performances and recordings. Some of the most musical and exciting performances I’ve heard were not perfect, but I’d always take that over a sterile but technically flawless performance.
I once heard the E-flat clarinet soloist of a MAJOR U.S symphony come in several measures early in the “suddenly loud” solo of Shostakovich’s “Leningrad”Symphony. (It was my teacher, so I won’t to call him out!)
Based on my experience as a college student and from working with professionals, I am certain that professionals mess up all the time but they are very good at hiding it. Even if you knew the piece they were playing super well, you would only notice a mistake if you were watching one musician closely the entire time they were performing. Of course, there are some occasions when performers make more obvious mistakes, but professional musicians usually have to work so hard to earn their positions that this rarely happens.
My favorite example is seeing Itzhak Perlman perform with the San Francisco symphony when I was 16. He played the Bartok second violin concerto, one of my favorite pieces of music that I knew extremely well, and in the middle of one of the movements, he used his bow to turn the page and completely flubbed/missed many notes of the subsequent bar. I was appalled, not merely because he was supposed to be “the best violinist ever” or some such, but even in a professional situation, I thought that was a really uncalled for and I still have no idea how or why it happened.
There are plenty. On YouTube there are even some hilarious orchestral musician bloopers if you know where to look.   However, you'll rarely hear noticeable errors in recorded music that made it through the digital editing and production process since they edit them out. So you'll very rarely hear errors if you buy CDs or also music from streaming services.   I think a few errors here and there is a nice reminder that we're all human, even the most talented, best trained musicians in the world. It can also add a touch of humor at times.
I wish Schickele Mix still existed, he did a whole show about this.
[This](https://m.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=149&v=f0vHpeUO5mw&embeds_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.co.nz%2F&source_ve_path=MTQwMTI3&feature=emb_logo) whole thing is very funny, but listen from around 2:20
One example that comes to my mind immidiatly is the second in [this video](https://youtu.be/sOMg0eIrxK4). You can hear how the trumpeter is nervous, but still a lot better than I could do.  Or [here](https://youtu.be/zP4il-1BUeE?t=83) at 1:24 a horn goes one step too high. It just happens.  Also in my orchestra are a few professionals. One of my trumpet collegues messed up his timing during a concert, but he knew what to do to coverer it and also did the same mistake in the repetition. No one could have noticed it and the recording of the concert is also great. If I didn't know that this was not on purpose, I wouldn't notice.
Went to listen to the Planets two months back by the Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra. Fairly certain I heard the bass oboist or contrabassoonist make a mistake at one point, just cracked a bit at one note.
To bad there isn't a recording or video of Yundi Li stopping the orchestra in South Korea. Written reviews seem to suggest he memorized it wrong and the orchestra couldn't follow and his tempo might be too liberal.
I once saw a Met Opera broadcast of Tosca where Placido Domingo cracked his high note in the middle of the second act. It was pretty obvious.  I also saw a performance of the Planets where the harp has to play these four harmonics at the end of Uranus. They messed up the very last note and everyone just sort of went “awwwww 🥲”
It’s hard to notice if you’re not also a musician but I’d imagine it’s not too difficult to cut mistakes from a recording either
Bobby Corno [badly cracked a note](https://youtu.be/f0vHpeUO5mw) in Beethoven's Fifth in a recorded live performance.
Not that microscopic, this piccolo player from the Orchestre National de France conducted by Berntein - Bolero: [https://youtu.be/k5Rl\_poZ1aI?t=379](https://youtu.be/k5Rl_poZ1aI?t=379) (recorded live)
It happens in live performances.  Not so much in recordings because of production and studio magic.
I went to a symphony concert one time (won’t name the symphony, but it was in the Midwest). The composer Bright Sheng was a guest conductor, conducting his Pipa Concerto. On the opening concert he gave a “downbeat” that looked like a double-armed Tai-Chi pose, pseudo-figure 8; half the orchestra started in one place, half in the other. They carried on like this for about 8 measures. Sheng gave a cut off, paused, sighed audibly, the concert master grew red in the face, then Sheng gave a more recognizable downbeat and they began the piece. Very scary moment.
I was at an organ recital at Davies in SF. The organist played the extremely treacherous Danse Macabre transcription.  Anyway he took a major stumble on an instrument that he had insufficient time to familiarize.   You couldn’t not notice it. Everyone was horrified. May have ruined his career.
Not part of the "canon" but listen to Rick Wakeman's Journey To The Center Of The Earth. It's the London Symphony and the liner notes specifically say they left in the squeaks and other problems.   Even if you're not interested in the mistakes, I recommend the recording.
The recordings of the Brahms symphonies and overtures with Bruno Walter conducting the Columbia Symphony (which was Los Angeles studio musicians), from the 60s I believe, contain all kinds of intonation and note errors, but they are some of my favorite recordings of those works, and the ones I first bonded with.  Same story with my beloved recordings of Ole Schmidt conducting the London Symphony on the Nielsen symphonies, from the early 70s.  I actually prefer to listen to older, pre-digital recordings because they generally feel more alive/ "human" to me.  Edit: and if you can find recordings of Furtwangler from the 40s, all the better!!
If all the notes were played correctly and in
You just aren't hearing the mistakes because they're so minor. Major fluffs do happen but they're much rarer. Some examples I have experienced:  Opera North, Das Rheingold. Beginning of scene 2, the Valhalla/Wotan motif - the horn section enters together out of very soft, wispy music to play a beautiful chorale. Unfortunately at this performance it sounded like every single one of the eight horns fluffed the first note. It was absolute chaos for about half a second, maybe less, the. It resolved into beautiful clarity and the performance continued as if nothing had happened.  Moskow State Symphony Orchestra, Mendelssohn Violin Concerto, 1st movement - coming out of the cadenza one of the cellos got lost and came in a bar or two early. Realised their mistake immediately and just held the note until the section joined them.  Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, Turangalila Symphony, 6th movement - percussions playing the vibraphone part got completely lost and played an entry in the wrong place. Simon Rattle calmly raised a hand to stop him and indicated to him when to play the next entry.
There's some recording of Jacqueline du Pré massively messing up some Haydn concerto (can't find it now), but really a total disaster. The thing is, she didn't give a shit and kept playing with the same unstoppable energy as ever, so the recording was kept and it's known for being yet another piece of Eden from Jacqueline
Too many. Most amusing when it's the timpanist.
Yes. I have a recording of one. Horn player in Beethoven 5, I think it is.
Vladimir Horowitz famously flubbed the first bar of Bach's Toccata, Adagio and Fugue in C Major on his Historic Return recording live from Carnegie Hall.  To make matters worse they were the first notes he played after seating himself at the piano.  There was talk of editing the mistake out but Horowitz insisted it remain as is.  Edit: expanded.
Sometimes it's the conductor, but the cool ones recover quickly:  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zlHu_nKpYT0
Martha Argerich and Horowitz both messed up some of the octaves in Tchaikovsky 1 in a recorded performance.
The reason it seems “flawless” is because we just get very good at moving on and not letting a flub derail us. Mistakes happen ALL THE TIME. Sure each individual might only make one in a concert, but there are 100 of us on stage.   Giant disasters are uncommon, but can happen. In my youth I went to see the Pittsburgh Symphony and the concertmaster completely zoned out and missed his entrance for a solo by several measures. The conductor had to basically snap fingers in his face.   The new principal flute of the Berlin Phil won the Nielsen Competition a few years ago with a performance of the Nielsen Concerto that was filled with mistakes (wrong notes, missed entrances, etc.), but his performance was so filled with life that he still won the whole damned thing.  I can almost guarantee that you have never heard a flawless performance. I know I never have. But the flaws just aren’t important or worth remembering.
At a performance of Bolero I attended some years back, the alto sax player hit a wrong note, but because it still “fit”, I don’t know how many people noticed.
Richter: I’ve got a recording of Beethoven PC 1 with some serious corkers.  Watts: memory lapse in a live concert of Brahms PC2 brought the work to a screeching halt.  Horowitz: mistakes everywhere  Schnabel: where to begin?? Lol  It happens to all of us. No one is perfect
My favoutite has to be Andreas Ottensamer (first clarinet in the Berliner Philharmoniker) squeaking at the beginning of Artie Shaw's clarinet concerto.  https://www.instagram.com/tv/Cdk702dJHp5/?igshid=ODM2MWFjZDg=
Oh the horns...I heard a Grammy-winning major orchestra play the Mozart bassoon concerto and the principal completely butchered the high Bb trill. To be fair it's a stupidly difficult opening phrase.
watched our professional symphony orchestra play tchaikovsky 5, and the horn player had a slight fart on the first note of the mvt 2 solo. rest of it was beautiful, but horn entrances seem particularly difficult
Any R Strauss tone poem
There are a few horn entrances that are flubbed so often - eg slow movement of Beethoven 9 - that hearing someone get it right sounds wrong to me at this point.
Yeah the most memorable mess up I've heard in concert was during mahler 1, horn player unfortunately flubbed that beautiful intro.
I have a subscription to Berlin Phil digital concert hall, and I havent heard the trumpet and horn miss a single note. Granted that the videos and the live streams are the last concert of a given programme and therefore less likely to have mistakes, I sincerely think that professionals should reduce the amount of missed notes even on the most vulnerable instruments like horn and trumpets.   I personally wouldn’t be affected by a mistakes here and there as a live audience member. But i do think that more effort should be make to avoid mispitches
Yep, no such thing as a perfect performance because humans aren’t perfect, and with that many humans, the margin for error goes way up. Professional musicians are usually very good at covering up their mistakes, especially in orchestral setting so an untrained person might not notice at all.
This is a common one. They simply have soooo many notes to play, and if you really listen to those inner voices you can sometimes hear a wrong note pop out. Even the best soloists. But like you said, it’s such a minor thing and it’s not like it detracts from the music. If anything it kind of makes me appreciate even more how hard they’re working to make art.
Better minor than mixolydian.
It used to be much more common. In early recordings there are a lot of mistakes and more ad lib stuff. Now, the technical bar is so high mistakes like that are much less common.
I hear a finger hitting two notes sometimes. Like octaves and the pinky finger doesn’t quite reach or over reaches.   Once I heard a soloist stumble during one of Bach’s WTC  fugues, soloist replayed half a measure or the whole measure. It was a fast section so no one noticed. Turned aside to see if anyone else noticed no one flinched. This is a pianist with a contract with a major label and released many albums.   They happen so fast it’s barely noticeable. And good at acting like nothing had happened. At least you know they’re not lip-syncing!
Also Arthur Rubinstein - excellent pianist but had a terrible memory lapse during a 1964 Soviet tour in a Chopin work, as one example. You can hear it on the recording.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmGw4tqoyIY
Sir Adrian Boult did the same during the premiere of a modern (Tippett?) symphony. The performance broke down, he turned to the audience and said ‘Entirely my fault, ladies and gentlemen’ - though the orchestra knew it was theirs.  EDIT: it was Tippett’s Second Symphony in February 1958.  Some slight blame could be ascribed to Boult as he had endorsed the concertmaster’s insistence that the strings’ rhythmic groupings be amended - telling Tippett that otherwise the work would not be performed. The incident was a blow to the prestige of the BBC SO and caused a minor controversy in the press.
theyre only mistakes if they are noticed!
This is mine: https://youtu.be/9UUPEo849_s
but I think his career ended there.
> It’s hard to notice if you’re not also a musician  I think this totally depends on the situation.
Ruined his career? Over one mistake? That’s terrifying
its impossible to ruin the tchaikovsky 1st concerto, tchaikovsky already did it by writing it
Horn player here, you're right. Especially when you're playing the first note in a phrase, and especially if you've been resting for a while, and even more so if it's a high note, it can be inconsistent. It's a hard instrument.
I've also heard a flubbed entrance of the horn solo in the 3rd movement of Brahms 3. It was my first time listening to it live after learning about that piece, so it was rather disappointing lol.
> more effort should be make to avoid mipitches  why, if only players had thought of just not messing up before! truly revolutionary insight on r/classicalmusic
modern recordings are also hugely spliced and edited so that any hint of "imperfection" is eradicated. even in "live recordings" they will often repeat sections after finishing the piece to patch in sections which had issues.
That is hilarious. It's his fault for going so slowly though! Horn had to be jolted awake.
This one had me in stitches.  I feel for the guy, but wow.  It’s like he’s doing a Tarzan impression.
Who is that?
I just looked him up so let me correct myself.  His career is good.  He’s playing alongside Olivier Latry in Paris.  But that was one biiiiiiiiggggg stumble.  Apologies for misinformation.
Mahler 5 seems like it would be a tough one to kick off with a horn. So important but man that’s a lot of pressure.
Nah that's not a jolted awake thing. The player just missed the note, but it's so subtle that it's hard to notice and the player recovered really well back to the right note
Jose Carreras, famous tenor, bad day
Mahler 5 is a trumpet solo at the opening. Do you mean that one or the horn solo in the third movement?
Subtle mistakes exist. This was not one of them
The beginning. That trumpet part is epic and an introduction and a red carpet etc etc. it seems like a lot.
That's like in the top 1% of most subtle cracked horn notes I've heard. The second player was good and the first player was only on the wrong note for a very short period, and the wrong note doesn't sound that bad in the context of the music. Having the second horn there helps a ton with hiding the mistake
Now you've got to go hear it live! It needs a ton of musicians so it isn't done super often, but definitely worth the effort to hear it live
These might also be up your alley:   Pictures at an Exhibition, Mussorgsky:  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=utt7f5lOJvE   Carnival of the Animals: Saint-Saens:  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=IDF3YN3GbO8   Pines of Rome, Respighi:  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TGT95J-jWrU
>I also got some Star Wars vibes   Parts of The Planets were used a "temp" track (temporary track), for Star Wars.  A temp track is music added to the picture by the director to give the composer an idea of what they want.  Any time a film score strongly resembles something else, you can almost guarantee that it's the result of a temp track.  And this is why I hate the claims of John Williams "stealing" other music. He does it because he *has* to, not because he *decides* to.  Besides, Williams's talent *far* exceeds that of writing a handful of tunes that resemble something else.  Anyway, yeah, The Planets - great piece!
Go listen to more Holst! 1st Suite in Eb, 2nd Suite in F, St. Paul's Suite (shares an ending with the 2nd Suite) he's more than just The Planets.  Also listen to his friend and contemporary Ra(l)ph Vaughan Williams. And what the hell, Clifton Williams while you're at it. Early 20th century and late 19th centiry music is fantastic.
>I don’t really think it’s telling a story but it’s kinda like depicting an astronomical character and how the character’s corresponds to the planets.  You were probably thinking of "astrological", and that's exactly what Holst himself said he was using.  From his "Hymn of Jesus", a bit of Venus-type music just before the full chorus and orchestra come in: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIiU2OxfWsQ  More ethereal Holst here, "Choral Hymns from the Rig Veda, third group": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFs4Zq1aiug&t=1049s
I'll add one more piece to the suggested additional Holst pieces: [The Cloud Messenger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i71y4J3-WZU). Stylistically it's very similar to The Planets, but it's one continuous piece (divides into segments of course, but no breaks between), and it heavily features the choir from start to finish.
Uranus has always been one of my favorite moments, the big swell with the brass fanfare is very variable in how it can make me feel depending on my mood! From jaunty circus act one day to a shadow of The Imperial March the next, it's an amazing piece all throughout, though my favorite planet is Saturn.
Listen to the Cloud Messenger by holst as well. Very underrated.
I love the Planets suite, especially Jupiter.I think you'll enjoy Rimsky-Korsakov's Scheherazade too!
Saw the Nashville Symphony with Leonard Nimoy (live) narrating a bit between each piece and oh my. Simply life changing.
The Planets are amazing. My favorite of all time since I was a little kid. I still regularly listen to them while following along with the full score. So much inspiration.
Parts of Mars were used for the song "Am I Evil" by Diamond Head / Metallica
>I also got some Star Wars vibes from the mars one.  That's [not a coincidence](https://youtu.be/4R5r4shLDbs).
The Planets is amazing!!
I saw the New York Philharmonic play it live several years ago and it was absolutely amazing! All the extra musicians needed to accommodate the piece is so cool to see in person.
The Planets rules.
One of my favorites!  Our [local community big band](https://www.columbiabands.org/) is performing a jazz arrangement of this suite on May 6. Anyone in range of central Maryland, come check it out!
Neptune is one of my faves.
The Planets were a big part of my childhood introduction to classical music.  I’m embarrassed to even admit to it, but I remember dancing to it.
I got to play Mars in a youth symphony at was in, and it was SUCH a fun piece! I haven't kept up my viola skills, but I would love to relive some of those moments. Night on Bald Mountain is another fun one to play.
It was the very first CD I ever owned! Got it for my 9th birthday, and I wore that thing down so much, it's too good
Mars and Venus are great. Jupiter is also very popular and part of it has been used as a major British patriotic hymn, “I Vow to Thee my Country” and for rugby tournaments, so it has a spin-off with a life of its own in pop culture.
The Planets - the gateway drug of classical music.
I like all the movements up to and including Jupiter. After that the piece becomes a bit underwhelming.
The Planets are great.
It’s a great piece to listen to and play! I played it a month ago and love Mars and Venus also! Welcome to the world of classical music and give more a listen when you can (hopefully live) :)
The star wars themes were actually inspired by the planets.
I just relistened to Uranus this morning. All of them are great. Jupiter and Mars tends to overshadow the others, but all of them are great.
You might like [Debussy’s La Mer](https://youtu.be/I-kZN97ir_4), it’s similarly atonal yet pretty.
A percussionist fav
I love Holst! Ralph Vaughan Williams was already mentioned as well.  One of my all time favourite pieces is Beni Mora from Holst. I'd recommend you give that one a try too if you enjoyed Holst's work :)
Funny thing about Star Wars. John Williams quotes snippets from Mars in some places of the score, and the ostinato theme uses very similar tricks to create tension, though it's not a direct quote. Overall, there's a lot of Mars in Star Wars.
Mars has similarities to *The Imperial March* from Star Wars, *Airship Theme* from Mario Bros 3, The *Map Theme* from Star Fox 64, *Death Mountain* from The Legend of Zelda: A Link To The Past, and probably many other songs.                             Some parts of Jupiter have similarities to *Saria's Song* from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and the *Millennial Fair* theme from Chrono Trigger. There is also a similarity between a part in Jupiter and the English patriotic song "*I Vow to Thee, My Country*".
The Cleveland Orchestra runs this event from time to time:  https://coolcleveland.com/2017/08/cleveland-orchestra-plays-holsts-planets-blossom-music-center/
Excellent OP! John Williams got Star Wars vibes too!
This is one on the list of stuff I fall asleep to. It's been a while actually so I might play it tonight. Neptune is my favourite! Certainly lives up to it's mysticism. It can make you astral project by accident.
I discovered this suite years ago and loved it because I knew the first movement’s theme from Venture Bros.: https://youtu.be/j73gYxsxRrs
Check out my https://classicalconcertmap.com: it's performed pretty frequently! The map will soon cover twice as many orchestras, so I think overall about 40 different orchestras will have performed it this season.
I will definitely
You've heard it live?!?
I would add Beethoven’s Sixth, the Pastoral to that list.  I just love how he captures the joy and freshness of being on holiday in the country.  Can you imagine what it must have been like to escape the smells of a city of that era?
You shouldn't forget Symphonie fantastique
Kind of like those, Pacific 321 by Arthur Honegger.
I mean he did say he would write something "better" than the Planet suite for Star Wars. I would say he failed in that respect. He's a great composer in his own rite and really shouldn't have compared himself to Holst there... Kinda dug his own grave for criticism.
Thank you for the recommendations
Wind band music FTW!
This is such good advice. *Jupiter* and *The Lark Ascending* are my 2 favorite pieces. And my 3 year old LOVES *Jupiter* too!
Here's a YouTube recording of the *St. Paul's Suite* - played by an all-woman orchestra, appropriately (given its history):  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBjkb9bBTU4
*Ralph Vaughan Williams  The early 20th century is a great period for English music. If you want something very accessible, very English and very fun (and in a similar style to the St Paul’s suite) then I’d heartily recommend the Capriol Suite by Peter Warlock.
Oh I see. Also I realized he didn’t include the earth. Probably has to do with what you said about astrological
I’ll listen to it. Thanks for the recommendation
Cool. Honestly I don’t know what planet is my favorite but I have always liked how Saturn looks. Reminds me of the ATLA when Aang combined all the four elements and it looked like the planet Saturn lol
I love the chaotic energy of Mercury.
You are the second person to recommend that one to me.👍
2nd theme of Jupiter is absolutely transcendent.
I would add Symphonie fantastique
Ahhh, good call!!
Oh wow, that’s so cool! I’m jealous!
I wanna see it live
[Also Symphony X](https://youtu.be/zFZFB0-VTrU?t=102)
Well Holst wrote it about 50 or 60 years before StarWars existed. John Williams stole some ideas from Holst.
I’m pretty sure “The Planets” was heavily based on Star Wars cause I don’t think the Star Wars movie included Earth and Holst did even include Earth in the composition so I’m guessing they connect
Where did you see if I may ask?
Awesome.
I have two favs. Mars and Venus
I was jamming to it and my parents were like what are you doing
Wow that’s awesome.
I think Jupiter was more of loud and adventurous
Oh I see
Neither piece is atonal at all.
That website is about to change my life.
Too bad that site is US-only!
Looks really cool!   ..... Oh.   *Cries in Canadian*
This is amazing - how does one get concerts on the map? Is it only for professional orchestras, or do you take choruses? Feel free to DM me, I'm not official or anything just wondering for a local group.
I don't live in the US, but absolutely appreciate your website! It helps to have an impression of what pieces of each composer are currently "popular". Thank you!
I was just wishing for a website like that! Lots of Shosta 5th and 10th going on.
So... A wind ensemble I've been managing is performing it this coming May 28. Plus some Star Wars & Trek.  www.SouthBayWinds.com  If you're in the area and interested, please come check it out!  If anyone wants discounted tickets, use code **Spaces20SBWE**.
I didn’t enjoy the suite except for mars and jupiter until i saw them live. It completely changed my perspective on the peice
I'm quite sure in that quote Williams wasn't telling Lucas that he can piss further musically than Holst can. He was telling Lucas that he can write something better *suited* to Star Wars than just using Holst directly, something tailor made for Star Wars.   I've never got the impression from Williams that he ever compared himself favorably against other composers, or thought himself superior.
 I think Williams is at least the equal of Holst as a composer.  He certainly has a much greater stylistic range, and in my opinion, is the best orchestrator since Ravel.  Spielberg himself has said how important Johnny's scores are for the success of his films.  Without Williams, at a minimum _Jaws_, _Close Encounters of the Third Kind_, _Star Wars etc_, and _ET_ wouldn't be anywhere near the success they were.  Compare to any other film composer today.  Do you remember anything from any Marvel movie?
We fucking *love* wind band music.
Fixed, thank you. I still keep the L optional, that whole pronunciation never made sense to me.  I forgot about the Capriol Suite entirely, and what a baller surname Warlock is too.
>Probably has to do with what you said about astrological  Yep, it wasn't included because it contains no astrological significance.   Pluto wasn't included as it wasn't discovered until 1930. Although Holst died in 1934, he didn't appear to seem to want to expand the work.  Composer Colin Matthews wrote "Pluto, the Renewer" in 2000, in which the ending of Holst's Neptune was ammened slightly so that it could segue into Pluto.  It's been performed as part of The Planets a number of times, although I think significantly less now that Pluto has been declassified as a planet!
So do I. I’ve never had the chance.
Also King Crimson https://youtu.be/aCQ_S-HY7qM
I think you meant to reply to OP's reply to me, but yes, that's one of the main points in that video.
Phillyspinto replied to you, but Holst came first. Star Wars was second. Which you probably already know by now. 🤣
At their home base, Lincoln Center in New York City. It’s a beautiful venue!
The middle part with the hymn is the best part imo.
“Late 19th- and early 20th-century composers such as Alexander Scriabin, Claude Debussy, Béla Bartók, Paul Hindemith, Sergei Prokofiev, Igor Stravinsky, and Edgard Varèse have written music that has been described, in full or in part, as atonal.”  "The repertory of atonal music is characterized by the occurrence of pitches in novel combinations, as well as by the occurrence of familiar pitch combinations in unfamiliar environments". *  -https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atonality  *which perfectly describes both pieces   “Debussy’s legendary atonal qualities come from several factors, including that he disguised other musical arrangements (such as bitonal chords) as melodies.”  -[goinghighbrow.com](https://gohighbrow.com/debussy/)  OP don’t mind Mr. Classical Snob guy here, if you like The Planets you’ll probably like La Mer
It's still in its very early days,  a very long way to go, but I am happy that you like it! If you haven't heard of them already, bachtrack.com and operabase.com are the polished for-profit versions of this sort of thing, though in the specific realm of American orchestras, they don't cover many concerts.
bachtrack.com does a similar thing, non-exhaustive list of classical concerts everywhere (not just 'murica)
haha Canada is 2nd in line, check in like 6 months! had to start somewhere
I'll definitely take choruses, just started with orchestras because they're easy and geographically dispersed. I take the info from each organization's website, so as long as they post their concerts on a website, I can pick them up with no involvement needed from them. If they don't have a website, I could take submissions via a form or something, but I haven't tried that to begin with because a lot of groups don't have the time or energy to submit events that way. I was the intern at a chamber music presenter, and I had to submit events to various local newspapers, and it was very tedious.  Anyway, what is the chorus called? I can look up their site if they have one.
I remember standing in a stairwell in my music building with my choir in order to sing the eerie bits of Neptune, while someone behind me slowly closed the door to the performance hall. Nobody ever saw the choir (but they still made us dress up for it). It's definitely something else live.
> I can’t take any of this terribly seriously, because I’m a musician standing on the shoulders of what people have done in other centuries of music.  Yeah, I've always thought he comes off off as proud of his work, yet still relatively humble for someone who's had such success. Most people who work with him seem to always talk about how gentle and humble he is.
The quote I've heard was that Williams told Lucas "You need a better composer than me," and Lucas said "I know, but they're all dead."
While I agree that John Williams is on a different level - there are a lot of contemporary film composers that I think are great! Hans Zimmer and Joe Hisaishi are ones that immediately come to my mind. All three embody different styles and Williams has a style closest to classical music as a genre, but there are definitely great film composers out there still.
Well I would disagree with you. But I'm sure I'm not supposed to do that as clearly shown above.
It’s criminally underrated and I will die on that hill! Nobody I talk to understands 😂
Fair enough, it’s definitely a weird one, not just him though.  It is a great name, albeit its a pseudonym. Seems like a very interesting and tragic character.
Basically some English words including names had silent letters added to their spellings to reflect their Latin roots and over time people began pronouncing the silent letters: another example is ‘falcon’ which used to be pronounced ‘faucon’.
Two reasons have been presented as Holst's reason not to write a new movement for Pluto:  * Holst believed that once the piece was finished, discovering a new planet won't suddenly make it unfinished again. * Holst was annoyed by how successful The Planets turned out, while his other works were completely ignored by everyone, so he kinda grew a bit resentful of The Planets.
Thanks
Thank you for sharing this. I’d totally go on a road trip to hear certain pieces.
I think Hans Zimmer is a great sound designer, and an OK composer.
The second reason turned out to be a problem for most great composers. Their most famous and popular pieces would come to haunt them
Also Pluto has no astrological significance for obvious reasons.
You may also like “The Firebird Suite”, by Stravinsky, which is an orchestral suite of music from his ballet. It has similarly rich and evocative moments that really are sublime.
what is the job of composers if not designing sound?
Sound designer is typically a different sort of role, often creating atmospheric background sounds or effects sounds, often using unusual physical items (and now electronic synthesizers) beyond usual musical instruments.
Been working on this piece- it’s so beautiful. I like how this guy plays the intro https://youtu.be/UodEEci_w5E :D
Last movement of the Italian Concerto.
[This particular recording](https://youtu.be/lXxRRYWx6QM) of the second movement of Brandenburg 3 is an absolute adrenaline booster, especially when the bass comes in!
The final (gigue) movement from the a minor violin concerto is a cracker. That pedal point!
The Gigue from that suite (as played by Gould)
Fantasia in C Minor BWV 906. It Is relentlessly bombastic.
I'll chime in with some organ performances.  &#x200B;  * The [Toccata in F major, BWV 540/1](https://youtu.be/5WX5PPRotSc) is quite fiery, as in a continuous pace...other than 1-2 whole notes in-between sections. * And I agree with the [Gigue Fugue](https://youtu.be/0gRBCAdC7wI) that someone else mentioned. This particular link is an old performance by Virgil Fox on the organ.
The opening chorale fantasia of BWV 26.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w0lqrGDvEk
The Prelude and Fugue in C Minor from WTC Book I. I believe it is the second P&F in the whole set. It isn’t really fast per say, but it certainly is furious, moody and passionate.
Literally any minor key Gigue.
Three Choral Preludes, which I like, are often played at break neck speed, esp when played on the piano.  I think it has much to do with the person who is performing the choral does not know what the text says, or cares about the purpose of the text.  BWV 711 Alleib Gott Hoh in der Hoh in sie ehr [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1DINGEdwNc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1DINGEdwNc) (even this rendition is too fast)  BWV 646  Wo Soll ich fliehen hin [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHcS4HYYnnI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHcS4HYYnnI)  BWV 550 Kommst du nun [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNIwNhTh8fc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNIwNhTh8fc)
Bach wrote 19 suites, you'll have to be more specific.
English Suite No. 2 in A Minor BWV 807 - VII. Gigue (see op's text)
I'm reminded of a college professor & conductor I studied under many years ago. I don't see/hear his name mentioned much these days, but he was a bit of a big deal in choral music back in the day, having been the go-to guy for preparing choirs for performances under the likes of Bernstein, Muti, Mehta, etc.  Anyway, one thing he was known for was that, whether conducting or as part of an audience, he would breathe very loudly and dramatically with the music; shuffle his feet with the rhythm (usually quite loudly; legend has it that he's the reason most conductors' podiums in the NY/NJ/PA region were carpeted); and sometimes sway in what I can only describe as a manner more apt to an extremely Victorian case of "the vapors" than to a concert attendee.  He was one of the most musically knowledgeable people I ever met, and IMO an absolutely brilliant choral conductor...but everyone I knew absolutely *hated* listening to music if he was in the room!
Nah, moving is totally fine, as long as you don't disturb the joy of others. People just enjoy stuff differently.   It's also very different in other cultures. I played a concert in china like 20 years ago with 10k people "listening" and it was more of a marketplace atmosphere where we barely could hear ourselves playing sitting in the orchestra. At the moment I live in Colombia and many times they won't applaude at all at smaller concerts.
Moving a little isn’t a big deal, though if you’re on the taller side maybe try to keep your movements forward and back, and not side to side. It can be frustrating/distracting to constantly have to shift to see because the person in front of you can’t pick a spot.
Classical music is quite fragile unfortunately – or at least that's my feeling of classical music. It's delicate and falls apart easily if there are outside disturbances. That's why if I'm listening to classical music at home I will move, dance, conduct or hum: it doesn't disturb me because those are my own movements. But in a concert setting, other people will tend to – for example – move in a slightly different rhythm to what you are feeling or hum a bit off key etc. And for classical music that is both not very loud and highly dynamic while musically complex that will often mean a noticeable disturbance.  That being sad I will do things like move my fingers slightly in a concert setting as well. But tapping with you feet can be quite disturbing unfortunately, even if it's not loud it causes vibrations and pulses which can be quite distracting.
I move to the music when I feel it! I don't care if people think it's weird, and some people approach me afterwards and tell me they enjoyed seeing me enjoy the music. As others have said, as long as you aren't preventing others from hearing and (best you can) from seeing, YOU DO YOU! :)   As a musician, the only reason I don't love when people clap between movements is that it makes it feel more like 3 or 4 (or more) separate pieces instead of a work all connected together. I'm breathing and preparing for the next movement. I find, as an audience member, it makes more sense to breathlessly await the next movement when I'm familiar with the piece. Then I, too, know what's coming next and can prepare for it! (In other words, when I am approaching a concert coming up, I get more enjoyment in the end when I've familiarized myself with the pieces by listening to them in the weeks before the concert, internalizing their nuances and patterns in a way that is hard to catch on the first few listens. :)   Welcome to classical music! It loves you back!
I’ve always nodded along at the build up to climactic moments
We need the quiet so as not to miss the ringing of our cellphones.
Haha I have ADHD and am also autistic so I constantly fidget, sway, and stim when I am listening to my favorite music at home and at concerts it is incredibly hard to sit still. I find myself repressing my movement but I don’t think it is necessary to stay absolutely still, just be lowkey so that it isn’t distracting anyone or whatever.
There are many ways to enjoy music. I think it more important to remember that these concerts are almost exclusively acoustic and in very specialized spaces to enhance every detail of the unamplified sound. For that reason, almost every sound is enhanced - be it tapping, rustling, whispering, etc.   So, please enjoy the music in your own way, but just be conscious of the space you are in.
I think most people try their best to stay still to keep the distractions to a minimum, so everyone can enjoy the full scope music, every detail. I can’t keep myself from lightly tapping my foot or nodding my head a bit when I get carried away by the piece either, i just hope it doesn’t bother anyone around me.
Tapping toes is a big no no
We were seeing the Philadelphia Orchestra last weekend and there was a couple with two kids, probably around 3-5 years old. The one couldn’t sit still, kept talking, standing on his seat waving at the people behind him and the parents did nothing. We go regularly and are used to not everyone having the best etiquette but this was unbelievable.   I always find myself swaying a little or tapping my hand on my knee.
Meh, I "air tap" my index fingers like they're conducting and gently nod my head in time with the music, if I get really into it. As long as you're not actually making a noise, why should anyone care? It's all good.
I'd so love to arrange classical music concerts with a mosh pit for the audience to dance if they wish!
Everyone moves. Try not to be too excessive but at the end of the day you've paid to listen, so you should listen as best you can, not spend the concert trying to be a living statue.  Secondary point: I have ADHD. I'm a musician myself, I've been t£ a lot of concerts, and I liko to think I'm a respectful audience member, at least I am always trying to be. But as soon as you are casting moral judgement on peoples ability to sit still for long periods of time, there's a bunch of people who automatically can't meet that standard. It's a frankly ableist assumption, and it just so happens to be exactly what a lot of us have been told off about by schools, parents, and loved ones, despite us not being able to do anything about it if we wanted to. For some oy us, it's quite traumatic.  Simple point is, 'stillness' is often only enforced to exclude neurodiverse people. Don't do it to music.
It's fine, as long as you're quiet. Your neighbors are either *silently* enjoying it, or else they're just there to show how cultured they are.
The problem is that the etiquette is to stay still, so anybody letting themselves go a bit will stand out. Everybody is like a statue because everybody is like a statue.   But it's very unnatural isn't it? In concerts of most different genres of music, people move around, that's how we engage naturally with music, normally. It's one of the many reasons why I don't really go to concerts to actually enjoy music, but for the visual appeal: seeing musicians playing, seeing the themes bouncing around groups of instruments, etc.
It's not that stuffy like many people think. You just have to be aware.   I was recently at a concert and there were two old dudes sitting about 5 seats away from me and I could hear them whispering to each other and it was extremely annoying. No one else in the place was doing that. If you're asking on this sub about etiquette, you are probably aware enough that you wouldn't have been talking when it was obvious you shouldn't be.   On the other hand, I used to go to concerts in millennium park in chicago, and there people will be talking, laughing, kids will be running around screaming, folks eating an entire picnic, etc, and that's perfectly fine as well.   If you're a kind person, you'll naturally be fine. Here in mexico, people applaud between all movements, though during, they're very quiet. I find myself swaying, nodding my head, etc. especially during really moving parts of the music. Nobody would sensibly be upset by that.
The more mental energy you are able to concentrate on the music the more you will get out of it. Senseless movement or worse someone making a noise like tapping along can only take away from the experience, never enhance it. Its not a dance or rock concert.
nah I headbang to jazz
I feel ya. I often wish there was some sort of mosh pit available for the exciting parts. I performed a concert a couple months back full of Latin American dance music but no place for the audience to dance. I couldn't sit still and I was a performer; I can only imagine how maddening it would have been as a listener!
I was just at a concert where Richard Egarr said that we should misbehave, because it was such lively music.   Nobody did.  It was Haydn’s 59th symphony and Beethoven’s 8th.
Well, most classical music concert-goers pay very high prices for tickets and they tend to be older people. So what you're really asking is "why don't highly successful rich older people move around a lot at a concert?" There's your answer. They're not children.
I wouldn’t do anything distracting, like moving or making noise, personally. I’d find that annoying as as an audience member, but that’s just me.
I got into classical music a little later in life too. I think we’re the change we wanna see. Being excited, bobbing our heads and truly enjoying the music is the most modern expression of appreciation. I don’t wanna take away from someone else’s experience but if I wanna tap my feet and move to the beat then I will.
My grandpa told me to always dance whenever you can, you never know when you won’t be able to. So enjoy yourself, it’s music, as long as it makes you happy who cares
Treating classical music as a religious experience is a thing that started in the mid 19th century, before that it was everything but. Since it has become a very expensive thing with mostly a century old repertoire, the tradition has remained, in big part because every concert can be a one time experience for a lot of people.  I can't keep still, though I do keep quiet. It's part of how I keep engaged and concentrate on the music. Some people don't need to move, others do. It's like morning or night people, where morning people won and now the world scoffs at late sleepers. Just keep it limited.  I'd still love a string quartet in a bar, where I can enjoy it however I want.  And it's not a silly question, things shouldn't be so imposing and hermetic. It's not like there is a guidebook anyway.
As a former performer, I found it extremely distracting if people are excessively moving or making sounds in the audience. I learned to live with the occasional cough, but someone's phone going off, someone opening a package of sweets, or someone moving along with the music could completely ruin my concentration.
It's absolutely essential to the experience that you remain as stuff as a board and display no emotion /s
Thanks all. :) Yes, figured it'd be a silly question, but after two years of regular going I was starting to doubt myself.
I am a professional timpanist in a Colorado orchestra. I want people to feel things and to move when I perform! If I can make you Bob your head or tap your toes, that just means I'm doing my job correctly :)
Do whatever you want that doesn’t involve your cell phone or talking. Clap between movements, lean from side to side, bob your head, etc. Maybe avoid unwrapping noisy candies, but do you ultimately.   I used to have a conductor in high school who told us to tell our families that if they even had a tickle in their throat they shouldn’t come to a concert, lest they might accidentally cough. I can’t with the elitism.
>Am I alone in this?   No, I too get enraptured by the music, I just move within my space.   >Is it bad etiquette?   I don't think so, don't assume other people stuffiness as etiquette, just don't disturb other people's enjoyment of the music.
I don’t know where you are, but when I go to concerts, there’s always at least one idiot in the audience who tries to “conduct” the performance from his seat. (Yes, it’s always a guy.) I’ve had to remind people that it’s annoying and distracting and there’s already a real conductor on the podium, and the musicians can’t see you all the way up in the nosebleeds. One guy told me he couldn’t help himself. So I offered to flag down an usher who would invite him to conduct from the comfort of his own home.
I always move a little, nod my head, i cant help it, i love it so much. I wish i could aplaud between movements, let me show my emotions damn it!   I find it funny that a classical concert is so upthight and serious... The music is so f*ing cool.
Some people have a modicum of self control.
I do the same thing.  I can’t help it.  As a metal head I’m already resisting the urge to headbang during a lot of pieces so I think a gentle head nod is appropriate.  As long as you don’t make a scene I think you’re fine
Totally fine. I’ve seen others gently move the body as well, none of them disturbing others. So you are not alone.
people are afraid to look silly or out of place. even when an artist asks people to clap or sing along, most people find it embarrassing. So, i think its less etiquette and more fear of being judged.   However,  you must share in the fear of else you will be marked as a fearless person, willing to do and be what ever they like and threatening the social order. such persons can not be tolerated in a society that strives for order and excellence. you must submit or you will be submitted, by force if necessary. Send out for the users, call in the security team. Stop the show i say, and let mayhem be so that mayhem can be stopped. expel and deter, remove and clear out. all must be quite and still for our music to proceed.
They're sleeping
As a musician who has gone through “classical training” at school, I can tell you that the cool ones want to break this bad audience habit of treating a concert like a conservative church event.   I can’t speak to the personal enjoyment of every statuesque audience member, but it’s clear that the idea of classical music being more “intellectual” and “elite” is attractive to a certain class of population, and their ideas of snobbery and behaviour have been imported into the listening of the music. They may or may not be aware that they’ve brought this baggage with them, but it’s there.  Mostly, I would say do your thing, enjoy the music in a way that makes you happy, and don’t worry about the others. You’re not there (like they might be) for appearances, you are there for the music.   There’s a huge amount of research - neurological- into how music reaches the brain and historical - how concerts were in the past that says there’s no reason for audiences to continue to be so still, but we may have to wait one or two generations for concerts to adapt and break away from these traditions.  I’d look at concerts hosted by inclusive organizations, ones that encourage moving about (I’m thinking of autistic audiences etc) or even smaller halls that host student concerts, the atmosphere is different, and with a younger crowd you’ll get more movement.
I twitch and tap my toes in concerts. Maybe not as much as Glenn Gould.
I headband at concerts all the time. Then again, my headbanging at metal shows is equally restrained.
I can't help running my fingers on my lap when at a piano recital and it's a piece I know well. Sometimes it invites glances, most of the time, it doesn't. I've seen others do similar.  It is part etiquette, part culture, and part appreciation. My concert venue of choice, when I was younger, was London's Wigmore Hall, which is notably frequented not so much by other musicians, but by retired civil servants and other middle-upper-class lay folk. More often than not, I and a friend I'd bring would be the youngest members of the audience by far. I watched those blue rinses and tweeds to learn old-money habits from.
It just depends on cultures and people. Where I come from people don’t move about but they applaud skillful improvisations as soon as the improvisation is finished unless the musician makes a hand gesture asking them not to, usually when they want the audience to hear the ending in particular.
I sorta tap my fingers especially when I know the piece but that’s it
So many people concerned about *seeing* music. sigh
As far as applauding between movements, look at your program.  If a work has multiple movements, try and resist the urge until the end of the work to applaud your heart out.  If it’s a single work…all good.  Quite often I hear applause after the first movement, and then not for the rest of the work.  Conductors usually are quite clear when it’s the end of a movement or section, vs the end of a piece/work.
Pro tip: most concert halls have a little room In the back for restless concert goers or people w kids to hang out. Just get an aisle seat so you don’t have to move past people.
Jazz instead of classical, but when I got to see Ari Hoenig play live I was bouncing around in my seat and air drumming. I just hope I wasn't a distraction for him because I think I was the only person who looked like they were excited to be there.
If you do it silently, it should be fine.
The other thing, too, is to bring something that occupies you physically as you listen - a sketch pad, a writing block, a small fidget toy, as long as it’s quiet, you can express that movement through something else without moving too much.
I never understood this. On important days at church they would have teenagers sing and play instruments and it was extremely impressive. When they finished their songs I would want to clap but you’re not supposed to. It always weirded me out when there was silence after a fantastic song.
I attended a performance of Mahler 5 last night from a balcony seat.  I don't mind people moving, head bopping a bit, quiet toe or finger tapping, etc., but what did bother me?  The guy in the seat ahead of me inexplicably leaned all the way forward in his seat at the beginning of the piece (for a decent section of the first movement) and then again in the final movement.  What I'm sure he didn't understand is that messes up the sightlines for whoever is behind him--the seats are configured so that from the balcony and mezzanine, most seats in the centre and centre side areas have unimpeded views of the entire stage \*if\* everyone sits normally in their seats.  He completely blocked the conductor and the first couple of chairs of the strings on the left-hand side (violins and cellos.) I'm not really sure what exactly he thought he could see \*better\* by leaning forward a foot or two.  Luckily the seat on my right was empty so I was able to lean to the side and crane my head around to see.
movement is usually a response to rhythm, and more specifically, pulse.    Classical music just does NOT value this metric evenness in the same way that pop music does. So the audience has not evolved to be tappers and movers.    to say nothing of a certain upper class social aesthetic...
move all you like. laugh if something is funny, and chat to the people next to you. concert etiquette is about enjoyment (just don't be so loud that you annoy others 🤣)
During a concert of the Matthaus Passion i sat next to a man who swayed to the whole concert. He was way bigger than the rest of us and all the seats in our row swayed with him! I thought it was hilarious and it didn’t bother me.
As long as the gestures are sufficiently mild that it doesn't distract other people.
Elgar used to mutter exclamations and clutch at his friends’ arms at concerts, for example when listening to the Symphonie Fantastique. A woman friend said she had bruises on her arm.
Eleazar de Carvalho was the same way, although it was usually hard to hear him snorting and grunting away over a full orchestra.
Was your teacher Robert Shaw?
You can just say the name. It won't doxx you or anything lol.
I love sitting first row hearing the conductor doing their weird little noises! How can anyone hate him for that?
What can disturb the joy of others is sitting behind someone who's visibly *not* paying attention to the show: browsing the program, whispering to a neighbor, shuffling through their purse, god forbid scrolling on a phone. We go to live performance to experience it together. If you're bobbing and weaving with the music, unless you're having a total seizure, you're not a distraction and might even enhance the experience like the audience laughing and cheering at the movie theater.
I saw a Bruckner concert here in Mexico a few weeks ago, and when people clap between movements, it actually takes quite a long time for the applause to quiet down. I didn't really think about it before because I almost never have been to a concert where folks applaud between movements, but having experienced it, I realized fully just why people don't do so. In general it feels weird not to applaud, and I get that, but it's like at least a full minute between movements if they're applauding. maybe 15 seconds in between if not. It makes a lot more sense to me now than it did before.
just imagining an audience full of people stimming and laughing out loud. I bet the orchestra would feel incredible though.
What you describe is not at all distracting I find.
Me but on stage lol.
As a fellow ADHD/autistic person I always try to find a way to figit without others noticing, eg under the chair or table
Agreed. We also need some concerts that are a more chill vibe in general. Let people enjoy the social aspect as well as the music and feel comfortable simply being there. If people can't hear then perhaps just a tiny bit of amplification is needed.
A good third of them are nodding off.
This is the answer.
OOF. He really needed everyone else to notice how educated he was.   Years ago I was playing a recital and someone in the front row started conducting. It was supremely distracting. I’d have never thought how much my orchestra brain can just switch on and follow waving hands 😂. To make matters worse he was a pretty decent conductor so it was easy to follow him. I had to ask him to stop.
I’ve driven to gigs with so many guys who do this in the car lol. Also always a guy. Feels unsafe honestly. It also feels performative to show how well they know the music.
Damn you sound very smart and very cool 😎
Wow. Imagine having to explain that... "Ma'am, those bruises...is everything all right at home?" "Oh, yes, it's fine; it's just that my friend Ed is *really* into music."
I find that oddly fascinating; makes me wonder how much of a "thing" that might be with conductors.
my first thought, cyril stretansky second
LOL I honestly do not know why I didn't name him in the first place. Cold medicine doing my head in a little, I guess.  This was Dr. Joseph Flummerfelt ("Flum," as we referred to him) of Westminster Choir College.
>who's visibly not paying attention to the show  I recently sat in a Rachmaninoff concert, and there was a father-child pair next to me. Seemed like the dad was trying to get his daughter (about 9-10) into classical music, but like most kid, she just didn't like it very much.  She slouched in her seat, tapped her feet, made noise by scratching her sequinned dress, yawned, shuffled through the programme ... while the dad coughed every 30 seconds and was on his phone **at max brightness** for most of the concert even though the attendant already said you need to put your phone away at the start of the concert.  Even though I think he was trying to get his child into classical music, ***he himself didn't even look like he particularly enjoyed it at all***.  Thankfully, they left in the second half after the dad **loudly** asked: "Are you bored?" in the middle of Rhapsody on a Theme by Paganini. So loud that a few people in the front row looked back at him.  It ruined the first half of the concert for me and I was mightily annoyed. Near front row seat so it costs a pretty penny.  I don't mind the kid. She's a kid. But the dad ... there's just literally no excuse. Not only he's visibly not interested in the music, he failed to observe etiquette that's quite literally broadcast over the loudspeakers at the start of the concert.
There’s plenty of settings where amplification is utilized heavily to assist in the performances.   Obviously you have lots of Broadway pit orchestras that are miced alongside the on stage cast, and lots of jazz ensembles will use mics for some of their performances in larger venues.   I know the marching band world tends to get a bad rep with a lot of classical people but a lot of groups heavily rely on amplification of their performers to some extent.  Most groups do mic their front ensemble percussion, and some will use shotgun mics to amplify certain ensemble moments (lots of competitive HS groups do this for their woodwind sections now) and there’s even some DCI groups that have wireless mics on a few players on each part to mix through their front field speaker systems for big moments with their brass sections. Some groups add Synthesizer subwoofer bass to big moments as well but I’d prefer to avoid that in a classical setting lol.  Some combo/variation on what all these diffrent types of ensembles are doing might be effective for these kinds of performances.
My local concert hall is rather well-lit.  On more than one occasion, I've sat near the same couple; she is reading a book and he is just listening to the music, and I think that's pretty awesome.  They're enjoying their favorite arts together even though they are different arts.
I'll admit, this has happened to me.  I love going to classical concerts, I truly do. But it's warm, it's relaxed, I'm tired because it's friday evening, and sometimes my eyes fall closed.
I guess it's now considered elitist to be able to sit still and not bother other people around you for an hour or so.
de Carvalho was eccentric in any number of ways. I performed under him once (I was in the Yale Glee Club during the time that he was conductor-in-residence there and we were part of the chorus for a performance of Beethoven's *Choral Fantasy* that he conducted).    Whenever he gave instructions during rehearsals, he would randomly bounce from language to language - English, Portuguese, German, Italian, maybe others, plus lots of grunting and literally pounding his own chest with his fist. It was quite an experience!
As an orchestral musician, I’d rather see an audience full of people enjoying themselves than an audience of people more concerned with others moving slightly than listening. If someone moving nearby means you can’t listen, maybe listen better? Idk.   If you don’t want to move, don’t move. Leave everyone else alone.
No, but reducing a complex cultural phenomenon down to a blanket assumption of lack of self control is a hilariously elitist take.
As orchestral musician, if someone in the audience is moving around so much that you can notice it from the stage, then they are probably annoying someone. I think it's well within the grasp of most people to gauge how much they can move without bothering anyone, and in any auditorium with adjoining seats, the answer is probably not all that much.
Not really. But hyperboles aweigh!
as an orchestra, if you're not twerking to my mozart, you don't deserve me
Someone would basically have to be jumping up and down or waving their arms over their head to be noticed from the stage. So unless they got stung by a bee, we probably wouldn’t notice. Maybe people can work on not bothering those around them, but maybe we can all work to not be bothered by those around us as long as they are staying out of our space. Maybe their leaning forward or backward (or even a little side to side 😱) isn’t as much about you as you think.
I feel sometimes people on this sub are so obsessed with demonstrating how "not elitist" they are that they ended up swinging the other way to being totally accepting and undiscerning about anything. Someone tapping their feet near me would 100% be irritating if I'm trying to pay attention.
>As an orchestral musician, I’d rather see an audience full of people enjoying themselves than an audience of people more concerned with others moving slightly than listening.  >Someone would basically have to be jumping up and down or waving their arms over their head to be noticed from the stage.  What are you even arguing here then?
I honestly think there is a significant minority of people subscribed to this sub solely for the seeking out of potential opportunities to use the words 'elitist' and/or 'gatekeeper.'
That if I looked out I’d rather see smiling people who might shift a bit in their seats than a lifeless oil painting of people far more concerned about the movements of themselves and others than about listening to the music.   The start of the second post was to highlight that no movement out of the ordinary would be distracting to us onstage. That doesn’t mean we wouldn’t see anything when we looked up during a rest for example. And I’d rather look up at an audience who looked comfortable and content than tense and nervous about moving.
Yeah. Plus in my experience these days classical music students are particularly insecure about it, and very keen to show their "man of the people" credentials.
There's also this online endemic notion of 'freedom' where endorsing any kind of self-control is seen as repression, rather than seeing how the absence of self-control could be repressing their neighbors (and obviously this goes to matters far beyond and more important than concertgoing etiquette).
A very intimate performance, with a relatively small chorus, and an organ sofly playing its flute stops. It's good, by I still prefer the more *bombastic* performance [from the Wissembourg recital of October, 2012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W86XH05Nk6g&list=PLcir3Bea-xLaiCuOYblSQ3Ki305gnFtwQ&index=43).
You're looking for Henry Raynor's "A Social History of Music" and its companion volume "Music and Society Since 1815".
Rock and metal, prog or not. Opeth, Pink Floyd, Porcupine Tree, Tool, Gojira, the big 4 of thrash, and many, many others. What are you favourite bands OP?  Personally I don't think there is any link between classical and rock / metal beyond simply the intensity and dramatic aspect of them.   Classical is a lot about harmony, while metal tends to be more about riffs and rhythm in a very narrow harmonic space (because harmony isn't the point). Of course this is not the case for all bands though.
Jazz (usually post bop, modal, hard bop, avant garde and free jazz), & death metal and math metal. Classical, jazz, and metal probably make up my top 3  I find correlation in the genres i listed for myself because all those genres tend to be more about the notes themselves, rather than production techniques that genres like hip hop and pop utilize. More production based music is awesome, but i just cant help but be drawn to note-y music. I need them notes man im an addict man im fiending for the notes
World folk/traditional music
I find a fast food burger nice, now and then, but I never try to equate that with fine dining. Both have their place..... I just wish the pop music would stay in its lane, as we find the fast food world seems to do OK without killing off everything else.
Rock, jazz, rap, hip hop, traditional music from various countries and/or cultures, pop, house, pretty much anything that gets me into a mood or a mindset, to me it's more about what it can move inside me than the genre.
Hard rock, jazz and instrumental metal. Not a fan of death metal lyrics and most screaming bands, so I dig Animals As Leaders, Sithu Aye, Intervals, and the like.
Jazz and rock, a little bit of Chinese classical too.
Film scores, electronic music (especially early), ragtime, library music, marches, jazz, some prog rock, some show-tunes, Tom Lehrer.
Tonight its Bugaku [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG9efSXLGDw&list=PLmg\_6Mv1NtA3G6TMaVt\_hDN2kzrQXh7fr&index=31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG9efSXLGDw&list=PLmg_6Mv1NtA3G6TMaVt_hDN2kzrQXh7fr&index=31)
80s punk rock, 70s/80s reggae, classic country, 90s hip-hop, salsa, funk, soul, blues...I like at least some music from most genres, but nothing grips me like classical does.
I like renaissance, medieval and baroque. In terms of modern genres I enjoy classic rock, folk and world music, as well as classic hard trance. I do not like metal. I also like Enya.
Folk. The other brother of classical music.
Jazz from ca. 1920 to 1975, more electronic music like Eurobeat, EDM and Techno like in Geometry dash, Rock by Eric Clapton, Robbie Williams or whoever, and many more, but I guess these are the most important. My guilty pleasure is Nightcore.
Folk and folk rock, prog rock / art rock, old-style light music along the lines of Edith Piaf and Jacques Brel. These might include: Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Strawbs, Pink Floyd, Steeleye Span, Paul Simon, Joan Baez, Janis Ian, Kate Bush, Son Lux, Koos du Plessis.
I like Opeth as well, but other than that, I'm more of a Be'lakor type of metalhead... I also dig Amorphis, Mors Principium Est, and a lot others like them... I love the chaotic and non-linear music pattern they have, but the feeling of grandeur strikes me only like classical music can
are you likening classical music to fine dining and popular music traditions to fast food in this analogy? if so, you are very misguided.

That's how AMC works. In short, AMC is currently for discovery and radio-style listening.

Fuck off condie.
Hey please don’t be nasty. I just wanted to share a nice article that I enjoyed.
She’s a war criminal who likes to hide behind playing piano. Her actions killed thousands of people but sure im nasty.
I wasn’t trying to get political. The article talks about some liberals too. Sorry to upset you!
I hate seeing people who fuck over the whole country be celebrated because they can talk about music. It’s a cover and fans of classical music should be aware of this and avoid allowing this kinda shit to happen. You can’t post an article about politicians without it being political.
I wonder what noted violinist and Beethoven interpreter Reinhard Heydrich thought about the music of Brahms...    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinhard_Heydrich
Have you ever thought that I, or others on this Reddit, might like her or the others mentioned in the article?
Why would you like Condelezza rice? Did you like the Iraq war?
The current wave of AI content generation is not really focusing on classical composition, as far as I know. The best place to look for this sort of thing is probably the more old-school-AI approach whose leading practitioner is David Cope. It turns out he does have a few Chopin-style mazurkas on YouTube; [here's one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXdVN-4Less) and you can search for others.
I practiced for a few hours at Rock and Roll San Diego when I was in town some time ago. I think I was in their Yellow Brick Road studio and they had an electric keyboard. It wasn’t ideal but if you’re just looking for some quick practice space it works.
I’m not always the biggest fan of vocal music but I do love choral music! Big fan of the children’s choir in St. Matthew’s Passion. Though I’d say I like a capella SATB the most, it’s such a deep and transcendent sound and it gives me goosebumps almost every time.
Verdi wrote a lot of nice choir sections in his operas I particularly like Va pensiero from Nabucco.
I love Britten’s choral music for children. Highly recommended
The best part of choirs is to sing in one. There is nothing like making beautiful sounds together. I directed a children’s choir and it was such a pleasure to see their faces when they get it altogether.
I do like choral music.  Christopher Tin is a great composer; he's done several albums inspired by world music, including The Drop That Contained the Sea and Calling All Dawns, he's done video game music like Baba Yetu for Civ IV and Sogno di Volare for Civ VI and the Offworld Trading Company soundtrack (though that's not choral), and most recently did an album with Voces8 called The Lost Birds.
I was a boy soprano in my Episcopal church choir as a kid.  Sang tenor for 27 years in one of the adult choirs at my current Episcopal church.  Would still be doing it now, but my voice decided to go kaput right before the pandemic.    😫
I been recently involved with my college choir, even if we suck i found some of the music amazing and beautifully written. [This is something that I really enjoyed](https://youtu.be/TbnT2leLv40)
Not a huge fan of children's choirs, but I have sung in choirs both amateur and professional all through my life. In fact, I'll be singing the Allegri "Miserere" this evening and the Sanders "Reproaches" tomorrow. I also compose choral music.  So yes, I do enjoy choral music. ;)
I’m a Puccini fan who really enjoys the children’s choral/solo roles in his operas.
I was in a Childrens choir from 4-9 grades. It was such a great experience! We toured all over the place and sang with pros. I dont consider myself an amazing singer but it taught me so much. And now those songs we sang have a permanent place in my heart so I love listening to choral music!
I think that choirs are a great thing for children and adults to participate in. Choral music is not where my main interests lie, but I still enjoy it.
Yes, but I am not a fan of the standard kiddie choir, preferring a trained boy choir (or trained girl choir) Through time, these church related choirs could be excellent, as the choristers had several rehearsals a week and regular Sunday services to sing. This done, for several years builds a repertoire, and music reading skills. It also allows a young person to more easily branch out to other musical instruments, because the rudiments of reading music have already been conquered.  School choirs often have too few performances and do not teach music reading skills.  It does not carry the same weight as a year in, year out regular rehearsals, regular performances.   My first exposure to singing was as a teen, in a very vibrant M&B choir in Washington DC. The same church also had an equally good girls choir, which sang, with the men section, for a different Sunday service (same music) Sadly when a new Rector came to power, he dismantled both choirs in favor of a mixed choir.  Seems several adult women were not happy that there was no place for them, even though very good mixed choirs were in walking distance of that church.    In America the whole topic of the unchanged boy's voice is sensitive. We push sports on our kids even though it often permanently damages their health, but are squeamish about boy's singing.   An additional aspect of having strong girls and boys choirs, is when they grow up they are more likely to support the musical arts, even if they no longer participate.
Ever since we started singing the carmina burana with school I've come to absolutely love choral music! I just love how much power you can get out of it
I love choral music! Maybe not so much children's choirs (although they are very good), but specifically British/European pro choirs like Tenebrae, Apollo5, i Fagiolini, The Sixteen, etc. I think the human voice is absolutely amazing and has such a variety of colors and textures.
The Lost Birds is such a fantastic recording, but anything with VOCES8 is always amazing.
Doing Children’s choir is so amazing! I wish it was a more popular activity.
Yes! I've cooled on his other stuff recently, but The Lost Birds is a joy.
Have you ever listened to [Wanda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZgD7Gf0q7g) [Landowska](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2FbbAUzCYA)?
There's the Peter Hurford boxset with the complete solo organ works. Around 30 CDs IIRC. Essential listening IMO.
Rejouissance from orchestral suite No 4, netherlands Bach society
I love this album of his [keyboard concertos](https://open.spotify.com/album/6bxFNJZroOJxL8MDwQpGnU?si=VvjFIW1tSFywrdtL-2rz4Q), Richard Egarr with Andrew Menze and the Academy of Ancient Music  also, [7 keyboard toccatas](https://open.spotify.com/album/0YMxkd02TvuWTPU83KHKM6?si=Y7TDNkk-RXKafeugyNRzxg), Pieter Jan-Belder  some harpsichord arrangements by Jean Rondeau, ["Imagine"](https://open.spotify.com/album/2egjtE3vU76habSWVusxQo?si=AT07Vi2bQw-S9ThAKhhssQ), highlights include the suite for solo violin in a minor, the Italian Concerto, and Brahms' left-handed transcription of the Chaconne in d minor   for harpsichord though Richard Egarr is my current favorite
I liked Janos Rolla for Concerti. He recorded 1052, 1054, 1056 and 1057. Incredible lift and levity. The tempi choices are closer to the harpsichord. Very different.  Lipatti recorded the 1052 with the Busoni and his own changes. Completely different from the Bach or the Lipatti you ever know. His Bach sounds like if you have never heard of Bach or Lipatti. More individualist and romantic, which is such a deviation from the urtext Lipatti.  Ritcher's Italian Concerto. He recorded several of them. You can see him maturing and shedding some of the young man's urgency. But his earliest recording of Italian is like a young man out of the gate and has everything to prove. Really fits the F major sound. I also like his WTC. Ritcher has a live of 1057 which I really liked and it is very close to Rolla's.
I feel[ marcele meyer](https://youtu.be/spHBTyagfZ4) recordings very expresive i think you might like it.
Gotta try Glen Gould if you haven't yet. He's polarizing,  but... you gotta try him.
No, I hadn't. I like her playing. I don't enjoy the sound of the instrument or the old recording, but I'm glad I heard this. Thanks.
On the younger/newer side, Vikingur Olafsson's Bach is compassionate and tender. A completely different side of the intellect and returning more to the emotional side of the Baroque period.
Yeah, Gould is Gould. Gotta respect him.
oh and! Vladmir de Pachmann's Bach. Really took to heart Bach's permission to invent dynamics and phrasing. De Pachmann is the symbol of freedom and his extremely romantic Bach basically embodies all of that.
how's my baby gonna sleep,
I Wish, I know that 🙂
Alex Ross has an axe to grind against him, because he *really* dislikes Yuja Wang, who is his girlfriend in what looks like a long-term relationship. Furthermore, Ross lives in LA and LA needs a new music director. He's afraid that if they choose Mäkelä then he would be cut off from the organization (Yuja Wang is distant to all of the establishment critics for reasons that are obvious (see below); compare her with, for example, Igor Levit) and he would lose a big source of his articles.  As for why Ross dislikes Yuja Wang: she made and continues to make establishment critics look bad. In 2016 Janet Malcolm (who was actually famous for her criticism of journalism) wrote a big profile piece on her for the New Yorker. In the first paragraph:  > In 2011, Mark Swed, the music critic of the L.A. Times, referring to the short and tight orange dress Yuja wore when she played Rachmaninoff’s Third Piano Concerto at the Hollywood Bowl, wrote that “had there been any less of it, the Bowl might have been forced to restrict admission to any music lover under 18 not accompanied by an adult.” Two years later, the New Criterion critic Jay Nordlinger characterized the “shorter-than-short red dress, barely covering her rear,” that Yuja wore for a Carnegie Hall recital as “stripper-wear.” Never has the relationship between what we see at a concert and what we hear come under such perplexing scrutiny.  This is the article that most new listeners drawn into classical by Yuja will come across. You can imagine what their first impression of music criticism will be. If you followed Ross long enough you would know the declining music journalism "industry" is a *really* sensitive issue for him. And Mark Swed is a dear friend to Ross, who defended Swed on multiple occasions.  TL;DR: His opinions on Mäkelä are compromised and should not be taken at face value.  Also, my personal opinion on Mäkelä echos what is already said in this thread: very interesting conductor who clearly knows what he wants, never on auto-pilot and never *boring* (how could Ross even say that). I always hear new things that I've never noticed before, though not in an exaggerated "look at this detail here" manner. I do wish sometimes he would speed things up a little bit.
Worked with him last season. Very impressive, no surprise he’s having so much success.
I think the last sentence there explains his reasoning. He favors a more diverse generation of classical music professionals, especially conductors, who traditionally have been white cis-hetero men. I am not saying his opinions are right or wrong, just stating my observations from his general oeuvre of criticism and the demographics of the people in those criticisms. In line with his apparent views, he has an aversion towards Makela.  I actually do like Makela quite a bit, including his latest album, but I don't know anything about anything so take that recommendation with a grain of salt. I think his Shosty 7 interpretation is a highlight: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB3zR\_X25UU&t=906s&pp=ygUGbWFrZWxh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB3zR_X25UU&t=906s&pp=ygUGbWFrZWxh)
  I haven't  heard  either of his two recordings of the Sibelius symphonies an Stravinsky ballets, but he appears to be an exceptional podium talent .  And if Dave Hurwitz pans a recording, it's a virtual recommendation for me !     Makela wouldn't have gotten his posts in Oslo, Paris and the upcoming one in Amsterdam  without making a highly favorable impression on those orchestras .        Contrary to popular belief, a. young conductor will never be able to make a big career by being  being handsome and glamorous .   No amount of slick publicity can make a big career for a conductor .   If you lack the enormous talent required to be an eminent conductor , you will never get anywhere .   Orchestral. musicians can  tell whether you have the right stuff  virtually instantly at rehearsals .   They will never accept  an incompetent jerk or a mediocre one as music director .
He seems to have a tendency to choose tempi that are a little slower than most. Le Sacre plods a bit IMO.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFNdujSofjs  He does have his admirers!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxHz9CwfwXI
His interpretations are of course a bit lighter than the "old conductors" but they definitely have a lot of promise. I've loved pretty much every recording I've listened to.
Klaus 😍
Not a commentary on him musically, just kind of funny - there's a video on YouTube of him conducting the Frankfurt Radio Symphony in Shostakovich's *Symphony No. 7* that drew a *ton* of "oh, look, Shostakovich came back to conduct his own symphony, lol" comments:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB3zR_X25UU
Sorry but none of what you write shows Alex Ross “really dislikes Wang”. There are a lot of hops in your story that starts from “a completely different guy writes a misogynistic article” to “Ross opinions about Makela are compromised” which doesn’t actually follow each other.
Hmm to me it sounds like he has a musical criticism. I think he’d just say it if he had an agenda like that.
I've heard that Hurwitz was highly critical of Makela's Sibelius cycle. He did not like it, and I agree with him. One instance is that he put too much emphasis on strings and did not balance timbre overall, apparently.  EDIT: Sibelius symphony cycle
Maybe that's the fastest the orchestra could go with achieving perfect playing. I mean do you hear how precise and perfect that is? I much prefer this than miniscule imperfections in the intonation and tempo. That said it's a tad slow but so crisp. You can watch it at 1.25x and still hear the precision but at breakneck speed. I get it, this piece can be a rush and crazy but not every interpretation of it has to be. Perhaps ballet dancers would have a stronger opinion about the tempo.
Alex Ross is not going to go on Twitter and say "I hate Yuja Wang", is he? Take it what you will, but I've followed and observed him long enough to know what his relationships with various artists and other personalities in the industry are like. What he is doing is trying his best to prevent Mäkelä from going to LA Phil, which is now a main source of his articles.
I agree. First time hearing this, but I think this is one of the better Danse Sacrale recordings I've heard. I see many people complain that ending (the very last chord) of the Sacre is a little bit underwhelming, but it doesn't come across as such here at all.  Also, I read in an interview that Mäkelä is a big audiophile and listens to a lot of recordings, so he's very well aware of what's been done already.
Nuit d’étoiles is one of my all-time favourite songs!
I really like the second set of Fetes galantes for lower voices- Colloque sentimentale in particular.
How much does the sound of the used one bother you? If you didn’t have the new one to compare it to, would it bother you at all? If you decide to go with the used one, sure you take a look at the inside of the used piano before buying, make sure nothing is super noticeably out of place. Ideally it’d be best to have a piano tech take a look at it, but that’s not always possible.
You need to hire a seasoned piano technician, not people who just like pianos, but do not understand their innards. New pianos will often be using synthetic parts. Some are tested, some less so. Some are still in the experimental stage, some will be a great asset, some not. Also what you want in a piano sound needs to be more formalized. Most people will play a piano say, yes I like that one, and never delve deeper.  I bet you can purchase a new custom piano for nearly the same as the off the factory floor, but with your likes built in.  In some ways we are talking about the same ephemeral notions that one uses for buying a car.  But the piano world is not as big and a custom piano will often require very little change from the stock model. I bet most will have to do with the scaling of the string wire, how hard the felt hammers are, and a few other tweaks to the key touch.  All should be able to to be altered to make the best from the room you want the piano to live.  And yes that room can make or break the sound of a piano. Put a mediocre piano in a live and reflective large room, and it will sound far better than the best name brand piano in carpeted closet.
Alan Walker's incredibly detailed and insightful 3-part biography of Liszt, as well as his works on Chopin and others, provide a musical bridge from the 1830s right up to the present day, via Walker's remarks and the recordings of those who studied under Liszt.   One can learn so much about how to draw true music out of piano works and one's own life experiences from Walker's views.   Through his generous lessons over a long life, Liszt left a mighty legacy of pianistic and musical beauty that will live on forever.

No way, there was a rockstar Artemis Quartet. People will start yelling.  PS: my favourite recording of Große Fugue is the one by Artemis.
Jan Swafford, who is also a composer, has written outstanding biographies of Beethoven, Brahms and Charles Ives. His Brahms biography in particular completely altered my perception of him.  For example, I had previously thought of the teenage Brahms playing piano in Hamburg whorehouses as simply an amusing anecdote, but Swafford shows how extremely traumatizing the experience was for him, to the point that might have prevented him from seeking a traditional marital relationship. Similarly, I had always assumed that his relationship with Clara Schumann was simply a deep friendship, but Swafford brilliantly brings to life their very intense relationship that was likely never sexually consummated - they shared a powerful link, yet they were haunted by the ghost of Robert, who they both deeply loved. I have not yet read his new biography of Mozart, but I am sure it will be equally insightful.
Julian Budden's *Verdi* is a classic, and will also teach you a lot about the ups and downs of making opera in XIXth century Italy (and some of the same for Paris).
Shostakovich: A Life Remembered by Elizabeth Wilson. It's like a written documentary. Very neat way to tell an important and riveting story of a dissident genius composer.
Alan Walker’s three volume Liszt biography. Also his Chopin biography.
Sergei Rachmaninoff: A Lifetime in Music by Sergei Bertensson and Jay Leyda.
Bach music in the castle of heaven
Swafford's bios of Brahms and Beethoven are fantastic.  If you already are a Mahler-head, Fischer's biography is very good but if you are newer to his music, Mahler: The Symphonies by Floros, is essential.
>a dissident genius composer.  Shostakovich was never a dissident. Wilson's book makes that quite clear.

might not be a popular opinion. but really want to plug Robert Levin's mozart. Levin basically improvised all the repeats, all the cadenzas, as well as recorded them on historical instruments according to the decades. the chamber orchestra balance is very good for the concerti. and the sonatas are very intelligent.  He also did the same with beethoven concerti.  a very cerebral player. i don't think he is the most conventional player. but definitely trying to stay true to urtext/urspirit. it opens up new thoughts on the period and compositions.
100000% These recordings on the fortepiano are golden.
preach! but also his bach on the harpsichords. so intelligent
I know what I'm listening to the rest of the week.
Congrats! I'd talk to a tech regarding humidity. The one I just talked to said 40-60% is the range you want. Depends on where you live though, I'm in the Pacific Northwest so our air is usually fine for pianos. Everyone (salespeople and techs) I've asked the humidity question to hasn't been very concerned about it.
Congrats! Always dreamed about one of those but here they cost as much as a house lol
You one lucky happy person! I had to relinquish my old Petrof I grew up with, and took up a beautiful Yamaha grand in its stead. Two years in, I realised I couldn't keep up with the loan and settled for a 50 year old Kawai grand, which will need an additional €11k or so spent on it to replace the hammers and the strings. Still a beautiful instrument regardless of its currently metallic tone. So jealous of your purchase! Do it proud!
Is it NY or Hamburg made?
Now play Hammerklavier.
F*CK. I take it you are either a famous or semi-famous musician or, more likely, have a completely different career?    Especially when accompanied by the art work on the far wall…
Congrats my guy!
Union made, too!
Congrats! Best decision I have made too, truly changed my life.   I recommend getting a nice tunning hammer so you can have sweet sound bliss always on demand. Best Android app I have found for tunning my Model B is PianoMeter.
We were gonna get in the market for pianos and I’ve always loved pianos. How much did this one cost?
88 Plus 1 Voter Here! Lol That's Beautiful yo
Congratulations! I hope to upgrade my current one to a model b or d in two or three years.
Congrats! Thats a big move!
Od love to have a working piano as well
Congratulations! I am sure it will be loved and treasured.
So beautiful 🥹 I miss playing acoustic piano
Is that a Jiang on the wall? I only ask because I have one on the wall behind where my lovely 6'2" Kawai used to be before I lost it in the divorce.  So, if there is "anything else you need to do"...don't get stiffed in a divorce. Oh...and make sure you keep the paintings. :)
Wow, congrats!
It’s criminal how much they charge for Steinways
Looks like the piano that always wanted.
Congratulations, she's beautiful (feels like a she)
Congrats! She’s lovely!
Isn't it recommended to keep room humidity at 40%?  Feeding humidifier water is a real pain in the butt. And you have to change the filters too. And the fan noise. Never found a better way though. Most piano owners I know use the Sears type one the size of 2 and half banker boxes. 60% is high, you'd have to keep the thing constantly on during winter months to stay at 60.  Paying extra for a really good tuner is worth it. Someone who also restores pianos and plays is probably a good sign. So annoying when that one note is out of tune.  Keep the pedals oiled?  If you live in a flat, it's generally no playing after 9PM in NY at least.  I keep the lid closed, for fear of cat sleeping inside and mucking up the strings or something. And yeah, kitty (if you have one) will probably climb onto it walk on it and cat fur.  Time to start collecting those scores...  I dunno if it's new or restored, if it's restored, fun to look up the number to see when it was made, but you probably already know it, given the big investment.
I remember my brain breaking as a kid when I learned you have to water your piano
Where in the world can you get a house so cheap?  A house can buy many Steinways in my area.
A Bösendorfer Imperial (~300k) will get you a small apartment where I live lol
This would be a Hamburg. Glossy finish and rounded corners. The New York has a slightly matte finish and squared off corners.
yeah
Still gotta play scales and Hanon everyday!
I think my mom got this for around 80k, but I would have to ask her again for a specific price.
Steinways do make good instruments and they have a ton of patents and such- they are just not super fun to maintain and they have always spent a ton on marketing their products (and making sure major artists only touch their keys), so it seems like they are the best ones out there and worth their premium.   But I'd take a Seiler, Bosendorfer, Schimmel, Petrof, Mason-Hamelin, or Yamaha over Steinway any way. Bosendorfer, Bluthner, and Fazioli are superior (or on-par if you're comparing a hamburg large steinway model) , Schimmel/Seiler/MasonHamelin I'd say are on par.   (Yes, you can get some pretty opinionated views when chatting about the high-end piano market....my experience is being a piano tech (RPT) myself and working with a bunch of them who all have similar opinions of Steinway- they can be great instruments, but they come at a cost).
That's amazing! Those larger pianos do have such a brilliant sound.
Isnt d the concert Size?
My brain is currently breaking with the expression "water your piano"! Is this a dry climate thing? I would absolutely *never* think to do that
Similarly, I remember being so confused about having to put a Damp-It in my violin over the winter as a kid 😅
In my area it seems that one Steinway can buy the whole area
In Italy, you could buy a small house with the same amount of money
And practice 40 hours a day
Ya we recently looked at some and I was pretty surprised how big the price range was.
Thanks for your reply that’s very helpful!
Yamaha seems to be making a big push to get major artists playing its pianos. We’ve had them ship in pianos for non-Yamaha artists twice this season, at their own expense. I think I like the Steinway sound a little better, personally, but I’m not a pianist so I wouldn’t be able to compare their touch or anything, even if I did have a chance to play them.
I have a Schimmel at home and play a Petrof at church, and played a Bosendorfer and Steinways when I was in university. Your assessment rings true to me.
I agree but it's important to note that many brands offer multiple production lines of varying quality. Yamaha is the king of this... how many distinct piano tiers do they have, I dunno 7 or something? They have top-tier handmade piano production (CFX) all the way down to mass produced stuff (GH) and and then digitals too, which they also have a ton of tiers (avantgrand, p series, etc etc). So, brand comparison alone isn't apples to apples, you have to talk about models/lines. Schimmel also now has multiple tiers (konzert and academy is it?), etc.
I suppose that might indeed be the prestige fee type of thing originating from marketing... I'll try to listen to some. Although, I have a question: no matter how grand the grand piano (tried 96K€ once too), it sounds incredibly noisy at loud dynamics, so much that clarity is lost, and a clipping-type of quality is heard. All with my real ears on acoustic instruments...Are my ears wrong? Am I not supposed to play this loud? Is it normal? I really have heard less noise in recordings on YouTube with my crappy earbuds. So, is it an illusion or something that I'm having?
Ya we recently saw some Bosendorfers and schimmels in addition to Kawais and Yamahas. I was super impressed. I grew up with a yamaha which was great but have always thought highly of Steinways but I think that’s mostly the marketing talking haha. It’s just the brand I see the most.
Without fail!  There’s always somebody who jumps into a Steinway thread to plug other high-end makers.
And bass!
Yes!
Some pianos can come with humidifiers built in, that require you to add water through a tube under it every once in a while
lucky!
Are you talking 9’ piano? Because they’re designed to basically be as loud as possible in order to project into a 3,000 seat hall over a large orchestra. That requires a very very bright sound, in addition to just being loud, which might be what you’re experiencing
So you plan on getting a Concert Size Piano for your Home?? Havent heard that thats a thing
We added a Dampp Chaser system to our Schimmel grand. It cost under $1k, IIRC.
I mean, housing is inaccessible, but grand piano is something truly unimaginable, even ordinary uprights cost around 1/3 of a house.
What would be the ideal piano size for a home without sacrificing sound quality?
Yes!  My piano teacher has model D at home, and so does one of my pianist friends. D needs a much larger space.
That’s not really my area of expertise, but 6’ seem to be popular for general large living room type spaces.
We have a 7’ in our living room, which isn’t a huge room. That size is the sweet spot, I think.

All of the Beethoven piano sonatas are pretty cool
Pardon in advance if some are already listed.  Prokofiev Sonatas (especially 1-4) Prokofiev Toccata and Etude op.4/1  Shostakovich Preludes and Fugues op. 87 (esp. A-flat maj, A maj, D-flat maj and d minor)  Grieg and Sibelius Sonatas  Rachmaninov Preludes op 23/2+5 Rach moment musicaux in e minor  Rach Etudes op 39/9 and one of the d minor ones (can’t remember which, it has lot of of ostinato-like passages)  Alkan Etudes “En rhytme mollosique”, „Ouverture“ and “Le Festin d’Esope” Alkan Concerto + Symphony for solo piano   Ravel Toccata
Mozart piano sonatas
Here are my favorites:  Beethoven's Appasionata, Waldstein (esp. 3rd movement 😁), and the Pathetique.  For something more classy and suited for concerts, I recommend Chopin's 2nd Scherzo and his 1st and 3rd ballades, which I am currently working on right now. I also love Rachmaninoff and Debussy, so check them out!
prokofiev piano sonata no. 6 is great
As far as the piano sonata cycles of the 20th century, Prokofiev is the best. The third is the most popular,  but the greatest are the War Sonatas, # 6-8. The finale of the seventh Sonata is perhaps the most insane keyboard finale ever.  Prokofiev also wrote many other piano pieces both charming and intense.  In the latter category, check out his Toccata or Suggestion Diabolique.
Beethoven Piano Sonatas:  No. 23 (Appassionata)  No. 8 (Pathetique)  No. 21 (Waldstein)
Prokofiev Piano Sonata 8 is unbelievable!
Scriabin Sonata 6   Scriabin Sonata 7   Scriabin Sonata 8   Scriabin Sonata 9   Scriabin Sonata 10
Simple but enjoyable: Tchaikovsky "The Sick Doll" or Erik Satie's series of piano poems titled "Gymnopedies"  Medium but enjoyable: Beethoven Piano sonata No. 17, "The Tempest" - start with the third movement  More serious and less typical: Dmitri Shostakovich's 24 preludes  Serious and stupendous: the piano concertos!  Try one of the five concerti by Camille Saint-Saëns. Or one the five by Beethoven. Or one the two by Brahms. Or the one by Edvard Grieg. Or ...
Vivaldi- Vivaldi variation
I’m really not familiar with Beethoven sonatas. Is this a total outlier? I have to say I was shocked!
This is from beethoven's last sonata. As you aren't familiar with these, the best place to start would be Moonlight Sonata. Then Pathétique, Appassionata, Waldstein - all the great ones. Then you are ready for Hammerklavier and the last 3 sonatas.
I only really listen to classical so I like supporting idagio the company too. If you listen to multiple genres then I can see why it’s a harder choice
I thought that a better payout model for classical streams was one of the features of Primephonic when Apple Classical hadn't acquired it yet. Pity to hear that it has changed.
Are you certain this is the case? I remember changing the payment model to per second instead of per play was an advertised feature of Apple Music Classical.
I just bought another 3 albums last month. I hope I can stay in this simple old way as long as possible.
I don't feel bad about the "commercially very successful artist" getting "subsidized" (in our context Schiff is one of those anyway, though tbh I haven't heard of Arctic Monkeys), but this payment model seems like a basic failure to understand classical music: "tracks" have highly variable lengths. A concert-length Bruckner symphony might be divided into only four tracks while an opera recording has a new track after every couple of minutes of recititative or aria.
I loathe the pooling play counts approach model.  It’s worse than you think since entire genres like lo-fi exist to make short tracks that are interchangeably dull to create wallpaper and rack up play counts.  That aside…  Apple is probably in a somewhat challenging spot with regards to negotiations about payment models to artists… it’s not clear to me who dictates terms but I suspect it’s more on the labels.  And basically the labels will negotiate in a way that’s better for their primary income stream (eg not classical).  Since apple plays both sides (mainstream and classical) and wants all the catalogs, and most of those catalogs come from conglomerates that presumably have both sides, my guess is they are all negotiated under an umbrella deal that works similarly for both.  Again, I totally wish my subscription fees were divided among what I listen to.  I feel like Apple is big enough that they could strong arm labels somehow if they cared enough, but maybe they’re already in the middle of hundreds of long term licensing contracts…  IDAGIO theoretically has better leverage to negotiate payment model because they are, essentially, a dedicated premium luxury service and a “redundant”, higher-return income stream for segments of the catalogs of the big conglomerates.  I’m still subscribed to both, fwiw.
How does Spotify work in this regard?
All streaming services stiff the artists to varying degrees, just as a matter of course. Their entire business model hinges on them doing this.
I really got frustrated with Idagio, because of their small catalogue. If you only listen to mainstream recordings, that’s fine. But if you care about smaller labels, Idagio misses a lot (2m tracks vs 5m with the rest). When I had it a couple of years ago, it didn’t even have all Opera Rara recordings that were on Apple Music and Qobuz.   The payout model is another thing altogether. Now I am at an impossible crossroad:  - Stay with Apple to help convince them that classical is a thriving business, hoping for some kind of snowball effect (because it gets a lot of hype, it will attract more users, etc.)  - Going with Presto, which has all the advantages of Idagio and AMC, but with fair payout. It got booklets and it’s a classical only company I bought from already (and those albums are available to stream for free if you purchased them earlier).  I am not seeing myself go with Idagio again. For my particular taste (small labels, unknown artists and obscure composers) it hasn’t been great the both times I tried it (I used it in each instance for more then 6 months as my only service).  There’s another argument against Apple: it’s too cheap. It’s basically free if you have Apple One. My wife and I have Apple Music, Apple TV+, iCloud for only 23€/month for the both of us. Presto costs another €13. This is only possible because Apple uses its wealth to create cheaper offerings. That’s their right entirely, but I would have switched already if they costed the same. I already have AMC, prepaid for 9 more months. Paying again for Presto or Idagio is basically paying double.  If someone who uses Idagio could help me with this: how many performances of Chopin’s Polonaise-Fantaisie, Liszt Sonata or Bellini’s La Sonnambula (complete opera, not single arias) does it have? Not as criticism, just as a small sample comparison. M
Most of the artists I listen to are dead or retired. And some of them, like Karajan, ammased fortunes bigger than most pop stars (over $250 million euros). The concern is not really relevant unless you are worried about the labels and heirs making money or you have a fondness for relatively unknown artists.
I also really like IDAGIO; I've been using it for years. But ever since I heard about the Apple Music Classical launch, I'm just expecting Apple to eventually cannibalize them and I haaate that. They will definitely lose market share, although I hope that doesn't mean they just wither and die; maybe Spotify will acquire them to compete? Who knows. I already hate that Apple Music has made it so much harder to navigate iTunes and access music I actually own—I'm really not interested in switching. IDAGIO addressed all the complaints I always had about browsing classical music digitally, and they've amassed a fabulous catalogue. I'll be hanging on with them.  I'm absolutely not surprised to hear the artist compensation is so uneven, too, although I do hope other commenters are right that they addressed it before launching.
It all moved over to Apple's default licenses, which are not the same as the ones Primephonic had
> I remember changing the payment model to per second instead of per play was an advertised feature of Apple Music Classical.  I had the same thought but I realized I was confusing Apple Music Classical with [Presto Music](https://www.prestomusic.com/classical/articles/5143--announcement-presto-musics-streaming-service-is-finally-here), which has a per-second model, and was launched just a few weeks before Apple's app. Primephonic had a similar arrangement.  Apple Music Classical is really just Apple Music with better metadata. The streams come from the same source, and the classical library is available on on both apps. I don't think Apple has any intention of having two separate royalty models. If they make a change, I would expect it to affect all streams, not just classical.
Well, you can substitute Schiff with Patrick Cohen and Arctic Monkeys with Beyonce, Michael Jackson, or anyone else :) The story remains the same: artists with shorter songs and listeners who listen to many of their songs win at the expense of others. Classical is losing against Pop, Rap, R&B, Rock, not because it's less popular, but because the payout method is absurd. The individual winners/losers don't matter too much imo.  And, any music on Apple Music Classical competes against all other music on Apple Music. So I think it's more than just a Bruckner-Opera comparison. Artists playing Bruckner are probably effected more by popular genres than they are by opera ensembles/singers.
Same as apple music
So it's probably up to us as responsible consumers to choose the platform that stiffs them the least.  As someone who only needs a classical music streaming platform, I'm happy to stay with Idagio, although I did like the curators and educational features at Primephonic.
Can you expand? This model appeared as a response to piracy, so this sure is better as an iteration on what was there. Does it need improvements? Certainly. We've had the same model since the late '00s, which is ridiculous.
I mostly listen to usual suspects so smaller catalog is not much of a problem for me. And I just buy if I can't find something I really want to listen on Idagio or Youtube music. But I can definitely see how it's a big problem for you.  I'm currently using Presto too (on a free trial). It's nice. My problem with it is that it's album-based. You can't filter on works or recordings. Its big advantage is also including Jazz with quite good metadata.  On Idagio, Liszt sonata has recordings from 176 different pianists (many of them having multiple recordings).  La sonnambula has 9 different conductors. Chopin Polonaise 118.
To be clear, your tastes need to run into the *really* obscure for the Idagio catalogue to be inadequate.  I find it to be really deep, and I am always looking for new composers and repertoire that I haven't heard.
The performers want to make money though, they’re not dead.
Yes, I use Idagio every day and it's obviously created by classical nerds like me.  It's great.
That’s my fear too, Apple Music is a very tempting package now.
I sort of doubt Apple will cannibalise Idagio because they already gobbled up Primephonic. I think they probably got what they wanted there.  I like Idagio’s payment principles but I am with Apple because I like other genres too. I recognise streaming payments are miserable but I try to support artists by still buying albums I really like rather than just streaming.
>Classical is losing against Pop, Rap, R&B, Rock, not because it's less popular, but because the payout method is absurd.  Eh. Not exactly. Labels are aware of this, so they deliver 4 movements to streaming services as 20 separate tracks, rather than as 4.
Yup. The actual musicians definitely make exactly zero from any streams
Ah! The fact that it’s album based is a plus for me. And the fact that you can just contact support too. I give Apple until my subscription ends to do something about artist pay out, else I’m going with Presto even though the app isn’t as polished as Idagio or AMC.  As for the comparison: - Liszt Sonata: 488 - Polonaise-Fantaisie: 455 - Sonnambula: 17  I wonder what a careful comparison will point out.  Really difficult times for classical music lovers, but the pay per second thing is very important to me
Well, not necessarily. They have only 40% of the Apple/Qobuz catalogue (2.000.000 tracks vs 5.000.000 tracks). As OP showed: 100+ Liszt sonatas on Idagio vs 400+ on AMC, 100+ Polonaises-Fantaisie vs 400+. The chance that there is one that you like and that’s not on Idagio is just too large for me. If you are happy, that’s fine. But I came across it’s limitations too often to enjoy it.  That’s why I switched to Primephonic.
I listen mostly to Wagner. Furtwangler, Bohm, Solti, Karajan, Knappertsbusch, Flagstad, Nilsson, Modl, Melchior, Windgassen, London  - the great Wagnerians are all dead. Most of the living performers attempting Wagner - are not worth listening to. The exceptions like Meier and Jones, I support by buying their DVDs.
This is why I was drawn to Idagio, and why I've enjoyed using it so much. It's clearly made by folks who love classical music like me! I wasn't aware of the payment differences between Idagio and AMC, and I'm only now hearing about Presto. I'll trial it because I'm happy there is another option for classical and jazz, but I will probably still keep up with Idagio because I want them to survive. AMC is a behemoth.
Hmm does this happen really? There might be exceptions, but I almost never saw this (other than a few Bernstein Mahler recordings).   A quick check on AMC: Literally none of the albums on their new releases collection splits movements into separate tracks.  It’s also not a good solution, as it harms the user experience. Which is probably why they don’t do it.
Ah, you experience what is called reminiscence bias. Good for you. But that’s not the point being discussed here. The point is that the classical industry is basically subsidising popular music.
I'm only 33. Far too young to reminisce about pre and post war singers. Anybody who says that today we have a greater abundance of talented Wagner performers than we had in the 1930s to 1960s is - simply put - a moron. The entire fach class is completely dead, and the art of singing Wagner is lost to history. There are no heldentenors and Wagnerian sopranos anymore. Sometimes things do get worse as time goes on, the real bias is in the myth of progress.  As for the subsidization, opera is broken up into < 5 min tracks, same as pop music. So that is a moot point. If you choose to listen to some hack living conductor bore an audience to tears with half hour long Mahler movements, I daresay the compensation reflects the worth of the endeavour. 🧐
You’re… still… missing the point of this entire discussion.
Which is? Go ahead and bore me.
and there you showed your true face
You can see my gloriously green face on every post in my avatar. And yes, that's Wagner's hat on my head
How’d you get banned from a classical music discord in the first place…?
You said everything but why you were banned, and too be honest it must have been heinous for you to get banned from a classical music discord
Lol how'd you get kicked off the discord in the first place?
He said parallel fifths were the best harmonic motion and that orchestras should tune to 432 hZ.
he said mahler should be played without vibrato
[removed]
Shame!!
lucky he didn’t get the death penalty!
do you enjoy wagner by chance
Why would you post a swastika anywhere and expect no repercussions? This isn’t a new thing lol
how old are you?
Discord moderation team can wipe the entire server if some wonky stuff is being hosted there. So naturally you'll get banned from most servers for posting nazi stuff regardless of your views because they don't want their server to be removed by discord police. It's pointless to discuss whether it's wrong or not, it is what it is. The idea of posting swastika on a classical music server sounds crazy to me, next time you better think twice before doing something like that.
Never heard of him
Not a ban lol
r/whoosh
can't you just google this
Very cool, thanks for sharing!

Obvious answer is bruckner 8th finale!  I never fail to just stand up in my living room and dance like a monkey when i listen to this epic ending of the finale…
Tchai 1812 overture
I’ve been liking it. It’s super convenient and I particularly appreciate the easiness of finding different recordings on the same piece. The sound quality is quite good (although I consider Qobuz HiRes better… which is why we subscribe it besides Apple Music; Qobuz it also works flawlessly with our streaming system, a NAD C700, the limits of Apple on this are a drag!).      What I don’t like: we cannot search via catalogue number, no offline listening, only app for iOS (although manageable via iPad, there’s no way to use it with the Mac). The Apple Classic also has a lot to improve, specially on the curated lists… but if well done they will be a fantastic feature.

This was my review: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/12b84th/my\_review\_of\_apple\_music\_classical\_a\_welcome/
I tried it and I’m sticking to Idagio. Apple Music has the same features as idagio (also has a better search function when it comes to opus numbers). However, it feels more bloated and I think the extra recordings probably are not adding much… There is also not a windows app, which is unacceptable in my opinion.
Good insights. I didn’t realize the limits on sound quality!
Thanks!
Apple Music streams at Hi-Res Lossless... frankly this is already far above the detail perceptible to the human ear. Even lossless vs Hi-Res lossless is a wash. Any higher quality is just marketing.  Apple additionally has Dolby Atmos, which isn't necessarily better but is an additional option other platforms don't have.
The Apple Music sound quality, namely the Hi-Res Lossless, is very good. Using my iPhone or iPad via Bluetooth with good earplugs or headset I don’t notice much the difference to the Qobuz HiRes.   That said, I do indeed notice the better quality of Qobuz when using the streaming amplifier NAD (comparing either with Apple via Bluetooth or via AirPlay, this last providing higher quality than the former). Exactly because *I notice it* (no matter if people say that the differences are minimum) I am paying for that service. For me good music (in particular Classical) when at its best is a marvelous thing.  In all, I’d say that if you are budget concerned, Apple Music/Classic is a great streaming system. I’d definitely choose it as a solo provider since the quality is very good and the music catalogue is fantastic (re: Classical only surpassed by IDAGIO). I also think the Classical app will be improved in the future (namely the curated lists).  However, if you are able to pay for another service I’d also check IDAGIO for its catalogue (pros: size, data, booklets; cons: only classical music) or Qobuz for its HiRes (cons: no lyrics, smaller catalogue; pros: the best quality HiRes, booklets).   Finally, Presto Music (that can be subscribed for streaming or used to buy digital downloads) also has HiRes flac and provides several recordings that are not available in any main streaming apps (ex. Hyperion Records catalogue).
Yes, all the other Mozart concertos. You will likely enjoy the early Beethoven concertos (1 & 2)
For starters, Mozart wrote 20 others, each one as great as the next. The slow mvts of Nos. 20 and 23 are particularly beloved.
The second movement of Poulenc's concerto for two pianos
Slow movements of Mozart 15 and 20 are a good start.   Also, I’m just gonna throw this out there. Keep an open mind. Bartok Piano Concerto 3, 2nd movement.
Haydn’s piano concerti :)
Listen to Mozart’s 14 and 25.
But most of the praise is on 9, 17, 19-25, and 27.  I love the second movement of No. 22.
I love Bartok’s 3rd, last thing he composed. It has moments of great beauty, and may be a surprise to most people who associate Bartok with percussive difficult listening. It is among my favorite works, and sadly, rarely played and appreciated.  That said, I never thought to compare it to Mozart. Lol. Anyway, I am in your camp, as far as the beauty of this music is concerned.
Ravel’s Piano Concert in G has a gorgeous slow movement.  It has been compared to Mozart, but of course it still sounds like 20th century Ravel as well.
The Sibelius violin concerto is an all-time fave for me: [https://youtu.be/J0w0t4Qn6LY](https://youtu.be/J0w0t4Qn6LY)   For more Baroque try the Bach double, especially the 2nd movement: [https://youtu.be/ILKJcsET-NM?t=230](https://youtu.be/ILKJcsET-NM?t=230)   The first movement of Rimsky Korsakov's Scheherazade Suite has a very famous violin solo: [https://youtu.be/SQNymNaTr-Y?t=60](https://youtu.be/SQNymNaTr-Y?t=60)
forget an arrangement, listen to Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto  also throwing in Barber's violin concerto
The term you're looking for is "concerto".  [Gyula Dávid's concerto](https://youtu.be/0WOAaqVFsvM) is one of my faves. Bit of a lengthy orchestral intro but the solo starts around 0:50  You'd also probably enjoy [The Lark Ascending by Vaughan Williams](https://youtu.be/OLhpkvQLDt0)!
Listen to concerti. If you want emotional content go for the romantics. Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Brahms, Bruch, Tchaikovsky, Sibelius, etc.
Aside from what's been said, listen to the [Russian Dance](https://youtu.be/YyrlAYgHC3Q) from Swan Lake, in which the ballet temporarily turns into a violin concerto (don't confuse it with the Russian Dance from The Nutcracker).
Came here to say Sibelius
Pierrot lunaire- Schoenberg, Wozzeck- Berg should both be in public domain
If it's for playing, the 50 For the Future repertoire library has tons of contemporary quartets, all by living composers, in many styles, and the recordings and full scores are entirely free.  Not sure about public domain if you're hoping to use any of them in a video or somesuch, though.
Anything written before 1928 (in the US) or by an author who died before 1952 (in the EU) is in the public domain,  so there's quite a bit of avant-garde stuff there.   Good luck finding public domain *recordings* though. Just about every recording is under copyright unless you record it  yourself or get lucky and find a recording under a free license.
