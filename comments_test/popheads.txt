I just played “hover like a goddess” and it’s pretty incredible! She sounds great!! Can’t wait to hear more!
really wished No Control was included although i'm not surprised it wasn't (still think it's her best song!). love her performance of ur a stranger! I love how she goes all in with the screams and doesn't skirt around them.
Her voice is just wow
She’s so underrated!
Is Euphoria coming back?
I’ve been waiting for this song to be released for months. I love it so much.
Incredible song 😁😁😁
This rules! Billie in the prime of her persona. More features from her please
I may not be the biggest fan of his recent output.  But im glad Labirinth got his career revitalized.  Also hearing billie belt feels a bit weird, it fit in HTE, but here not so much.
season 3 starts filming in june i think i just read
Yh not really my style tbh but I love seeing Labrinth make music again

????????????
He was a little….corny on Jeopardy so…this checks out.
His voice is actually better than I would have expected, but the song has the same energy as the winning American Idol single from back in the day. Taylor Hicks is quaking that he couldn't record this.
I’m good thanks 🏃🏽‍♂️
THEE definition of a jump scare
what
Is there a reason people don’t like Simu Liu? The song is boring, but his voice sounds fine. Just curious if there’s something I’m missing.
Jeremy Renner, ha impact!
…Listen to This.
I'm so morbidly curious but can't listen at the moment. Can someone describe it?
huh 😭😭
Is this for One True Loves???
He's got a good voice! I was surprised when I first heard him sing
Name checks out....
Oops! All platitudes
WHAT????
There's room for everybody, let's just say that.
New Barbie soundtrack is wildin
Sooooo corny.
He’s homophobic. Do a dive into his reddit account. ~~He’s ugly too.~~
emotional christian pop ballad sung by someone who just came back from running a marathon. somewhere between james blunt and the climactic ballad from an off-broadway show based on a Meg Ryan movie.
Looked up his supposed homophobic comments aaaaaaand no, he’s not. Reading comprehension is super critical here.  And no, he’s not ugly. What a juvenile response. 🙄
What's his Reddit account?
You should write professional music reviews, this comment is art
He's not homophobic. He made some insinuations that  conversation therapy is a terrible practice and is not the answer to dealing with p*dophilia and said homophobic practices that used it is evidence of that, which is very misguided and potentially dangerous but he has never said anything directly homophobic. Not trying to simp over the guy but people easily lose nuance in this whole thing.  Edit: I don't know what his Reddit account is or if it's still active. I think you can easily find it though tbh.
thank you! i'm gathering all my dumb little reddit comments to send to pitchfork right now
Yeah, I found the comments you’re referring to. His explanations were a bit inelegant and I probably wouldn’t have used the p*dophilia and homosexuality comparison simply because of what we’re seeing right here on this thread: people being incapable of any sort of reading comprehension. He could have also been a bit more explicit in saying that homosexuality isn’t immoral and doesn’t require any mental health treatment, but ultimately I understand what he was saying.   Anyway, as both a gay man and a mental health provider, I agreed with his sentiment. Guess y’all can cancel me too. 🤷🏻‍♂️

Madonna probably has multiple examples, but an iconic one is the 'Like A Prayer' MV Pepsi fiasco.  In 1989, Pepsi signed a sponsorship with Madonna and debuted Like A Prayer in their [Pepsi commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lt09WGx16j8), broadcast to a 250M viewer audience during the 31st Grammy Awards. The very next day, she dropped the legendary [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79fzeNUqQbQ) on MTV, which featured various imagery including burning crosses. This leads to huge backlash from Christian groups calling for a boycott on Pepsi + it's subsidiaries (KFC/Taco Bell/Pizza Hut) for supporting her. It got so intense that the Vatican and the Pope himself tried to boycott Madonna's Blonde Ambition tour stop in Italy. Eventually Pepsi caved and cancelled the entire campaign, so the commercial really only aired once.  However, the free publicity for Madonna was unprecedented. MTV increased the rotation of the Like A Prayer video and launched not only the video but the accompanying album into massive public exposure and commercial success. And while Pepsi took heavy flak, in retrospect Madonna seemed to get the better end of it, as she got her song debut through the commercial plus she kept the $5 million advance after they cancelled their campaign.   It not only boosted perhaps her most famous song of her career, but it helped cement her legacy as one of pop's greatest business leaders and a very early example of the foundational pop superstar principle of free publicity through carefully crafted controversy.
I think one of the most obvious answers is Lana Del Rey’s SNL performance.   Regardless of what you think of the performance, or if she deserved the backlash, its insane how hard she (and the music) was dragged by just about every blog/music publication/person who could give an opinion through social media after the show.   Remarkable the longevity and success she has had since then. Its clear she recalibrated her pop career path after SNL - where peoples music careers have ended for far less (I.e Ashlee Simpson).
It wasn't career *ending*, but Dua Lipa was on the verge of becoming a laughing stock after that [green dress bad dancing video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bH7ZaBNeKcM) became a meme. Her management putting her in dance classes and making sure her *very next* [high profile performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Wyum8FwMtw) involved a (comparatively) complex choreography that she would nail was the absolute best way to cut that off at the knees, as well as becoming a moment for everyone to comment on how much she'd improved and how admirable it was.
Kanye West with MBDTF for sure. Not sure if he's getting out of this one tho lol
Vanessa Williams. After losing the Miss America crown due to the Penthouse nude scandal she was getting dropped left and right from everything. Then she came back with the songs The Right Stuff, Save the Best For Last, Colors of the Wind, etc. She ended up with a few Grammy noms and probably the most successful Miss America in general
Honestly, Raye taking her long awaited Independence into a #1 hit. 7 years in a label, not a single album out.
Tyler, The Creator. He had been banned from the UK for some of his lyrics on his mixtape Bastard, that he recorded when he was 18, and his lyrics had been criticised for using homophobic slurs. He releases Flower Boy which showed a lot of maturity and every release since has been of a very high standard while showing his growth both as an artist and as a person. I see him as an example of someone who made errors in judgement in the past but grew past them.
1. George Michael as stated in my post  2. The (Dixie) Chicks comes to mind for this one. I personally am happy with how they handled the situation but if they had chosen to not stand their ground things may have gone differently for them. Again happy with what they did but if they acted in preservation of their career it would have looked different.  3. Chris Brown and probably Kanye West. Not much to elaborate on these two.
This is an interesting topic!  One that came to mind for me was Cardi B, I remember people trying to use her stripper past against her but she took it in her stride and used it as her empowerment brand.  Doja Cat could have easily seen her career fall down the drain if she never addressed *those* Tinychat allegations. Luckily, she explained it and became more successful than ever with her Planet Her era.
Apparently Flume eating ass at burning man would’ve been a career ending move for him, but instead actually boosted his popularity
Megan Thee Stallion comes to mind. 👑
Mariah Carey and Glitter fiasco. It wasn’t necessarily career ending, but the respect the public had for her was down the drain. The movie wasn’t received well, and the album wasn’t considered good. On top of her mental health not being in the right place, and her attempts to be comedic with promoting loverboy didn’t go over well with the public. Instead they tried to portray her as being crazy lol. It also didn’t help that Tommy was trying to sabotage her, during that time period, and she was dealing with conflict with her family. She really had it rough.   Charmbracelet came afterwards and while it has some good songs, it once again wasn’t like any of the stuff the GP was used to from her. She had success ofc, but it wasn’t the same.   EMOM came out three years later and she had gained respect again. The music was better, her vocals were more impressive again, she was charting and created more hits. Her public perception massively improved again, and she got taken more seriously like she once was before.
How come nobody has mentioned Britney Spears, Blackout, and her breakdown?  That was the first example that came to mind for me
Ariana’s been mentioned a couple times already. But her spinning her whirlwind of a year in 2018, into a career peak is the defining example. Thank U, Next (single) was good enough, followed by 7 Rings and then the album itself, alongside the tour.   I think her dropping another album so quickly after Sweetener really pushed her to the next level. Before then she was one of the few major pop stars without a #1 and wasn’t taken as seriously, despite her consistent success.
Eminem playing into every controversy in the late 90s/early 2000s and basically putting up a middle finger to his critics instead of apologizing gained him a fanbase who appreciated his lack of filter, during a time where there was a huge backlash against censorship and an appreciation for figures willing to speak their mind. If he’d apologized and toned it down he wouldn’t have been nearly as successful
Not exactly a popheads-style band, but one that comes instantly to mind is Rick Allen from Def Leppard, who lost an arm in a car accident and then went on to continue drumming on Hysteria, their most commercially-successful album a year later.
The answer is always going to be Rebecca Black.
Does Miley Cyrus count? During the Bangerz era, the controversy of her new image was everywhere, and she kind of ran with it. Wrecking Ball was such a massive hit too.
it has to be kanye right? the vma taylor swift moment had him wildly panned and his comeback led to the most critically acclaimed album of the 2010’s and started a beef that’s kept him in the headlines
Ariana Grande turning donut-gate into the massively successful Dangerous Woman Era, taking the "bad girl" image and kinda running with it. Even it was mid 2010s, similar scandals have ruined other popstars careers.
While it's popular with the Weeknd's fans, his debut Kiss Land, following his acclaimed mixtapes, was a commercial flop.   According to the NYT Popcast I listened to, realizing his limitation of doing it on his own, he reached out to some higher ups at his label and eventually met Max Martin and jumped on the Ariana Grande record. From there he convinced Martin to work on his follow-up album and the two conjured up the smash single "Can't Feel My Face" and he hit super stardom.   A lot of artists would never recover from a debut commercial album flop, but The Weeknd was able to buck the trend.
Billie Joe Armstrong and his breakdown at the IHeart Radio Music Festival in 2012. He used that moment to get sober. And come back. Not only could that event end his career, he could've lost his life not too long after that.
Oooh interesting question!   1. Taylor Swift with Reputation and the whole snake thing.  2. I feel like Nicki has had a few weird/bad moments but she’s still top dog and her barbs love her  3. Morgan Wallen :/
Not exactly career ending. But Scooter buying Big Machine and subsequently getting Taylor’s master recordings, basically led to a massive domino effect. A domino effect that essentially cemented Taylor as the biggest artist of the century currently.   The re-recordings basically are a re-appreciation of Taylor’s old work. The re-records serve as a means to introduce others to her older eras as well. Tack on Folklore, Evermore, Midnights, and the Eras tour too, and you have a recipe for another massive career peak.
The 2020 incident SHOULD have ended Morgan Wallen's career. But here we are, two albums on the Hot 100 (the top 10, mind you) and the biggest "country" star at the moment.  Whatever people want to believe, that was a defining moment because his entire listening demographic shifted because of right-wings wanting to stick it to the people who were affected by his reckless, racist behavior. He may still have seen tons of success because he was big enough prior to it, but it has kept him on top.
Ariana Grande creating her best album (according to her fans) in the aftermath of the Manchester terrorist attack
An obvious one is the entire Taylor/Kanye/Kim drama. She talks about it in her doc, but it’s pretty wild to think of how many people have to be talking about something to trend on social media the way TaylorSwiftIsOverParty was trending online. I think the way she came back was a make or break moment for her, if she had almost ignored it and not used it as a centerpiece of her next body of work she could have really faded into the background. There were a lot of fans and non fans alike that turned their back on her, and using the motif as she did really piqued everyone’s interest. I mean the LWYMMD video had *a lot* of people talking and then that album launched her most successful tour to date when by all means she could have stayed stagnant OR even lost popularity after these moments.
Her career was never at risk of ending but Taylor dropping Folklore and Evermore part of the reason why Midnights has been such a massive success for her. It built up so much goodwill and then using that with the nostalgia of the re-records has been able to keep her one of the biggest artists if not the biggest artist in the world. Don’t get me wrong she wouldn’t have been completely irrelevant but she wouldn’t be as big
I don’t know the extent to which this applies but U2s major genre pivots at the start of the 90s and 00s feel relevant.  Rattle and Hum saw U2 getting a lot of flack, possibly enough to derail a rock band at the time (especially with how many 80s rock bands did not survive through the 90s change ups). People really did not like how far their Americana influence was going and the documentary made their stone faced politicking and perceived arrogance become a major distraction against U2, rather than just an acceptable facet of their sound. This made U2s complete reinvention in sound and personality for Achtung Baby seem incredibly drastic, which generated a lot of new interest and basically sustained U2 through the decade. The electronic dance music influence allowed them to “return to European music” in a way and the ironic, self aware personality really sold the change in a way that helped U2 commercially and in terms of reception   The pivot going into the 2000s was a lot less graceful but certainly it was a commercially good decision. Just like how the Americana sound wore thin, the heavy dance elements did not work as well on Pop and many of the lyrics on songs like The Playboy Mansion lacked the same spark as those on Achtung Baby. This led to All That You Can’t Leave Behind, which was basically a return to form album that turned U2 back into a stone faced, political band. Timing wise, it aligned well with a lot of political changes throughout the 2000s and it helped distance themselves from Pop, while still using Pop to show the severity of the reinvention
Does a Drag Queen musician count?  Alaska Thunderfuck 5000 could’ve had her whole career ended during All Stars 2 after her tantrum. Everyone sent her snake emojis and she expertly turned it into her brand  She was most likely Taylor Swift’s inspiration for having snakes in the LWYMMD video
Allie X leaves her dog in a hot car
Morgan Wallen  I hate that I love him
That's why Madonna is still around and some people don't get it, she could have ended her career multiple times with the amount of crazy things she's done before, but all of those things made her name even more powerful. All of the controversies she does today don't even come close to what she did one day.  I really don't see any pop star today who could do something like Erotica and the SEX book, Like a Prayer, Justify My Love, American Life, Truth or Dare, etc, and get out of those with the career intact.
Madonna career could have ended so quickly due to controversies but this just shows how smart of a business woman, Madonna really is
It's crazy to me the Grammys had a 250mil audience, now award shows are lucky if they break 1.5 mil💀
Holy shit the level of vitriol directed at her after that performance was insane. Was it a quiet news week or something, because it was EVERYWHERE and so brutal. It reminded me a lot of the Ashlee Simpson/SNL hoedown moment.
It helped that she killed it (in a good way, this time) a couple of weeks later on Letterman:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2FvYTi07VY
That performance was legendary. I wonder what other ones we would have gotten had Covid not happened.  She really did a full 180. Crazy.
I always wondered what happened from that first video!!  Looking back, that dance had some horrendous choreography. Most of it seems like she has no idea what she should be doing. At the worst parts, you can even see the professional dancers look just as bad because the choreography calls for… shoulder blade clashing, back hunching, and neck twisting. It also wasn’t a great dance to go with the outfit she was wearing. I’m glad she got out of that because everything since then has been wonderful from her.
I'm conflicted. I really hope we get another masterpiece from him. But I also believe he needs to make some true amends after his latest stunt. And he has not been known to make apologies.
I find her story really interesting! For the longest time I only recognized her from Ugly Betty and maybe some vague murmuring of scandal, but then You're Wrong About did a two part series a few years ago that was illuminating.
AND THEN she gets that amazing performance and heartfelt apology and triumphant walk and reinstatement as Miss America a few years ago! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrwF5FxGEOQ
I pray this happens with Normani but maybe that’s wishful thinking
If you'd said back in 2012 that by 2023 Kanye West would be a massive supporter of fascist bigots and Tyler The Creator would be a lot less of an edgelord, a lot of people would not have believed it. I'm proud of Tyler for that particular glow-up.
He's honestly one of the most intelligent and interesting artists out there. He has vast, encyclopedic knowledge of music history.
There’s a great podcast episode about The Chicks and their debacle, a lot of their response was the fact that they were overseas when they made the statement and didn’t know about Americans reactions for a little bit.
I'm curious about Brown. I never really listened to his stuff, as it isn't really my genre and also due to him being a piece of shit.   My impression is that he somehow has avoided major consequences for his actions, but has he really made something acclaimed and highly successful since he beat up Rihanna?
I think for Cardi B revealing she used to drug and rob men while she was a stripper was even more of a potential trainwreck for her career than just being a stripper, she managed to sidestep that though.
Log my lord I just looked that up and that was so bold of him. And her.
>Flume  I'd say eating ass at Burning Man would be not just expected, but mandatory.
What was her moment? Getting shot in the foot?
Mariah’s comeback with *We Belong Together* also gave her the most successful single of the entire decade lol. Out of the 7 full decades that billboard has been around (60s-2010s), Mariah had the biggest song in 2 of them
Looking back, I was a bad fan. I loved everything she had done.i remember watching her on TRL freaking out Carson daily with her "cheekyness" and I wrote her off.  Glitter was a punch line for late night and comedians all over. It was bad to be a fan of MC.
My favorite Mariah album is glitter lmao I’ve never watched the movie though, I think it being released on 9/11 made it out to be a bigger failure then it actually was.
I’m honestly not super sure of the timeline of events but Brittany didn’t really bounce back from that one did she? She had the whole conservatorship right?
Without Me leans into every single drama he was having at the time and turns it into an iconic song, perhaps his best.
Honestly, I wish we had an rapper like this today. That is polemic, and raises an middle finger to the critics. Not that they always are right, neither Eminem was, but it's just cool too see how much an artist can standy by his point and show both the critics bad side and his own bad side
Queen shit!!! Can’t wait to see her on tour soon 😍
I feel like when I talk to people about liking Miley they still envision Bangerz Miley even though it's been like a decade
Wrecking Ball video, the VMA performance with Robin Thicke, "Miley, what's good?"  So many artists would have disappeared after just one of these controversies.
yeah. bro fr released one of the best albums ever after a beef with taylor
i’m curious about this reality in which ariana licking a donut led her management team to be like “i guess it’s time for her bad girl/i’m grown now era”  like those two things did happen around the same time but it wasn’t that much of a rebrand for ari and i don’t think it was because of the donut 😂
I don't know if I'd say she "turned" donut-gate into that bad girl thing during DW but it's worth noting that the GP and *many* media outlets at the time were rapidly talking about what a diva she was with tons of fans saying she was so cold and snobby at fan-meets and stuff. She was straight up on a straight spiral to being a very hated popstar up until 2017, when the Manchester bombing happened, that almost instantly turned around what everyone thought of her, as fucked up as it is to say.
i feel liek that donut situation was literally nothing?
Genuine question, but was donut gate all that bad? I just remember people thinking it was gross and unsanitary, but I don’t feel like it was career ending bad.   But I think dangerous women era was more sensual and sexual Vs “bad girl” type.
Alask did the snake thing first 🐍
Somehow the controversy went around Morgan Wallen and landed on Marren Morris and Jason Aldean’s wife.  Edit - I mean that country chatter was more fired up by this spat an entire year later than Wallen’s literal slur.
It’s wild to me that he and Kelsea Ballerini are from the same area of Knoxville
Morgan Wallen is pop country and that Steve Earle quote rings true about Nashville machine pop country, “they’re just doing hip hop for white people that are scared of black people”. So of course it didn’t hurt his career.
How would a terrorist attack that she wasn’t responsible for have been a career-ender for her? Genuinely curious how you came to that conclusion
How could that event have been career ending for her? She and the other victims had literally everybody's sympathy and goodwill.
- LWYMMD could mean "Look What You Made Me Do", a track from *reputation* (2017) by Taylor Swift.  ---  ^[/u/zandeye](/u/zandeye) ^(can reply with "delete" to remove comment. |) ^[/r/songacronymbot](/r/songacronymbot) ^(for feedback.)
No I think it was Kim’s tweet about National Snake Day that inspired Taylor to embrace the snake motif.
If we’re talking drag queens, agreed on Alaska and would also throw in Jasmine Masters’ name!
I actually feel bad for her on this one. I think she’s stupid not cruel and really does love her dog.  Glad that all seemed to blow over fast and she learned her lesson but I’m sure some people still hate her.
Seek help
I don’t think people could do it today simply because in todays age people would NOT give up. Like there wasn’t social media back then so I feel things fettered out pretty quickly. Nowadays you can spam someone for free online as much as you want. And even get bots to do it.   Back then ignoring it as an artist was easy. Now if you try you’ll just get more comments and more comments demanding you speak on it if you try to just post like nothing happened.
I honestly can not see a single main pop girl to go on and release a book full of their naked pictures. And not just pictures, but actual erotic images like Madonna did with eating someone’s ass, hiking naked on a busy highway, fully deepthroating someone’s toe. She literally went like “So you think I’m a slut? Well yes I’m and I own it”  Her recent antics are nothing if you compare to what she used to do in the 80’s and 90’s, and you can say a lot about her nowadays but she was a force of nature back in the day, she was fearless. And it’s such a cliche to say, but without her, music business would be completely different now, especially for women.
What’s the controversy with Justify My Love?
There is a class of people, Madonna, Cher, Kardashian, Swift, JLo-- just for a few examples, who seem to be re-energized by controversy. There's a competing class like Selena and Beyonce who do the opposite-- controversies seem to melt and disappear around them even when they should be month long talking points
It truly was everywhere. It definitely helped put her name into the brain of the general public. Including me, even though I didn't actually look at the performance until I'd already become a fan. I sometimes wonder where she'd be if she hadn't done SNL.  It's still sad that she had to face so much hate at the very start of her career. It clearly affected her for a long time.
Thinkin bout the way she was
its even better when we remember that she used that same choreo (with some minor tweaks) and added it to her “dont start now” tour choreo in the beginning of the show, which made the audience scream every single night… she really turned it around and used it to her advantage
This reminded me that she was the final Desperate Housewife as well. “Scandalous” model, crooning songstress, comedic actress… what a career!
Which she mostly did for her mother apparently which makes me love her all the more for it. Vanessa *knew* the organization was essentially using her for clout and a great news story, but it meant the world to her mom. You even see it in the clip you posted where she says "especially my mother" and you can just see her mother beaming with pride and happiness and barely contained tears of joy
Y’all gotta let Normani go
If you remember what podcast it was I’d love to give that episode a listen :)
I mean she's a rapper, if you take everything rappers say literally most of them would literally be serial killers.
I think most people were smart enough to discern that while it wasn’t great, she was doing what she felt she had to do to get by. I’ve never been in that dire of a circumstance, but I’m not judging her for it tbh. I think a lot of people throwing stones have never been in that situation and don’t realize how scary and hard it can be, or the gendered aspect of it as well.  Plus, she never said she r*ped them from what I remember, she said she would drug them so she didn’t have to fuck them and then robbed them while they were knocked out.    I personally don’t see how it’s super different than JT from the City Girls stealing peoples credit card info, yet people praise her and call her a scammer…..okay? Lmao. Only difference is Cardi preyed on men’s horniness.
 .. How do I google this?
Yeah, a ton of people in “the hip hop community” sided with her shooter and came together to cast aspersions on her character. She also had a number of challenges in her personal life that could’ve easily taken her out of the industry.
Blackout was a low point commercially and personally for Britney, despite its current acclaim. Unlike a lot of the other scandals in this thread, Britney’s turmoil was mostly caused by other people, not her own misconduct. From her scumbag fame-seeking husband at the time Kevin Federline to her predatory family to the paparazzi hounding her everywhere she went. The level of vitriol aimed at her day after day, week after week in tabloids, on national news from ABC to CNN, on late night talk shows’ punchlines, etc. was unprecedented. It’s unfortunate but people literally thought Britney was going to die around the time of Blackout - let alone ever have a career again. Newspapers had [obituaries already drafted](https://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/ap-prepares-britney-spears-obit-article-1.343771) for her. South Park even made an entire episode chronicling how horrific she was treated by the public who once loved her. Blackout was her first album to not debut at #1, thanks to a last minute rule change by Billboard. Many reviewers tore the album apart for her personal life instead of actually focusing on how great the music was. Rolling Stone ran a cover story calling her “An American Tragedy.” Britney seemed to have fallen as intensely as she’d risen.   BUT… Blackout was beloved by fans for its quality and helped set her up for a massive comeback with her Circus era a year later. Circus was a huge era from its singles to its music videos to its tour (which was doing so well that they had to keep adding dates and even extended it to include an entire new leg of the tour). The album and singles did much better commercially than Blackout to the point that predictions for the first week sales increased significantly mid week and nearly doubled Blackout’s. The same media outlets attacking Britney a year prior were now singing her praises and calling it an incredible comeback.  With all that said, Britney’s massive comeback with Circus was enabled by the corrupt, self-serving, exploitative, and abusive conservatorship. So, like you alluded to, there is an unfortunate and tragic side attached to her career resurgence.
Yep, pointing out that media figures who were attacking him would be irrelevant without him. But I think Stan is pretty easily his best song
Too bad it didn't work a second time with pablo
I think and hope that it turned her around too — and not for the sake of image. I remember the diva accusations, particularly when Ariana was being carried around by her bodyguard. I especially remember Jeanette McCurdy’s shorts on YouTube that blatantly spoofed Ariana and painted her as stuck-up. After the attack, succeeded by Mac Miller’s passing, I think anyone would have a shift in character.
tbh I'm biased and also thought nothing of it but the anti American comment was apparently bad enough to get her gig at the white house canceled so I guess I'm not in the circle that cared ☠️
My boomer mother will never forget that she followed the donut lick with “I hate America”
It was basically a trashy tabloid story.   Tumblr discourse that was either "this sucks for the employees" or "they shouldn't have donuts out in licking range"  People were mad at the "I hate america" comment because they assumed she was Mexican lmao
Hey girls my name’s Alaska, I got a tiny little question to ask ya.
Because they're women and women (especially Maren in this case) will always face more consequences.
Same. She's 1000x the person he will ever be but country music is more forgiving to the man. Shocker.
did we miss the “traumatizing and enough to quit the industry for good part” or are we just a bit slow 👀. Anyways, something like that is INCREDIBLY traumatizing, could you imagine how much guilt she had to deal with on top of people throwing the “it’s your fault that Mac died” allegations around at her despite him overdosing. I personally don’t think I’d be able to make a comeback, could you?
You can't be serious. That shit is traumatizing and enough to make an artist quit the industry for good.
Trauma.
That only inspired people to start sending snake emojis to celebrities. Alaska is the first person to own it and use it. Taylor did it a year after Alaska did.
She really took the “meme queen” angle and completely owned it. I love Jasmine Masters
I’m surprised how at least on Twitter she was able to come out of it relatively unscathed, that statement was just worded perfectly and was really honest, and then everyone just started dragging that guy for promoting his music 😂 I think you’re right tho, stupid, not cruel. It’s clear she loves that dog.
You're forgetting how slow the news cycle was though. This was pre-24hr news cycle and therefore new stories stayed around for weeks longer than they do now
The video was considered soft-porn and was banned from airing, so she decided to release it as a video single, the first of its kind in US, and the song went on to be another number one hit and the best selling video single of all time.
She also has a daughter that is just as beautiful if not more talented than her. One half of Lion Babe. Such a strong performer, really absolute magnetic. Energy for days.
I’m unfortunately starting to. Maybe keeping expectations low will help mend it
Absolutely! I didn’t want to just share it in case you weren’t interested, [Here](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2c0QS31WFPITICkPnBSa5L?si=JGOzkbVFT3SKtCXYg3dl-A) is the link. It’s quite interesting, but gives a lot of great context to the situation since I was only like 4 when the incident happened.
It's called "you're wrong about" They also go through jessica simpson's book and a bunch of women from the 80's and 90's who were essentially canceled before canceling was a thing and help rehabilitate their image outside of the misogynist 90's
Drugging people until they're unconscious is absolutely worse than stealing a credit card. I cannot believe this has to be stated.
"flume eating ass"
Damn I’m in such a bubble I thought most everyone was on her side. Popheads is a nice bubble to be in sometimes.
Eh I guess that fits. She was the victim so I don’t really see that being career ending for her. There were more people sided with her than against her by all accounts
Thank you for all the context! I’m going to add blackout to my need to listen list.
Pablo was a huge album at the time, I think it was the first album to go platinum entirely off of streams.
That is true. Though the good thing about news is you could dismiss it easily. I just can’t imagine my social media being filled with comments and thousands of replies to my messages for an extended duration. Or really any duration.
Hardly. The 24 hour news cycle was started by CNN, which went on the air in 1980.
That’s your opinion and I respect it. I just don’t see it as worse then the other.   Both had money stolen from them without consent at the end of the day.
Yeah I ended up biting the bullet and doing so lol
Hm. 🤔 I don’t think victimhood precludes her career from ending due to backlash from would be collaborators.   Sure the general public might’ve agreed that the situation was absurd (and I saw tons of people who don’t agree with that sentiment) but we also aren’t winning her features, brand endorsements, or producing her albums. There’s no shortage of victim blamers in the entertainment industry.
Oh my sweet summer child. You must not have been online then.
There were so many people (probably mostly on the internet) talking about how she lied. If her shorter hadn’t been convicted she probably would have gone down as “that girl who lied” too (even though that wouldn’t have meant she lied, just that there wasn’t enough evidence to convict).
You’re welcome! :)  Even though it was such a dark time in her life, “Blackout” is now considered Britney’s best album. She was also very hands-on with it and it’s her only album that she was the executive producer of. The songs themselves were largely produced by Timbaland’s protege Danja. Many popstars then and now have praised the album including Rihanna, Beyoncé, Charli XCX, Tinashe, HAIM, Julia Michaels, and more. I hope that you will enjoy it too, once you get the chance to listen it.
Is that a feat in itself you think? Or more of just a sign of the times and timing being just right in terms of digital streaming? Not being critical lol, just curious because I didn’t know this!
One will only result in lost money, one can result in permanent damage, addiction, or death. Jamie Foxx almost died from being drugged and suffered mental health issues for years. DMX battled addiction for decades and eventually died from it after someone laced his joint. Ketamine WILL kill you if you’re on one of many common medications while taking it. Like the fuck is this brain dead take
Imagine being this brain dead. Yikes take.
She also said she would seduce the men first, so drugging them in what they think is a sexual situation is also SA.
>>Hm. 🤔 I don’t think victimhood precludes her career from ending due to backlash from would be collaborators.  Who would that be? I’m not saying it wasn’t hurtful to her personally, but I don’t think she’d work with those people anyway. Maybe Drake but that hurt his already downward spiral more than her.   >>Sure the general public might’ve agreed that the situation was absurd (and I saw tons of people who don’t agree with that sentiment) but we also aren’t winning her features, brand endorsements, or producing her albums. There’s no shortage of victim blamers in the entertainment industry.  I do agree but I haven’t send anyone drop her because of the situation. Maybe she won’t get new deals but I doubt that too.
I was right here, and on Twitter lol. I’m sure the losers at Shaderoom were talking mess but they aren’t important lol.   Like I said I know there was hate but it really mainly from the Rap community and they aren’t huge. I’m not saying it wasn’t hurtful for her but there were far more people sympathetic to her than against her and for Tory. I don’t think that’s green me being out of touch, just it’s clear the public was right with backing her lol.
Her “shorter” is quite the typo for this convo!!!! 🤭
i thought i was a britney fan…  do you have a blog or something bc i would love to read it 😂
At the time it absolutely was a feat, especially since it was originally exclusively released on tidal and pirated a ridiculous amount of times because of it. The hype around that album was insane, I’ve never seen anything like it before or since
LMAOOOOOO
Here's some movie-related mess.  This past week, it was announced that historical drama *Jeanne du Barry* would open the 2023 Cannes Film Festival, which attracted controversy in some online circles due to it being Johnny Depp's first starring role since the Amber Heard lawsuit. The film, intended as a comeback vehicle for him, is directed by Cannes regular Maïwenn, who stars opposite Depp; he plays king Louis XV and she plays his lover, the titular character.  Now [Maïwenn is being sued for physically assaulting a journalist](https://www.indiewire.com/2023/04/maiwenn-director-sued-for-assault-johnny-depp-1234826747/) who alleges that back in February, she approached him at a Paris restaurant, pulled his hair and spat on his face before storming off.  There are also reports of persistent conflict between Depp and Maïwenn on set:  >Depp’s co-star Bernard Montiel said on the French talk show “Don’t Touch My TV Set!” that the actor frequently clashed with Maïwenn on set.  >“I’ve heard some noise from the shoot, very serious stuff,” Montiel said. “So, [Depp is] an excellent actor, when he comes on set, except sometimes at six in the morning the crew is ready, and nobody turns up. So of course, Maïwenn, who is the director, gets angry, and the next day she’s the one who doesn’t turn up. And you’ve got Johnny Depp, and she’s not there… It’s finished, over this week, [but] it’s going very, very badly. They don’t get on at all; they’re screaming at each other the whole time.”  Yet more proof of why Depp's career was in shambles even before the Amber Heard trial. It's not looking good for this film.  Hey Thierry Fremaux, there's still time to correct this and spare your festival of this drama before the official lineups are announced.
Euphoria S3 will start filming in June and the season is reportedly set 5 years after S2. I'm confused since they never even graduated from high school 😭😭

The sequel movie's US box office has also reached the dubious milestone of the first movie's opening weekend this week $53 million. It's already looking like the movie will barely earn back its budget of $110 to $125 million.

It's so wild, because even after everything, there's still a pretty simple path for Depp to rebuild his acting career--do a couple European movies and don't cause any drama on set, and from there, smaller American films will probably be interested if he's willing to work at a discount. And after a few of those without drama, bigger American studios will probably be willing to play ball again. But he can't even handle the very first step of that plan.
You don’t understand, the more aggressive or abusive an actor or a director is, the higher chance their movie gets a good spot or they’ll win a lifetime award at a European film festival. (Talking as a European myself.)
Isn’t he exhausted from being such an asshole all the time?
Bold of you to assume any of them (aside from Lexi) would graduate lmao
Their University of Phoenix plot line 😍
I wonder how this would work out considering the shows whole aesthetic is high schoolers doing the most bat shit crazy stuff.
Honestly the show should’ve just taken place at a local community college in the first place
Not trying to be a hater, but I genuinely wonder how they will salvage any potential storylines for Season 3 because Sam genuinely wrecked every single character except for Rue over the course of Season 2

Of course he was cruising, for him sex was illegal for over 300 years.
I think you mean 25 years 😭😭
For any popheads who weren’t raised Catholic this is really not a surprising statement, and is in fact the baseline of catholic theology in regards to sex.  The church would consider itself “sex positive,” just under a wildly different interpretation of what sex positive means
sex is a beautiful thing for a pope like me to have - but I have it
Did he happen to mention the age limits of the sexual partners??

I would die, MUNA is a 10/10 with absolutely no skips so a deluxe version would be amazing   Total aside but I love the branding of “the greatest band in the world” it makes me smile every time i see it. They are right and they should say it!!!
Hopefully!  I believe Amber/The Japanese House confirmed there's a MUNA collab on their next album, so if that album could materialise soon... that'd be great thx.
I mean as long as she gets her cut of the money at the end of the day, I doubt she cares. She still has writing credit anyway, so
That’s a weird reason
As a younger fan I’m so excited to see Sutton!
Almost makes up for it being 4 episodes long. *Almost*
I honestly thought Shazam 2 was as good as the first one, but at the same time had no desire to watch it again even tho I’ve seen the first one a few times. Doesn’t help that Black Adam was *awful*, but it’s still surprising to see a DC movie flop this hard at the box office. People were calling Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania a flop but that still made half a billion dollars, Shazam 2 not even making back its budget is wild
>It's already looking like the movie will barely earn back its budget of $110 to $125 million.  From what /r/boxoffice says, listed budgets are usually only production budgets and don't take into what will be spent on advertising costs, so that 125m still wouldn't be enough to break even because I'm sure they spent a *lot* on ad space trying to get it off the ground.
I’m trying to watch the Super Mario Bros movie but every screening is full of kids 💀
Here’s hoping we find ourselves with a less predictable outcome as the previous three films. The changing hands of directors and writers really made a mess of things. After the way they handled Finns story line it’s left a bad taste in my mouth.
I don't understand why Daisy is coming back. Disney didn't protect her at all during the sequel trilogy and not all the money in the world is worth being harrassed by middle aged sexist fans every day.  Also I expect this movie to be bland as hell.
The Rise of Skywalker genuinely killed any interest I had in her as a character and made me step back from SW as a whole tbh. Good luck to her, but I wish the franchise would explore other characters and timelines beyond the Skywalker saga in the films.  ETA: I think they should've waited a little while longer to being Rey back into the picture, too.
I'm hyped. Hopefully those weirdos won't bully her this time. Wish they could also get John back too. He did said he is done with star wars but maybe he will come back if they offer him more money
What an interesting choice.
As a person with over 100 Miss You scrobbles I feel allowed to wonder if it's really due to low sales without it being too shady.
i mean, i could picture it working if they just moved the setting from high school to college ~~which the show shouldve started at to begin with~~ but if theyre skipping right over those years? i have no clue either
even rue has the drug storyline that was never resolved >!the one where she got drugs from a drug leader and then lost it all. with how threatening the drug dealer was, i don't see how rue got away from the situation unless she's stuck with the drug dealer during those 5 years!<
It pains me when people get upset at gay people for crusing in the past. It was literally a safer way for gay people to have sex than in their own homes because peoples neighbors would report them.   It also sucks how common it was for cops to entrap gay men. Some of the cops would go as far as actually engaging in sex and then arresting the person. The amount of self hate those people must live with.
Oops thanks for the correcting. Tracy Chapman was 35 years ago and I slipped up because just posted about that the other day. I corrected it.  Thank you!
yup, full idea would be "sex -inside of an heterosexual catholic marriage with the sole purpose of procreation- is beautiful". For them sex is only positive  under those circumstances
I was gonna say…. Not really surprising. He probably just didn’t mention the caveats about marriage and it being with a heterosexual partner, blah blah blah.
Underrated comment  Edit: Wait who is the pope having sex with

Her fans are mostly annoyed cause the collab can’t get nominated for a Grammy now.
I mean the song is called never felt so alone. So I do see how a (ft. Billie Eilish) would clash thematically. As long as she’s still getting a check for her work!
that's for League of Their Own not Maisel, I was confused for a sec haha
Its only four episodes! Oh wtf I didn't know that. Oh pain.  Edit googled it theres 9 episodes. We're good.
not to be overly cynical but i really hope this signals a slowing down of the overwhelming flood of nothing but superhero movies
Yeah usually people looking at whether or not movies are profitable use the quick "double the budget to account for the marketing costs" trick so that would mean it had to earn $220-$250 million to break even
go late if you can. My theatre had 9pm showings and it was only teens/adults.
Go to a late night showing on a weekday
> The Rise of Skywalker genuinely killed any interest I had in her as a character and made me step back from SW as a whole tbh.  Yep. They just didn't know how to balance making satisfying endings for all characters, including Kylo Ren/Ben and Finn; they focused too much on Rey, did a poor job at that anyway, and now here we are. I feel like if they at least had Rian Johnson finish what he started with The Last Jedi, the whole thing would have been more satisfying, because it seems no one knew what to do following the twists and turns he had in that film. It really sucks; I thought they had a good thing going after the first two sequels and then they messed it up royally.
They still bully her. I'm no sequel fan but it's ridiculous how fans still talk shit about Daisy and Rey to this day. I see SW fan accs on my feed all the time and when the sequels are even alluded to, the comments say "Finn/John deserved better" (absolutely true) and a whole bunch of Rey slander vaguely aimed at women in general.  On John's side, I wouldn't be surprised if he's done for good. They (both official creators and fans) took one of his life's passions and destroyed it. Besides Finn being pathetically written out of a lead role, Reylos (particularly white women) \*are extremely racist and harrassed him endlessly when he joked about the ship once.  After both creators and consumers generated such a mess with the sequels, I'm shocked they're even going back to that era.
I saw someone say that they marked the tickets as unavailable/sold out because they knew they were gonna cancel. That just looked like one of his fans though so idk the source, but it does seem unusual he hasn’t personally commented on it yet  Edit: he [tweeted](https://twitter.com/Louis_Tomlinson/status/1644452053115183110?s=20) an apology
I'd guess it's mostly just the same financial/logistical issues that everybody else in the touring industry is dealing with right now? Non-American tours can be hard to turn a profit on to begin with because of the costs associated with traveling between countries. And I imagine with shipping costs being crazy right now, that hits Asian tours extra hard because it's so big.
I think it is not, almost all shows were completely sold out and two had low availability. I know that US leg doesn't look good, but this wasn't the case in Asia.
>!They could have just mentioned that "Rue's mom paid the money" and the plot would have been resolved. Her mom managed to pay off the dad's cancer treatment bills so it doesn't sound like a stretch that in five years she managed to be financially stable again and could afford to pay $10k. !<
Cruising is literally and legimately gay culture. If you're gay/bi you should do it at least once as to honor your ancestors. ~~unless if you're ace which you're honoring  those who didn't~~
Would change “for the sole purpose of procreation” to “while never being closed from the possibility of life / being open to life” to make it more accurate.
eh i feel like if the submitted it, the grammys would allow it
😒 jfc
It’s good to see somebody learned a lesson from ‘ME! (ft. Brendon Urie of Panic At The Disco)’.
I guess the issue is, it might cause wb to cut hbo or adult swim's budget in response.
Racist Reylo literally *still* are trying to ruin his career   It was wild seeing the racist fans of both genders being why Daisy had to disable comments on posts she had of John on Instagram once.   Genuinely wish her good luck and a big check for going back to that fandom
I'm surprised too, there is only generic statement on his website. Louis always tweeted when thing like this happened, last time when he broke his arm in November and had to cancel few events. I don't know why he didn't say anything yet.
I respect the joke (300 years, that tweet by that gay guy) but I really like this point tbh liiiike  I think it's so easy for younger queer people to forget how much the world has changed in such a short amount of time and that the way queer people exist is informed by history like cruising, or cottaging as this more specifically is an example of.  And so like yeah the 300 years tweet was a bit dumb, but imo embracing straight culture's puritanical views on sex ain't it and maybe I should also go cruising sometime to honour my gay ancestors.
Omg not you encouraging people to cruse in this day and age 💀💀💀  I think it’s really hot and love hearing my friends stories but I couldn’t full on cruse. I’ve had sex in the bathroom at bars but an entire stranger would make me sooo nervous.
not as egregious but "Airplanes (feat. Hayley Williams of Paramore)" always irked me too
ooh yeah that wouldn’t be good
Yeah I'm going to edit that "were" to "are" because you're totally right. I love Star Wars but the community is horrifically bigoted. They haven't learned anything, seeing how John and Moses Ingram are still treated in the fandom as well.
Yes he seems to use twitter a lot so it’s weird. Tbf the language of that statement could imply low ticket sales, but can’t be sure.
Yeah, I'm only half joking but people didn't cruise back then because of the rush or because they were sex addicts. It was their only option and for a lot of people it still is, either if in your country it's legal or not to be gay, there's still a lot that goes against it.  Specially with how much the aid crisis took our people from us and their wisdom with. There's many people to explain how things worked before internet and grindr.
as a non-native english speaker: what exactly is cruising?
I may have done it once or twice but it was purely for historic reasons 🤭
I actually went down a little Wikipedia rabbit hole earlier about cottaging and arrests for “gross public indecency” and it was really interesting. Like seeing one of Laurence Olivier’s mentors be one of the people arrested for cottaging and him directly mentioning Ian McKellen (who I had the joy of seeing speak at my school) and Simon Callow as actors who could ‘come out’ like he never could - and who now themselves are able to see gay actors thriving openly more than they could.   One of the things that annoyed me was a contemporary comment about an MP who lost his career for being caught cottaging, with the paper’s view being “it’s not that it’s gay sex, it’s that it’s risky and dangerous sex unbecoming of an MP” and it’s like… but that was one of his only options, and that really sat with me because I’m very fortunate to live as I do in this time.  Also I ended up finding that actor I mentioned (John Gielgud) had an affair with James Lees-Milne who kept extensive biographies, and this the Wikipedia chain keeps going because James had been in love with this guy and was a close friend of his sister Diana after the guy died… and that Diana is Diana Mitford, infamous fascist and wife of the infamous fascist Oswald Mosley who Sam Claflin plays in Peaky Blinders
Crusing is when someone (gay men typically) go to a public place looking to have sex. There are signals like tapping your foot while in a stall to signal you are looking for sex. There are also just commonly known places to cruse like the 4 th floor of my schools library.   Gay men had to do this historically because it was illegal to have sex and it was safer than inviting someone over to your house where your neighbors might call the cops.
thank you for the explanation 😊

So happy for both of them! Well deserved. I hope we get more collabs as a result of this #1. They compliment one another beautifully.
Something to do with label issues perhaps? I’d be very surprised if Ellie’s team chose not to add it.
I feel like Ellie has the potential to have a #1 song and album!
They should have replaced that last deluxe track with “Miracle,” since that other song can’t be streamed as part of the album (at least on Apple Music US).
especially on zara & lizzy!!
I think ed popularity is dying he’s reaching that stage where no one cares about him anymore even though his music is still good
Agreed on everything except that his music is good
Oh so it's not just an edgier sound it's an edgier LOOK too... doing the eyeliner with the knife was fierce.
Criminally short…. Please can this trend die
That's all it takes to be "edgy" these days???💀☠️☠️
Idk what to tell you, it’s definitely edgier than Ralph’s other videos.
Sometimes, as a nation, we have good taste

Indifferent about the boygenius record, if I’m honest. Over the moon for De La Soul, though, 4 spots higher than it’s ‘89 peak, I think.
Did Chlöe not debut in the top 100 at all?
the morgan wallen erasure ugh i love it
Bury Tomorrow 💪
Yep, she’s not there at all unfortunately!
Compared to most country artists, he’s still performed very well in the UK somehow.
Cringe.   I like it
Like the song more now that the video dropped as expected. Still iffy on the song but thb I've been singing the chorus all day in my head so its growing on me.   As a fan of both Flamboyant & My Agenda I'm excited for whats to come 🎭  Edit:  going freak mode all weekend long
Very dumb and bad. I love it.
It’s a banger. I think the frat boy aesthetics are an interesting progression from the more online ones of the last cycle.
Very MSI   It's so discordant, I love it.
I love it!
I doubted them and I'm so sorry. Should've waited for the full song before judging
Regardless of the music, Dorian is always going to serve an epic music video.
it really is gorgeous the fashion the visuals the direction you can always trust this group of trust fund babies to live my dreams, i mean it <3
the girls not knowing what a boom box is... poetic cinema

The sparks fly is definitely AI  I think with how secretive Taylor is of her music (especially that she doesn’t play own songs on music video sets) i highly doubt she’d play enchanted TV that freely in a stadium with a lot dancers and stadium crew
I’d love it to be Taylor’s Version but I also think it’s quite possibly just a tour recording. Its LQ but still doesn’t sound like a studio mix
are these like final mixes? i heard the other snippet and they seemed... unfinished.
I'd assume its just vocals recorded for the tour.
Nathan Chapman backing vocals used to add something in her songs. Not hearing any male voice on ''these are the words i held back'', it doesn't hit the same as the original.
I KNEW she'd be releasing SN TV this year. I was right being cautious about the Grammys extending the elegebilty time for submissions. Couldn't be up to her.
Isn’t this AI? There are some pretty advanced AI Speak Now TV recordings out there
If it means we get more music from Taylor then I am all for it! I still do wish that she would release another single from Midnights though. Lover had three singles, why can't Midnights?
even if it's a tour recording they'd be using the rerecorded vocals. it might not be tv but it's damn close
Honestly wouldn’t be surprised. WANEGBT, 22, The Moment I Knew for example all sound super unfinished on Red Taylor Version so I wouldn’t be surprised.
Enchanted one feels like it kinda.
I can quite clearly hear a male voice singing behind her…
It actually has to do with the trademark.  It will be at least until May for her to announce it
The 32-second Enchanted one is real, it was posted by one of her dancers in rehearsal before they deleted it and UMG started striking any reuploads. All the others are fake.
Midnights had 3 singles (Anti-Hero, Bejeweled and Lavender Haze) and Lover had 4 singles (ME!, YNTC, Lover and The Man) actually.
- WANEGBT could mean "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together", a track from *Red* (2012) by Taylor Swift.  ---  ^[/u/mattysmwift](/u/mattysmwift) ^(can reply with "delete" to remove comment. |) ^[/r/songacronymbot](/r/songacronymbot) ^(for feedback.)
fr. that's the only strife i have with the rerecords. they're not as rich sounding.
You can’t put a 33 sec snippet on someone’s phone and compare it to full mixed edited produced final product tracks.
So it’s probably a rehearsal take then?
It was just the dancers rehearsing over the track, and there's male backing vocals that aren't in the tour version. She could've recorded a separate version just for rehearsal, but I don't know why she'd do that when it's the same timing.

Mere weeks after S Club 7 announced their comeback tour. Between that, and how devastatingly young he was, this is absolutely tragic news.
He's been struggling for years now but this is so unexpected, he was on Daily Mail on Wednesday doing a happy dance in the park now this :(
S Club 7 were a huge part of my childhood, and me and my sister have tickets for the tour. 46 is no age
S Club 7 were so freakin important to my childhood as an American. I wasn't allowed to listen to non christian music growing up and the loophole I had was the S Club 7 TV show Miami 7 and LA 7 which was my first outlet to "secular" music. Paul and Tina were my favorites too. I was really looking forward to the new reunion and tour so this is super hearbreaking.
I **gasped** when I saw it on BBC News. Sad day for British millenials, his family and the group. RIP
What terrible news. Rest in peace, Paul.💙
Chilling news. RIP Paul
I gasped so hard when I saw the IG post. I was going to see him for the first time in a few months... what. This is so sad. I hope his family and the members are doing well.
Oh this is so sad. He/the band were a huge part of my childhood. What a loss 😞
I can't believe it, I grew up with S Club 7 and Paul. I remember in my school dinner hall, they would play their music on a speaker. I'm devastated 💔😢😭
This is so shocking and particularly tragic with how well things had seemed to be going with the reunion. Rest In Peace Paul.
May he rest well.
This is so sad to hear. I have wonderful memories watching the S Club 7 shows on foxfamily in the late 90s. RIP
I'm heartbroken over this. I can't stop crying. S club/7 has been part of my entire life and has gotten me through such hard times.   I messaged him on FB years ago thinking he'd never answer me being such a big celebrity and was shocked when he did. We had full conversations and he even randomly wished me happy birthday. He was a truly a kind hearted soul and I will miss him terribly forever.   He was too good for this world, we didn't deserve his joy and peace. RIP Paul. :'(
Oh my gosh! He has been so open about his personal and financial struggles. It seemed like things were on the up with the new reunion tour. Poor guy deserved so much better! :-(
I’m thankful for the joy he brought to the world and I hope he will be at peace.
oh this got me, their music made me so happy as a child
Didn't the group just get back together though? This is really sad and it sucks so hard. RIP Paul. I'm sorry this happened. I will be thinking of his family and his band mates.
This is absolutely awful, that’s so young and they had just announced their reunion. :(
Totally devastating news!! 😭 S Club 7 were also a part of my childhood and I was so thrilled for the tour. I was rooting for him to get better physically and mentally. This is so sad 🤧💔
This is devastating news. He’s been open about his struggles since he the band split. The tour might have been a fresh lease of life for him. Tragically young to be taken 💔
S Club 7s first album was one of my first CDs. Huge part of my childhood. This is genuinely shocking.
I just gasped out loud. Wow.... I am truly sorry about this. They had JUST reunited too... poor dude. May he rest in peace :(
This is so sad. I don't think it's any secret that he'd had a fairly hard time of things since leaving S Club, but I was hoping that the comeback would give him a bit of a leg up. I loved the group growing up and still listen to them today, so he did achieve a lot with his life.
This is so sad. They were my first favorite group. RIP
DAMN. Right before the reunion tour.
46 is so young :(
Damn. I was just rewatching some random episodes. Was just seeing their reunion interview.  I don’t get hung up on age. But seeing all these celebs from my childhood getting married/passing away/starting families really makes me feel old.   Sending positive vibes to his fam and the members
May He rest well I can’t believe this news
I was just waking up when I read this. So tragic, especially knowing all the shit he’s been through over the years. And what’s even sadder is the rumour that he left the band in 2002 because of his horrible father.   I was going to London from Canada to finally see them live. Hopefully they still continue on with it but understandable if they don’t. I was really hoping to hear his part on Reach since it’s one of my favourites. RIP.
Gosh this is so sad, it’s really impacted me. S Club 7 were one of my introductions to pop music and one of my first concerts. For British millennials they were definitely a childhood-defining pop group. I remember buying their albums, watching their shows, and Paul was always one of my favourites. Rest in Power Paul, no longer need to reach for the stars, you’re there ❤️
Holy fuck this is heartbreaking.
RIP, so sad to hear that. 🙏 :(
This such a fucking bummer. I still listen to S Club 7 on a fairly regular basis. Pure nostalgia <3
This is really sad news. I love S Club 7… so many bangers and I’d have loved to see them all together. Paul was the one I had a crush on when I was younger, he was so handsome I always thought. RIP Paul
That’s very sad. A millenial from the Philippines here. We used to dance to their songs during school programs in my elementary days so they were a big part of our childhood. RIP Paul
Nooooo. This is so sad.
my heart is so broken. way too young to die. 😔😔i so regretted not going to the UK for their 2015 tour and told my husband i’d walk over broken glass to get there this time. i got 10th row tickets and was so excited to go to london for the first time and to see them. i hope his loved ones and bandmates are okay.
This is terrible. They were just reuniting for a tour.
Oh no. No. Growing up is so sobering.  May he rest in peace.
I’m beyond sad.
What a shame 😔
I’m too scared to listen to Two In A Million without bawling my eyes out
Yeah didnt expect this.  I remember listening to these guys and the spice girls too.
First Sarah from Girls Aloud, now Paul 😢  Thank you for the good times, Paul.  Gonna go dig up my Miami 7 tapes now...
Wait what? I am speechless... rest in peace Paul 💙
Wow :( RIP Paul
I thought I was seeing things when I saw the headline on The Guardian's homepage. S Club 7 were a huge part of my childhood. I mean, they had an even bigger hold on my peers in the five years they were originally together than even the Spice Girls or Britney ever did. RIP, Paul.
Been listening to S Club 7 all morning. Cried during "Love Train" ( Paul has lead vocals on that song). I am just incredibly saddened by this news. Rest in Peace, Paul
S club 7 had many memories of my childhood. I play their music every now and then
This is so sad. S club had such amazing music and deserves so much more love. I really wish he could have seen more of it.
I have tickets as well for the tour. This news has absolutely broke me. 💔
Maybe that was related. He's been under financial pressure for years and now he was under pressure to perform again. He already had his back injury to deal with. I hope he's at peace now.
I think the negative comments on social media about his natural appearance for his age may not have helped.  Social media is such a great power for help but can be our greatest enemy at the same time.
Not unrelated I’d imagine
Are you me?! I wasn’t allowed to listen to secular music growing up either. My dad is a southern Baptist minister and I was only allowed to listen to Christian music. I was able to “get around it” by watching Miami 7. I also discovered bands through the Disney Channel lol. Anyway, a sad day for S Club fans. :(
>I can't stop crying.  :( sending love
This was my thinking as well. Also the group was screwed over financially the first time around. I hope there wasn't something stress inducing with the contracts this time.
Oh wow, yeah my dad is a minister as well though pentecostal
You must be a fellow Jump 5 / ATeens fan lol
wtf is wrong with you
Wasn't really feeling this song at first but it is growing on me
queen of being a better man
I still find her and Ed sheeran’s back and forth of songs talking about eachother back in like 2014/2015 really fascinating. “On My Mind” by her is such a great bop.

It feels disorganized on first listen but after a few replays it CLICKS hard. Love the chorus and the contrast it creates
After nearly two decades of gayhood, I finally got around to watching Brokeback Mountain and yeah, I now understand why this is THE entry level Gay™ movie. So fucking iconic and perfect and ahead of its time. Heath 💔
HEARTBREAKING: my new coworker hired over the pandemique is really nice but also listens to trainings on speaker phone
My brother's gf is pregnant. I'm gonna be an uncle. I'm so happy I could cry. They've been trying for years and years and I know they kind of thought it would never happen for them.   I only wish I could be there when she tells her ultra-Catholic immigrant family that she's having a child without being married.

This guy I've been seeing for a week just yelled at me over nothing after showing me multiple anger related red flags. I told him he's not allowed to talk to me like that and to get the fuck out of my house lmaooo. A pro of aging is I don't put up with clownery from men anymore. Byeeee
Since we’re talking about Star Wars, my brother told me the other day that Lizzo and Jack Black were in the newest episode of the Mandalorian, but he neglected to inform me that they are married… power couple tbh
It's so sad to live knowing that there are people suffering or going through something every second  of everyday
can someone manifest me that i get fired in my current job and that my old boss from my first job gives me a job offer to come back even though their HR was shit?
sometimes I wonder if people get paid to tweet about random pieces of content from the 2000s/2010s or if they're just bored and try to find stuff to tweet about for engagement from their followers    Not in a malicious way or anything it's just like for some huge accounts on twitter I'll look at their tweets and it just doesn't make sense as a coherent set of opinions and interests that a real human being can have
Good Friday is about to end today and some clubs in my area are opening at exactly midnight later. 💀
Tumblr users creating polls for the stupidest competions is just peak Tumblr. Right now on Good Friday, one of the biggest polls on the site is asking people to choose [Jesus vs. Hello Kitty](https://www.tumblr.com/brightorangetea/713703828045873152/jesus-or-hello-kitty-jesus-hello-kitty).   There's also a competition for the [most annoying fandom](https://www.tumblr.com/mostannoyingfandom-poll/713920089148276736/here-is-the-updated-bracket-for-round-2-again). Swifties are currently competing against GOT fans and Larries are fighting against Harry Potter fans. If they win their brackets, the next round will pit Swifties against Larries which will just be a bloodbath and a lot of chaos.
I am fully obsessed with Carrie and Lowell by Sufjan Stevens. I’ve played it through 8 times since last night. This morning, while I was lying on my bed listening to it, I genuinely found it so peaceful and relaxing that I felt my heart rate slow down.  Credit to Recordranger for inadvertently recommending it to me on here :)
Y'all remember how the other day I was bitching about having to drive to NASA (which is across town from me) because it was a long drive on the highway and that's scary to me as a new driver  Yeah so my friend who's visiting this weekend flies standby and all the flights to Houston filled up so I had to drive out to Austin in the pouring rain in the middle of the night last night to go get her so I'm basically a professional driver now and also I'm never fucking doing that again
I hate that I’ve only heard Nonsense and boy’s a liar on my local top 40 station when they do that weird DJ mashup hour where they just play parts of several songs without ad breaks
Sooooo  There  is a user here on Reddit I use to do fantasy writing with. We became decent friends and he was really nice. Fast forward 5 months and I had to straight up cut him off. He was constantly playing victim to the world because he had some odd traits about him and no One wanted to indulge him In his fantasy’s. (He also has shitty views on politics and is a massive conservative)He’s also a massive game show fan and managed to get on jeopardy. He won a few games and now that the episodes are airing he’s getting a ton of attention. One of it is that he has a facial hair style that is Atkin to hitler. He was being trolled for it and it made gossip headlines. His reaction was very much on brand and now he’s soaking up in his victim hood (and I don’t support the bullying one bit but he’s the type to fuel the flames because he feeds off of this victim complex)   It’s just surreal to watch. Knowing what I do I hope he uses his winnings to pay for therapy.
I listened to the Spotify snippets of Ellie Goulding's new album and it sounds like HEAT. I can't wait to sit down and listen to it from top to bottom. We need more impersonal album from artists. I don't care about being innovative or pushing the envelope. I need fun good music in my life.
i think the "spotify bio" thread has a weird vibe. i think it's not that deep 😭
Tried to be a good catholic today but Chipotle put a huge serving of chicken in my vegan bowl for some reason like this lid barely even closed
[Weekly 5x5](https://imgur.com/a/oZm66Qs)  Sad I can't go to the Phillies today, excited for the concert I have tonight though. Ya win some, ya lose some. At least tomorrow I can down a dozen or so hot dogs, buy some more baseball cards, and just have a general good time.  Just such a shame that yesterday was probably the most perfect day we ever could have had for Opening Day and it go cancelled on the very small chance of rain. Game was slated for 3, didn't rain in Philly until after 8pm...what a joke. It was also a nice 80 degrees out and today is gonna be 60 and slightly cloudy. Big big oof on the part of the Phillies and MLB.  In nonbaseball news, literally crying at the trailer for [Ahsoka](https://youtu.be/HnzNZ0Mdx4I). She is my favorite Star Wars character and Rebels is my favorite Star Wars show, so this is EVERYTHING for me. Also a James Mangold movie about the first Jedi? And a film about Daisy Ridley's Rey rebuilding the Jedi order? LET'S FUCKING GO.
enough time has passed that i can admit i have no idea what the Shake It Off bridge is about
so even though I think the Spotify bio thread has a weird vibe, I will playfully post here the trend *I* have noticed that always makes me go "lol" when I see it on Spotify. I also think it's not that #deep and it's more me noticing it, but for like 2 years I have noticed most alt-pop artists doing the "hand on face, pouty disinterested look" pose that it's become a trope to me.

The Barbie discourse is getting obnoxious.   Not the memes itself but people trying to fancast Ryan Gosling as if he wasn’t already cast. 🤪   And or it’s “I don’t get why everyone is so excited about Barbie.”   Like why can’t we just have a fun movie
I just got outed at work wtf??!?!???? Like this guy wants to go on a date with me so he adds me on insta and instead of DMing me he asks my coworkers about me and tries to get them to set us up?????
Revisited Raye’s album yesterday and I’m blown away by how much it grew on me. Honestly she had my current AOTY and I’m not entirely sure if anyone will top it!    Favorite songs: Escapism, Buss It Down, The Thrill is Gone, Ice Cream Man, Worth It, Flip a Switch
Trina has a Tiny Desk concert, I repeat Trina has a Tiny Desk concert!
Just wanna say: Succession season 1 episode 2. Wow.
My family never really regularly went to church growing up so I have no idea when Easter and Good Friday is until I try to run some errands on Easter Sunday and can't cause all the stores are closed  Also one of my Filipino buddies always gives me crap about never observing Lent or anything like that when I remind him that the few times I did go to church was with my grandparents who were Seventh Day Adventists and had their own weird set of rules. I did not realize being a Good Filipino was so tied to being Super Catholic!  (I realize my parents are basically hippies compared to other Asian parents which explains a lot)
I didn't like Succession when I first tried watching it but I just have this feeling that once I get it I'm going to be fully obsessed. So right now I'm just trying to watch this video essay about why it's so good to convince myself to like it lol.
seeing Weyes Blood reaffirmed my belief that Titanic Rising is the greatest album of the 21st century so far and A Lot’s Gonna Change is the greatest song    for ME anyway but that’s also the only opinion I care about so 😤
I saw Hamilton recently … What a MUSICAL. I’ve been a fan of the soundtrack for years and now I’m re-discovering why I love it. It’s just so good
I've been seeing so many clips of Ugly Betty on tiktok lately and I'm going to take it as a sign to finally do a rewatch after all these years! I didn't even finish the final season properly because that was year I got my first "adult" job and was busy af. I'm excited!!
I can't stop listening to IVE's Kitsch. It's far from their best song but damn that anti-drop in the chorus is infectious.
tomgreg stans need to be tried at the hague. in this essay i will...
anyone else trying to buy tickets to the Ava Max tour this morning? It looks like the only purchasing options are the $130 and $300 VIP packages but I don't see anything about regular GA onsale times...anyone know what's going on?  Edit: nvm it just sold out right away that's why lol
I actually liked Waffle House by Jonas Brothers a lot more than Wings but I was checking the song times on the new album and only like two of them are over 3 minutes  And I’m just annoyed.
Work was very long and stressful the last couple of days but I finally finished everything I needed to so I can head into the weekend with a clear head :)  I also have become such a Troye Sivan stan in the past few months. I liked Bloom when it came out and absolutely love Easy (Remix) and Angel Baby, but recently his music has really been hitting. Maybe it’s bc a lot of his songs mirror my own experiences (like Seventeen and Lucky Strike) but I also really think his voice is underrated af, and his collabs like You and You Know What I Need are also top tier.
This is so random but I’m relistening to Mabel’s *…About Last Night* album that came out last July and it’s so underrated! Such a good dance-pop album.
I wanted the pastel pink emoji heart but Apple rolling out hot pink emoji heart in time for barbie is what she deserves
My mom really wants me to go to dinner with her and my dad to her Venezuelan friends house for home cooked food and I really don’t want to go because there is a Very Large Chance she’ll go on about how AMLO who’s still within his elected term a dictator and the next Hugo Chávez or Maduro and call me an apologist for literally just wanting substantial criticism and not fear mongering right wing US imperialism rhetoric about a President I literally Do Not Like.   🙇🏻‍♀️ here’s hoping I can get out of it because she tried to talk over me saying no
Oh my lord I have never been this nervous over a crush! A boy I met at the bar a month or so ago hit me up and I didn’t open his message for a while because I was so worried as to what I would say. Every time he messaged back I had to work up to opening and responding.  Anyway I’m going to the bar with him tonight so wish me luck. Last time was amazing but it’s been so long I’m nervous if that makes sense. I told him I’ll be taking my shirt off to show off my new harness so I’m hoping he’s into that.
does Caroline meet fans? I assume not cause she's so big now but I'm seeing her next week and I've been a fan of her since i was like 13 😭
NSFW TMI i listened to Blackpink’s Ice Cream  What do they mean by “get the bag with the cream. if you know what i mean?”  there’s a lot of sexual innuendoes in the song. my only interpretation of bag would be a condom and cream being cum. are they saying they “get the bag with cream” as in they made a man c*m in a condom.   then they say “i’m nice with the cream if you know what i mean”  what is your interpretation of these lyrics
Listening to Oceanic Feeling after watching Avatar: The Way of Water makes me feel alive icl.
Okay I'm successfully back on the outskirts of Houston again so I'll call it as a successful impromptu emergency late night 300-mile-round-trip road trip  NEVER doing that shit again I swear to god. Even having gotten a hotel last night and having a break I'm so tired of driving.
I'm not gonna ask Mother Nature any questions but how the fuck was it -5° two days ago with a ice storm that took down four trees just on my property yet expected to get to over 20° next week… wut?
Weird to me that we have the billboard global chart but everyone seems so focus on the US chart still
Who’s an artist that you know will always have a great live show? I’ve seen Kendrick live a couple time and always have so much fun at his shows. I’ve seen 6lack live at festivals too and he always has a great set. It also helps they have a live band with them
i've been on a trivia team since like, august or september, and last night was FINALLY my time to shine! They FINALLY asked a question about Taylor Swift. my entire life had been building to that moment
Kylie and timothee….? Has me so confused but also I would live for him and Travis to have a fight on KUWTK
If you liked *WHAT WE DREW* by Yaeji, I suggest checking out *With a Hammer* that came out today. A noticeable improvement in my opinion, lotta cool sounds. I didn't listen to any singles beforehand, but favorites were probably "Michin", "With A Hammer", "Done (Let's Get It)", "Ready Or Not", and "For Granted"
The rumours are true: the Boygenius album is excellent.
The weather hit 70 last weekend and since then I’ve been listening to mid 2000s edm nonstop since then
Feeling so out of context in this gaudy apartment complex !! </3
Long shot posting here, but not sure where else I could. I have tickets to see Avril Lavigne next week in Amsterdam, but the friend I was supposed to go with can't go anymore. Anyone happen to be lurking who would like to come along? I'd rather find someone new to go with than sell the ticket and go alone. Sadly have terrible taste in friends and no one else cares about Avril.  Otherwise, anyone got any tips on where I might be able to find people who could be interested? Anything is helpful because it's a bit last minute. 🙏
hey i've been off the sub for quite a long time except for rate reveals, uh why are we now personally attacking small artists for not providing enough information about themselves in the "about the artist" section of their spotify page? seems like a complete non-issue when google is literally free and you can literally just search up the artist there. massive dick move to belittle these small artists who probably don't earn nearly enough from the streams they get on spotify and who are just trying to make a living just because you don't like their about section on spotify
I’m in my Lover Era right now. I’ve been revisiting the album a lot lately and I’m lowkey mad that Cruel Summer was the only song I liked off that album minus the singles at the time. Because now I really like London Boy and Death By a thousand Cuts after going through a “It’s nice to have a friend” phase after the Megan trailer came out   This is why I like Taylor’s music because her music tends to grow on you after being like “Eh” at first and then like three days later you’ve memorized all the lyrics to Midnight Rain without intending too.
I saw my first fly of the year. I'm not ready for this. I hate flies so much.
If the yacht rock era was 1976-1984, what years would y’all consider to be the beginning and end of the minivan rock era? Any songs from earlier than you’d consider to be proto-minivan rock?
Might have to get my popheads card revoked for this but I can’t stay silent I don’t care that wings is short I think it’s a great song and it does exactly what it needs to do in the time that it lasts   Also Waffle House is pretty good too and I’m not even a Jonas brothers fan like that but I exited for the album
I’ve been in my picture book bag for a while now. I’ll buy a book on things that I’m not even particularly interested in just to look at cool pictures(recommendations welcomed) but it’s wild(Monet) that people will expect you to pay $40 dollars for a book that’s 99% pictures but won’t show you a single page to at least give an idea of what to expect. Haven’t they ever heard the phrase “don’t judge a book by its cover”?
It’s kind of funny how memory works because I can remember how most of my school looked before the remodel even how big the middle school locker rooms were and then I forget about how the wrestling room used to be in a room above the gym until someone else brings it up and it was cool but I remember never being able to go in it and giving the older guys shit for listening to Hollywood undead.   And it’s like immediately unlocked when someone else brings it up

Thanking Mare of Easttown 133456 days later for introducing me to Phoebe Bridgers (since I mention Mare of Easttown I have to say Kate Winslet gave one of the best performances I have ever seen on TV. She really mothered hard on that show.)
Was hoping to see the super Mario movie today and to was FILLED with kids, the people there even said to me “are you sure you wanna watch now, there’s a lot of kids”. It’s also Easter holidays so it’s going to be like this for the next two weeks, so I have to wait until after school starts again 😭😭😭
Asked chatgpt to describe Olivia rodrigo’s sophomore album tracklist what do u guys think about what it came up with?   Tracklist for Olivia Rodrigo's sophomore album, "Redemption":  "Redemption" - A powerful opening track where Olivia declares her intention to redeem herself after a difficult period in her life.  "Moving On" - An upbeat pop-rock song about leaving the past behind and moving forward with confidence.  "Rise Up" (feat. H.E.R.) - A soulful collaboration with H.E.R. that encourages listeners to rise above adversity and stand up for what they believe in.  "New Beginnings" - A reflective ballad about starting over and finding hope in the midst of change.  "In My Head" (feat. Billie Eilish) - A haunting duet with Billie Eilish that explores the darker corners of the mind and the struggle to stay grounded in reality.  "Forgiveness" - A piano-driven ballad about the power of forgiveness and the healing that can come from letting go of anger and resentment.  "Break the Chains" - A fiery anthem about breaking free from societal expectations and living life on one's own terms.  "Uncharted Territory" - A dreamy, synth-pop track about venturing into unknown territory and taking risks in life and love.  "Love and Loss" - A raw, emotional ballad about the complexities of love and the pain of loss.  "Fading Away" - A stripped-down acoustic track about the fleeting nature of youth and the inevitability of change.  "Phoenix" (feat. Demi Lovato) - A soaring power ballad about rising from the ashes and emerging stronger after a period of struggle.  "Goodbye" - A bittersweet farewell to the past and a hopeful look towards the future, featuring a stripped-down, intimate arrangement.
Happy Good Friday from your local godless heathen who has just eaten chicken tenders for lunch
Morning Raters and R&B lovers!  I'd like to mention that we currently have 34 participants for Confessional R&B! As always, [check the list to make sure I have you marked down if you submitted](https://pastebin.com/wkecKLv9) as there are now only **9 days until the window to submit officially closes**! Now the rate was named "Confessional R&B" for all 4 of the artists laying down some vulnerable and personal stories that allow multiple listeners to relate. I already talked about all the lead singles from every album in the rate. Now I would like to move onto a couple other tracks I think are very much worth highlighting.  # [Kehlani - melt](https://youtu.be/aA7TB5yXxxU)  If I had to describe *blue water road* in three words, it would be gentle, loving, peaceful. And it all honesty, I feel that this song summarizes those feelings as best as possible. IWGUIW was a project where they sung about some of the struggles that they were experiencing from an unhealthy relationship, but this track is a near complete 180, both sonically and lyrically. Kehlani's described this as their favorite from the album and honestly? I think it's my personal favorite as well.  A lot of the lyrics here feel almost poetic to me in a way I can't really explain. The entire track pulls me in but one of my favorite moments is when Kehlani pulls you in during the pre-chorus for the following  >Wish I could build me a cute apartment   >   >One-bedroom right where your heart is   >   >Inch of space feels broken-hearted   >   >Across the bed feels way too far  Of course Kehlani's made previous love songs before, but something about this track - with the lightness of her voice being a perfect match for the lyrics while singing across a very relaxing and calm instrumentation - feels extremely vulnerable and frankly more beautiful than ever before. It's really a gorgeous track that holds a special place in my heart and one that I consider to be one of Kehlani's best songs to date.
happy Classic FM Top 300 Countdown Weekend to those who celebrate! Personally rooting for C. Schumann’s Three Romances and Fauré’s Réquiem this year, though super thrilled that Florence Price made the ranking this year!
Seeing stuff about dating and/or “oh how to know if he’s X” is frustrating when the person you are interested in and yourself are both neurodivergent so all of these “norms” don’t apply to either or you.   Moral of the story: I need to communicate!  EDIT - i’m talking about myself and my situation here and no shading anyone in particular
Okay posting a lot today because I doubled my dose of adderall but are any of y’all on shirtless Eddie tiktok? It’s my favorite place on tiktok
I’ve been avoiding eating meat today to appease my Irish mother so it’s typical that I’ve been craving stuff like bacon all day lmao   Our fish supper tonight was 10/10 tho

anyone else tried the Welcome Home ARG? i feel like i have found everything that could be currently found... or I just suck at this?
Okay well since Spotify bios are a hot topic right now, [let me share my favorite.](https://i.imgur.com/a5KLxgF.png)
Altégo’s “Bling Bling” and Rita Ora’s “Bang” with Imanbek- does anyone know the link between them? They are identical.
Irene in Portrait of a Thief  is kinda a bitch (tbh so are both Chen sibling even if they’re contesting with Alex to be my favorite character right now) like the way she talks to Alex in their first conversation is so unwarranted.   >!like where are you going to get a hacker if you actually did drive off the only one you have and who has shown they can do what you need at a museum already? It makes it seem like she doesn’t know what a hacker is 😵‍💫 especially when it’s because she assumed she’s an ex of her brother and then keeps running with it after being aware they only had two dates years ago. Hell I know she’s Will’s friend only but Will and Alex have been friend just as long if not longer then Lily and Irene and Lily and Irene frankly have more replaceable skill sets 😭!<
Do y'all got any good movie or book recs with   mlm romance where the  characters are under 30? (Not trying to be ageist lolll, i just can't relate to characters so much older than me).
Yesterday I saw the Mario movie and the D&D movie. I really liked Mario: It was incredibly simple, it tells the same story Mario has been telling in games for years, but in this case sticking to basics worked. Jack Black serves, as everyone says. D&D was, in comparison, rather overwrought, but a little fun.  Mario was *packed* though. The biggest auditorium in my usual theatre has been selling out showings of Mario. It's lowkey a breakout star of the year so far.
Forever Winter has to be one of the best songs Taylor has ever written, along with maybe her best vocal performance period. I can’t believe she wrote that for Red, probably thought about releasing it, and was like “…nah I’m good”
Everything aside, Bhad Bhabie wasn’t that bad at rapping. She wasn’t great, but she was better than Iggy. That’s pretty much the consensus on here right?
"This nation was built on peaceful protest" coming from under Obama's (team's) fingers is exactly why people have a problem with his semi-annual NPR-core playlists helping create this wholesome relatable image of him. Political awareness in America is absolutely neutered.
I really don’t get the rhetoric that Taylor is only as big and successful especially in streams just bc it’s X amount of albums’ impact. It might give more variety but it’s not like her casual listeners and majority of her fans would stream 2-3 songs at the same time, or even stream 24/7. Anyone could release dozens of albums yet not get the same traction as she does.

the >!cannibalism!< scene on yellowjackets was done so beautifully. i didn't even realise that they went there until they went there and even after they did, i was not faced with the usual feeling of disgust because of the way they portrayed it
heath ledger was ahead of the times. he refused to present at the oscars because of tasteless homophobic bbm jokes. he was a such a standup guy </3
im still not over it tbh. the marketing was also great since they had to make a "straight-bait" out of that film just for the GP to watch it.
the movie is meh for me honestly, but that theme music motif is truly iconic i think

I know on tumblr at least a lot of themed "content" tumblr blogs will have multiple mods
If it’s a big page then there’s probably different people running the account. I follow a lot of aesthetic pages on ig(so mostly stuff from 90’s and 2000’s) and there’s usually 2 or 3 people running the account.

Hello kitty >>>>>>>>
I’m so happy you love it! Carrie and Lowell has had a huge impact on my music taste and I hope you explore Sufjan More although his other music does sound much different. Have you listened to The Greatest Gift yet?  Nick Drake - Pink Moon is sonically pretty similar and there a Nick Drake tribute album coming out this year so it’s the perfect time to check it out.
In my imaginary top albums of all time ranking this album has never left since I first heard it years ago. I actually recently fell back in love with 'The Only Thing' after being fully obsessed with it for a period of time. Also if you liked this then I found *Sea Change* by Beck to be a similar experience, just FYI.  e: Adding specific *Sea Change* recs, maybe try ['Lost Cause'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SY71xW-qz5A&list=PLC45874B285D8A72D&index=6) and ['The Golden Age'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6iGez4BLjQ&list=PLC45874B285D8A72D)
Houston traffic is, memorizable to say the least. But Houston and Austin traffic in one day? Good lord, I’d rather fall into a pit of lava.
what does "do fantasy writing" mean? just curious
stahhhhp you know that guy? i saw him in the jeopardy sub the other day complaining about the mustache tweets! i did think they were mean lol but he sounds v weird based on your experiences
I've never understood why so many people act like these artists need to release serious albums and songs with profound poetic meaning and innovation. We listen to various artists for different reasons.   If that sounds shallow to anyone, so what. A lot of people, especially in this sub, are SUPER pretentious and just really need to relax and listen to the music.
I really had no idea people were reading that far into artist Spotify bios  Like back in the day some CD booklets had the lyrics and some didn't but I didn't get super mad if they didn't have them
I love the weird short bios. People can just look artist up on Wikipedia if they want more let artist do their fun little thing.  Himeras just says No drum zone and it makes me so happy for some reason
"I'm not the intended audience for these artists' branding, going to go yell at 1.4 million people online now"
There’s like a weird sense of… entitlement? It gives me the same energy as those people who tweet at Normani yelling at her to release new music and leave her label.
If I go to hell for this and not for having sex with other men I'm going to be so mad
Oh my catholic mom literally cooked me beef today   I’m so horrible at fasting I couldn’t do what Muslims and Jews do for either an entire day or month 🙈
Love that you’re listening to Charli Brown enough for it to be on your recap
neither do I but it rules  I just shake
When in doubt, just do what someone else has done and hope for the best lol
I sorta prefer when my favorite artists hit Vegas cause I can make a trip out of it and see them in a (usually) smaller venue than I would in LA😬
This insane behavior. I though people from grindr finding me on Facebook was bad but this is just another level.   I hope your workplace isn’t too conservative and your coworkers don’t treat you any different.
Go to HR, that’s totally fucked
Wait he doesn’t work with you?
NPR also put out a podcast episode about her yesterday, it was great! They interviewed Trick Daddy for it also and he made a total ass of himself, as usual.
The Tiny Desk concerts are always so good.
My best friend is Filipina and wasn't raised Catholic but converted as an adult mainly for family reasons, I get a strong sense it is a big part of their culture at least for some.  Still Seventh-day Adventist is way different and he should understand that.
It took me a couple of episodes to get into it. I watched it because I've enjoyed a lot of the creator's work like Peep Show and the Thick of It but I wasn't quite sure of the tone like is this a comedy, or a drama at first. I kept watching and got hooked.
Was it this one? [https://youtu.be/\_lU91279xZk](https://youtu.be/_lU91279xZk) It kind of worked for me too  But the sibling videos really got me to actually start watching lol [https://youtu.be/n8x12bhOIKg](https://youtu.be/n8x12bhOIKg)
I’m gonna counter this with Wild Time
for all the poorly aged and problematic content in it, at its core it’s still one of the goofiest and imo funniest shows ever
I love it. Can't wait to hear the other ten new songs when *I've IVE* comes out.
I saw some mention wings and Waffle House in conjunction with the Jonas Brothers earlier but I thought they were talking about the food/restaurant and the Jonas Brothers thing was something completely unrelated lol
Blue Neighborhood was literally my adolescence. Back then every Youtuber was either making a book or making music and honestly let's just say the quality bar was very low 😭 While TRXYE was decent when he finally made his debut album I couldn't believe how insanely good it was. Plus the Trilogy music videos accompanying it turned the whole thing into this amazing project for queer people. I haven't fully connected with all his newer material, but he'll always be on my radar because of how important BN was.
The production on In a Dream is unmatched.  If you haven’t heard it already check out the Love Me Wrong feature on Allie X album. One of my favorite songs of all time and I’ve imagined showing it to my parents so many times.
Crying On the Dancefloor is a prom season bop
Also she doesn’t need to revive her “phase” of burning the British flag but god I wish she was less Eurocentric now
It’s actually for the Canadian fans there (milk comes in bags)
get the bag = get the money    with the cream = get the dick too while you're there
It *MIGHT* be a reference to the Wu-Tang Clan's "C.R.E.A.M." (Cash Rules Everything Around Me). "Cream" is occasionally used in rap to mean cash.
yeah I didn't think too deep about that one line, but I can see how you got that take from it   I thought it was just a generic "get the bag" = "be successful" line myself
I mean, the Hot 100 has been around for decades, meanwhile the global chart only started back in late 2020. It hasn't even been five years since its creation. Plus, it lacks certain "rules" that make it seem more chaotic (like lacking any recurrent rules). But yeah, I hope the global 200 would one become be seen as relevant as the Hot 100 just because it would mean there's a second list to chart-watch xd
Yeah
Can I ask a...Question?
what was the question?
Wait my brain cannot process him being on the show 💀 what if he fights with kourtney about gluten
It's very much like an algorithm was set to "arbitrarily pair two good-looking celebrities" but whatever hope they're happy (... ? if it's true?).
ooh thank you for the reminder that this came out today, and totally agree that it’s a step up! What We Drew felt like it kinda meandered and started ideas without fleshing them out, but With a Hammer feels more… complete. definitely a good example of mixtape vs album
Omg this is so cute please post an update if you find someone. Also maybe post in the Avril subreddit if there is one
Bogo I just read that whole thread, it's unhinged but it's just outrage bait. Do not engage for your own wellbeing.  🫂
London Boy is such a banger when you realize Taylor just likes to be a little silly sometimes
Death by a thousand cuts live from pairs version hits so hard
i think this is not the right forum of demographics to ask this specific question lol
Growing up in the 90s and 2000s I want to say roughly 1997-2004, but am not quite sure why.
Literally the only reason Barnes & Noble still exists.
Memories are also weird because there are things I  know happened but the only memories I have of them are my friends talking about the memory.  I vividly remember my friend telling me about the time we were sitting on the floor of her dorm room doing something but I cannot access that memory for the life. We even talk about that memory a lot because it was a pretty important moment and it makes me feel so weird that I can’t remember it.

I find it very funny how on-the-nose these titles and the descriptions are. Idk Olivia so idk if that’s how her first album is, but like “Moving On…yeah it’s a song about moving on” lol
The descriptions for the HER and Demi tracks sound so believable lol.

I can't listen to altar without getting emotional — kehlani can be wildly inconsistent but when she hits she HITS. great write-up
That is what it comes down to most in most of those posts.
> Having a job and responsibilities is not conducive to my wanting to read all day  Almost got into a fight over at StarWars this morning because I commented pretty much saying watching Rebels is easier than Clone Wars since it is shorter and I don't have all the time in the world.  Like yeah, I could sit in front of the TV all day but also I wanna read books, go to concerts, hike, play some video games, etc. etc. The time I wanna spend on a TV show is not that high in the hierarchy of things I wanna do.
Yesss Extraordinary Machine representation. Underrated Fiona.
I haven't done any "searching" because I'm rubbish at ARGs but I love the visuals and the characters
I feel like that’s a decent one? Doesn’t say anything about the music but you can always listen to it if you like the personality/vibes of the artist, which you really can pick up on through the bio
Both are built around the same *Axel F* sample. Still extremely similar though, more than just using the same sample should make them.
I do think and really like that Li uses her first and second gen immigrant characters to have very different relationships and opinions to China including within close in age and close siblings
I’m pretty confident the book will address eventually Irene >!being kinda sexist to Alex and Will’s own issues with women because there’s been repeatedly brought up enough!< but I am not sure if it’ll address the classism that’s very clearly in the background
it is a really good song but i think it was a little personal for her to release at the time :/ glad we have it now though because i think a lot of people can relate to it
It sounds like a speak now / fearless song!
The nation was **built** on peaceful protest = the rights we enjoy as a nation today were gained through peaceful action. He's not talking about the revolutionary war or slavery, unclench.
It's a shame he got lost in the role of the Joker I would have loved to see what he would do today.
I won't get over it anytime soon. Through the years I've heard all the tasteless jokes and controversies surrounding it; turns out it's actually a beautiful, tender film. Fuck the straights
DON'T YOU JINX IT😭
I think it’s because JB tends to play a pretty specific kind of character— really bombastic, good-natured dudes, and if Lizzo’s character is anything like she is IRL, they would make a great match.
Yea can you imagine being born, growing up and then having your life just lead up to that point. It's horrible.
thanks for this!
Amen! 🙏
Right? I was so shocked when I saw some of my friends dressing up for the club already on my Instagram stories. Mind you, they woke up early in the morning to attend the mass. The Philippines is a very Catholic country so I am surprised this is even allowed.
Hello Kitty sweep
Yeah, it might be recency bias speaking on my part but I genuinely think this might end up in my top ten albums of all time - that's how much I love it. I have listened to The Greatest Gift - it's great, really pretty and kinda uplifting, wish it was it was longer actually.   Will definitely check out his other stuff and the Nick Drake one you mentioned although I'm probably gonna be stuck on Carrie and Lowell for a while :)
Thanks for the recs - will add them to my list :)
Luckily it was so late that it was EMPTY for 90% of the trip but god once I got close to the airport it was like the Dumb Bitch Olympics
Collaboration on a story essentially. Writing characters and such together.
I don’t like the bullying. Over all he isn’t a malicious person. His parents raised him up to be very very sheltered. His world view consistently  feels like one that’s modeled versus something he’s adopted himself. He’s probably eating up the attention good or bad. If you see how he responds in a very “and I’m that guy… it’s me…” but saying it’s defamation for people to say he looks like hitler is all the evidence you need to know.
Yeah. Sometimes you want artsy conceptual music, and sometimes you just want to bop. You can like both!
Oh man, I DID.   It was SO HARD to know the actual lyrics otherwise. Just put them in the book!! It's what it's for! I don't care about anything else in there!!
What is the meaning of the no drum thing by the way?
It 100% gives off entitlement vibes
if it’s that new chicken al pastor god will understand
I mean the pope said the second part is okay, so hopefully he tells god to forgive you for having chicken today
He does work with me but we're not in the same department and seldom interact.
I’ll definitely give it a listen thanks!
> for ME anyway    but i do love Wild Time
I watched it in full last year and agree.  Unfortunately a lot of those "jokes" were common in media then.
canadian blinks are fed 🇨🇦
I just looked this up, no idea this was a thing. Omg it's highkey horrifying.  Pouring milk from a bag, even if it's in a pitcher just seems wrong😭 I'm glad it doesn't waste as much plastic though
For the record, western Canada uses cartons, it's only really a thing in eastern Canada (Ontario, Quebec, the Maritime provinces)
i saw that on urban dictionary and that’s most likely the meaning.   it’s just about getting money
How many number one singles has Taylor Swift had on the BB hot 100?  But it was one part of a four part total-sum question. I actually was off by one. And my teammates answered the other 3 parts. I don’t believe we got all 4 right but we ended up getting the overall answer right bc there was a margin or error!
That’s why I like Me! it’s actually a fun song when you realize she wants to be goofy and cringey.
Girl we ain’t spring chickens in here
How was them breaking up only a year ago that’s insane to me. Feels like they never dated it all felt so artificial to me ngl.
I feel like this a movie to watch in the morning but like I have never seen my local theatre like this, it’s the exact same when my high school used to take us to the cinema as a trip and there was so many of us. I just know that I can’t watch a movie with a bunch of kids around cause they won’t behave 😭
Lol I think that’s just how the ai is it’s not very smart.  I don’t take it very seriously but it’s fun to laugh at
Ranch! With buffalo being a very close second.
Well to be fair can we classify hot dogs as meat? /s
Oh yeah, especially with just the vast amount of Star Wars stuff now! I haven't watched any of it recently because I just feel so burned out from the almost nonstop nature of it. Kenobi was the last time I kept up with a Star Wars show
oh definitely! i can really feel that this was such a passion project.
You’re probably right, but like damn it makes you wonder how many incredible songs like that she wrote and didn’t release for similar reasons
Girl I hope not lmao, but listening to Charli's unreleased stuff like this always makes me wonder if the song will see the light of day 😭
Oh this is in the Philippines, I was curious where in the US this happens.
ahh i see. How did you reconcile working with someone and also befriending someone who was such a conservative?
Kids really don't know how hard it was to find correct lyrics even after the internet became popular! If you were looking for lyrics for something even slightly out of the mainstream there was a good chance you'd get a butchered interpretation if you found anything at all. I think it wasn't really til Genius.com where you started to find everything.  These days even the most obscure experimental electro project has their lyrics scrolling on Spotify, probably verified by the artist. Spoiled!
If you listen to most of their music and all of the new stuff they don’t use drums at all. The most percussive sounding thing you’re gunna get is some synthesizers that have a bit of a kick to them.
I am aware of this but sadly it’s funnier to blame the whole country
we also ain't no old rotten rotisseries!
Ranch is so dependable, like what does it not go with. For chicken i like hot honey and for fries i like mayo!
I swear there's a Charli curse. She wrote songs for Addison Rae and now those songs might never get released😭 I need I Got It Bad😭 But fr Charli needs to release an album just of unreleased songs (which is like every album ever but yk what i mean lmao).
I assume he didn't initiate the friendship by handing them a cue card reading, "HI, my name is Tim. Here are some of my views on economics, the police, and the relationship between church and state. Do you want to be my friend?'  Plenty of times, someone can be totally pleasant about plenty of other things, so you don't even really think about their personal politics until the subject comes up somehow.
Figured it was literal, just wanted to check. Thanks!
LMAO i’m using that from now on!
Yep! It came up when he asked me “as a women do you honestly think it’s ok when other men pretend to be just like you?”
i wasn't doing a "gotcha!" moment when i asked her that question so
Oh no you’re fine! I get it, I live in a conservative area of the country so I’m used to it. But, sometimes you just wanna hope for the best.

APPLE BOTTOM JEANS BOOTS WITH THE FUR 🗣️🗣️🗣️  I was at a wedding a few weekends ago and everyone ran to the dance floor when this came on
A cultural milestone.
This is one of those songs where the chorus and the feature is so obviously the star of the song that you forget there are actual lyrics.  Like no shade to Flo Rida, but T-Pain carries this song by a country mile.
One of my most vivid memories is of hearing this at a middle school dance and everyone around me trying to like limbo their way as close to the floor as possible during the “low x8” part
This is a classic!!! Kid me used to dance my ass off to this track, of course not knowing what the lyrics meant, but I got low low low low low low low low.
If only for the fact that everybody still hits the floor and, next thing you know, gets low-low-low-low-low-low-low-low whenever it comes on at the club (and you're going to the wrong clubs if it doesn't), I'll always love this song. Not many songs that sync people up like that.
Every once in a while the line shawty was hot like a toaster so I had to fold her like a pornography poster will pop into my brain and I'll try to decipher it to no avail but I still think it's so dumb it's brilliant
APPLE BOTTOM JEANS
“Let me talk to umm, let me talk to umm.”   If you weren’t around for this song at its peak, you truly missed out! The OTR of the mid-00’s
Did nobody else notice this tidbit when Will.I.Am was mentioned alongside "In The Ayer"?  > As lead artist, will.i.am’s highest-charting single is the 2012 Britney Spears collab “Scream & Shout,” which peaked at #3. **It’s a 4.**  I mean, I kinda lowkey agree, but, OUCH.
JESSICA!!!!! DID YOU SLEEP WITH MR. WILSON?????
Flo rida really had a generational couple of years and people have largely forgotten about it
Iconique if you ask me. Still got me shaking my ass
This and Crank that were middle school dance essentials for me
Welcome to 2008, y'all! The year when a former Christian rock singer kissed a girl (and liked it) and the last year before the club boom of 2009-2011, when the blaring electropop synths would briefly replace R&B as the most dominant form of popular music. The final year of the Bush administration was kicked off with its' biggest hit, the anthem to all the shawties who have them apple bottom jeans and boots with the fur.  Up next in this column, remember 2004 and how Usher was the MVP of that year? Well, after Confessions, it would take four years for him to come back with new chart-topper.  And the "new chart-topper" is the next song on this column, where Usher belts about how he wants to make love to a woman he just met on the dancefloor.   Literally.   >!Just like, having sex with her on the dancefloor at the club. !<  >!Where other people are probably dancing at the same time. !<  >!Not even waiting to escort her into his apartment.!<  >!Just, clothes come off and \[PARENTAL ADVISORY - EXPLICIT CONTENT\] and the bouncers do not interrupt the action and ask Usher to leave.!<  >!Also, Young Jeezy is there, as Usher's wingman/guest rapper.!<
To me, this song marks the beggining of the dance club explosion, and honestly, what a banger! Low is a bop, and both T-Pain and Flo Rida made a great job in delivering such an addicting song, that imo is timeless: a 10/10, no doubts about it.
i remember massively misinterpreting the meaning of this song as a kid. i always thought that the girl being described was like making a scene or something, and shawty "getting low" was her boyfriend trying to hide in the crowd 😭 the actual song makes a lot more sense
Few songs can immediately evoke an era the way Low does for the late-00s. It's a song that will always get a big reaction from those who were around in its heyday and for good reason. It features one of the most undeniable hooks of all time and the verses are quite fun as well.
In college, I worked summers as a summer recreation counselor with six-year-olds, and they *all* sang the hook of this song on repeat.  The 10 for "Independent" hell yeahh. Boosie "Bossy Bottom" Badazz, America's favorite self-hating closet case, snapped on that one.
boots with the jeans
The lead two paragraphs of this article are why this man makes the big bucks. What a fantastic article.
My childhood right there.
I remember this song as clear as day. I also remember that the DJ they hired for my 8th grade dance played this and went “This is the theme song for [Name withheld] Middle School!!!” It was truly a time and a fun way to attach a memory to a song
This is an iconic song!!  THE BOOTS WITH THE FURRRRR (with the fur!)
such an iconic song from my childhood!
Until the day I die, the line will be boots with the spurs. Cowboy boots are cool! Who would want furry boots?
I can't hear about this song without thinking about this mashup with Supermassive Black Hole https://youtu.be/3kxXOnbHI08
I remember first hearing to this song while watching Step Up 2, what a banger!
I love these comments - everyone seems to have memories, good memories, of this jam. Love it.
4EVER A BOP
Girl we are SPRINTING from bathroom to middle school dance floor at full speed
(WITH THE FUR)
I think I still have emotional damage from seeing an aunt go absolutely HAM to this song at a wedding years ago.
Omg. Every wedding I go to. Lol
when marianna from brazil, the hottest girl in my 6th grade (lol), walked into school with the uggs and apple bottoms playing that song on her ipod.... EVERYONES wigs flew
This is true for most of Flo Rida’s hits
Having DJed a few middle school events - middle schoolers LOVE this song. High schoolers also love this song, old millennials like me love this song, and old folks love this song.  I am not exaggerating when I say this is an all time across all generations classic
I can only ever link this song to me being beyond wasted at clubs because this came out right when I was in freshman year university.
I think he was generous here
I was FAILING CHEMISTRY!
Right Round, Wild Ones, Good Feeling, Club Can't Handle Me is an incredible run of hits
All of his big singles are legit bangers. I don't know why he gets clowned. Flo Rida *fucks*.
I was in middle school during this time and it was transformative. Every bat mitzvah was lit as hell
Flo Rida never really *did* anything on his songs, but he was a cypher for some bangers so respect!
Let’s not start with this Boosie thing. Insinuating that a homophobic man is gay is homophobic in itself.
with the jeans  the whole club was looking at jeans  she hit the jeans  next thing you jeans  [shawty got jeans jeans jeans jeans jeans jeans jeans jeans](https://youtu.be/W4gNyaA9n60)
THE WHOLE CLUB WAS LOOKIN’ AT HER
Hell I’m even getting married this year and I can’t wait for it to come on during the reception lol 😂
i'm trying to refute you... but i literally cannot. you are right
Same for some of Pitbull's songs as well. The chorus/hook overshadows the rap verses.
didn't even mention Whistle which is his another #1
I feel like the only person on earth that thinks Club Can't Handle Me is a transcendent masterpiece of a hit
*So many girls in here, where do I begin…*
Todd in the Shadows had a field day with Flo Rida at his height, and sure, he was pretty anonymous, but after years of seemingly every pop artist promoting their “most personal album yet”, a little anonymity is actually kind of a good thing.
> Flo Rida *fucks*.  And he wouldn't shut up about it in his lyrics.
I have clowned Flo Rida in the past, but Flo Rida songs are like 20% better than anyone else trying to do Flo Rida songs, so he clearly did something right  He's like Musical Bay Leaf or something, he's mostly carried by the beats and the hooks but the song is just better when he's there
Haha! Oh. Also that window to the wall song. And congrats!
Or Elevator & Sugar
Guess how good it sounds in 27 part harmony https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kVvquWW3CUc&t=2m50s
You're not the only one
For sure. I said the same thing in one of the Ellie Goulding threads a couple days ago. I think there's a pendulum shift happening. More and more people are cognizant of parasocial relationships and trying to resist obsessive stan behaviors.   Speaking personally, I'm finding more songs I really like just by watching BET, and I'm typically just downloading the song and not even digging through the discography. Not learning anything about the artists or their stories. Literally limiting myself to just the tracks I like.
"Musical Bay Leaf" might be my new favorite term of music criticism. Who else can we apply it to??  I think Ty Dolla $ign would be a good candidate. Improves almost anything that he appears on, but is just...there.
Or My House, Where Them Girls At, GDFR, I Don't Like It, I Love It...  Goddamn this man had a monster of hits.
Oh yeah, I saw her call her new album her least personal yet, and even Todd called it a good thing on Twitter. I agree, the trend of everyone trying to match Taylor is getting old. Some artists can pull off deeply personal tracks, but others should stick to nondescript bangers
I was going to say Jason Derulo immediately popped to mind but I think he and Ty both have too distinct of personalities to truly fade into the background  However I would like to nominate B.o.B, who managed to ride hooks from Bruno Mars, Hayley Williams, and Taylor Swift to success
Agreed. I've never met someone that disliked Ty Dolla Sign, but also never met someone that was a fan of his music.
You know, I agree. B.o.B could rap and had personality, but none of his verses were particularly quotable, nor the most memorable melodies on those tracks.

She's still a force.
So underrated. Deserved to be so much bigger. And spitting bars actually live.
lol who wrote the description under the video??? i love it   > As a rapper, Trina has been pushing P since before her successors were even sitting up in Pampers and her wild ride of a Tiny Desk concert, 25 years after making her rap debut, only further proves why she is the blueprint. >  > Decked out in leather, diamonds and a wavy jet-black bussdown, the vet got comfortable behind the Desk quickly
Queen of Miami!
I was wondering how she would do Baddest Bitch but she highly edited it. Makes sense lol.   It sucks how short this is - she has a ton of hits.   Love her.
Trina, Missy & Lil Kim are the holy trinity of rap in the 90s and 2000s they always deserve their flowers.

It’s worth looking into 100% Electronica!  That’s George’s label that he shares with his fiancee, Neggy Gemmy.  They do a ton of cool shit like this, though this is a new level for them.

Lol why the first thing that came in my mind is that Bowser is covering Justin Bieber's peaches
impeccable vocals. the raw emotion made me weep.
aside from the constant references, this was hands down the best part of the movie
Saw this movie last night loved it tons of Easter eggs for die hard fans
Something about the rhythm when Bowser sang "Peaches, Peaches, Peaches, Peaches, Peaches" sounds a lot like another song I've heard. Is this song a parody of something else?
Yeah, the tune does remind me of something but I can’t place it either
i thought the same thing!!!!

Weirrrrrd collab. I'm not sure what sound I expected, but it wasn't that. Would've loved to hear her on a more r&b track.
Whooooa what an insane collab
I was hoping for a bit of the magic of that Waves remix with Kacey and Miguel. And this isn’t it.

Well, the OT12 dream was really short lived, lmao. If she ends up being the only one not on Modhaus, at least we can hope for a collab every now and then.

Personally, I loved “Side Effects” but didn’t care for whatever that second single was. Astrid S will always get a pass in my book though because of everything she released in 2020. Amazing stuff

Loving this album. Wish we got more than three new songs though.
He's doing the damn thing  Fluids still hits
this is SUPER fun and i have been loving everything he’s been putting out. title track is so freaking good. side note: i *much* prefer the original do your thing, if i had to nitpick
So excited to listen!
It’s soooo good.
He’s adding a new song to the album each month in May, June, and July, so we’ll be getting three more total!

WE ARE SEATED FOR THIS
This is my favorite release so far this year. Wow
Love love love this. I've been in love with this band since Landfill dropped, and this feels like a very true to form album. I listened to it a few times today while doing food delivery so I haven't really digested it, except to say that Future Lover is a real banger.

Recently I thought Spotify had updated and the new feature was for the about section to be empty. Turns out it wasn’t that and more and more people are opting to not describe themselves!!!
I agree lmao it’s especially worse if they have a generic ass name and you can’t find anything about them by googling, like am I supposed to spend half an hour trying to find your social media
Ngl it really annoys me when I go to an artists page on Spotify, take the effort to scroll all the way down to the deep depths of their page past everything, and there’s just… nothing.
I remember reading Olivia Rodrigo's bio on Spotify and I thought it was so refreshing. Like she was typing a Facebook status introducing herself.   The vague, cryptic shit definitely doesn't give what it's supposed to give but also a lot of artists do not aspire to be superstars and super-famous. They just wanna put out music and perform it. So maybe it's a concious decision on their part to not really try to market or "sell" themselves.
Honestly I get it. If you're not super-famous, a formal bio has the same vibe as a wikipedia page obviously written by the band. But there has to be a middle ground between "At just 20 years old, [artist] has built her huge, dedicated Gen-Z fan base with her flawless output of confessional bedroom pop songs and DIY aesthetic" and "hi".
I'm actually living for this post lmao. Like I completely agree but never had the courage to say it! It's so dismissive of potential fans who genuinely wanna know more
There's an indie rock band I love with very few listeners that do EXACTLY this. I have no idea why a band wouldn't describe themselves to new listeners.
I love Sorn's about page. She was in CLC (kpop group) that wasn't top tire but did pretty wel, and now she's solo and the bio reads like she's just some girl trying things for the first time. It's just too cute.   Apart from that one I don't care about the bios tbh so I don't have anything useful to comment.
pinkpantheress’ is “mwah! x” and it infuriates me every time I go to her page lol
i have a similar rant about deluxe versions like if your deluxe ver has the exact same cover take the standard version down TAYLOR
The saltiness lol.  But yeah i agree, it's nice to atleast know some basic info.
It's your opinion and I respect that, but I couldn't care less about the artist bio. I either like the music or I don't.
Ngl the first couple of times I encountered blank profiles I thought maybe it was just a case of nepo babies trying to hold back their basic info so people would judge them by their music first but it turns out it's like a very common thing to do now lol
Yeah, it annoys me as well because I really like finding out more about artists. I think the really short non-descreptive ones annoy me more than blank ones tbh. I remember once seeing the description just be "new album out now" like I'd rather it just be empty at that point
What would people here like to read in an artist Bio? What is it you wish you knew about the artist?   Most small artists are writing bios themselves and it is awkward AF. I’ve been working on a rewrite of my own for a couple weeks. Neither my new nor my current bio say almost anything personal except where I am from. The rest is music related and it’s hard to imagine the average listener cares about that anyway. If you’re reading the bio you’ve probably heard the music?  A side note about bios is that they’re often multipurpose, probably put together for an EPK so that the relevant parts can be used as necessary in different contexts. A Spotify audience is different from a label you want to work with, a grant committee you are applying to for funding, artists you want to collaborate with or venues you want to play. So, I am curious what a bio tailored for Spotify should include?  Final note- I don’t know if people know that spotify is a lot like SoundCloud in that anyone can put their music up. You just use a distributor and it takes about a week to appear, but there is no actual need for a label and people can and do put music on Spotify for all sorts of reasons just by themselves. Someone without a business plan or marketing team or whatever can have music on Spotify just as easily as any big artist (but of course it’s less likely you’ll find and listen to the nobody).
I thought I was the only one who hated this
this is by far one of the weirdest things i’ve seen popheads choose to get angry over.
I think anything except an informative, at most gently complimentary, blurb comes off as really amateur and cheapens my perception of the artist. It should essentially read like a Wikipedia page with a focus on the artist's success. I don't want NOTHING and I don't want it to read like a groupie wrote it either, god damn.
I kind of enjoy these idk  The only time it annoys me is when it’s an unknown and I wanted to _know_ anything about where else I could find them
Indie artists are often terrible about promoting themselves. You don't want to hand over your social accounts to your fan club. And you have a band manager who's great with getting you into venues but terrible with social media management. You're busy writing your third album while juggling a day job and nursing the mild drug habit that accompanies your artistic nature.   There's a great local band in my town that for 20 years has no web presence other than Facebook page. The only thing they share on that page is the Facebook event that their regular bar gig creates. Despite having a catalog of originals and unique cover arrangements they've released exactly one album. They had a big show professionally video recorded 10 years ago and put it on a DVD but then never posted it to YouTube. They're all just fine with the regular bar gig.
So this is all over if an artist/band decided to not write anything for their "about" section? I really don't understand your *high* amount of anger here
I kinda agree with you on this. Granted I feel like the About pages on Spotify are overlooked by many app users, but it does annoy me when smaller artists put nothing of substance in their bio when there is little information about them online. It feels like a game of cat and mouse where you’re reading segments of articles from small music publications to get a *feel* of who this artist is.   Bigger artists with detailed wiki pages don’t need to worry about a silly Spotify bio.   I will say that some of the bios are funny and capture the essence of the artist even if you don’t know much about them! Remi Wolf is a great example of this.
not gonna lie, I wasn’t even aware that there was an about section for artists on Spotify, and I bet I’m not the only one
I didn't even realize there is an "about" page on Spotify 😅 But that might be because I mostly listen to albums and don't really use it to discover new music.
I don't really care, if anything, it shows off their personality and how they want to come across in their music. And if I'm interested in finding out more about them, I can just google an article or wiki.
this happens with smaller artists on apple music too and it drives me nuts when i’m going through the curated indigenous playlists. rep your nation please!
I am one of these people your talking about- in a world where music seems to only be about social media, promoting and marketing I think it’s nice to have the main page I show my music on speak for itself. Not be filled with loads of crap about which radio show I’ve been on. The about section is the music if you like that enough to go onto the social media where the artist is trying to flog you more it’s a different story.
Consider that not everyone uploading to Spotify actually gives a shit about Spotify specifically
It’s Spotify not Wikipedia. Just play the music 😂
...How come I didn't know there is an About Page on Spotify🤡
Put it in your diary babe
This made my day. I put a lot of thought into what to include in my bio. Some artists want you to think they are mysterious like the weeknd back in the day
personally i'd rather have an artist with a cryptic or nonexistent bio than those excruatingly normative bios that reek of basic and crude copywriting techniques and say basically nothing about the artist except trying to paint them in a sellable light making them look amateur and unrelatable.
I don’t love it, but that’s why Google exists
I AGREE SO HARD, I just want to know where you’re from and your genres, it makes me so mad!!!
This made me curious to check out the About sections of some artists I've been listening to lately. (Wow, Fifty Fifty has their whole lore explained in their bio.) I feel like I must be lucky in that a lot of the ones I looked at have actual bios (Tegan and Sara, Imogen Heap, Regina Spektor, Coeur de Pirate to name a few).
i completely agree, as a small artist it makes me so annoyed looking for new music, finding a banger then wanting to follow them on insta and start finding a community and then the profile is empty. don't they want people to get to know them?  we keep our bio updated, have a playlist with music we love we update monthly, have a dedicated playlist to our music if anyone wants a simple intro and all our links are updated. besides the monthly playlist all those things are super simple and not time consuming to do.
Is this really an issue..? I had no idea about pages were a thing.   > You should count your blessings that someone went through the trouble of scrolling all the way down and clicking that about page square.   > You are not special, you are not cool, you're a silly poser wasting away goodwill from an audience willing to engage with you.  400+ upvotes for this? lol google them if you want to know more
Everyone trying to act cooler than they are. Sad.
making an indie rock band so i can do this nd spite op
Name names!!
I'm just reminiscing about the time I drove 45 minutes to the nearest Musicland and asked one of the staff members if he knew what song was playing during the prom scene in My So-Called Life. He did not, and didn't even know the show, in fact.   "What Is Love?" by Haddaway, btw.
Overall I would like some artists to put more effort into aesthetics because they DO make a difference. It’s what makes you stand out. Use the Spotify canvas, use the different single photos, give us openings, interludes, actual eras, that don’t end the week of the release. I actually think that Billie and Olivia are great at it, when you check out their Spotify pages they’re full of their personalities
Shut up, whiner. These artists don’t owe you a bio any more than they owe you music. Sit down and be grateful that you get to enjoy what you have. If you can’t enjoy music without a bio - and can’t go look up info on your own - then wtf?
let the girls girl
Himera’s just says No Drums if I remember correctly and I’m in love with it
Kim petras’s bio being just “Pop icon.” was always funny to me, but I’m ALREADY a fan of hers, so like I “get it”. But if I didn’t already know much about her, I’d probably be frustrated not to be able to learn more
I am so shocked at your capability of being SO ANGRY about something so unimportant. Honestly, you should work on yourself.          Acabei de ver que é brasileiro, kkk ta explicado o surto
Please be fr, nobody outside of twitter and popheads even knows that about section exists
Wha
I completely agree. It’s an opportunity to reach out to a listener and hopefully get them more interested, so I don’t know why somebody wouldn’t take it. Writing a good about section will take some time and work, but it’s a very small investment in yourself that can make a big difference.
girl what. i think its entirely fine to let the music speak for itself
Who the fuck cares? Go to wikipedia.
The NPC behavior in this thread is off the scale
This makes me feel so much better about taking the time to write and real and informative bio for my page. I see a lot of other artists with a cookie recipe or yeah nothing at all and kinda felt like we’ll if I was cooler or more popular I could make mine a joke but after seeing this post it’s gunna stay real no matter what!
This bugs me!ike you’re not even that popular 🥴
TIL There's an about page on Spotify. No offense to you and your very strong feelings on this topic but I simply do not see what is the point. If you listened to their music you should in theory know what they do and what genre they make. Personally, I don't think I would care and don't read this, and I don't know anyone who does.
You're so right!! There's more than just an artist's sound that draws people to them. If your lyrics or album art is interesting then I want to learn about you and connect further!!
What a trash opinion lmao. I'd rather see a shitty meme or nothing at all in a bio than some nauseating AI-generated PR bullshit.
yeah this shit bothers me. stop trying to act mysterious because your label got you on one of the playlists.
Google is free
Finneas's Spotify about section comes to mind:     >Bios are boring  Is it the bio or is it you?
your brain rot is showing
Maybe they do it to filter out people who are irrationally opinionated about their branding (or lack thereof).
calm down
La La Land by Demi?
What??? This post reeks of entitlement 💀
Only lorde can pull it off!
they want to seem *quirky and mysterious*
Im more annoyed that there are some bands that deliberately released albums called "discover weekly" and "release radar" which are soundalikes to spotify playlists.  So when i ask my android phone to play those for me, it always plays these fraudulent albums instead.
I just want more Remi Wolf style spotify bios:  >“Remi Wolf is a crazy bih but is also hella nice and sweet sometimes but also likes to yell at people but has figured out that maybe instead of yelling at people she can just sing and scream at people on stage when she’s in the mood to make money and act like a daddy dom. Remi also occasionally hosts The Steve Harvey Morning Show and the nationally syndicated Family Feud, which is on its 43rd season. She also occasionally guest stars on the Jersey Shore as a Snooki body double. But seriously, shiiii, this bitch fucks tho. Also, I am this bitch, so damn, come at me bros, and carne asahhh dude. Single and not ready to mingle.”
Annika Bennet has only one listener (Me) and she’s stated she’s working on the bio in her bio like a teen Twitter bio of 2012 god bless.
It’s more cringe when a small artist has a big profile written full of praises and it makes them out to be bigger and greater than they really are and it’s clearly written by the artist themself but as if some music critic did it.
There used to be descriptions of the artists and their careers by some third party website/company called Rovi back in the day.  Those used to be pretty informative, guess Spotify paid for those which is why they eventually stopped the cooperation and now we have either nothing or descriptions like "Hi I'm random artist, I make music, also I like to eat grass. Mooooh".
For real, I feel like disliking this is what made me put actual effort into my bio haha
Yep. Sometimes I just want to learn more about an artist past their stage name and music. Are you a group? Producers? Where are you from? Etc
You'd think the label would care if they're signed to a reasonably big one. How to build fandom in an era of fragmented attention seems to be the big buzz topic in the industry atm based on the newsletters I get.
It’s hard to sell yourself! Does anyone like doing the “let’s go around in a circle and give three fun facts”?  But also, I would really like three fun facts about these people
There is a place for artists who aren't really trying to sell, it's called releasing exclusively on Tidal.
Omg Chelsea Cutler’s was “hi” for the longest time until someone from her label finally snatched the phone out of her hands and wrote a real bio
I get a formal bio would feel weird, but maybe a couple paragraphs written in first person, just say what are your musical influences, who are your collaborators, how would you call your music genre
My fav indie band has a whole ass fictional story about how they met in the 1940's 💀
My favorite indie band is literally “rock band” (with the quotation mark)
I am from the 90s and I almost literally cannot think of anything less cool than filling out your fucking Spotify bio as an indie rock band.  Someone who wants to be a pop star, fine.  If you're a noise band that put out six albums on cassette last year?  You're flushing all your 'credibility' down the toilet for $0.0000035 per decade.
Drop the band!
I love Sharp Objects by her and no I have nothing useful to contribute
That’s quintessentially her at least
I love that so much. She's such an enigma. I can never see her do a traditional talk show either.
I mean, i'd say that does tell you about her
I love single covers and I hate it when artists use the same one as the album cover. It's so lazy and uncreative.
Thank you! reading the top posts on this thread had me going crazy haha. especially because it seems targeted towards smaller artists who maybe don’t have PR teams.   Many artists don’t have the time/interest/ability to write that stuff on their own, and I doubt it has much impact on listenership, especially because you’re already ON their spotify page.   The amount of people here who seem legit offended is wild to me haha.
this thread is genuinely really surprising to read through because i have never in my whole life looked at an artist's spotify bio… i had no idea this was even a thing people cared about. if i want to know more about an artist i google them lol
right like… i just saw a comment from someone that said they refused to listen to the rest of an artists music because they didn’t like their bio. I swear some people here look for reasons to not enjoy music lmao
Yeah I don't understand being this upset about this.
OP is already listening for practically free and yet feels entitled to more. That's our culture in a nutshell. "You mean I have to close the app and ask Siri to Google something? As if!"
I’m reading through and this and thinking “am I weird for not immediately wanting to know everything about an artist?” The only time I seek info like that out is for black metal bands to make sure they’re not Nazis.
and not just angry but seething rage angry as if all artists are actively choosing to deny information to fans when they likely don't even manage their own pages
Some people clearly have nothing going in their lives
Not to mention that if they are touring or doing any press. There is likely already a quick paragraph written about them in a bland, informative or neutral-positive light that they can cut and paste. Promoters need these descriptions to to sell tix.
"Utterly infuriating and pervasive!!"  Yeah, it's a bit much.
It's funny that you bring up Remi Wolf because I was going to comment on her bio. Anytime I read it I cringe so hard even though I love her music. But I guess it does get her vibe across lol
Smaller or local artists or bands with generic names aren't that easy to google. If a band doesn't bother to fill anything on the about page for the *main app people use to discover music*, I would assume they don't want to be known. There can be and often is multiple bands across the world with same name.
maybe they meant it in a "im mother" way
oooo they got your ass. i will be streaming
Pinkpantheress, Florence + The Machine, FINNEAS, Aurora, Sia.
I just found out about it!  I don't even use Spotify but I have a release on there from a few years ago. So now my page says "purposely left blank to appear engimatic"
It still exists for the specific purpose of giving informed about artists. It's not unreasonable to expect a minimum amount of professionalism from artists. If artist has a manager and label contract and nothing or basically nothing on Spotify About page, someone should be fired. Spotify is the leading music streaming platform, with discovery being its biggest selling point, and people don't provide basic info for those that actually discover. This is failing in the fundamentals of marketing.
"I dont care for that so you dont have a point"  Uh, nice argumet there
Yes because these are the only two options.
Finneas' solo songs are so downright trite he makes white straight basic boy Shawn Mendes' last album sound inspired. Thank fuck for Billie Eilish.
Y'all learn words with more than two syllables and start trying to use them at ANY chance you see
They are still on Tidal! And they are absolutely amazing, they even go in depth for each album and ep
I still have it? I just scrolled down on LDR page and it’s super long by Rovi
"Fragmented attention" is such a perfect description. I'm borrowing that!
These are artists, though. I'd assume most of them love talking about themselves
You gave me a great idea. I just made a post about it lol.
what is this, 2016?
Lol pls what's their name
That's interesting at least haha
Maybe that's part of their lore or concept as a band?
Drop the band!
[Talker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZVQktzoF_c) is an awesome one woman solo project that sounds like a band but isn't a band (looking at you Tame Impala) with the Spotify description of "throwing glitter all over my emotions" like that is a good introduction. A bigger but not megastar group who does this is [Cold War Kids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7PlkjpabQY) with the description "you already know". As someone who discovered them via a random algorithmic guess, I did not know who they were.
Sometimes deluxe covers suck though
Yeah I love reading the spotify bios but I’m not expecting artists with a few thousand streams to have one. And afaik you had to be with a big label to change your bio from the default Rovi one in the past right?
Agreed, we literally have the entire internet at our fingertips...
same, I forget they even exist honestly
What's wrong with "tell me who you are or at least your country so I can figure out which of the 7 artists/bands with that name you are?" OP can't buy anything from the artist if they can't find them outside Spotify.
Actually your Spotify page aesthetic, is one of the easiest to manage you can just do it from Spotify 4 artists on mobile.
That's extremely hyperbolic for a thread that's full of mild annoyance at the most.
I had to double read to make sure it was just about the "about" section.. lmao. The sheer outrage at something so minute is wild. If you want to know about an artist or band you absolutely think Google or Wiki not spotify about section
I feel like Florence and Sia can get away with that because they're established artists. If you're a brand new artist, I'd like *something*. I'm old. I don't know who these people are. I don't need an entire essay, just a little something and maybe an instagram? A twitter? A LinkedIn?
Aurora's profile is giving nolimbs tbh
we love the mystery 👁️
Yes, it's not unreasonable to expect some information in an about section, but some here are saying they straight up stop listening to music if the artist "doesn't respect their fans enough" to update some info you can easily google anyways  Also OP isn't exactly sounding calm and resonable here, OP seems unreasonably angry over an innocuous lack of simple info
"a minimum amount of professionalism"   "someone should be fired"  😂😂😂 please touch grass. it's really not that important.
I'm not arguing with you. I am giving you my opinion. This is a silly thing to care about.
they used the word correctly, dont get hot. OP is whining because they feel entitled to cover letters.
Or at the very least they can get someone to do it for them
Good Kid
They have plenty of lore but the bio isn't related, I think they were just having fun with it lol  Edit: It does explain why one of them wears suspenders. That's basically it
Friday Pilots Club, they are crazy underrated
yeah but if its the same why keep the standard version
OP isn't simply asking for this info, they're demanding it and name-calling. It's a Karen post. If you know the name of the artist and the song, they can be located on Bandcamp or another DSP.
yeah its not like OP is fuming over empty spotify bios, but for some reason people can't read the room and realize *it isn't that serious*  people are here getting mad about someone being basically fake mad.
ur mom \[almondmilkhunni💋\]
I am going to get into Sia's discography. I don't know a lot about Florence though. Not gonna bother with her.
I haven't been on Spotify in ages so idk what the context is.
But that is how communication works. If you refuse to communicate, some will take it personally. And let's not pretend that artists are unaware of the existence of the page. Every platform has the bio section. Choosing not to put anything on the bio on your biggest professional platform implies a lot. I can imply that you don't take your music seriously and are inactive. It can imply you don't respect the platform and its users. It can imply you are disorganised. All of these things can make people decide that the one or two fluke songs they liked aren't worth the frustration.
It is *the* ad space for the *artist* on Spotify.  Spotify, is *the* app for music discovery. And they aren't using it. If you have people responsible for your visibility and promotion, and they are messing up the basics, they are incompetent. If you are signed to a label, that label has written a bio for you that they are sending to publications, etc. If that bio isn't on Spotify, someone messed up. This type of minor menial marketing stuff is literally what managers and labels are for and what they get paid for.   As a listener, you might not think the about page being empty is a big deal, but as an artist, that would be a huge missed opportunity. For independent artists doing all their own promotion, it's understandable if you miss some. But if you are paying someone to promote you and they miss *Spotify*, they should be fired.
It obviously matters when multiple people agree with OP. You can have your opinion but when youre dismissive of the other side while making no good points on your own
It doesn’t make a difference anymore since everything’s on streaming, as soon as deluxe versions release the standard version basically becomes obsolete. At that point the standard artwork basically disappears, which is weird if it’s supposed to be the defining image of the album era
I often play albums start to finish, including on Spotify, and I'd rather bookmark a version *without* a bunch of live/instrumental versions at the end so I can queue albums up rather than having to switch to a different album partway through... I don't mind if there are just a few extra songs though
Ah yes, OP is entitled Karen for being frustrated that artists don't bother to put up their basic info, but artists aren't being in any way demanding to expect people that discover them on Spotify to jump through hoops to find them on other sites, without even bothering to tell *which* site they are on. Truth is that the artist is the one losing. Your assumption that you can just Google artist name and song, shows you've never tried googling any more generic band or song names.
Thank you for getting it!
LMAO sorry, not a Spotify thing. A terminally-online gay brain rot thing. Ignore me.
☠️
Plenty of people can agree on things that are very very silly. Just because many people agree on something does not make it true, and OP is hardly courteous or civil, Half their comment is a mean-spirited rant. The tone isn't set by OP that this is a serious debate, jut their personal opinion peppered with dismissive insults. Their main point is "you aren't popular enough to do this" which is not particularly logical since its an appeal to the majority for authority. Personally, I don't have points to make because I have no stance or strong feelings. If no one puts anything in their Spotify about page I do not care. If they write a whole biography in there, I do not care. I am however amused about what people have the spare energy to get upset about to the point of insult.
I’m not sure about that. I usually add to my library the deluxe versions, but sometimes Spotify’s search will put the standard version first when I’m searching for a song.
OP’s post does seems entitled cause why do you need to know any of that?? You don’t even know what they want to become as a musician, maybe this is just a hobby or maybe they are just a bot 🤖. Just listen to the music, musicians don’t need to tell you anything, even if u think it’s ‘basic info’.
No, musicians don't need to tell anything, but if they don't, they get treated like bots and ignored. Most people don't like to listen to music created by bots and algorithms, so I think removing such "artists" from your playlist is perfectly reasonable behaviour. Good luck being an artist without an audience.
If the stream can't be played it might not be out in your timezone yet.

In case this is your first time going through a Linkin Park anniversary edition/demos tracklist: a lot of the new tracks are demos in various states of completion or, in many cases, incompletion. You will find pure instrumental tracks, tracks without choruses, versions of existing tracks with completely different lyrics (Shifter is From The Inside with rapping verses and Mike singing a completely different chorus), or even in some cases vocal test tracks. For example, the Breaking The Habit original Mike demo has a vocal take that was never meant for a final track, but is more a vocal guide/proof of concept for use in the studio.    So if you go in and feel some of the new tracks feel unfinished, that's because they are.
oh man, some great stuff here. my top recommendations are More the Victim, Massive, **Healing Foot**, and Resolution.
I'm digging these unreleased songs a lot.
I kept scrolling and scrolling LOL
One of the first non-pop albums I got into. It was 6th grade. Me and others at my after school program. I wanted to keep the pop(Hot 99.5) station on but one of em suggested putting on the rock station(DC 101.) And from that day is when I started getting into rock music, fall of 2005. And this album was one of the first albums I got into.   This morning I went on the swings and swung to the album. On the same swings I swung to these songs when I first got into em in 6th grade.  Edit: The album has 5 unreleased songs
No matter how much of a pop girlie I turned into…Linkin Park stays GOAT
Oh hell yeah, this is gonna be perfect for my Philadelphia to LA flight on Monday.  God, I can't believe this album is 20 years old. It is weird when the albums you listened to as a kid are hitting that milestone. I was 11 when this came out, I got it for Christmas 2003 when I was 12 and I was over the god damn moon, may have even been the best thing I got that year all things considered.
My god! 20th?!?!
Crazy how some of the demos are better than most of the album. Fighting Myself is honestly one of their best songs ever for me? Looking forward to digging into this.
the absence of Chester's vocals on Resolution actually makes it probably one of the most sad and impactful songs the band has made, especially if you play it right after Lost.
Be me  Go back in time to middle school me.  Tell them the Meteora 20th anniversary is 5 hours.   Middle school me cant handle it and dies.   I die.
You know the absolutely hilarious thing about Resolution though? We know for a fact that Chester technically recorded SOME vocals for the track. [Here are the vocals Chester recorded for that instrumental.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsqntilNBTw)      So imagine a version of Resolution with those lyrics on them.

As someone who doesn't really listen to Daniel Caesar, this is an excellent album! This is a very surface analysis but lyrically the album's dense, and thematically touches on emptiness and longing, and reminiscing the past. It's just a... sad album. It does get a little samey at times, but the production is lush enough to keep you engaged.  highlights: Cool, Pain Is Inevitable, Ocho Rios, Unstoppable (LOVE the chorus)  Only song I didn't vibe with was Superpowers. Some of the lyrics were a bit cringe ("You're the main character now"); and felt like a filler track though it sounds beautiful.  Also, Shot My Baby is *the* slower tempo, male version of Kill Bill by SZA.
Damn there’s zero talk about this. Wild with how good it is
Wow I wasn't expecting to like this as much as I do...I kind of fell off after Case Study 01 so I went into this blind. Really pleasant surprise and one of my favorite R&B releases of the year. Reminds me a lot of Grae by Moses Sumney.
First time tuning into his new music after the comments made in 2018 in defense of YesJulz.  I’m sure YesJulz wasn’t even his friend like that and she definitely didn’t come out to defend him after the self inflicted backlash. I mean did ask his listening audience to cancel him and they delivered, yet no one can deny that Freudian isn’t an amazing body of work. This album  speaks on heartbreak, loneliness, longing and self doubt. Toronto 2014, Cool, Valentina, and disillusioned are the songs I might circle back to and listen to the most out of the 15 songs in the album. Also, I’m pretty sure that’s Ty Dolla $ign  featured on homiesexual ( unless I need to get my ears checked, but I’m 100% sure it’s him).
Yeah I expected more visibility than this, Daniel never misses
Was he even cancelled?, his recent singles have 10m+ streams, his BBNG collab has 30m, he's doing alright seemingly
He wasn’t cancelled, but a lot of his black listeners paid Case Study 01 dust after his comments regarding race
The candace owens retweets definetely doesn't make him look any better.  I've been side eyeing him ever since
elaborate pls cuz i can’t stand her
Olivia recently parted ways with Island and this is her first release as an indie artist. Can I just say...THANK GOD. This song is everything I expect from Olivia- the vocals, the lyrics.   Besides "A Means to An End" a lot of her recent work has felt like it was chasing some kind of relevancy and was inauthentic to the person who put out "Was It Even Real?" Four years ago.  Sure, the sassy break up songs and bops are fun, but as an artist, Olivia just shines better with the more emotional material.   I love that this video feels like a random movie montage from a drama film in the late 2000s/early 2010s, lol. It's fun.  I was on the live for this release and Olivia seemed completely miserable, but I hope that she's at least happy she's finally able to put music out on her terms.
*Was It Even Real?* came out four years ago oh my GOD I'm getting old. I got into Olivia's music in like 2017 and I instantly had her pegged as the breakout star of that generation of rising sad girl singers, especially after her debut album was such a serve (I was telling everyone to listen!) but it just never seemed to happen for her and I'm not sure why.   Then her label kept chasing a hit and decided she would be a Tik Tok artist so her discography became a patchwork of disjointed singles and EPs that didn't receive proper follow-ups... I've enjoyed a lot of the songs individually but she was never going to be taken seriously as an artist that way, so maybe going independent is for the best. She already has a decent sized fanbase so I think she could still have a solid career as an independent artist if she wants it and can put in the work.
wait why did she seem miserable what happened? i watched her on a podcast a couple of weeks ago and last i remember she said she was sober and the happiest she’s ever been 😭
I certainly hope to see her work hard to promote her music now that she's indie and doesn't have the constraints of a label. The song is on a few Spotify playslists, including NMF, but besides her live...she posted a picture that just says "it's out".   I know her mental health isn't great rn, but I hope that doesn't stop her from really promoting her music and getting to put out the art she wants to.
Her therapist died last week, she's depressed and has no coping mechanisms because she's sober and clean, all of her friends are currently in Turks without her, and on the live people were being rude or something which made her move to the instagram live from tiktok.

Mixing sounds complete garbage. Was surprised by the low quality sound
Him putting a voice note of Kim talking about leaving Kanye is wild💀💀  What’s even weirder is that it doesn’t even fit the song? He’s talking about wanting someone to rescue him, what does that have to do with Kim & Kanye
i need drake bring back One Dance and give us a song of the summer
I wonder if Kim approved clearance to sample her divorce conversation.   This is mostly just Twitter fuel.
Sounds worse than the ai drake memes
honestly trying to see what people see in drake... everything he releases is so corny for his old age
I’m a Drake fan (unlike most of this subreddit lol), but this song sounds **very** poorly mixed, so poor that it takes away from the song itself.   It feels as if Drake recorded the song from shitty speakers and uploaded it to the streamers. Like vocals recorded from an iPhone don’t sound this poor, so I don’t even know how audio engineers didn’t catch this mix.
If you told me this was a demo/reference track then I’d have no choice but to believe you because this shit sounds awful.
Sad thing about it is the Kim Kardashian sample is the lone reason why anyone who isn't a Drake fan would care about this song. Drake himself just ain't that interesting.
He needs search and rescue for this song, because I almost fell asleep. It is a no for me.
at one point the song finished and NF played and i said “this is kind of good” then realized it wasn’t drake.  Yeah this was not great
This song is such a vibe!!

thought i was the only one, also the one from the radio mixing is way better
because him and kanye had beef a while back and it was rumored drake was fucking w kim
It sort of makes sense. He sings about how he worked hard to achieve a lot of things but he is not happy at where's he's at and he will try to achieve hapiness. He thinks it will come from someone saving him / falling in love. Kim is also succesful but was unhappy and she made the bold choice to leave Kanye for her own happiness. Idk before writing this it made more sense to me then now
To get people to talk about it.   Could also be more Kris PR moves because of the Trisitan/Khloe situation.
Feels stale and petty
His music peaked in 2010-2013
Honestly never mind was an exception in recent years.
> so corny for his old age  Did we just normalize being ageist ?  Madonna is so real for bringing this problem in her public appearances, because it’s insane how society is supporting the idea of gate keeping people from doing certain things based on their age.
Justin didn’t prod this his brother did
Yeah i know the lore but he isnt even shading kanye in the song. He’s singing about wanting someone
* 2011 - 2015
It’s immature regardless of age
What?, they're just saying they're being insanely immature and petty for someone who's a dad in his 30s.  No one is gatekeeping anyone
i’m assuming he’s wanting kim?
Eh I like Thank Me Later (2010) a lot
> It’s immature regardless of age  They specifically said “corny for his age”, which means it’s there if Drake would be younger this wouldn’t be corny by doing this and that’s what I’m talking about.
> they're just saying they're being insanely immature and petty   > for someone who's a dad  > in his 30s  And that’s exactly what ageism stands for though ???  Why having an offspring or being in your 30s should make your music more “mature”, whatever that should mean ?  It reminds me of time when Madonna was releasing fun carefree dance music wearing revealing clothing, which she was doing for a while anyways, but once she became 40+ y.o. woman, that suddenly became “corny” and “immature” for ageist crowds.
It’s not ageism it’s just facts💀. U can’t be doing the same stuff u did as a 18 year old at 30-40. It’s called growing up
Its not that the music itself should be mature, it's that someone at that age shouldn't be always inciting petty beefs for no reason other than twitter discourse.  The madonna comparison is not it, making fun music is not the issue.  Or even making stuff like SZA.  It's starting beef for no reason, always.  Maybe it's because of the megan disses or CLB's lyrics, but I have way less patience for Drake's bs after all the shit he pulls.  I thought that after the Pusha T beef he'd learn his lesson, but I guess not.  He just can't sit still and not be confrontational.
My point is that age of an artist shouldn’t be something which make the same action seen “not corny” in their youth suddenly “corny” in their adulthood.  It’s understandable if you’re not a fan of petty beefs, disses or Drake’s recent actions/music releases - especially if you “have way less patience for Drake’s bs” recently - there’s a scroll function specifically designed for people to access posts about topics they like/love and ignore something that tests their patience and annoys them (unless they keep on *choosing* a masochistic path of torturing themselves by visiting, listening songs and commenting in threads about artists which they “have no patience” for).

Lights was my top artist last year because I had PEP on repeat so much, and unsurprisingly the dEd version of every song helps me love the songs even more.  She literally refuses to miss!
Only 4 songs in and wowwwww these are stunners. Easy money 🤍🤍🤍
this woman is such a gift. every song she puts out is amazing and she always releases at least two great versions of each one. love her so much and want so badly to see her on tour ❤️💛💙
I love how this keeps the feeling of her acoustic albums while doing something new. Lights never misses for me, and this is no exception.
Lights is so underrated. They way she reimagines each of her albums is incredible and shows such artistry. Constantly impressed by her.
Lights is in my Top 3 artists of all time, she NEVER misses and this album is no exception 🖤💙❤️

Lights is truly so underrated, she’s been hitting on every album since pre 2010
I saw her on tour for Little Machines and she was excellent. Highly recommend!
I preferred the original people, but the lyrics here hit hard too
maybe it’s the music video, but I actually preferred this to part 1. the lyrics are beautiful as always and I love how well iu’s voice fits into it! I’m a little confused about the english lyrics, but tbh it doesn’t bother me that much. maybe I’m biased, but imo the gorgeous lyrics and  iu’s soothing voice make up for it. definitely one of my favorite releases this year.
This definitely aim for korean success. Not the type of my song as much. But IU as usual sound beautiful. I think his best collab was so far away remix ft jin n jungkook. Now, i am curious whats his title track gonna be? Would its still be more chill or badass ala daechwita? I hope the latter because i miss badass cinematic mv by BTS lol.
I love the chill vibe, it's perfect for spring.  South Korea is gonna eat this up.
It’s actually IUs part that I was humming after first listen. I didn’t realize the lyrics were unusual till I came to Reddit and said: oh let me go back and see what she was actually saying lol   I get the gist of what she was saying, but overall it just gives riddle to me…which I’m fine with. Sing that riddle girl!
So far away with suran is better imo

I have to look up the exact interview, but I think about how interesting it would've been if she stuck to her original plans and put One Kiss and Electricity onto *Future Nostalgia* instead of the debut's reissue, because it just makes so much more sense - thematically, not time-wise. Those really felt like the first precursors that cemented where Dua is now.  It's not like the music she was making was radically different, but it felt like for the entirety of self-titled, her/her team were floundering trying to find something to stick, even after New Rules took off lowkey. This really felt like the metaphorical pat on the back telling her everything would be alright, and **thank god** that was nudging her towards the dancefloor.
One Kiss deserves a mention in the Popheads Hall of Fame just for the choreo alone
One Kiss was electrifying when I first heard it. That lyric video/visualizer of the fuzzy purplish analog TV. Oof. I was in the middle of my first big work project, having a Golden Age with weed, feeling like I was on the right path for the first time in eons. It was a sunny mid-spring day, I remember, when it came out, right after a 3-hour trip back from our remote offices. STOMPER. I remember thinking it sounded so modern and I really hoped it would usher in an era of that *sound*. But that didn't really materialize. I discovered Azealia Banks's "Anna Wintour" the following day or two and thought "oh shit is it happening" but no it didn't. It didn't happen.  One Kiss is special to me, like. It's a very well-done song and the constantly shifting song structure is captivating, I love it so much. It's still my favorite Duer work.
i cant believe it’s been 5 years
2025 will mark 10 years since Dua debut. What kind of insanity
My husband and I played One Kiss during our wedding ceremony right after we said I do and the officiant said you may now kiss 🥰 Then the chorus blared as we kissed and walk down the aisle to the exit. It was fabulous!
Bring this Calvin back
Such a unique sounding bop still. 'Slide' with Frank Ocean shaped these type of chords and synths for Calvin I think. The wind instruments on top of the hook really elevate it to the highest voltage.
For me the highlight of this single was the performance with St. Vincent at the 2019 Grammys - still watch it weekly.
thank god we got 'that' choreography which i ultimately believe led to better stage presence and  future nostalgia 😌
1. How the fuck   2. Peaking at fucking #26 in the US should be a criminal offense with regard to this fucking BOP.
Dua really had a great streak of non-album tracks for a minute there honestly
now that's a fuckin HIT right there. absolutely love hearing it come on in the club and i need to return to the future nostalgia tour.
Some of their best work respectively. One of the cuntiest mainstream pop songs in the past 5 years.
I also wonder what a Calvin x Beyoncé song would sound like… crazy they’ve never worked together.
[This performance of this song is iconic now.](https://youtu.be/bH7ZaBNeKcM)
This sub and the term “magnum opus” I swear 😂
I’ve actually always hated this song, the music the lyrics the vibe just everything is so dead to me and has no soul. A pass from me
no way it has been 5 years
5 years?!?!?! Time is slipping AWAYYYYY
I'm in the minority but I consider S/T to be a lot closer in quality to FN than it's given credit for because it's hit after hit after hit even if the cohesion isn't as up to scratch
I might be in the minority but electricity is my all-time favorite song from dua lipa. Really wish it would've been a part of future nostalgia but I can see why it wasn't.
I thought the label introduced her as mostly indie for status/distinctiveness, before a planned turn to dance because it always suited her.
Damn 5 years already, feels like we literally skipped the corona years
This might sound hyperbolic, but that terrible chereo honestly kinda defined her career. It forced her to level up her stage presence and chereo for Future Nostalgia. But at the same time, she still does that dance ironically and she isn’t afraid to poke fun at it.
I love these kinds of memories, when a song is so good the time you heard it is cemented in your brain
>  I really hoped it would usher in an era of that sound. But that didn't really materialize.  In my opinion it did. Retro 80s pop really blew up a year and a bit later. It wasn't the exact dance sound that One Kiss was but it was in the same spectrum.
Dude this comment made me feel so nostalgic for no reason whatsoever
Really? I have the feeling she's been around forever 😂 I connect her so much to summer 2017 with New Rules being inescapable both irl and online lol  And then doubling down with One Kiss the following summer  Now, after the pandemic, those years seem so distant in time
I remember when she only had 3 songs out… wow time flies 😕
Awesome idea!
just imagined this in my head omg thats perfect
I was hoping we were getting this Calvin for Funk Wav vol 2…. we know how that went
Weird that no one else has mentioned it yet! When OP said "that performance" first thing that came to mind was "do they not like St Vincent???", and *then* I remembered the choreo thing  I too watch it at least once every two weeks
The best fucking pop song you've ever heard gets released, is a massive hit in almost all of the world.  The US:   > Peak in the 20s in the Hot 100 and MAYBE a double platinum certification if we feel charitable.  Many such cases.
Right 1v1 me on smash
I agree, hencewhy I said both her albums weren't radically different lol  Cohesion is key tho. I just think (while it makes sense) that because her debut was so long, there were def a couple moments of filler/basically-demos thrown in amongst smashes because they wanted to show *all* of what she could do, rather than what FN did which was confidently deliver a tight package that showed her precise vision.   TL;DR: With FN, she told the world exactly who she was; with S/T, she gave the world options on who she could be. That being said, justice for Begging
Same here. There’s just something about Electricity that makes me feel so damn good every time I hear it.
that music video lives in my mind rent free! Makes me also want to dance around in my underwear.
Which is one of the reasons why I’ve switched from a Dua disliker to a stan.   She got criticized for her debut being bloated and not really unique, and her choreo. But she took it on board, released a much better, tighter album, and improved her dancing AND can laugh at herself. Not taking herself too seriously and taking valid criticism on board makes her very likable in my eyes.
Thanks! I was proud of myself for thinking of it lol
:)
I’m a Slave 4 U by Britney
Justice for Garden as well, I'd love to see that back on her setlist
Welp she will probably be shelved..😫
How do artists keep making this mistake??
goddamnit 😭😭
girl RUN
I guess doomsday really is close at hand 🥴
Was surprised to find out she wasn’t already signed, especially since she has a collab with FINNEAS. Good for her I guess, but isn’t RCA responsible for the whole Normani situation?   With her style of music and general aesthetic she’d easily fit in with Interscope. I just hope they don’t hold her back like they so often do with their artists.
Get ready to battle
I hope it was a smaller label under RCA that will fight for her that she signed to.  Also i have insider info about Normani that her situation is not as cut and dry as you think. It’s not just RCA but she herself is a “perfectionist” and convincing her to put songs out is a struggle. Motivation would’ve never came out if it was up to her.  Edit: spelling
💀
Out of the loop here, what’s wrong with RCA Records?
Hopefully this means a repress of the Urban Outfitters blue variant of Five Seconds Flat will happen now that she is signed to a major label.
incredible news!!!
Rip
it’s over 😩
Rip to a real one
Sad news :(
god fucking damnit
Do we need to book a marching band?
She was already signed to an indie label with AWAL distribution. But not a major.
I’m pretty sure normani is uh… a special situation on RCA. [My friend put it best](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/851835432886599761/1093768977395761303/IMG_0278.png)
I never understood why the Grammy eligibility period isn't just the calendar year
So a Grammy darling is releasing on September 1st, 8th, or 15th. My guesses are either Adele or Taylor (Speak Now TV?).
>The Recording Academy has extended its eligibility date to Sept. 15 — two weeks later than the Aug. 31 date the organization proposed just a month ago.
Wild that a song released on September 16, 2023 won’t be nominated for the Grammys until February 2025.
I always thought the eligibility periods were pretty comprehensible, probably because I'm used to measuring time by fiscal year. In some workplaces fiscal year starts October 1st and ends September 30th. For the longest time that was the Grammy's eligibility period.  I think people are just really hung up on the fact that it's not a calendar year.
They were shaking because SZA had AOTY on lock. They were right to fear her!
It seriously makes no sense. With the Emmys and Tonys it at least makes some sense because of the way those industries operate.
[this article from 2019](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/grammy-eligibility-year-close-one-month-early-august-1197451/) implies the cutoff is directly tied to the broadcast of the ceremony?  >The eligibility year for the 62nd annual Grammy Awards will close on Aug. 31, one month earlier than it has in each of the past nine years. The change is the result of next year’s Grammy telecast being moved up two weeks to Jan. 26, 2020. That change was made so the Grammys wouldn’t go head-to-head with the 92nd annual Academy Awards, which moved up two weeks to the Grammys’ intended airdate of Feb. 9, 2020.
This would work because there are hardly any major releases around Christmas time
Cause an album that releases in November or December (example: SOS, heroes and villains, her loss) is hard to put in a similar category of AOTY alongside releases from the beginning of that year (example: Dawn FM, DS4Ever)
not taylor because she already has Midnights for this eligibility year
Clearly it's the second act of renissance just so bey can loose to a mediocre white man again!
It could finally be Rihanna’s long awaited comeback.
As someone who doesnt follow this at all that closesly? Is the two weeks that much of a drastic change? is there anything from last year that, by the rules, would've been suddenly eligible?
If Renaissance could not win AOTY neither is SZA!
Theoretically it’s so voters have the time to listen to everything
I wouldn't put it past her tbh
Daddy Del Rey is getting BNA, SOTY, AOTY, and ROTY.
Premature congrats are in order to Ed Sheeran!!!
Y'all are not talking about the same person who waited for the eligibility to end so she could release Evemore, and Midnights on separate runs from Folklore and RED TV. She knows the eligibility period.
It seems so unlikely though that the Grammys will award the re-releases any major awards that I’m not sure why she does seem to be spacing it or considering the eligibility. Like if ATW10 didn’t win any Grammys seems hard to think any other singles would, and I don’t think they even nominated Fearless or Red TV for album categories. Like Speak Now’s chances of winning album of the year seem so unlikely.
there’s actually been a ton of rumors about another Adele release just in the last few days. I also think it’s unlikely but it has been floating.
Adele was spotted filming carpool karaoke recently so there are rumours that she’s releasing a new album
There’s been some rumors circulating about an Adele release in a couple months, so there’s some weight to that. I don’t think I’d read too much into it, but that’s a possibility.  Taylor wouldn’t release another album while Midnights is competing.  I haven’t really paid attention to the Grammys until 2020, but I think Billie or Lizzo could be possible. Maybe even Olivia, since she was one of the biggest breakout stars so far this decade.
Yes it is. Because the Grammys are known to bend rules for Grammy darlings
Nothing from last year would suddenly become eligible (or ineligible). It will mean that anything released between 1-15 September 2023 will compete at the 2024 Grammys instead of 2025.
I know that, my dear. It’s just wild to not know any big hitters coming in the next 4 (!!) months and doubly sus that they had it extended.
AND she's earnest about it
It’s true that she probably wants Midnights to have the spotlight over Speak Now TV. Idk how she doesn’t get exhausted gunning for AOTY sooo much after winning 3 times already  ETA: thought about it for half a second longer and answered my own question, she probably just wants her legacy to be “the best” and winning AOTY 4 times would somewhat accomplish that
She didnt submit them for the major album awards, there were some for ATW10 and some vaults but that was it. And she wont make SNTV or 1989TV compete with Midnights.
ATW10 did win a grammy
- ATW10 could mean "All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)", a track from *Red (Taylor's Version)* (2021) by Taylor Swift.  ---  ^[/u/PungentPomegranates](/u/PungentPomegranates) ^(can reply with "delete" to remove comment. |) ^[/r/songacronymbot](/r/songacronymbot) ^(for feedback.)
All to well TV literally won a Grammy lol and was nominated for song of the year.
I agree, but I can’t think of another reason the Grammys would push their eligibility
And that’s partially why I think the Grammys are such a joke.
So then the simple question is, why couldn't an artist just move their release up a few weeks?  Especially since we're talking about *September*, not a few weeks from today.
She has a lot of drive for awards season. Her response for Reputation not being nominated for AOTY it's one of the most honest things I've heard from a celebrity. She absolutely wants it and goes for it every time. I know the promo for Midnights during grammy season will be crazy. Can probably expect Eras Tour Live right when the voting opens.
I looked it up because I couldn't remember. She didn't submit Fearless TV at all to Grammys, which I'd forgotten, but she fully submitted Red TV to album of year and the country album and song categories. Which was sort of my point, like if Red TV can't even get nominations for album categories seems so unlikely SNTV or 1989TV could reasonably win a major category and I doubt they would really take that much shine away from Midnights if they released in same eligibility period. Like 1989 especially already won album of the year, they aren't going to give it to it again.
I guess I forgot it won music video. lol. But I still think my general point stands, that like the re-recrodings are very unlikely to sweep or pick up more than maybe 1 or two Grammys, which in the context of Taylor's career isn't all that much. So like spacing each album out potentially to be in its own eligibility period seems a bit unnecessary in my opinion.
It’s a strange move. The big artists all seem to know who’s releasing when and move dates around to accomodate before the public knows. Maybe there’s an artist who’s releasing in early September who just found out another artist they see as a threat is releasing late September and don’t want to compete with them for Grammys? And/or that moving the date forward would mean they don’t get the #1 or something?
Oooh what was her response for Reputation not being nominated. I've never heard of this before
If Midnights wins over SOS I will actually set the whole place on fire. I understand Bey's noms have critiques like too many songwriters and shit but SOS is not only entirely self written but is also having a way more successful chart run than Midnights. Sza has got both the sales, the acclaim, the songwriter cred going for and I'd be so mad if Taylor wins this one. I don't even think this album is worth a nomination I'm sorry, it will be because shes Taylor and it sold a billion but other than that, no.
I misremembered, hmm so not submitting was only for Fearless TV. They shouldn't be eligible if you ask me. Anyway, Taylor's really close to overexposure so I doubt she'd be releasing TVs till maybe late this year.
There’s a clip in her documentary when she finds out. She’s quite upset and insists on needing to “make a better album next time”
Have you looked at the credits for SOS??? It’s very much not entirely self written, most songs have 5-7 credited writers and 3-5 credited producers lol. But the amount of songwriters an album has also doesn’t matter at all and shouldn’t be taken into account for album of the year. Those critiques against Renaissance were completely ridiculous
SOS is not mostly self written. Midnights sold much more than SOS, in fact, had Midnights been released the same week as SOS in the US, the latter wouldn't have got any week at #1.  The Academy votes are not based on commercial or critical succes anyway, it's mostly about the kind of music they prefer and SZA is unlikely to win because of that. I don't think Taylor will win either for that matter.
You might as well prepare your kerosene now then bc this is the Grammy's we're talking about and they almost never award PoC in AotY. On top of that Taylor is a fierce campaigner too when she wants a win and after the Harry Styles win I'm just resigned to her getting her 4th at this point.
Don’t know why you are getting downvoted for this. Time for someone else to win AOTY. SZA will be fitting and the album checkmark all the boxes
5 seconds after receiving the news on the phone.
They got downvoted for being factually incorrect about everything- not because they think sza should win over Taylor.   Frankly,  I don't see sza getting the votes if Beyonce can't, and I don't see Midnights winning either- it's too inconsistent.   I expect someone not currently in the conversation to win.
That's all I'm saying. The fact that swifties think she deserves it for Midnights on the back of the sales alone is everything that's wrong with the Grammy's at this point.  This is not a 25 vs Lemonade situation. Because lemonade had a lot going against it, it didn't sell as much as 25, didn't have a huge hit, wasn't a singer-songwriter product.   With Midnights and SOS they're both selling well, both have huge hits, and both artists have legit songwriting cred that the academy goes up for.
It’s not factually incorrect. Reddit is filled with opinions. Your statement was an opinion… No facts stated. No where did the poster say it was a fact
None of these two will win. Happens every time, if an album is released to close to the release cut out, it doesn't have legs to win everything after. Look at Thank U Next going home empty handed. There's still a lot of times for more hits to come and they both will probably leave with two or three wins each if that.
...they claimed sza wrote her album by herself and that the album is performing better than Midnights on the charts. Those are factually incorrect statements.

my summer-has-arrived song has arrived
Heat
Everything
Missed aminé so much
So excited to see Kaytranada open for the Weeknd this summer 😍
As expected, this is so fire.
KAYTRAMINE is going to dominate the skylofte2 Hot 100 this summer I can feel it already
3 very talented ppl and they came up with such an OK song. Amine's lyrics are meh. His French was cool as hell. The production is sharp though, I wish it was someone else vocally on it.

Was this song never out before this? I feel like I've been hearing it on tiktok for years
Damn I want Billie to sound like this on her next album
She is BEATING those whispering allegations 👏👏
she is back 👏
Shit he got Billie on this???? Sounds heavenly as a Mashup. Perfect tiktok vibey hit
I wish it was extended with the beat at the end of the live performance. Love the song, but it does feel a bit unfinished.
She sounds so gooooooood. She’s baaaack.
Labrinth should produce a whole album for a main pop gurlie
Why'd you lie in the title billie isnt officially credited
I don’t really like this song, but billie’s singing is pretty.
I like Billie on this! Wouldn’t mind a similar vibe for her next album.
I miss listening to labrinth
i believe this is Billie's first ever song as featured artist right? this is so good
It was played in a Euphoria episode in 2020 and wasn't released until now
Me too. I want to know how big her voice goes.
I was fine with her doing that at first to make her stand out from everyone else, but this next album I do hope she expands like she did at the end of her last one.
what an awful dystopian last sentence. not a world i want to live in
Yes!!! They performed it together several months ago- I’ve been praying to the pop gods for a release 😭😭😭
Him producing an album for Lana would be insane. Would love for him to work with Billie as well
She’s not officially credited cuz of her label but she’s literally got her own verse and harmonises in the chorus. plus she’s in the mv, I’d say it’s a fair title
I think she was? And then it was taken off?  Or maybe I'm just going crazy.
She has an unlisted feature on Sirens by Denzel Curry, she sings on the chorus
lovely with khalid is one of her biggest songs!
Oh nice! Its cool that he added billie
*2019 but point still stands
Walk with me: Olivia rodrigo for a melodrama style sophomore album
Wait why does her label do this? No credits on this track is just absurd
:(
yeah that's what i meant
Although strangely she doesn’t have an artist credit on the song.
with Labyrinth or you want Antonoff to collect another pop girlie to produce for 😭
Finneas just responded to a fan that was angry about this. They think uncredited features are “cool aesthetically”. Whatever that means but it was their choice. They do have credits in writing and producing, there’s just no (ft. Billie Eilish) in the song title on streaming platforms.
He is so fucking pretentious lmao
She was also uncredited for her feature on Sirenz by Denzel Curry back in 2018.  I heard it was because of label issues but I wonder if it was actually for this reason
Yuh she clearly don’t gaf ab charts no more

Yay! This album healed my soul
I met Hatchie and she’s extremely cool and nice. I can’t wait to hear this.
Love this album. It's like pop shoegaze.
BIG 90s vibes. My fave decade of music, I'm very pleased with all the new tracks
Nooooo my dreams of getting an album full of Nosedive... will check this out regardless cuz GtWA was one of my fave records last year
One of my favorite albums of 2022 - Hatchie didn’t miss with this album!  The bonus tracks add to the album and I’m glad she released them.
It's a great album. Recommended.
I loved this album sonically excited to give it a listen.
Amazing album front to back. Excited to listen to the deluxe tracks!
Haven't stopped listening to it ever since it came out and now the DELUXE edition too. I'm about to cry.
Isn’t that just dream pop?
Lol yeah, that's what I was thinking as well.
Idk there is a little bit more bubblegum/ audible crack in this than say a beach house or mazzy star. Like Britney Spears took a bunch of acid at a 90’s rave.

AI generated visuals for the lyric video really fit the song! (derogatory)
Based on a Haddaway sample? I’m terrified to press play
Anne-marie just be doing anything at this point
Not another one...
Everything that’s old is new
I for one like it and welcome our 90s-hit-sampling overlords with open arms

I'm just happy coi Leroy isn't singing that dumb song every minute.
That's a bit disrespectful.
Checks gonna check
Those royalty checks from South Korean's playing her 2002 song on loop since 2019 are drying out ok!!!!
This is taking me out so bad 💀💀💀
the song is disrespectful
She also canceled her European tour last year I had tickets to, i get sis got zero cash atm
It's a fun song, who cares if it sampled lol.
Oh idc about the sample I just think it's generic and boring. it's not like OG song was too sacred to sample or anything, it's just a meme song
It's a cover at best, and whether a good one is subjective

Jesus at the Gar Bar, Jesus is a Rockstar. Is there anything this guy can’t do!?
Full of bops tbh! Keep Me Safe is one of my favourite Aussie songs of the last few years
Their best album so far!!! Really good
Your honor, it’s a serve 💅
The title intrigued me and I went in not knowing anything about them but omg!! Bop and after bop!! I love it.

I personally think distasteful queer music is back on the menu
Damn I'm in the opposite party here lol, I don't usually like Dorian's music but this kinda goes into "so bad it's good" territory for me
dorian is verrry hit or miss for me, but i actually really like this sorrry
why am i the only one that's popping my fucking pussy rn?
I know Dorian is leaning *heavily* into irony and mocking incels and such, but hearing the word "normie" in a song just makes me cringe and never want to listen to it again.  Even outside of that though, I just don't like this. I really miss Flamboyant era Dorian.
This sounds like dorian doing a mindless self-indulgence song which I love. The hook is especially giving Jimmy vibes and I can actually listen to this without feeling bad about listening to a groomer
Y'all have sticks up your asses this is a bop 🤠
@flamboyant era come home baby the kids miss u
I haven't had much interest in their music lately, but after these strong reactions I'm just dying to hear it. I'm in so much suspense  edit:  :(
I actually don’t hate this? And I wasn’t a big fan of My Agenda. It doesn’t sound bad to me 🤷🏼‍♀️
Im going to wait for the MV and a few interviews. I’m not sure what makes this Freak Mode project different to My Agenda.   Musically I do like it. There’s a lot of interesting hooks and textural layers. Lyrically I thought we already traversed this ground though
I'm absolutely gonna live this even though it probably sounds like dog crap
Y’all weren’t kidding. 💀
I actually like My Agenda, but this sucks, My Agenda at least had bangers so the lyrics didn't really matter much to me, but this?, I hate using this word, but it's so cringe.
I love Dorian... but this is just foul. It's hard to believe that they've become so irony-poisoned that they actually think this sounds good/fun. I guess the new album is gonna fucking suck. Fun!
Well if you liked My Agenda I think you'll probably like this, if you have ears...
This song needed to be workshopped a bit more cause it has a lot of great things going for it, but Jesus Christ the final product is just…sloppy in such an unappealing way. And trust me, I love filth as much as the next guy, but this feels unnecessarily raunchy, like a 4channer trying to how “fucked in their humor is.”      And I don’t wanna hear any “BuT iTs a pArOdY! ITs iRoniC!” I’m aware of irony and satire, but there’s such a thing as irony poisoning, and this really feels like that
ok we did the My Agenda album already can we move on please
Kinda lukewarm on it. It's like, fine. Still interested to hear more, and happy for more new non-remix, non-cardboard-box-ed-sheeran-cover Dorian Electra music.
I did enjoy my agenda, but this is pretty bad
Don't love this... I put it on, immediately forgot it was playing, then thirty seconds later was like "what the fuck is this?"
Flamboyant my dear come back
It’s like if you mixed Dorian’s last era with the sloppiness and white-rapping of Kesha’s aesthetic. If you like “Tonight” from High Road and the 4 bonus tracks from My Agenda you will probably like this.   The production is great but the song lacks substance
God, what happened? This is fucking awful. Like some disgusting vomit sludge pouring into my mouth. Really disappointed. I'd rather lick my dad's hairy nuts than put this shitty slop into earholes.
Kinda confused as to why *this* is the one where yall draw the line ? They've been making garbage music for years and this is ironically of their most "normal", should I even say "decent" track in a while ? 😭
Nah, it’s fun. Dorian always delivers obnoxious fun in spades. People getting kinda weird and hand-wringy about the sound and irony is pretty par for the course at this point with their music.
Yeah I’m loving it too haha can’t wait for the visuals
Yeah I actually like it idk lol
Ya they dont get it
The hook melody is really good and catchy and the production is great (or maybe I'm just that starved for some Clarence Clarity production) but god damn you're right, the lyrics are really hard to get past. And that verse is just not it idk
I have a cock in my pussy and I still don't like this
I love this song too
Wtf yall didnt like my agenda???
This sounds nothing like my agenda tbh. Different themes too
I've reached the point where I unironically listen to thay cover 😭
Why did you make me read that bestie 😀
their fun music is better when you dont really take them too seriously.
Right? One of the most fun albums in a long while.

This should’ve been the lead single over whatever Wings was. It flopped anyway so they might as well pretend that was just a teaser and call Waffle House the lead.   It doesn’t really sound like the JBs but it’s a catchy song. I wish Joe had sung more in that register after his high note. He should be included more in conversations about the best vocalists in pop right now.
The beat is sick but I don’t like the way they’re singing. I think this track would be cooler if they used a vocal effect
Definitely a better song than Wings. Again, it’s still pretty short, but the fact that I didn’t feel like this was a teaser was a miracle on its own. Catchier lyrics as well that don’t feel entirely underwritten. 7/10.
Wheres the Tame Impala inspired DNCE album Joe I will never forget that you announced that
It still baffles me that they are making ringtone songs. Like a 3:20 song would really hurt them?    Other than the length, it sounds great. Sonically I like what they're doing. It sounds like grown up Disney music lol. Catchy, safe but interesting enough to Shazam if I heard this in the wild.
This song is way more catchier than Wings. It should’ve been the lead single instead of Wings.
I want an Ethel Cain Waffle House song now
This is so catchy and I love Joe’s vocal but I wish this was like a minute or so longer? It feels rushed
Both this one and Wings feel like they lack a chorus?? They both have something that sounds like a pre-chorus that ends up going nowhere. That being said, this one is a step up from Wings for sure
It's not bad but again, barely 2.5 mins long... I guess that's a step up from Wings?
This so SO MUCH BETTER than anything they have released since ‘First Time’ in 2013.   This is a banger. Pure pure banger. Although confused at who is singing in the first verse. Is that Joe? Or did they throw a Kevin in there finally?
Waffle house putting a lot of $$$ into viral marketing lately
THIS IS THE ONE!!!!! My only complaint is that there’s no key change but WHO NEEDS IT? What a Banger!
I hate how they been giving away their new songs on tiktok/IG, etc… so when the full song is out, you already know the beat and the lyrics and it’s not exciting anymore. Tbh their new stuff including wings and waffle house is just plain horrible and this is coming from a JB fan back in 2007. Quite sad actually. Even happiness begins was way better than this crap and I remember when they were teasing “sucker”, they were only teasing a bit of the beat and Joe’s whistle. Plus why would they name their album “the album”? Seems like they put 0 effort in coming up with a meaningful name. Again, it’s just horrible. And also, waffle house is barely 2min 30 seconds…Based on the last two songs, the album doesn’t look promising at all.
Really love the song!    You’re adults guys, you don’t need to censor yourself!
The bar was on the floor after Wings. At least this feels like a song, even though it's still only 30 seconds longer. Getting retro Broadway ensemble vibes here.
Someone tell me who is the chicken and who is the egg between Jonas Brothers and Harry Styles. I feel like they both make very similar music.
This is much better than what Wings was. Just wish it was longer.
I really love that repeating “hey nah” in the verses. So catchy
>He should be included more in conversations about the best vocalists in pop right now.  I've been saying this ever since I wrote that write up for the 10th anniversary of his flop solo "Fastlife'. Joe can sing his ass off. His live vocals are insane, and he has a wide vocal range. I wonder why he never reached full potential as a vocalist.
Wings is there Me!
Ahhh first time. One of the best songs of their career that everyone seems to have forgotten. Starting with they themselves. I really think they like to ignore that whole period as it was a commercial letdown, but that song is fantastic.
the Jonas brothers carried harry styles to term for several long years in the late 2000s if you know your herstory
Because when they were immensely popular he had weird technical skills. Nick did too but for Joe it was a lot of screeching. Then around DNCE times he got retaught
i always thought he was the front man growing up. learning it was actually worlds-largest-stick-in-his-ass nick made me a lil sad
I ran that song to the ground. I really liked First Time. I remember when it came out I thought it was like their goodbye song to fans lol. After that I had no clue if they would ever get back together
That and the queen that is PomsPoms!!  I would kill for a 2023 Version of that!
I thought he was at the beginning then it changed to Nick? Or maybe that was just my opinion lol.
nah, from the doc at least, nicks always been the front man
Joe had big front man energy 😂

Can more artists start releasing their least personal albums?
Hit after hit after hit. She slayed so hard for this
I’m an unabashed dance-pop Ellie fan. I loved *Delirium* and really wasn’t feeling *Brightest Blue* at all, so this album is a huge breath of fresh air for me.   It’s less daring and dynamic than *Delirium*, but I also think the uniformity of *Higher Than Heaven*’s sound makes for a very consistent and pleasurable listening experience. It’s lush, sharply-produced, synthy dance-pop. And Ellie’s voice, as always, gives the music such an ethereal, magical quality.   All in all, I’m loving this. One of my favorites of the year so far and I’m glad it’s ***finally*** out. My current favorite of the non-singles is “Love Goes On”, but that could change.
Really digging this. Not genre-bending, but lots of ear worms. Looks like she worked with super producer Greg Kurstin and Dua Lipa producer Koz. I can definitely hear both Kurstin and Lupa in the tracks.
Loved the album but I'm mad about the artwork 🥲 The standard album cover is so pretty
Temptation didn't come out to play, she is that bitch
I’ve realized that I’m an Ellie STAN and this album proved me correct!   I’ve liked all of her albums and this one is easily one of my favorites
As a longtime Gouldigger, *this* is what I wanted 'Delirium' to be. Big, bombastic stadium sized electro pop that doesn't lose her identity (to the point "How Long" kinda sticks out to me because it's so obvious she didn't write it when compared to the other songs on the record). The deluxe songs are a bit weaker, but the standard edition is her tightest body of work since 'Halcyon'.  BTEOTN is one of her best songs in years, I am so in love with it. Euphoria. HTH reminds me of 'Diamonds & Dancefloors' in that both records aren't personal but are wall-to-wall pop bangers. I see myself throwing this album on often in the future
If this album had Dua Lipa's name on it, everybody would be talking about it. It's a solid candidate for AOTY imo. We need more music like this!
Still surprised Miracle isn't on it
Literally half of this album was released as singles 💀 But honestly a pretty solidly produced record. A lot of the songs kind of blend into each other, though.   My favourites: Easy Lover, BTEOTN, Intuition, Better Man (so dark!!)
Bop X 16.  Amazing album!
This is excellent! Incredibly consistent with a LOT of standouts!  Edit: Temptation -> Intuition -> Tastes Like You is an INSANELY good run
It’s out at last. Hallelujah!
Tastes Like You is pop perfection.
am I the only one that swapped out easy lover for the solo version on my playlist? It's my only nitpick with the album. Solo version fits better
Jesus died after hearing this Masterpiece
this rollout has been absolutely wild (the single drops have been a mess ofc but also the “least personal album yet” publicity has been crazy the past few days) but in the end, she delivers. i’ll always have to check for ellie, she’s one of those girls that may not always be cutting edge but her voice and artistry resonate with me and she’ll always have a special place in my heart 💙🩵💚  favorites are probably midnight dreams, by the end of the night, and like a saviour. the first is so groovy for an ellie song, the second is one of the most emotional moments on the record, and the third is just a masterfully crafted pop song, the engineering on it is *immaculate*.  hard to say where it will stack up since it is a bit less emotional than her other albums, but right now i’m thinking: halcyon > lights > brightest blue > higher than heaven > delirium >>>>>>>>>>>>> EG.0
Smash smash smash smash… - woah vicky
She put her whole gouldussy in Temptation and Just For You!!!!
i've never been the biggest ellie fan besides a few songs but i'm listening rn and this album SLAPS
What sort of wicked boppery is this? Ellie has never been on my radar really but this album is straight bangers! What a fun album.  Like a Saviour!! ~~Justice for British spelling~~ What a track.
The only thing holding me back from saying this album is a masterpiece,  Is the lack of bass.  Did anyone else have this issue with the album? Or is this a direction that electro-pop is moving in?
A pop emergency tbh
Ellie from off the top rope with this one! Front-to-back filled with bangers. Gonna be on of my most played albums this year methinks!
First full Ellie project for me, and this is the best dance pop album of the year so far. She realllly served and a lot of people should be scared cuz wow.
Cure for Love is a fantastic track
Rise up elliephants, ellievators, gouldiggers, whatever her Stans are called! She has never let me down. By the end of the night just might be my song of the year  And if I like squint I guess I can maybe hear dua on a couple of these but idk. I think Ellie’s voice is just too distinct and it’s throwing me off lol. I can’t imagine her singing like a savior or let it die or even by the end of the night really. I def get the comparisons though
This is what I wanted from Diamonds and Dancefloors tbh
I see reviews describing the new Ellie Goulding album as fun, light-hearted, frivolous, impersonal. Ellie said the album is not personal but meaning that it is not biographical. I cannot imagine it as something impersonal when it is so full of her: her instrumental vocal writing, her unusual timbre, her perspective on pop and dance music, her sonic fascination with the subaqueous and the ethereal, the nocturnal aesthetics of her lyrics and album artwork. It’s certainly fun, but I don’t think it’s light, and if any other artist made Higher Than Heaven, it’d simply be another album. Likewise, criticism of the album is criticism of something that does represent a huge personal investment – disavowing its relevance to her own life is a way of protecting herself from that.
Does Intuition sample something? Like maybe another Ellie song? The chorus is so familiar I feel like I’ve heard the exact melody before
This thing is amazing, just non stop bangers. Ellie is back
Never really been a big EG fan except for the odd track, but I have to say, this album is a lot of fun. Easily one of my favourite releases from this year so far.
Is it a bad thing if I can see dua lupa singing some of these songs? Banger after banger after banger though
A cohesive, skipless album with nothing but pure dance pop bliss. Definitely hearing a some garage influence here too, which suits Ellie really well.  The second half has such an insane run from Temptation to Intuition to Tastes Like You, and apart from those three, my favorite new songs are Midnight Dreams and the title track.
Idk why no one talked about it yet but Just For You is my fav I think
I've literally never listened to her outside the Radio, and I love this album omg. It's so dancy and light-hearted and eretheral. Like how she is able to pull off the lyrics in "waiting for it?" I think I'm a full-blown Ellie Goulding fan now
LOVE GOES ON……. WHY IS NOBODY TALKING ABOUT THIS
I was actually quite surprised because I didn’t really care for brightest blue, but this album is just amazing pop vibes in every single track. This might possibly be her best album to date
Listening now and she killed it. I liked Brightest Blue a lot and i feel like this is a big step up
Comments about not liking this are downvoted to shit BUT I have to be real and say this just didn’t do it for me. I gave it three playthroughs and no songs stood out except the singles 😭 it’s not bad, but I do think it needs some tempo changes to break up the vibe a bit.
Good album however I wish it wasn't so dancy
I know this will get downvoted to oblivion but it is what it is.  I do not see the hype that everyone is saying in this thread. Not a single song was rememberable on first listen and there are no moments that make the record stand out. No pop deep cuts (like Ava’s Get out of my Heart; Carly’s Bends; Charlis Constant Repeat). Usually with pure dance pop albums, I can find that one track that’s absolute crack that keeps me anchored to the album and keeps me wanting to explore more, but not here. Miracle was close and it’s not even on the record. Totally underwhelmed.  FWIW - Halcyon was one of the core albums of my early 20s so Ellie Goulding is an artist I’m always keeping an eye on in the background
I’m sorry but this is just too damn relentless for me….there are normally ballads or interludes to break up the speed of ellie's albums, so i can forgive her for always having like 20 tracks on an album, but this is just 16 straight up dance-pop tracks back to back 💀  as of right now this is my least favourite project from her :(
flopppppp
Damn it's high time to give Ellie her flowers. This album is almost perfection.  I particularly loved Like A Saviour, Just For You, Midnight Dreams, Higher Than Heaven, and Tastes Like You.
Yessss I agree with everything you commented!! I’m an Ellie stan since her Lights era and I love this new direction she’s going in. Love Goes On is my favorite so far from the first half, I can’t wait for the rest to come out at midnight (I’m on EST, currently it’s 9:30 pm lol).
Ellie always delivers imo. I’m excited to hear this album
People drag Delirium on this sub but it is full of BOPS
Same! The original was so cool but this one is a major step down which is a shame
same.....I LOVE the standard art
Is the standard art the one on her vinyl?
[My new wallpaper on desktop !](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0548/6424/8961/products/ellie_goulding_higher_than_heaven__high.jpg?v=1669297162)
Maybe Sony want to continue to profit off its single sales some more.
because it was finished after the album was turned in lol. I think it’s more fit for a Calvin project anyways lmao
idk imo her label releasing some of the singles in the past few weeks (i think it was 4 of them?? that's what at least spotify says) kinda took away that surprise factor
I definitely did. Same with ‘Close To Me’ solo version on my version of ‘EG.0’
What is EG.0 again? Brightest Blue Deluxe?
This is what I’ve wanted *since* D&D lol, nothing has caught my ear since, both great 🙌
both great albums 🔫
I prefer D&D, both are great albums tho
My mind immediately when to Ava Max too. I'm like...why can't her music sound like *this?* But we gotta remember Ellie has been in the game for over a decade making bops so she knows how to make fun, upbeat pop songs.
D&D is more memorable imo
Same producer and her ex-management team, too. This seems to consciously be an attempt at making her own Future Nostalgia.
By The End Of The Night and Tastes Like You are the standouts for me, but I don’t think they stand out as much as the two artist’s songs you’d mentioned.
What about how long and better man? They're both much more chill and lowkey
I don’t stand for *Delirium* slander. It’s such a good record.
Yes! It looks beautiful
Also wouldn’t be surprised if they wanted it to be held back to count towards Calvin’s next album to make up for how Funk Wav Bounces Vol 2 did…
Her management team is the same as Lana’s and Caroline Polachek’s.   And Lana and Caroline have a history of having *unique* album rollouts.
The shitty collab songs on the second half of Brightest Blue.
sort of, i’m pretty sure they’re on every version of brightest blue but yeah, everything after the title track. i treat it as it’s own entity because i really love brightest blue and don’t care for those songs in the slightest lol
The songs her label forced her to release in order to release the Brightest Blue side. It’s the only way they could realistically fit onto the album though so it didn’t make me mad.
💯
Given Ellie has been making synth pop bangers since before Dua Lipa had a career I don’t think there was any conscious attempt to emulate her
https://i.imgur.com/LiGM0SF.jpg  She slanders it herself.
Eh, it’s not like Calvin doesn’t have a ton of great orphaned singles. How Deep Is Your Love, This Is What You Came For and My Way all instantly come to mind.
Oh, yikes
The thing is, no-one has once said they could imagine Dua singing her older synth material. People are saying that this new album sounds like something Dua would do. And for good reason.   It’s obviously been proven to be a success recipe and it’s no accident to sign up to the same management and go out of the way to hire Stephen Kozmeniuk.
Well then she needs to get better taste too lol
Wasn’t “One Kiss” also a one-off?
True, but idk... the stakes feel different now and the industry was so different when those songs were done...  It was one thing when people needed time to cool off from Feels and soak in all of Vol 1, hence what felt like a palette cleanser with One Kiss, Promises, and Giant. But *now*... this single really feels like a reminder and quick pivot, especially since it's been released so soon and on a new label at that.
I believe that made its way onto the super deluxe version of Dua’s debut.
What didn't make its way to a deluxe version of Dua's debut 💀
Oh, true, I forgot about that
I’m still waiting for Future Nostalgia to be added to it honestly.

she's taking it. this is phenomenal, not only for a debut, but this album already feels so ahead of its time.
Gaysians eating good once again
Really great album!! So much to unpack, production is insane and vocals are so fun
Happy is soooo good wtf
Yaeji = certified vibes
Tinkatons everywhere are gagging
halfway through and omg 😭 this is so good
Loving just how many real instruments are on the album. It’s a nice contrast.
New York’s hottest club is With a Hammer. When making it, club promoter Yaeji went crazy. It has everything. It has break-beats, flute samples, and even yellow fever. It also has a musical maternity ward. (It’s that thing where a synth passage sounds like it’s giving birth, but like in a beautiful way). Club promoter Yaeji threw in some vocoder, chopped up vocal samples, and a little bit of that Bexleyheath sound. (It’s that thing when a song makes you want to frolic atop a windy hill).
The explosive drop in 'For Granted' is 🤯. Does nice things to the belly. 'Fever' has the early Animal Collective DNA and the hook in 'Done' is amazing.  It's her least accessible and most assertive record as of yet imo. The only poppier tracks are the singles pretty much. She chickened out of writing during lockdown to reinvent herself and most surely did. Once more released on XL.  My best picks: For Granted, Done (Let's Get It), Fever, Submerge FM
That intro though. Submerge FM is an amazing opener, a truly submerging track
she consumed omg. luv thissssss luv yaeji
It's criminal that I'll Remember For Men, I'll Remember For You is only 2 minutes
Ooh this is so good. No skips but on first playthrough Fever, Michin, and Happy really jumped out to me.
It's soo goood!!!

Aren't you forgetting about What We Drew?
A truly hungry two weeks since Rina in John Wick 4
Yzma going feral for this rn
Lmaoooo
Been binging a lot of AnCo and that was my first though while hearing Fever! Glad I’m the only one. What a masterfully produced record.
WWD is considered a mixtape ~officially~ so this would be the debut in terms of ~albums~ lol
Rina is in JW4???  God damn I need to get on it and go see this.
I know I was waiting eagerly for the next morsel
Yeah but again, it is kind of unfair to compliment an album as "fot a debut" when the artist has been delivering self-contained bodies of work for several years now
Oooh nice!! Didn't know that

Ed Sheeran co wrote  the song if anyone cares
People don’t write their own melodies anymore. They just sample an old one, they burn out and then they sample another one…
This and the new Kim & NM song prove that 90s/2000s samples are going to be the pop norm for a while. This isn't as decent as Blue with Bebe but I'm sure pop radio will lather this up with coconut oil and ---
Guetta must have really liked I'm good drop so he reused again  Can't believe this is the same guy who made I gotta feeling
This is the kind of song I listen to with a straight face the entire time
Whoever mixed this fucked up Coi's voice.
it's not as bad as expected. sounds like I'm Good so probably gonna get a very good radio play.. do we think it's on Anne Marie's or Coi Leray's album?

Where u get that from?
Yup. The worst part is that David absolutely knows how to write a banger melody himself but he doesn't need to. Just look at how long the Blue cover stayed in the charts, it's still there for some reason
I've always been on the "who cares?" if an artist samples a song. If it's fun to dance to and listen to then what does it matter?
Finally somebody else that recognizes I Gotta Feeling for the dancepop electropop masterpiece that it is
Spotify credits and genius.com
The problem is the song is shit, where them girls at has the same beat of sexy bitch but Nicki and flo Rida give some energy to the song but with I'm good and baby don't hurt me, bebe and Anne are being on autopilot
Looove Where Dem Girls At, and wish it had gotten its proper flowers
Not the C-list popstar Lady Marmalade. If it's catchy it'll be all over tiktok
this is the boygenius of tik tok omg they ate that
i’m actually excited for this i need my girl gayle to have something other than abcdefu
they heard the Let Loose remix and scrambled to defend their TikTok territory
This is going to be so aggressively mediocre. I love it.
This will be terrible. We will be streaming!
Straight into the Worst Tracks of Fantano's weekly 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Did we want this? Not really.   Do we deserve this? OH HELL YEAH!
big slay alert
Wait? This actually sounds kind of interesting? I will definitely be checking this out. Let’s hope it’s not a don’t call me angel situation.
i'm actually kinda looking forward to this. i really like gayle and i really enjoyed egg in the backseat
i feel like radio could do something really funny right now
~~c list~~ tiktok/genz lady marmalade was gayle, upsahl and blu detiger doing e-z
is is TikTok boygenius or tiktok bang bang
Same I’m very tired of grown adults tearing down an 18 year old girl for a singular song 😀
Her EPs are actually pretty decent, my fave non abc-songs are luv starved, ALEX, and 15.
ugh that ATE
why not both?
tiktok don’t call me angel 😍
They've been doing it since she was 16 smh. She's made it clear she doesn't like the song that much either so idk why they continue to bash her.
oh i’m a big fan of her met her at a concert once she was so sweet and deserves the popularity
Kiddie Pool is another one that’s very good
Your mind
💀💀💀
Kim & Nicki collaborating makes total & complete sense, and I mean that in both a positive way and a negative way.
this feels like it was concocted in a lab in order to rile up popheads
I'm here for the comment section
her popheads diss track omg
I’m sorry, April 21st? She shouldn’t have been teasing the song for so long just for it to drop 2 months later
The jokes write themselves
Fox News bout to seeth
If there’s one thing we know about Kim, it’s that she WILL work with a predator
I don’t follow anyone on TikTok so whenever I watch a video to the end, TikTok pushes every video related to that topic to me. So I’ve known about this for weeks because I’ve seen every instance of the song sound being used.
I fear it’s gonna be a bop…
What? I've been waiting for so long thinking it was finally going to release tomorrow 7 April 😩
on kesha’s rumored release date??🥴
Damn why she gotta collab with the worst fucking people.
They can bond over supporting rapists 😍
Kim really sold her soul to the devil last year huh
This message is for Kim’s team:  If there was ever time for a radio payola deal or for y’all to actually promote a single, it’s this one. Do NOT play in my girlies face this time. She deserves this win!
Say what u want about Kim or Nicki but this is bringing me back to playing Maplestory in 2011 on my family computer in the best way possible and i'm so excited
sexual predator apologist anthem of the summer
it never fails to shock me that abusers and those who look the other way to continue benefitting from the perpetrators run in the same circle.  but it makes sense. good for her i guess. i just don’t feel like it should be difficult to choose better people to surround yourself with. it’s almost like it’s very intentional 🤷‍♂️ you become the company you keep
pretending to be surprised like this hasn’t been all over bunhead twitter for weeks 😂
I hope this is as catchy as it is ~~problematique~~
Omg featuring Nicki? Kim about to blow up
[removed]
Rapist Apologist UNITE
I was excited about this song two weeks ago. I mean I’m still excited but why two MORE weeks until she releases it?
The intro is giving heavy Beauty and a Beat vibes.
I wonder if she’ll get a hit this time? Jesus was a rock star and brr came and went.   But then again I’ve been hearing a snippet of this song for the past couple of weeks so maybe the third time is the charm?
That woo-ah already makes the intro so iconic, I cannot wait 🥰
Abusers everywhere gonna love this one
As divisive as both are in those within the stan pop community (including popheads), y'all know it's gonna be a bop. Nicki's current releases are some of her best in years and Kim is usually reliably good in making bops. This is probably gonna be a banger and I'm personally excited to hear how a collab between the two will sound
this intro is already so iconic we are in for a TREAT
Better Off Alone sample for potentially yet another "90s iconic electronic music put over some new verses/slightly changed choruses"  Lets hope its better than I'm Good I guess!
The differences between reactions to this and Chloe collaborating with Chris Brown sure are interesting 😃
Controversy aside, Im excited for some pop Nicki.
i fear im gonna be very sat
Gross woman collabing with another gross woman on a song likely by a rapist. Makes sense
Somehow Nicki is still going to find a way to rap about her opps on this track
i need it now 😩😩
Could be great, could be not so great. I feel like a Nicki feature doesn’t hold as much weight as it used to.
Mannnn, I hate the person in her insta comments saying the track was dropping March 31st. I got my hopes up for nothing. :( I think the track will be worth the wait though, but I'm impatient.
Love this for both Kim and Nicki!
If this leads to Kim getting another number 1 hit I am all for it. I really would like to see her break into the mainstream.
This could be really huge for Kim.
Kim you make it so hard for me to love you 😭
Damn she’s been teasing it since first week of March and we have to wait another 2 weeks 💀
This is 100% a collab I expected, they compliment each other, take that as you will.
Ughhhhhhhh I want to like Kim so much but she keeps pulling shit like this and it reminds me why I’ve always had trouble stanning her.
YESSSSSSS
How did she manage to get a collab with Nicki? Like how do these things happen in the industry?
Pophead girlies gonna do anything to defend Kesha instead of streaming her song lol it's so embarrassing
Where’s the album announcement? Is Jesus is a rockstar gonna be on the album? And the way she teased this since march 9th
I thought this post was from r/popheadscirclejerk for a second
another sample.. i think it proves that samples are gonna be massively used in a couple next years and I'm not sure if i'm happy about it..
i wonder who will produce this!!
THE WAY NICKI IS GOING TO GLIDE ON THIS BEAT! 😭😭😭
This is either going to be a serve or a flop. We will find out soon.
I am afraid that I am seated for this one. The sample is too good.
I just need a remix with Azealia to complete my trifecta of problematic faves 😍
[removed]
The song was already giving 2011 in a good way, if we get a 2011 Nicki verse i will have to give them my streams
I’m here for the Alice Deejay sample.
I don’t even dislike kim but its crazy that kims fans are acting like she completely stopped working with dr luke. Hearing the alone snippet(and knowing what dr lukes production sounds like) as well as the fact that nicki is on it(and she worked with luke on sfg), i would bet this song is a dr luke production too. At the end of the day 98% of kim’s discography has luke on it, if you were a fan of her before you probably just don’t care ( and that’s fine ). Like lol, she’s still gonna work with luke
So excited!!! I love Kim and I will always love her
justice for kesha
I dislike them both as people but OH BOY that Better Off Alone sample has me interested… I fear this will be a song that I will have to illegally download and pretend not to like
This is a POP EMERGENCY   I LITERALLY GASPED. Words cannot explain how hyped I am for this song hoooooly
Ooooh I’m excited to hear this
Unfortunately, I'm seated
We WON. A global HIT
boyz by jesy nelson just got competition
the dr luke extended universe is expanding
Cmon let’s not fuck this up 😭😭😭 CMON BARBIE DOLLS
Honestly this better be a hit, if not Kim needs to leave her record deal break the contract or something. We’re over the two months teaser for one off songs that probably won’t even make the album. They should have capitalized off of her being the first trans woman to win best pop duo and released something around that time when she had a lot of eyes on her. Hell they should have even released problematic it would have at least added to her portfolio and maybe spit out a couple TikTok hits like “Treat me like a slut” and “Coconuts.”
IM CRYING YASSSSSSS
[removed]
my 9/11. I did not fucking want a feature on this song, let alone Nicki of all people. please.
I hope it's not as annoying as SFG
Musically I'm interested :/ It's Nicki's first collab with an altpop girl. God damn it why they gotta be horrible people
I’ll just listen to the original song.
LOL 200+ comments, this thread will be spicy
I can’t wait til she collabs with Chris Brown
"Pretending to be shocked"
Can we delete it instead?
😭😭 the best way to put this
Congrats Nicki! First woman in music to marry a rapist, work with a rapist producer, support a rapist, and collab with a rape apologist 😍😍
As a huge Kim fan who has defended her again and again, this collab ENRAGES me. Like, of aaaaaaall the people to work with, she chooses a deeply problematic rape apologist??? Kim, given your personal history, what are you DOING???  Kim literally follows me on twitter and I am about to get blocked by her, I am so fucking fired up. We were all rooting for you, UGH!!!!
when did this sub switch on kim? she used to be a darling of this sub iirc
If there was any a time to sort by Controversial 👀
Check out Twitter. It's a blood bath 💀
Well, since mods didn’t learn any lessons from Jesy Nelson threads, I guess this thread won’t be cleared of Stan Twitter refugees’ conversations
Yep. I'm gonna leave my comment here just because I know this thread is gonna be locked.
Agreed, I assumed it would be tomorrow..
She keeps making the same mistake of teasing her singles by playing the same 5 second snippet to death over and over for months on end  By the time it comes out I usually hate the snippet and have to “give the song a chance” rather than actually being excited for it
💀💀 and unapologetically at that
I’m starting to think she prefers it~
Nicki isn't a predator
Honestly kims team probably paid someone at tiktok to push it lol
But at what cost
april 21 is also kesha’s rumored release date for her lead single
Same. She said something about big news on Thursday earlier in the week, and I was hoping it was the actual song release.
i mean are we shocked
Woof
they both work with Dr. Luke a ton
Perhaps it is because she is also one of the worst fucking people
Funny how interchangable this is
[removed]
You make me feel like the devil’s gonna win.
She took Charli's Crash social media campaign too seriously.
I feel like this is being pushed as the big Unholy follow up.
They already starred shooting the video yesterday! Praying that we actually get a proper release out of this with teasers + both the single *and* video dropping on the same day.
Maplestory 😩 🍁that brings back so many memories
Wait what.   Imma need an explanation, please.
I have never related to a comment more omg   Blasting pop radio while spamming the FM for 10 attack work gloves
Lest we forget how her collabs with Jesy Nelson and Meghan Trainor went lol
[removed]
Oh yeah! This was a fantastic move. They’re gonna kill it!
Nicki did the same with SFG and Sam did this with unholy. People said the same thing thing about those songs 🤷🏼‍♂️
Lol Kim fans are never satisfied with her release schedule. We just did this with Unholy.
Do you want the roll out to be done fast or do you want it to be done well? There's a music video to shoot and edit.
Remember when people said this about super freaky girl and then it hit number 1? I don’t think 2 weeks is going to matter. The general public probably hasn’t even heard any snippets of this song yet and they are the mass majority. Not people on the internet who hear things immediately as they are posted.
SFG was a tiktok hit and with the barbz mass buying it went #1. If this isn’t a tiktok hit it’ll debut okay because of the barbz mass buying and then free fall because gp isn’t listening.
Yup !
It's incredible to me how such a progressive community can turn a blind eye to a shit cocktail of shit people simply because "it bops tho". There's plenty of bops that don't directly support pieces of shit like Nicki Minaj, Kim Petras, Dr Luke, and whoever Kim's manager is that works with Dr Luke on the regular.
I wonder if there will be any similar broken record circlejerk in every single thread about Kelly Rowland after her recent support of Chris Brown.
Green screen Minaj
factually a nicki feature still means a huge boost in sales.
larry rudolph, the guy who britney spears fired and then was forced by her father to rehire for the entirety of her conservatorship, is kim’s manager.   and larry rudolph has a long history of a working relationship with dr luke. luke works with tons of fuckin people, including onika. so.  i think it’s just a matter of running in the wrong (or right) circles
Well they're both working pretty often with Dr. Luke so 🥴 they've got some mutual contacts
Artists are always interacting talking ect. Plus I think there label mates
For reaaaaaal, like it’s possible to root for BOTH and still hate what Dr Luke did…
you could just listen to the original instead of being like this
Same here. 😬
[removed]
How is Kim an alt pop girl
Given that the music industry has been filled with terrible men since it’s inception, surely Nicki isn’t the first to tick all those boxes
don’t forget she also collaborated with tekashi who is also a sex offender 😍
where were you when Nicki vs Latto happen lol
But why are you surprised by this? She’s the same woman who has defended Dr Luke multiple times and implied Kesha was lying about being raped. Her and Nicki are both problematic rape apologists so this is a match made in hell as far as i’m concerned.
When you're at the top of the industry, you've got power and money. Kim is at the top of the privilege scale among trans people, so she can basically get away with a lot of problematic, moral decisions.
She's said she's a huge Nicki fan several times, so it's not unsurprising
Might've been when she kept working with Dr. Luke
It’s when we figured out she worked with Dr. Luke by choice and it wasn’t a Doja Cat situation. I used to love Kim and now I basically have her blocked on Spotify (save for a few guest spots on Charli’s songs)
When Kim released Clarity. Most of the album was trap and not bubblegum pop like her first era, so the sub revolted against her and decided to start dragging her for working with Dr. Luke, who they blamed for her new music direction.
To be fair, that strategy, as annoying as it is, DID earn her a multiple-week #1 single in multiple countries (including the U.S.) as well as a literal GRAMMY.  Her record label is simply following the same strategy that led to such success last time.
Little dirty bitch (she likes to fuck).
I mean not having morals usually pays
You’re right she just marries them, pays legal fees for them, and ridicules victims
If Kim’s team was that powerful enough to make her singles artificially popular on Tiktok, we would’ve seen the same with her first 2 singles.  I know that it’s a bitter pill to swallow, but people seem to actually like it so far.
[removed]
Kim is learning from Nicki, announcing the announcement for the announcement
is this another dr.luke song?
So does Dua, Doja, Meg Stallion(same producer as SFG ) and Latto but people only mention it when it's Nicki or Kim
Oh? What songs for Nicki did Dr. Luke make?
When she won the Grammy and went on a big shpiel about being trans it made my blood boil. She was trying to shift the focus away from the fact that she's a rapist apologist. I don't think even trans people like her.
This will be craaaaazy
Oh thank god. I feel like she never released music videos!
I owe Maplestory for making me an elite typer.  Chatting with people for hours on end during the summer of 7th grade, was more training than 6 years of Mavis Beacon Typing games 😂
And on the flip side, she also turned down features on Doja Cat's *Get Into It (Yuh)* and Lil Nas X's *Industry Baby*, so Nicki's hit radar has also been notably off as of late...
Yeah Nicki isn’t enough to make average products good.   If it’s a bop, it will thrive, and if it isn’t it will flop.
Yeah but a month from teasing to release is long…. Especially if they don’t come with a video already shot.
Lol I really don’t though, I just want this song cuz it sounds so good. Didn’t mean to offend anyone by being impatient. Like I said, I’m still excited for it.
No, no, you misunderstand. Her *husband* is on house arrest. /j
Some of y’all will make up anything to fit your narrative.
If I wanna listen to a song I’m gonna listen sweetheart
[removed]
Isn't she?
What?? I meant both of them, hence the they?
True, but it certainly doesn’t help clear Nicki’s intentions when she’s openly ridiculed her husband’s victim and kinda sicced the Barbz to harass her…
people really banked on the theory that she **had** to keep working with him for contractual reasons   but that's seeming less and less likely, and more like she's just wanting to work with the guy and ignoring his crimes
I thought a lot of people liked Clarity, it was just everything that came after it and turn off the lights Part 2 that made it all go down hill. (For myself at least)

People have been complaining about Doja’s involvement with Luke since Say So got big. There have been *numerous* discussions about it on this subreddit and on social media for years now.   Also, none of Meg’s songs has Dr. Luke credited as a producer or songwriter
You pulled Dua and Meg right out of your ass. Neither of them have ever worked with him or have his credits on any of their songs, unlike Kim who up until this year had his credits on literally every one of her songs.
Super Freaky Girl was produced by him
Super Freaky Girl, Blick Blick, Say So
SFG was produced by someone who’s ultimately under Dr Luke so his name goes on it too. I personally think the anti Dr luke stuff is like pointless (I hate him but he ain’t going anywhere so why crucify pop stars?)
It better be the new WAP.
Nice to think so many of us found ourselves here so many years later!
Right, I don’t wanna be teased for that long, hah!
Back in my day, singles were announced 3 months in advance. Then you waited another 6 months to hear the album when it arrived on CD!
i think you’re talking to the wrong person dude. i know britney’s story front to back. OG free britney member && i’m telling u  she hates larry rudolph. and was forced to work with him 🤷‍♂️ that’s kims manager.  she just did a song with meghan trainor who is managed by one of the OTHER people who are responsible for trafficking america’s sweetheart.  Lou Taylor / Dr. Luke / Larry Rudolph / Nicki Minaj / Kim Petras 🧐 what do all these people have in common? they’re happy looking the other way when egregious shit happens.   i think ur bending over backwards to support an artist that wouldn’t spit on u if you were on fire
[removed]
[removed]
She makes the most basic mainstream pop music and being LGBTQ doesn’t make you an alternative artist
Doesn’t help that Kim defended Dr Luke on twitter, this feels like one of the slimiest collabs we’ve seen in a hot minute.
Personally jumped ship after the “I wouldn’t work with an abuser” line, indirectly calling Kesha a liar.
She also tweeted that she wasn’t sorry for it and she won’t let us make her her feel bad for it
Not sure it’s less and less likely. He hasn’t produced any of her releases for the past year, and we’ve yet to see credits for this track.
[removed]
Neither does SFG but someone above brought that up as produced by Luke, it’s not. But it WAS produced by the same women who produced Her for Meg. Dr Luke’s publishing company being behind some of the biggest pop hits still isn’t brought up by this subreddit tho when it comes to certain artists
Pills and Potions too!
That’s such a stupid reason. He’s not going anywhere because big stars like her still work with him. That’s the problem.
We are definitely a type!   God bless the internet for creating spaces for nerds to dork out on things they love like chat rooms, sidescrolling RPG’s and pop culture lol.
You also didn’t have internet when artists posted their every move! 😂
Except Unholy came from Sam Smith, I really doubt another two weeks is going to have people hyped up for this coming from an artist that still has much trouble having solo hits. It's more likely any discourse on the song will stop until release date in my opinion, whereas I've seen a fair share of hype in the recent days
Bruh Unholy is a Sam Smith song lol. We've seen this marketing fall on it's face so many times with Kim Petras which is why fans react this way.
It’s not smart though. So many people want the song to be out and hear the full thing when they hear it on tik tok. Having to wait two weeks is LONG. maybe a week turnaround but I always get sad because I don’t think the algorithm will bring the update video back to me in that timeframe
My comment had nothing to do with whether you know Britney’s story front to back or anything else you’re talking about, so I don’t know why you’re *bending over backwards* to prove that you’re an OG stan.  OP asked how this collaboration happened, and you used a series of assumptions to say that this was organized because the two artists work with abusers.  It’s entirely possible—and frankly, pretty likely—that this collaboration happened because Kim and Nicki **are on the same label, Republic Records.** The label’s president, Wendy Goldstein, has been mentoring Kim since she was signed and has actually helped her get in touch and work with producers other than Dr. Luke (Max Martin, Ilya, Ian Kirkpatrick). It was also announced that Wendy is directly helping Nicki launch her own label.   Hell, we could both be wrong. But my point is that you’re presenting information to further a narrative that these artists are and always will be horrible people that run in the wrong circles, for no reason other than negativity. It’s not always what you want it to be.

Wym
I’ve resorted to YouTube to MP3 to listen to her songs I like so I can enjoy her and not support her lol.
> the “I wouldn’t work with an abuser” line,   > indirectly calling Kesha a liar.  I don’t know why people keep on putting words in Kim’s mouth, when she never said “Kesha is a liar” and in fact told about HER own experience with the person (which in her case is not abusive experience), without speculating about things she wasn’t even involved in to have something reliable to talk about.  It kinda reminds me of time when people were mad at industry people for not stopping working with Justin Bieber immediately after accusations against him surfaced...   I guess he would’ve been in the same position of a “not proven guilty but a 100% r*pist nevertheless” if he wasn’t precautious enough to save the receipts to be able to prove his innocence.
and called us TERFs for criticizing her lack of accountability for her statements
He is literally credited on the entirety of Slut Pop???
he literally produced the entirety of her last EP   granted she's went an entire four songs without him making an appearance, but it's **far** too early to say she's not working with him anymore???????? ugh I'm so tired y'all.
[removed]
Super Freaky Girl literally has Dr. Luke credited as both a writer and songwriter. I don’t like that he has a production company to continue bringing him in revenue but that is not the same as actively working with him?
I wasn't sure what the timeline was for the songs he produced on Pink Print, I assumed the user was talking about post-Kesha Luke tracks.
Va Va Voom was, as well
It is when y’all stream songs from his label/production company which still gives him money. Selective outrage at its finest.   If you don’t want to support him. Don’t support him in any way. Even when it’s through streaming songs from his company where the revenue indirectly goes back to him. If he’s the problem then it doesn’t matter where he’s directly involved or not.   Just makes y’all look selective.
Truly it was the dark ages
[removed]
are you just now finding out that rapists and abusers might not rape and abuse every single person they work with and that if somebody does not rape/abuse you specifically that doesn't mean they are not a rapist/abuser?
A lot of people are transphobic in her Twitter reply’s so I don’t really blame people for assuming so
>>I don’t like that he has a production company to continue bringing him in revenue but that is not the same as actively working with him?  This just sounds like trying to absolve yourself because the issue people always bring up with Luke is “not supporting an abuser”, yet when you’re monetarily supporting him by streaming songs from his production company “that’s different”.   It’s not. He’s still getting money from it. If this is something you’re going to complain  about see it all the way through instead of being selective.
And who’s “y’all”? Because I don’t stream anyone signed from his label or production company, not a fan of any of them. But okay 👍
Girlie multiple people are commenting because this is a Kim Petra’s thread…
> if somebody does not rape/abuse you specifically that doesn't mean they are not a rapist/abuser?  I wonder how you were able to read my full comment in a sober state and then come up with dead-serious conclusion of me implying THIS ?  I said that Kim was talking about HER own experience and HER own perception of the person so far, which is probably the only experience she actually knows a thing or two about, and this is obviously not reflective of WHOLE Luke’s history of actions throughout his life, because I’m pretty sure she isn’t stitched to his back 24/7.   By the way, Katy Perry also talked about her own non-abusive experience:  > “Do you believe that sexual assault or r*pe is consistent with Dr. Luke's character?” “No,” Perry responded.”  > “Perry repeatedly said that Luke had not r*ped her, contrary to an allegation that was made in recently revealed text messages between Kesha and the singer Lady Gaga.”  And guess who, out of these two women, gets more criticized *specifically* for voicing their disbelief in Luke being a r*pist ?   Correct. A transgender woman gets more hate for this specific phrase.  Feels like another instance of obvious transphobia, which is tiring, but not surprising at this point.

always feel weird giving newly released songs a 10/10 but i can't think of any negatives to give this a lower score. FLO brings some attitude and sass - particularly in the bridge - and the missy sample works so well in the chorus which is then amplified by missy's great verse and chemistry with FLO. cannot WAIT for their album  10/10
The latest from the UK sensation FLO, this time at the sampling of and collaboration with Missy Elliott.  "Fly Girl" plays off "Work It" and the lines, "If you a fly gal, get your nails done, get a pedicure, get your hair did". Aside from working with that reference point, there's also a beat switch into Missy's verse over ["Cop That Disc", a Timbaland & Magoo song she featured on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccmb4fnm8_E).  Let the music video tell the story, one of the more telling lyrics in "Fly Girl" reads as "A time piece and it don't Tik Tok". That part is actually in Renee's opening verse where all the watch/Rolex [watch that doesn't *tick tock*] motifs are used in rather genius ways. This indicates that FLO has continued on their sweet spot of nostalgia of the 00s and managing song lengths that feel complete or at least have structure. As for Missy's verse, if you take it as an open co-sign, it comes off much better than it does.  The song overall did take a few listens for me to completely embrace it. Having come off "Not My Job" where their identity was set, having a song like "Fly Girl" did seem like a step backward in that the reference seemed to get more praise than the song itself. However, considering Missy's verse and "Fly Girl" being such a club banger with the FLO stamp is at least a sign that their vision is being nurtured.  #10/10
That's how you do a sample, I love how this song simultaneously feels like a throwback and modern  9/10
I forgot that Trace sings this with that weird British accent  pop punk singers sometimes do, the chorus is still so powerful that I love it on some level  7.5/10
i cannot give this score any lower than a 10. it ended up being one of my favourite songs from the naughties and came out in year 7 and my embarrassing backstory for it is that i thought i "discovered" this song and made it popular in school (i didn't, it was featured on an ad) and i went around calling myself "the music person" of the year. god.   anyway, song is an absolute banger. catchy chorus and fantastic bridge.   10/10
I don’t care how corny or cheesy this is, I will always love this absolute JAM of a song. That chorus does exactly what it sets out to do - get you off of your feet and onto the dancefloor. This was a stable at all of my high school’s dance nights and it was a joy to get down to each and every time.  **9/10**
everything about this is the epitome of 2008 (this band literally exists because miley cyrus and mitchel musso’s brothers met on the set of hannah montana) and I love everything about it. I was starting middle school the year this came out and I remember feeling cool listening to it bc it seemed like something the “older kids” would listen to.   maybe I was just the right age at the right time but I already see this song as a classic  9.5/10
This is my Soty so far. Solid 9/10. This has to be one of the best synthpop-well done in kpop. Jimin’s vocals also shined through. I hope he does more of this genre  The production was chef’s kiss and I’m glad they had an instrumental breakdown after the first chorus. It kinda reminded me off Stranger vibes a lot.  The lyrics were also good. Especially for the English version(Korean version is great too but it’s rare in kpop to have the English version not sounding like an afterthought or a mishmash of awkward English phrases)The bridge and pre chorus have to be my favorite parts of the track  My only gripe is that there’s barely a 2nd verse. After two lines it just switches back to the chorus and then straight to bridge where it ends. If not I’ll have rated it a 10/10
5/10. The song is neither bad nor good. The lyrics are great and very relatable especially when we miss someone special who passed away. But the song is just generic. The production is meh and the melody is just there. I don’t know he could make a song like this come out looking at his credits lineup👀(those are some insane producers)  If not the for the lyrics this would have been a 2/10
victoria is so underrated but it seems like she's happy in her lane so good for her. this chorus is so catchy, and the beat is so bouncy and summer-y. i really like lucky daye's feature too.   8/10
It’s just so sad that Plug Two didn’t live to celebrate Buhloone Mind State’s ~~quarter-century~~ 30th anniversary nor see De La Soul’s catalogue finally arrive on digital platforms after all these years.
Phenomenal. Best band coming out of SG rn and that's saying something
i fucking love them, amazing live band and they're only going to get bigger i imagine
*”There's a lot of conversation right now about combatting bots and making sure tickets get directly into the hands of fans, and at a reasonable price. Ticketing fees have never been higher and a lot of people, me included, are justifiably frustrated and concerned.

Soccer Mommy and Alvvays are perfect openers
Wow this is such a great step to combat the shitty online ticketing system. Love that she's included exclusive merch and a playlist just for the day.  I wasn't wild about her last album but if this were to come to Vancouver I'd definitely go!
PNW dates after getting nothing for Feral Joy tour ohhh I’m happy
Is anyone going to Forest hills? And willing to buy me a ticket ?🥺 I have work and there’s no way I can make it in time.   I will definitely reimburse you!!!
Seeing her headline Hinterland in august. Can’t wait.
Seeing Toronto :’) Ohhhhh I’m so happy!!! I’ve been waiting for this announcement since the album was released!
We will be watching
Love to see it. I remember it seemed to go well when Nine Inch Nails did something along those lines back in 2018.
[Link to instructions page](https://live.umusic.com/maggierogers-tour?_kx=T2jUpEzadKB9v0W-Gz6at6tPFg-91hpxO1fjYRlD5do%3D.Y8DReg)  Includes prices and any fees associated with said tickets, as well as what forms of payment are accepted, which is real neat.
Man I'm bummed Soccer Mommy isn't on the West Coast dates. I like Maggie just fine (loved the first album, Surrender was not my favorite), but Soccer Mommy I'd be really excited to see
Maggie Rogers should be opening for Alvvays tbh
Yeah sounds like an amazing show
You can still get tickets online it's just after the physical sale.
am i stupid and cant see or is not every date on this page? specifically the LA date.  edit: i guess the hollywood bowl isnt doing an in person sale, wish that was made more clear/directly said
I wasn't super impressed on first listen but I have to admit I've become addicted to the song at this point. So energetic and fun.
This song has hit potential
I love that she shot this in Tokyo! It's so fun, carefree, and really captures the vibe of this song.
Queen of first person singular pronouns
next single: myself
“me” is the inverse of “ME!”
Give us your post divorce empowerment anthem Kelly!  I hope the double single means she has a lot to say.
Curious to see how this performs, wondering if her talk show stardom will translate to more plays. However it performs  the songs will still slay, Kelly always delivers.
Heard a theory about a double album because of the "me" and "mine" and that "chemistry" is a thing between two people. As a certified double album hater, the only person I'll accept one from is Kelly Clarkson. Simply because she needs to drag her ex through more than one LP.
This melody sounds so good, I can't wait to hear what the instrumental is like. I hope it's bluesy like "Slow Dance"  Edit: lmao looking at the rest of this thread the "no comments just about songs with the same title" rule came just in the nick of time
ITS FINALLY HAPPENING!!!
I just finished rewatching Survivor Ghost Island, so I’m almost legally obligated to say this is Kelly Clarkson’s chance to REVERSE THE CURSE of songs called “me”
My body is ready

[removed]
I like the idea of the two singles playing off of "Me and mine", fingers crossed it turns out well
Not really a big fan of releasing double-singles together because it means one won't perform good. Or even worse, they BOTH might perform well. I hope this doesn't happen with Kelly.

Predicting that it would do well but will get outsold by the Jonas Brothers upcoming 7th album
the following week the elusive chanteuse drops
coming for taylor’s gig
Kelly gave Taylor the re-recording idea…who’s to say Taylor doesn’t just reach into Kelly’s vault for lead single idea either? /s
George Harrison's ghost is eying her with suspicion
It’s giving Taylor swift
and after that: i
Hey, elder millennials, spelling is for losers.
It better sound like that too. We don't need another ME!-like song haunting the airwaves and teaching kids how to spell 🤢
now why did we even have to bring her into this?
If we can get 20-something tracks for double album release, I'm all for it. It has been 6 fucking years since her last studio album.
What is wrong with double albums? There are some really good ones.
Meaning of Life deserved way better and this comeback better get better treatment than MOL did.
Ooh yes, I would love more of that sound from her! Her vocals sound amazing in the clip so I have faith it will sound great regardless.
This is such a weird crossover of my interests.  I hope the new single is more DvG-level than Ghost Island though.
[removed]
I still think Look At Her Now would've charted WAY better if Selena didn't release it right along with Lose You To Love Me, although I saw the vision.
If only The Album were their 7th (it's actually their 6th)
I think Kelly was merely the one to say out loud she should re-record but the whole time Taylor was planning to steal the idea from Jojo
🎶Just me, myself and I🎶
Followed up with: Am the problem.
The most disappointing thing Taylor has ever done is get rid of the “Hey kids, spelling is fun!” bridge in the song.   Like yes it’s awful, but at least commit to it lol
Thread about Kelly Clarkson. Top post about Taylor Swift.
I just started that season which I’ve never seen but judging by the first episode - I agree with you.
[removed]
Jonas LA was a studio album so if we count that then The Album could be their 7th.
If we’re talking studio albums then yes. They do have live albums as well so technically your both wrong
In hindsight, it’s crazy that a collab between Bebe Rexha and G-Eazy got that big. Like, how did we allow that to happen?
I completely forgot about that until just now.
No spoilers. It’s my favorite. Enjoy.
[removed]
I read an article where they were claiming it was their seventh I could’ve sworn it was too.
The funny thing is that it’s called Me, Myself, and I even though it’s two people
I was actually referring to Kelly Clarkson's chorus in Stronger lol, but i completely agree!
Back when songs blew up simply because they were good 🥵
Ohhhhhhh shnap. Thank you for your endorsement. DvG and Edge of Extinction are the last 2 I’ve not seen, so I’m excited to watch DvG. Not so much EoE :(
Oh shoot! I remember her releasing the single but not the album!!! Catching up now hehe. So excited!
AAAAAAH I’m so excited! gotta let her know how much she slayed me with this album and at her show in Dallas last month 😭
Are we supposed to prepost our questions here?
Very excited!  Gotta figure out the perfect question!
the one day of the week i have to go into court 🥲
Would like to know this too haha
No, post them in a separate official AMA thread that will be posted near the actual AMA time (usually an hour before)
[U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has been secretly accepting gifts and bribes for decades and has illegally failed to disclose them](https://www.propublica.org/article/clarence-thomas-scotus-undisclosed-luxury-travel-gifts-crow)  This could set the grounds for impeachment. Impeaching a SCOTUS Justice follows the same process as a U.S. President: a simple majority in the House is enough to begin impeachment proceedings, a trial would ensue, and a simple majority in the Senate would either convict or acquit the Justice.   EDIT: Republicans control the House of Representatives but have a very slim majority: it would only take 6 of them joining Democrats to begin impeachment proceedings. The Senate is currently controlled by the Dems, as they have 48 Democratic Senators along with 3 Independents that caucus with them. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Joe Manchin of West Virginia make this interesting however, because they are very moderate and could vote alongside Republicans to acquit Justice Thomas.  EDIT: [CNN Article explaining the impeachment process](https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/16/politics/scotus-impeach/index.html)  From the article: “Impeachment and removal of federal judges is extremely rare. The House of Representatives has impeached only 15 federal judges since 1803, and eight of those impeachments were followed by convictions in the Senate, according to New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice.  Samuel Chase is the only Supreme Court justice who was ever impeached, in 1804, and he was acquitted by the Senate in 1805, according to the Supreme Court of the United States and the Senate.”

SZA is so close to getting her first Billboard #1 with ‘Kill Bill’ next week and is just behind Morgan Wallen at the moment! I’ve seen fans on Twitter holding streaming/buying parties, so I hope she manages to get that top spot!

Filipino singer Jaya is in hot water after it was discovered that she has been [liking tweets transphobic tweets saying that drag queens are groomers](https://twitter.com/DeeDeeMarieH/status/1643721449767837701).  The "If You Leave Me Now" singer responded with this [bullshit tweet](https://twitter.com/jayasoul/status/1643691278155268096?s=20).  >Reseach and dig deep to form your opinions on matters that matter to you. Then have a respectful and honest conversation without making it personal. Once again, I am against children being exploited. That is it. Nothing more, nothing less. But if you like, you may also unfollow me. Love to you all ❤️✝️  This is incredibly disappointing news for the Filipino LGBTQ+ community who has hailed Jaya as a gay icon and was impersonated so many times by gay comedians and drag queens. Jaya's mother Elizabeth Ramsey, who is a celebrity of her own, was even impersonated by drag queen Brigiding in the first season of Drag Race Philippines.
A supposed snippet of Sparks Fly (Taylor’s Version) has people going feral on twitter, although some people are saying it’s AI generated.
[Pop Tingz claims that there is a Variety report that says there is a pay gap between Pedro Pascual and Bella Ramsey](https://twitter.com/ThePopTingz/status/1644031012530188288).  There is no such report from Variety about this.
The new Jonas Bros single is out in Aus and wtf I don’t know why the chose Wings over this as the lead
There's pretty much zero possibility of this going anywhere.
I hope she drops the song of the summer omg. She trolls so much it's hard to tell.
What even is this supposed to be ? Looks like a dirty piece of cloth.
[i hope she did have a fart in the album😉](https://youtu.be/LTkjimLtmok)
Perfect color for future merch featuring pop-punk-rap Doja on the front and back.
The way I always read some variation of ‘the singer states’ at the end of every meme makes it seem like her takes are always very important and that journalists go out of their way to hear what she has to say 😭
https://twitter.com/elliegoulding/status/1644304228813250560
I can’t believe SZA and Dua Lipa have both had multiple *massive* hits but neither have had a number 1 yet. Hoping that Kill Bill makes it because it’s deserved
American Popheads make this your mission I swear to god
RCA drop a remix challenge
If she actually gets it, she should drop a remix with someone big and with that she could stay at number one for one or two more weeks. and also she needs to drop a stupid deluxe version of sos.
I hope she doesn’t get too mad at him for sharing that— he’s already taken it down and it was a very, very clear snippet of the bridge  It sounded a bit different from the OG but good imo! She was giving very strong rock vocals on that bridge.
I’m ready for her to drop Speak Now because I’m sick to death of all of the theories and speculation about it.
ITS SO GOOD enchanted is my favorite song of all time this is a very big day for annoying people (me)
I feel like I am one of the few that really loves her re-recorded songs. Maybe this is because I lean toward her more grown-up vocals.
I fucking hate Twitter and the doge bs 💀
Jenner sisters doing psychological damage to chronically online white and Latina girls

Say sike!  Please say sike!!
Ain't he too old for her?? But yasss get that Apple money
That's really bad for the image he is trying to build as a serious actor.
if you think about it rationally, this probably benefits the only person that matters in this situation (Timothee's friend and one of the greatest fashion designers of our time, Haider Ackermann) so I'm choosing to believe this is real. good for them, congratulations, etc.
### [POP EMERGENCY]
Yeah I kinda got that vibe after watching the "Accelerate" music video
Not the gays in this sub getting offended at this. Also who is actually surprised at that??
I didn't need to know ❤️
the taste is unmatched
I’ll rewrite this: Christina Aguilera reveals *too much about her private life here,* and this is coming from someone who sees what Britney posts. 😳
Y'all are being oddly puritan, swallowing is good actually
I wonder if she also swallows if the [redacted] is from a smoker. 🤢
Straight women talking about their sex life…. So cringe. Leave that to the men, amiright?    /s
Wait when you say gay Icon do you mean she’s gay or just has a lot of gay fans
Even if this is true are people really surprised about this? Pedro is a veteran actor and Bella Ramsey is a relatively unknown actor. They're not going to be paid the same rate.
I appreciate that Pop Base and Pop Crave cite their reports with links or photos. Pop Tingz just reports things out of nowhere with no validity. 🙄
tbh yeah differences is kinda crazy but hes bigger name so ofc he will be paid more. hopefully bella gets more for next season since well i don't wanna spoil anything but things will happen and it would be only fair and logical that they get way more money
They also claimed that Ellie Gouldings album was AI written without including the caveat about her saying it as a joke.
I swear I remember seeing that he got 600k an episode and she got 400k….   Weird that suddenly changed though this doesn’t have any sources for validity.   But people getting upset really just don’t get how entertainment works and it infuriates me. Like yes equal pay, but also if you have 3 credits and your other lead has 300, why would you expect them to be paid the same? Then preaching about feminism?! Like what?!

It's CRAZY Wallen has a no1 and Dua doesn't. Dua has obvi broke records in other ways (year end no1) but it's still insane to think about.
American Popheads better promote SZA harder than RCA
RCA be a decent record label for once challenge.
It would be weird to get mad at someone over a song that everyone already heard before. A leak of an entirely new song is understandable.
It lacks emotions imo 😩 but I've felt this way with every TV so not surprised. I'm more excited about the vault songs since I probably will keep streaming the og SN like with Red
I think speak now is the only one where I’m attached to her young vocals but I agree overall
Sorry they made insta embeds so complicated haha
Kim K x Paul Mescal when?? Their couple name could be Messkal.
HELPPP I MEANT TIMOTHEE NOT TIM APPLE
Not gonna lie it’s sad the idea that his harmless private life would dictate his professional reputation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLvtTb6ciM4
I can’t speak for the others, but for me it’s not offense but more of “another unexpected, out-of-the-blue (blew in this case) thing to hear a celebrity share today.” It’s among the most random tidbits I’ve ever heard, up there with Katy Perry was interested in sexy wheelchair time with Russell Brand, or (not so much about sex) Jennifer Love Hewitt revealing she uses pure vanilla extract as a perfume. Like, interesting. You do you, but, interesting.
Nothing is scared 😭
TMI but swallowing fresh nicotine-flavored creme de bruche was the worst thing that I put in my mouth. 💀
The latter.
Honestly, the whole discussion of the pay gap issue in Hollywood is like walking on thin ice because you want to make sure you have all of these other considerations such as experience and acting resume factored in whether the salaries are justified.  That being said, it's sad that racism and sexism play a factor in the pay gap which is why it's a big issue in the first place.
Right? Like he’s almost 50 and has been working since the early 00s. This is like her 2nd major role.
Pop Tingz annoys me so much because they so clearly are trying to be another Pop Base/Crave but then they’ll just say shit that’s not true at all to start drama and they’ll try and defend it like “well this is my page and this is my personal opinion” which yeah okay but you’re clearly trying to make yourself out to be an account that’s “newsworthy” 60% of the time and most people are only engaging with your tweets with they get the outrage clicks they want. It’s such a mess and I wish we could go back to when they were never a thing
that entire account just spreads misinformation all the time, idk how it gained a lot of followers and attention
Ellie Goulding was so real for that. I just know the people behind Pop-Tingz were nervous that a celebrity can actually call out their bullshit.
Variety did report on him making [$600K an episode](https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/tv-salaries-2021-kate-winslet-jason-sudeikis-succession-1235043291/). But I don't think there are any reputable sources on what she makes. I think somebody just pulled it off of one of those dumb websites that makes things up entirely.
The quote tweets of that tweet really show how true your meme is. 😭
Honestly since it’s a U.S. centric chart I’m not surprised a commercially successfully American in a popular American genre is ahead of a European who is big but did have the cross over it to the market that’s literally his home base
I'm still surprised that Last Night got so high.
I only recently got into her discography but I honestly can’t tell which version supposedly has more emotion. Some of the older ones do sound better production wise although I lean towards the new ones because I greatly prefer her newer vocals
Sometimes it sounds like she’s trying too hard to sound like she did in the OG recording instead of just singing with her current voice. It makes it sound off.
Agreed. The Taylor’s version sound like a verbal shrug to me. They lack any authentic emotion to me, but I’m glad so many others are enjoying them ❤️
Same. I’ve literally only added the vault songs into the OG album playlists and I’m content with that. SN is also my favorite Taylor album so if I had hard time with Fearless and Red TV’s I’m pretty sure I won’t like that one either.
That’s fair, I love the re-records but I especially love hearing people’s different opinions on them, I think it’s so interesting! She is giving it her whole abdomen though hahah she really said Speak Now is a rock album and it will get me yelling
We don’t need this energy out in the world. The destruction it would make to the fragile sally rooney universe ecosystem
i know haha
The way I’m 90% sure I know what this is before opening it  Edit: I was right 😭😩
Katy Perry what now
You are braver than the troops
I never knew this was a thing💀 that's highkey scary that it affects your body to *that* extent
\*WRETCHES\*  You are doing the lord's work, babe.
The worst part is that there are people who do believe whatever bullshit Pop Tingz say on their page. I am trying my best not to get annoyed at people for not doing their basic fact-checking, but I am definitely upset that Pop Tingz is justifying their lapses in reporting. This is falling on disinformation at this point and social media is already in its terrible state in fighting against fake news.
Thank you for pulling this up! But yeah, the tweet from PopTingz still comes off as dishonest because there's no reliable proof of how much Bella Ramsey gets paid.
I prefer the original You Belong With Me, it just has way more personality
I totally get that cause for instance I only listen to fearless TV, I actually didn't even like that album until the Tv version came out. I think I'm partial to the other og versions (except début I don't listen to either) because I'm more used to them
Probably cause she wants people to use them as full on replacements and not a different take on the song.
Everytime someone says Accelerate, I have to use the opportunity to link Ajay's reaction. 😭
The power couple formerly known as Russty Branderry let it out that they were totally into and up for wheelchair sexy time. I wish I hadn’t shared that. You can Google it, but use your words carefully and probably don’t use Images. 😳
I think my most controversial TV-related opinion is that I prefer state of grace TV over the original
You are doing the lord’s work. Ajay needs to come back if only to react to Christina’s latest media release. 💀
so excited to see them play msg again 🥹🥹  presale starts next week depending on the venue but it seems the earliest one is april 11 at 10AM EST. registration isn’t available yet (?) and some south america dates are yet to be announced. lots of details to come soon!!!
They've definitely been saving most of 5SOS5 for this tour, so I'm praying that Carousel, You Don't Go to Parties, Moodswings, and Tears makes the setlist! Hopefully I can get tickets this year, I saw them live last year and have wanted to go back ever since.
I'm gonna go feral pls god they better come to here I want to throw ass to BLENDER
I am so excited that they are touring again this year!!
I saw them last year and it was literally in my top 3 best concert experiences ever. Can’t wait to see them again
I’ve never had meh luck seeing 5sos live, it’s never their fault but it is always funny. 2 times I’ve seen them they were opening and the second time, it was for the chainsmokers so the crowd was so dead and not there to see them at all. The last time the venue was just overall really shitty and at the end I remember them commenting that hopefully next time they toured it would be anywhere but there so I’m happy to see they’ve picked a new venue!   I haven’t heard much of the new album yet but I’ll get on it since it think it’d be fun to see them live again (and hopefully 4th times the charm)
saw them at the sydney opera house in december and they were fantastic!! highly recommend getting tickets if u can, i can't wait for another aus show
why did they choose this picture lol
YOOO
they’re actually doing arenas in the US again wow
prayyying for flatline too 😭 according to an update acc ticketmaster says that the reason they’re touring is due to the release of their live album “the feeling of falling upwards” from ono at royal albert hall sooo maybe some older hits as well? would die to hear outer space/carry on live
They really did Ash dirty with this one
Oh hell yeah! I think I was taken to church when I saw the ONO version of Outer Space, they'd better play that on tour.
I'm with you on Flatline!!!!
Put your brains together, popheads. How do we bully this band away?
Beavis and Butthead could spend a whole season or two solely roasting these guys.

This is basically Daisy Part 2 but I love that
prefacing this with i'm a BIG fan of hers. this one hits better at a first listen than her last two singles. worms has grown on me a bit but i still feel like it's missing the punchiness of a lot of her more poppy songs, and i so desperately want you make me sick to have a bridge or something to break it up and give it room to breathe for a second so that it can come back in going even harder. in summary they are both a little one note for me, especially for ash who i consider to be a pop artist that is pretty multidimensional in her stylistic influences. this release is def more dynamic but not an immediate replay for me like a lot of her past releases have been. i will say she does seem to have a specific vision and direction in mind with this album which i like. very interested to hear the rest of it and excited to see her on tour this fall.
They sound the same as her last few but that's OK, I'm here for it.
Definitely the vibe I got too! “You Make Me Sick!” took me some time to really gel with and fully appreciate, but I feel like “Worms” and now “Weedkiller” have that signature Ash magic! Can’t wait for the full album.

Usually not a fan of her but I'm gonna listen just because it's not personal
The album is truly a pop masterpiece. How Long is a BANGER
Because we all know how personal Future Nostalgia was.
“personal-driven” is such a terrible phrase for a headline. You usually use a noun before “-driven” it’s so ugly   There are so many better ways to say this as well. I know I sound like an English teacher but I am at times shocked by what these massive companies will publish 🤣
The albums is flawless. Period.
I fucking Love this women! She’s so weird, yet so unproblematic
Don't want to sound dumb but what do they mean by "personal-driven"?
Or Renaissance. I’d say it’s one of Beyoncé’s lest personal albums yet still one of her best. Same for Future nostalgia
For real who the fuck wrote that
Ugh, yes fire the editor on this... It's so bad
It also ended a lot sooner than I was expecting. I guess it's not that short, but it didn't manage to say much.  Idk, maybe I'm biased as an impatient fan
confessional pop would have been way better
+ her new song slaps
>In an era when most pop stars wax lyrical about the soul-baring honesty of their songwriting, there’s something refreshing about the unusual way Ellie Goulding is talking up ‘Higher Than Heaven’. “It’s the least personal album [I’ve made],” she said recently, “but I think it’s the best album because I got to just explore other things about myself.  The opening paragraph explains it pretty well.
You mean Beyonce singing an r/antiwork hymn about quitting you 9 to 5 is not drawn on personal experience?

I MET BEYONCÉ TODAY!!!  She was such a kind hearted person and so funny. When I asked her about renaissance visuals she told me: “I was about to release them, but then I remember how little r/popheads streamed Black Is King so I decided to hold it back for a bit”. So in conclusion stream Black Is King if you haven’t already to manifest Renaissance visuals (and also because it’s incredible and soooo underrated)
I turned down a guy on Grindr just now and he immediately said I looked like Sid from Ice Age  Apart from that being funny as fuck, another random guy said I looked like Sid from toy story like a year ago so I guess I'm a Sid kind of guy now huh
I literally have no idea what the fuck I want out of my life anymore. Like... I'm not progressing in ANY way and I just don't know how to get out and move on to the "next stage" in my life when I don't know what to do. I don't know what to "chase" for and work towards for. It's annoying.
I don't get the uproar over the critic rating for Mario movie. the critics don't have an agenda against mario or kids' movies and they're all not pretentious. the main criticism is that the movie lacks a story and is just filled with fanservice with bad voice acting so yeah, makes sense that critics won't rate it high. I'm not a huge Mario fan but I feel like creating a story for a movie should've been easy, even the lego movie was able to do it

I rewatched Alien (1979) today and I think it’s moved up to ‘favourite horror film’ status for me. There’s a few reasons.  1.	More class commentary than I remember.  2.	 Scary as fuck  3.	Sigourney Weaver 4.	Jonesy is a good cat.
ok besties here’s my sorority drama for this week.   Picture this. You have a sorority house with eight spots. The house fits sixteen people. Ten of them want to have cars in the lot. The street your house is on does not permit street parking, so those who don’t get spots would have to park several streets away. However, your house is in a city and not in the safest area, though it is close to campus.   How do you decide who gets the spots? Do you go by seniority? Do you prioritize those who already have cars in the lot? Do you collect reasons from those who want cars as to why they need them? Do you use a random number generator?

Can an ex who wants to be a friend give me the ick. She so badly wants to be back in my life in whatever context and I don't really get why she's putting in so much effort. She's also the type to want to constantly have a running conversation and I hate not tending to notifs and leaving them on read so you can imagine how this goes...
lately (but really my whole life) i’ve been longing for an asian friend group/community. everyone i know who’s the same ethnicity as me seems like they have a tight knit community whether it’s because they have relatives close in age or just have an asian friend group and it makes me so jealous. i truly have been deprived of it all my life and now i want it more than ever :( think the need for it has become even stronger now as i have realized i want my future partner to share the same culture as me, and i just think it’d be easier if i already had people like that around me. i also have the same longing for a lgbtq community (for the same-ish reason)  i have also now spent a week curating my monologue to my ex where i will arrange for me to stop by his place to pick up something i left at his and then tell him we should agree to stop pretending that we’re friends and essentially cutting each other off for good. i need it to heal and move forward. i will hopefully be able to perform this next week. i can’t wait to be in my “feather” by sabrina carpenter era 🫶🏼
went to see Mario last night and it was quite fun! it has a simple story and great animation. The kids around me were having a blast and the laughter was contagious so I kinda got to feel like a kid again for a little while. Certainly, is no masterpiece but I had a good time and it makes clear from the beginning that's it's main purpose
Wide awake came on shuffle and the way it transported me back in time, never felt so old in my life it's a weird feeling, like it feels kinda suffocating I was lowkey panicking
Perusing the [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/12dvile/men_would_you_take_a_male_contraceptive_pill_if/) from men saying they absolutely wouldn’t use a male contraceptive pill if it was readily available and being like, surejan.gif
About to get cockblocked AGAIN. This is a travesty
Cardi B Invasion of Privacy turns 5 years old today  Edit: Kali Uchis Isolation turns 5 years old today as well
self improvement is always gonna be a life-long journey, but i feel more like myself than i have in awhile. it's a really good feeling 💗
good news: i finally found actual psychologist who can get me a diagnosis for autism! i just hope it doesn't eat 50% of my standby money.
How do you deal with psychos at work! I have a nasty person on my team that makes everything a whole slice of hell.
As someone who lives in a Catholic country that takes Lent very seriously, going to work on Maundy Thursday and Good Friday feels like the week between Christmas and New Year where time feels frozen. Nearly all stores are closed in observation of Lent and there's not much vehicles in the street. The people you'll see on the street are most likely on their to and from church. It feels even weirder going to my nightshift job handling overseas accounts who are business as usual.
mad annoyed at people who don't respond to messages and have to be pestered for a reply.   fuck you! You're cut! You're not in this dance anymore, bitch!
Y’all this tweet about how Rollingstone named Lana and Taylor the best songwriters is freaking me out because the photo they used of Taylor.  https://twitter.com/thepophive/status/1643968562820964352?s=46&t=VqyqEwKEE-FNm5x829J1Gw  I’m partially face blind so I could be over reacting but that’s not Taylor swift. Right?
not to be that person but lots of people on high horses on the kim nicki annoucement but i remember yall was hyping melanie up.... not really adding up idk
Ok, you know whose cameo in The Mandalorian was so random. Didn't expect this person to show up in this show of all places😭😭
How long until one of the children that saw Lil Nas X preform at their school makes their way to popheads

My early teen crushes are so tragic
It's official: Azealia Banks's '212' is now Radio 2 music. I never thought I'd hear the day  (For people outside the UK, Radio 2 is the BBC's main adult contemporary station)
the way boys planet was supposed to be my straight girl era but i ended up supporting the fruitiest trainee like i can't
I had tickets to Aly & AJ’s Philly show on the 16th, then my stupid cousin had to go and plan her baby shower for that day, so I have the option to get tickets to the Maryland show the day prior (about the same distance). I’ve seen them 3 times before, and they’re always phenomenal, but my best friend and go-to partner for concerts was not into With Love From (and really neither was I), so I’m wondering if it’s worth the 5+ hour trip to see them when the thrust of the set is an album I didn’t love. They’re phenomenal performers and if it were Cleveland or Pittsburgh I wouldn’t think twice. Idk.
God I love when people call me all angry especially when it's about some shit I have nothing to do with it's so cool and mature and smart of them. They imply that I'm stupid for not *knowing* ***their*** *child's social security number* and I think wow this person is someone I aspire to be I love talking to them. I want to help them so much. It's such a good strategy to be mean to random people to get what you want because your cruelty is the only thing that makes it possible for me to give you the secret second phone number for the passport agency, a thing which definitely exists.
Tiktok keeps showing me all the cute gay couple videos and I feel so lonely and single (yet I keep watching them all, but you know how these apps suck you in) and like why is this reminding me of being 14 and closeted watching troye sivan tyler oakley etc gay videos on youtube
can y'all link ur spotify playlists 🫶🏼 i really need new songs
I’m such a sucker for ratchet female rap. I want “my coochie pink, my bootyhole brown” tattoo’d on me.
day 5 of my friend ghosting our group. i finally caved and asked someone who was there but not part of (what i suspect was) the main conflict, but they didnt really have any info to offer, just that things seemed okay for the most part.    i want to try asking someone else, maybe one of the main "conflict" parties, but maybe just the ghosting friend themselves. not really sure how to tackle it, or if i should be tackling anything.   ive been friends with the ghosting friend for years, way way longer than ive known anyone else in the current group. we've been friends through multiple other friend groups, we're still in another server together with different people....but theyre inactive there too (although the dynamic in that one is different, and on the whole all the members arent super active).    maybe im just worried that if theyre ghosting this current group, theyve decided to include me with them even tho we've been friends for way longer. i think id feel weird staying with this group if they left it entirely. maybe theyre really just taking a social/social media break and im overthinking everytihng....but i dont think so. i dunno
Does anyone know why Austin Mahome never really took off? I just saw him on Cameo and thought about how he really missed out.
Btw good luck next week to all the juniors who have to take the SAT
Recently got back from my first trip to Montréal and Toronto! Both very lovely cities. :) Queen Street West in Toronto kind of reminded me of Lombard Street in San Francisco a small bit
You know those questionnaire fuckups where the answer options have absolutely nothing to do with the question? I saw a thread with a bunch of them a few months ago, one of them was "gender" and the options were from "strongly agree" to "strongly disagree"  I joked that my gender was "somewhat disagree" but it actually kinda makes sense??? And I haven't stopped thinking about it since 🫥
now that i’m home with my setup… can confirm that ocean blvd is absolutely amazing on vinyl
that video of justice smith talking about genera+ion and how it is so underrated😭 i miss my comfort show so much
People in long-term relationships:  When people fight over the smallest things, is it just because of familiarity and pettiness or is it something else like unresolved issues or pettiness?
Had a breakdown at work (due to not getting any sleep last night) and had five teachers show up to take care of my class and send me home.   Embarrassed but grateful for the kindness of my coworkers. Trying to nap but still anxious.
my HOA has been working on replacing all the buildings' staircases recently and i'm goin nuts !! my building is litrally last on the list even tho one of our staircases has a stair that's been knocked off line for years at this point lol!!! its so bad :)))))) anyway idk maybe the other stairwells are even worse but man its so frustrating to not even have a start date estimate
Young queer people often get shit on for “making being queer their entire personality” but as some who falls for the corporate pride month scam of slapping a rainbow on to a tee shirt and calling it allyship, I get it.
Kill Bill is [neck-in-neck](https://twitter.com/talkofthecharts/status/1643801118017830912) with Morgan Wallen's song for #1 this week, everyone go buy the song by tonight! it's only 69 cents rn!!
John Wick 4 was both amazing, and way too violent for me lmao. Man’s out there shooting downed combatants and using flame weaponry, breaching international law.  People are stabbed, shot, bludgeoned, hit by cars, set alight, kicked off buildings. It’s crazy. There’s a certain point where a >!dog urinates on a corpse!< and the whole cinema cheered lol. Maybe i’m just getting soft, but I thought it was too much.
I just started watching *I, Tonya* and the scene with her mom was already triggering. I love movies like that though. I’m looking for movies like Marie Antoinette, where you kind of get into the female psyche? It’s just such a refreshing movie, oftentimes movies only show women from the male perspective which is quite sad when you think about how half the population is literally women
One day I’m gunna have the energy and write out the story of how I met Taylor Swift when I was 11 because my grandpa died. Happiest day of my life kinda sad I grew out of her music.
Kind of weird how the Tennessee GOP only voted out the two black democrats and not the white lady.   Like…..Do they not see how poor that looks. Kicking out the only three democrats but then only kicking out the two black Dems……  Don’t fault or blame Rep. Gloria Johnson for the GOPs blatant racism but like come on…..they are really just making it too obvious about their racism.
Still thinking about how Lorelai Lynch was snubbed. 😔
Tomorrow is my grandfather's birthday, and I was thinking of just doctoring a cake mix for him, but looking at it it seems like I may just as well make one completely from scratch myself. I enjoy baking from scratch a lot and it's been awhile since I baked a cake, anyway, so I'm looking forward to it now!  Anyway I think I'm gonna use [this recipe](https://preppykitchen.com/german-chocolate-cake/)  Also I got out and went for a walk this morning and it was really nice. Everything is in bloom and so pretty, and it was nice and cloudy for most of the walk so it wasn't too warm.
Saw Six yesterday! We were in the second row even though they were lottery tickets...so lucky omg. It was perfect too, it really felt like being up front for a concert (only seated and comfy af vs. GA standing). Definitely would recommend seeing it if you can.
[Trailer for *My Adventures With Superman* dropped!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw91jQwJnDo)   I was worried that it wasn't in development anymore given that it was a WB property but it looks great, I love the *Totally Spies* style anime-esque animation. Superman is my favorite (real) super hero and this seems like exactly the kind of show I want to watch about him.
have any of you guys gotten an email from Spotify from being a Jessie Ware top listener?? She announced a new single in mine but no one is talking about it 💀
The double standards in this sub is insane. The response to Kim’s upcoming release (she has defended dr. luke many times) is overwhelmingly positive yet people will get a chance to bring up Chloe’s collab with chris brown every time they get 😩 It’s pretty clear that people pick and choose with their morals
I can:t believe TikTok edits (of Pedro Pascal, of course) will be the thing that finally makes me listen to Lana Del Rey. A&W has been on heavy rotation lately because of the edits, she kinda snapped on that one.
Omg there were so many popheads in yesterday's TT thread horrified that Tori Spelling kept her contacts in for 20 days.   I was just like, girlllll, i've been doing the same for 3 years😶😶😶😬💀
Fun little question:  You’re taking a trip with two other friends. You book a three bedroom AirBnB.   You and one of the friends is single, the other friend is married.  Who gets the master bedroom? The married couple or the single friend who booked the trip?
since it's good/black friday (whatever you call it), RIP jesus. you would've loved pop2 by charli xcx
Did anyone else know that Wilson Phillips sang background vocals on FourFiveSeconds??? Just learned this a few days ago and really surprised me lol
Question: what is your favorite "slow" song right now? Doesn't hav to be new, but just one you have listened to a few times in the last few days or so!?!??!
Every thriller/mystery book I've read has paled in comparison to Gone Girl. The thrillers/mysteries that have come out recently are especially bad. Thrillers/mysteries srsly need to stop being basic and give us good stories. Also the covers need to change!
I feel like I’m coming down with Covid or the flu except I’ve got no respiratory symptoms and every test I’ve done has been negative 🫠  I’ve managed to binge the entire first season of Designated Survivor and got 80% of the trophies in Astro’s Playroom bc I’ve not moved off the sofa in 2 days
I'm listening to aespa's Hold on Tight and I keep getting jumpscared thinking that Karina is yelling "FUCK YA LIFE" in the prechorus
Do you ever wonder… like who else is fucking your man?
The A.I covers have gotten way too scary man. Just saw one where they made Ari sing Newjeans' OMG, and while for the most parts it's still noticeably fake, some parts do sound kinda real. Probably won't be long until people use A.I to fake recordings for smear campaigns or stuff like that.
Popheads is it basic of me to get into Rina's music because of John Wick Chapter 4
Phillies opening day postponed until Friday, and I can't make Friday work due to some other plabs. *sad baseball noises* Plus side, I am going on Saturday, so I'll still get to attend Home Opening Weekend, but opening day is just special, ya know? Gotta figure out what I'm doing with my day off now, though.    ~~I'm pretty sure the entire city will riot though if the weather stays as nice. Yeah, thunderstorms can roll in fast and heavy but oh my god, it is so beautiful out.~~
Some white twink on Twitter decided it would be cute to start a war between Black people and Asian people just because of a joke that Quinta made about Friends on SNL. 😐
Happy last day of the work week! Well, for some of us anyway. We don’t do too much for Easter except for Target run the day after to get all the Easter Candy on sale to get rid of it.   I have to remember to hide my change jar when I get home. My nephew is coming over for the long weekend and last few times he’s been stealing my quarters, Nickels, and Dimes out of my change jar. Last time I had about $30 worth of change and all he left me was the pennies. How I found out is I was about to cash them in and wasn’t even worth doing it.   At least my work turned back on the decent playlist. Aka they finally paid the Pandora subscription.
Morning Raters and R&B lovers!  I'd like to mention that we currently have 33 participants for Confessional R&B! As always, [check the list to make sure I have you marked down](https://pastebin.com/wkecKLv9) as **there are now only 10 days until the window to submit officially closes**! Now the rate was named "Confessional R&B" for all 4 of the artists laying down some vulnerable and personal stories that allow multiple listeners to relate, whether it is based on heartbreak, struggles in relationships, or finally being at piece. I already talked about all the lead singles from every album in the rate. Now I would like to move onto a couple other tracks I think are very much worth highlighting.  # [Jazmine Sullivan - Hurt Me So Good](https://youtu.be/O0dajiO1ZIc)  As I've mentioned before, *Heaux Tales* is meant to be a project where Jazmine takes the story of one of the other women involved in the album and dedicate a song to said story from their point of view. However, on the deluxe version of the album, this song is the only track on the project where Jazmine sings from her own experiences. Predating this track is the interlude "Jazzy's Tale" where she says the following:  >Growing up a brown skinned girl, a fat girl, essentially growing up feeling undesirable. When I got older and I had a man that desired me, it validated me and made me feel good about myself. Therefore, the content that the validation brought me was worth the actual pain that the relationship eventually brought. And it's a sad, scary, and vulnerable place when you need to feel love so much that you're willing to accept anything.  It's by far the most personal tale/song on the album. Of course, the topic itself has been done before from other artists, revolving around continuing to stay in an unhealthy relationship feeling that the satisfaction you get is worth the pain. But man the passion in her voice while being backed up by as little as a small choir and piano makes this all the more gut-wrenching. Arguably one of my favorites on the project and a great addition to an already very vulnerable body of work.
my library's website has been down all day 😭 like i have books to lookup and add to my future reads list!
I love how West End Girls sounds so much, whenever I hear the song I just 😵‍💫 What are other songs that sound like this???
checked setlist.fm for the current HEALTH tour, we’re seeing them this saturday. looks like we’re getting spoiled. last time we saw them (almost exactly four years ago) it was a REALLY short set, this time looks like they’re doing 21 songs, pretty well spread out over their albums too so that’s gonna be sick
I could have had the day off tomorrow but thankfully my supervisors weren't available to talk to when I needed them so I will be going to work and getting my full pay. Otherwise, I would have taken the day off.
wildflower wildfire is probably my favourite lana song like those lyrics👀
Ok, the whole Angel Reese thing with Jill Biden is now getting ridiculous.   Jill Biden is essentially a 75 year old grandma who probably doesn’t even like sports. Angel, let it go, and go to the White House. Things that seem “edgy” at 21 are often looked back in embarrassment at 28.
Any other 2001-born gurlies here👀  I wanna stay 21 forever why do I have to turn 22 this year😭
5SOS going on tour again and suddenly all is right in the world.
Attending my first kpop concert solo and idk something about them playing a video of a dance practice during the show feels very chaotic and I'm not sure how to feel about it. There's also been lots of talking to the audience between songs which I'm not huge on, but maybe that's impacted by me only being a super casual fan (as in, I don't know any of their names, casual). Anyway it's certainly an experience so far!
i have no idea who vance joy is but new noah cyrus ugh she can do no wrong
Is Soccer Mommy an industry plant or something? It seems like she’s constantly getting booked to open for big tours despite not being particularly great. I’ve seen her as an opening act three times and the crowd has never vibed to her. She’s opening for The National this May too, so that’ll be show #4 for me. There’s more information on her Wikipedia page about all the tours she’s opened for than about her albums. I don’t get it.

Last night's Abbott Elementary episode is sooooo good
So what the hell is the deal with that whole situation with Melanie Martinez's accusations as I always thought it was false but then I saw YouTube music critic Brad Taste In Music go on this big long rant in his community tab about her and her fans as if it was true (and people in his comments section doing things like talking about literally throwing merch away or making JKR comparisons) and I'm rhetorically not sure which is worse (as obviously her having done the thing would be), her having done the thing she's being accused of or Brad hating the new album so much he would say the accusations were true if they weren't
somi on boys planet, this show is truly for me and the straight girl era agenda found dead in a ditch
Has there ever been a producers rate? Like imagine a collection of songs from Rostam, Jack Anatoff, SOPHIE etc, would be cool to see/do
u will love this tv show swarm.
you are so silly. i had a viewing party for black is king in palm springs with a bunch of gays, so there's that
Oh wow, you had a much nicer encounter with Beyonce than this lady on TikTok who said she got beaten up by her, Solange, and Blue Ivy when she asked if Bey is going to release the Renaissance visuals anytime soon.
The idea that critics hate fun and hate movies and whatever is so strange! Like, you have to really *really* love your chosen lane of film to have the knowledge and depth and ability to get the chance to have a wide readership/viewership for your reviews
yeah dont do it. it just builds resentment (in you), and you're gonna end up alone
what do u mean???
I would say that if anyone has a particularly good reason for needing a close parking spot (reoccurring leg/knee injuries, chronic illnesses, disabilities, etc) get first dibs.  After that, I would use a lottery system (pick names out of a hat, random number generator, etc) to decide. I think that is really the only fair way to go.
You could swap things around every quarter of the semester so everyone gets a parking spot for like 3/4 of the semester.
SELF CARE is important for the nonprofit for underserved staff! does your work have any sort of mental or emotional support insurance or services they provide???? if so, take advantage of them! you are worth it ho!
Sufjan Stevens - Carrie and Lowell Arian Grande - Sweetener  Tracy Chapman - Tracy Chapman Beyonce - Lemonade  Mike Dean - 4:20
Also getting my ankle check and I hate being weighed here because one hand great to know my vitals are good but also like I gained ten pounds I haven’t been able to lose and I don’t want to talk to a doctor about trying to manage weight with disordered eating habits and family that both complains about you eating but also thinks you should eat what ever they give you and make even if you’re not hungry otherwise they’ll cry you hate them 🫥  🫡 wish me luck
I've gotten so lazy with my skincare since moving to dayshift (waking up at 4:30 in the morning is roughhhh) but my skin really looks so much better when I use both my creams. I need to wake up earlier I guess
I’m doing good to wash my face once a day. I hate my lack of discipline. Although going gluten-free has cleared up 90% of my acne.
I feel you about tending to notifs… I’m a fast replier because of that and it gets on my nerves when it’s just up there in my head when I don’t reply to someone. Honestly being in a relationship and texting is like playing mental ping-pong in your head. It’s tiring
honestly? if your ex gives you the ick, you don't have to entertain the idea of friendship for the sake of her feelings. i know how that sounds, but i would be grateful if someone was honest with me about being uncertain about moving into a friendship after the end of a relationship. that energy and time could be spent on new friends, or being attentive to the other friendships in her life. but if you'd like to have her as a friend, then having a conversation about your different communication styles + setting boundaries sounds like it might help.
One method that may work is check asian meetup.com groups
Was Mario’s voice weird like everyone expected
god that means the best year of my life was 5 years ago ugh
do you think you are?? if so, why?
Don’t engage if they pick fights it only encourages them
my catholic parents are appalled that everyone has to work today and tomorrow in the US. this week always adds fuel to their fire of "this country \*persecutes\* us" mentality.
I think it’s the bangs that make her look off. It’s wild how…average (not offensive) she looks when she’s not glammed up. I wouldn’t notice her in public like that.
No that’s her lol
That is in fact Taylor Swift
Help It looks normal to me 😭
It's the angle, the lighting and Taylor's hair that makes her look different but it's definitely her.
I saw gifs on tumblr and thought it was like a Super Bowl commercial or something but no apparently that really happened! Okay!
Someone mentioned offhand and I thought it was wild but I assumed it was like a “lupita in episode 7 type of deal” and it wasn’t until I saw the gifs and realized that was not the case
how do you even find a radio edit of that song, half of it has to be silent surely? 😭
I adore them live, and also really loved With Love From, but I am curious how it’ll translate to a concert since so much of it is so chill. I did see them in MD last year at the same venue, and it was great. But it also sounds like a really long trip for you, so if you weren’t as into this album, then it doesn’t sound worth it. I’m sorry!
If anyone was wondering, when you apply for a US passport the normal way it is only in the acceptance facility's hands for like, a day before it gets mailed off and we literally have no way to check on it after that point, so if you can't get through to the 877 number that the state department runs (BECAUSE YOU KEEP CALLING WHEN THEY'RE FUCKING CLOSED) don't fucking call the people you applied with they can't do shit please leave us alone please stop yelling at me I want to light your house on fire and I am going to do as little as possible to be helpful the second you start yelling at me.
Frustrating isn't it? We have people coming into our office with the following things: a nice little chip on their shoulder, an attitude, complaints about how EVERYONE ELSE is treating them, etc. But they deadass come in WITHOUT their appointment notices or without their proper identification and then catch an attitude when you ask them for either. But again, it's US who is mistreating them.
My TikTok is so bipolar because it keeps showing me the men vs women debates and then immediately after showing me cute couples like make up your damn mind.
This one has a loose breakup/moving on from relationships theme but I’ve been jammin’ to it the last few days just because:  https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2riL5LW9Oisp1UFcdnJB8j?si=yrVCOMTXR0ONyXznEC7ETg&dd=1
Don’t know what music you’re into but [Someone a few months/year ago made me a list of albums to make my music more diverse](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5Ps4qaObQ0hFFA79XwKybk?si=Opl1dEWYS7WWgdvboivKDA) (and I also put Dedicated Side B cause why not) hopefully you’ll find something you like here
I think you should talk to them directly, imo.
I think you should reach out!
He had a few good songs that were moderate hits but, imo, it was too much marketing him as the "next justin bieber" when Justin was/is still a huge celebrity. Then, his rebrand of sex icon felt forced and desperate. I think all the "next Justin Bieber" like Cody Simpson, Grayson Chance, etc. flopped for the same reason.
I had a complete brain fart when I wrote this comment and MEANT to say the Haight-Ashbury District in San Fran 😭 oopsie
The best ones I’ve seen are where when someone chooses other and writes something in it because an answer choice. So for gender you can pick from “female” “femal” “femael” and the iconic “non hispanic”  Personally I’d love it if for gender questions the only options were “cis” “trans” “non binary” and you can select multiple.
What color did you get?
He talked about it recently?
could be both? if it is the same fight about the same smallest things then it’s definitely unresolved and petty. if it’s different small things and couples find new things to fight about then it’s mostly familiarity and petty
Could be the couple doesn’t know how to argue productively and pick their battles? Idk that’s a hard question without knowing details. The three year itch is also real. My partner and I did a lot of growing (and productive fighting) in year three because you start asking yourself big questions about compatibility.   edited for brevity lol
When my husband and I were in marriage counseling for some issues at the time, our therapist said when having petty arguments don’t ask why what they’re doing is upsetting you, but ask how are you reacting in the first place. It kinda sounds like the same thing but it isn’t. He could forget something and make me mad.The emotion could either lead me to yelling, crying , or being silent or all of the above. But most of all the reaction is what brings the argument when it comes to these petty issues. So I yelled and cried and that upset him further and he yelled back about some random event and then it snow balls.   Or I react with a steady head and explain my issue. He either understands and apologizes and we move on or he has a counter point and we dive deep into other issues that are the real problem. Either way reaction is the key to figuring out if it’s petty or if it’s something else.
i mean, both. couples fall into a pattern of taking small things to an unhealthy level and that breeds resentment and unresolved issues.
one of the most humbling moments of my life was when I wrote in to an lgbt/sexuality-centric “Dear Abby” forum about how annoying I thought my friend was for making “being queer her entire personality. The columnist told me that actually, I was the problem and just had a ton of internalized homophobia. It hurt at the time but like… she wasn’t wrong!
obviously there are like exceptions and extremes to everything, but this notion of gatekeeping personality types is so stupid
I find it so Intriguing how violence in films is treated to real world violence. Like I 100% get it’s all fake obviously but also the way people feed off of it makes me wonder how many just really want to do those things in real life.
Gone Girl, and Joy Luck Club maybe?
I loved I, Tonya! Virgin Suicides, Diary of a Teenage Girl, and Promising Young Woman are some of the other female-centered movies I like but I should warn you that they can be very very triggering. There’s also this [video edit](https://youtu.be/uHAcEf-TFAU) on YouTube that compiles movies that show feminine rage so you can try seeing what you like from there. Not a movie but you might also like Big Little Lies.
some movies that are pretty good imo:  women talking  passing  little women (greta gerwig's version) (other ones are also good im sure but i loved this one)  heavenly creatures
They know exactly how it looks. They just don’t care
was the third guy expelled yet? I didn't hear anything about his vote yet
but paloma diamond was right there! she had that olivia coleman route going for her!
Ooh that recipe looks so good! I've never made anything with meringue i don't think. There's nothing better than the accomplishment of baking a cake by scratch! The end result is always worth it imo. I don't really like using cake mix, but when i do i always doctor it up. And Happy Bday to your Grandfather!
It’s to be expected because we all have inherit bias towards people that we like but gosh it’s so annoying when people try to bring up things like problematic collabs as a reason to not like an artist because it’s never consistent.   If I don’t like an artist I would never be like “oh it’s because they did this fucked up thing one time” knowing that my fav is far from perfect. I don’t know why is so hard for people to just say they don’t like someone, there’s nothing wrong with that.
> It’s pretty clear that people pick and choose with their morals  which is weird consider neither Kim's and Nicki's new music is that good to be doing that for
Except people constantly point out that “Kim works with Dr. Luke” like that’s always the first or second comment
This sub is basically always looking for reasons to justify its biases against black artists so its not surprising
i see dr luke in every kim thread and im only know about the cb collab because of this comment lol maybe i don't pay enough attention
omg dont do it gurl... all it takes is one infection... dont be lazy and cheap. you only get one set of ocular orbits baby
Shoot I feel guilty when I take a long nap in my contacts, when I pass out and fall asleep with my contacts in I feel like they're glued to my eyeballs I don't know how you're all doing it
The only reasons I don’t wear contacts anymore is because I was too lazy/depressed to take them out. I have them for when I’m playing tennis with a friend or skateboarding but other than that I’m glasses all the way.  Zenni sells cheap glasses if you know your script.
the married friend’s spouse is coming?
Trick question: it's a three bedroom AirBnB, everyone gets their own room. Therefore the friend who booked it should get the master bedroom.
My automatic thought is the married couple since they’d have no issue doubling up in one bed, that’s a smart use of space, but if it doesn’t feel egalitarian it’s whomever wants to pay more. Master tends to be nicer with more amenities.
married couple for sure since usually i spend not that much time in the bedrooms at least when i traavel lol
Whenever we plan a big friend trip with our friend group, we always let couples get the larger beds (even if they didn’t plan the trip). So I’d say the couple gets the master here and then the friend who planned the trip gets their pick from the other bedrooms
blue dress by aly & aj!! just really gorgeous and lush.
*Go Find Yourself or Whatever* by queen Carly has been on repeat since her album came out for me lol
seeing Weyes Blood this past weekend has had me revisiting her work more intensely than usual and overall she’s on the more slow folky/alt side so basically her discography in general    special shoutout to [Seven Words](https://open.spotify.com/track/3UpZZWAFQlWTQM8xl4UlOW?si=t_btbfDqSfW5HbawhD001A&dd=1) since she said she wasn’t it doing it this time around when asked about it lmao
(They Long To Be) Close To You the carpenters  Hide and Seek Imogen Heap  All is Full of Love (Rosie Thomas cover)  Home with you FKA Twigs  Animal Troye Sivan  No Woman is an Island Rae Morris
for some reason i’ve had an unhealthy obsession with “how am i supposed to live without you” by michael bolton lately. i’ve always been obsessed but it came back hard. “things i wish you said” by sabrina carpenter has been hitting since its release too

>Probably won't be long until people use A.I to fake recordings for smear campaigns or stuff like that.  We really, really need strict AI laws to keep that from happening. Like, forget petty pop music stan nonsense—this could be used for political campaigns, false evidence in court, etc. It's terrifying.
that just means the propaganda is working. you're on the right path.
There's practically no wrong reason to get into it! The people who get upset about, like, new fans of Kate Bush after Stranger Things or whatever are *such* boring people who just need to get over unimportant stuff!
Same with Oriole's opening day
what happened
Twitter really is just a hellsite in the most derogatory sense 😵‍💫
lolll i used to steal coins from my dad all the time.... i cringe now thinking about it... so obvious
That's all I got for today!

what do you like about it most? there’s a few different directions i could go with recommendations so i wanna get a feel for which aspects about it you’re into
Dr. Biden is a pretty damn big Eagles and Phillies fan, she indeed does like sports. Just needed to throw that out there. (Being from the Philly area even are grandparents are INTENSE about sports)
Hey there 🫶🏻
Also I think I need to never come to this venue again because being under 5'6" is unbearable unless you're willing to pay VIP or line up 2 hours early (I ain't about that life). Watched the entirety of the start of the show through other people filming on their phones.
The way I can tell what show this is by the dance practice vcr mention lol that one really was long! I was also a casual fan (learned half of their names on the way there) so I stood in the far back to be able to see better. 10/10 would recommend doing so in the future if you don't care about being as close to the stage as possible for a show! Much better vibe and view over the shoulders of tall people. Small shows are such a roll of the dice vs the bigger production arena shows, I just wish all venues were seated or slanted
Vance Joy is the riptides guy
Just because you don’t think she talented doesn’t necessarily mean that she’s an industry plant lol.
Ummm I love Soccer Mommy. You saying she's not "particularly great" is definitely just an opinion that I don't share.
Maybe the universe just wants you to become a fan....four times is a lot of times to randomly catch someone lol. (Also gotta disagree with you re: industry plant/talent. she's great, everyone stream SOTY Shotgun)
melissa's speech💀💀
The accusations are definitely more substantial then her fans would have you think (who have literally and unsurprising faked screen shots of any recant that doesn’t exist and frankly would still be obvious under pressure of public harassment if it even did) but also also I don’t think there’s like some concrete evidence if that’s what you’re looking for   Based on what I know it’s always seemed like do you still believe victims when accused is a women who’s music you enjoy?  Martinez never denied they had a sexual relationship just that she said they “never said no to each other”. Which isn’t any different from what men say about allegations against them. Including saying in music form that the allegations only existed for the alleged victim to gain notoriety or something out of it.   For me bare minimum Martinez’s initial responses and music response speak volumes on her character and the likelihood there’s reality to the accusations. Especially when the only thing really to suggest it didn’t happen is the victim messing up dates or timeline which….is incredibly common with victims. Fans **very** conveniently omit that Martinez **admitted** to sexual acts together and only defense was that she never heard a no, which is literally rape culture that if a victim was quiet or didn’t struggle x way or y amount it’s consent. Her fans literally parrot rape culture to defend her and the only reason it doesn’t get brought up more is because Martinez isn’t relevant to the public to warrant the press attention.
You know that feeling when you play The Sims and your sim had a great conversation with another sim? It's kinda like that.
Thank you so much for providing an unbiased perspective! We don't have anybody with a medical need for a parking spot, so that isn't an issue. My parents think I should try to make a case that as a stage manager for a choir, I should get a spot, as I frequently travel with choir materials at night and alone. I was all for it at first, but I've started to fear that it's just my anxiety speaking. Like, I'm not going to get murdered walking two streets down with a music binder, y'know?
Our organization kindly offers us 15 free tele-therapy visits per calendar year  A pay raise would be nice tho lol
Thanks for this comment. I just on a whim decided to give Sufjan Stevens "Carrie and Lowell" a go and...it's incredible start to finish.
It is just a sprain and my weight didn’t come up but they did ask me to schedule a physical which is good I know abstractly but in my head >!does make make me want to not eat by then to have a lower number!< versus just take care of myself 😵‍💫
I saw the movie in my language (I'm not from the US) so I can't answer that, srry
i mean, i have had the signs all my life. faking my way through life by trying not to act like "the weird kid" (even though i never did), burnout bc of it, can't communicate well (esp. high school), constant hyperfixations, trouble with idiomatic expressions before, not reading through social cues a lot of time, periods of depression, the list goes on honestly.   though, it could be something else. i just think this time is a wake-up call just bc i have a hard time reading in between the lines at my current work.
This is the validation I needed
Please tell me she at least look weird or something. I genuinely do not recognized her.
Hmmmmm. Things are not looking good for me.
Y’all are gunna tell me [this](https://apostore.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/03-Taylor.jpg) looks like her too huh
It's 3:24 of her saying "hey, I can be the answer" in a loop
Thanks for your thoughtful reply. They are fantastic, and I am sad because I had Philly tickets I can’t get rid of, but I’m just wondering if it’s really worth it. You’re right, they’re always on it live. I’m glad you enjoyed the album! I grew to be okay with it but it’s not immediately something I think I’ll jump at.
In conclusion I'm literally just some fucking guy please stop shouting
GOD I know that feeling. People will show up without proper documentation or way late or with their young child with only one parent (and no documentation that allows us to proceed without the other) and it's like. Legally I cannot do your appointment unless you follow all of the rules that were laid out for you on our website and the state department website! Go yell at the government that you wanna get your identity stolen so bad then!!
i think you're right. i tend to get caught up in like, trying to figure out everything from everyone's point of view so i can like, min-max solutions, but that's definitely proved itself to not always be the right move. i think part of me is nervous to approach them directly and was probably trying to work my way up to it. but youre right.
the black standard edition!
yep [here](https://twitter.com/ooc_generation/status/1643499530032226308?s=46&t=WwUMqvLk8i-cM4sA6t5QOw)
That last part. Sounds so simple on paper but hard to do in real life.
I think much like metal music they experience these violent stuff to get that energy out. Not everyone who loves it is a completely unhinged psychopath who has no grip on reality.
I mean, I'm not into the intense action that John Wick does, but I am *absolutely* a horror queen, and some people also have that reaction to horror, so I'll take this from a horror angle  I have a lot of anxieties and fears and whatnot. Like, to a point that it's a little overwhelming sometimes. And yet I love horror, which sounds a little paradoxical. For me, I see horror as answering that voice that's like, "What's the worst thing that could happen?"—because the worst thing that could happen *does* happen in those movies, and we have our protagonist who (usually) survives it after facing her fears. Sure, it's awful, they may be covered in blood and limping away, but they make it through and they triumph. And, idk, I feel resonant with that on some level.  And beyond that, like, there is no such thing as thoughtcrime. Maybe lots of people *do* have those impulses. Maybe people do have daydreams where they're a badass action hero and they get to beat up bad guys. The question is: **So what?** The impulses and the daydreams don't matter as long as they never act on them, as long as they're not actually out committing assault. And having a medium where, for two hours, you can roleplay those squashed feelings out safely in a world of fantasy is probably a good release valve, a good piece of catharsis. Those films with violence or horror or *whatever* give people ways to confront and deal with their feelings in a safe fantasy world, and I think that's a good thing.
I love Amy Tan’s works!
Thank you! I’ll check this out. I haven’t watched greta gerwig yet but her films are on my list.
I think his vote is happening right now.
I think the only time I've ever worked with meringue was a couple years ago when I made an angel food cake from scratch! And I totally agree, last year I made him a doctored cake and the recipe I followed then didn't change it much at all imo, and when I was looking at another recipe it called for sour cream, more flour, more cocoa powder, etc. and at that point I felt like I might as well just be making my own. I'll let you know how it goes, I'm gonna start soon!
Which even makes it more appalling when people leave positive comments because they’ve read that already and they chose not to acknowledge it
I really really need to take this advice! When my mental health dips so does my "upkeep" which is why i started.   I really want to get glasses again.
I don't know either! I swap them with new ones like every 2 months so it's not like they're the same pair. I've never once had a problem with them ever, so i guess i've been pretty lucky lol!
I LOVE BLUE DRESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! so yes, thsi is exactly the vibe i am craving rn
ok wait, this is what i am looking for. let me know if you know of anymore like this!?!?!??!?!?!
LOVE flower!! Listening to 7W now...   wait what are the 7 words??? vain... games... insecure...??
> All is Full of Love (Rosie Thomas cover) >  >   LOOOOVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! OMG!! i love a good female cover like this
ok but that song is SO good. it's so dramatic in the best way. and i LOVE things i wish u said! so that was perfect! i am in this kind of mood
There was a commercial in the late 90s or early 2000s that constantly advertised using that song, and that song is forever associated with that commercial and that time period in my head!
I LOVE Aimee Mann and havne't heard this song! it's giving heartbreak christmas
So for full context, Quinta made a joke in her [SNL opening monologue](https://twitter.com/PopBase/status/1642556075345080321) saying how Friends lacked diversity while her show Abott Elementary has Black people unlike Friends.  That twink quote tweeted PopBase's tweet about the joke and said something like "imagine taking a jab at a 90s show for lacking diversity but your own show doesn't have any asian people". (I won't link it because I will not give stupidity a platform). The racist tweet was over-ratioed thankfully but it made me pissed how this person who said this is not even Asian and has no right to speak on how we Asians are represented. ☹️
I kept thinking about how my friend left Twitter for this reason and she is much more happier now. It has always been a hellsite but Elon owning it makes it so much worst. Plus, a fucking dogecoin as the logo? Get that dog out of here.
I'm glad Elion took over and made it dogshit so that I could finally get rid of it for good and not have to deal with such stupidity anymore.
The way Neil Tennant delivers all the lines is probably my fave but I love the synth too ( <-- sucker for synths)
Philly fans are wild.  My main point remains, Angel Reese needs to calm it down with the whole "disrespect" shit as if turning down a white house invitation makes you "cool", while knowing your coach is a anti-vax, right-wing nut.
They kinda lost me during one of these breaks between songs. From what I can tell from way in the back and not paying the closest attention, they started having some kind of long jump competition? What the hell is going on. 😭 They've been on for like an hour and I feel like I've heard 5 songs.
Lmao I've been exposed! Yeah I was chilling in the back after a couple songs cause being in the crowd was not it LOL. I've had better luck with views at Purgatory since it's so small you can see everything, but this venue is rough. I saw MUNA there too and I got a half decent spot only out of pure luck when a family left after the opener. Overall definitely prefer being in bigger venues or places with seating cause I am too indecisive about where I wanna be when the show actually comes!   I am seeing Mamamoo next month so I'm excited for a group I'm more familiar with and in a venue that's way more comfortable (aka I could pick seats in the front of a section so tall people don't keep bouncing in and out of my line of sight 🥲).
he was scared of dentists and the dark?
Uncertainty gives me even more anxiety and also, not saying that this makes it not true, but no offense but part of your argument seems like you're saying it's automatically true because "she did what guys do when they get accusations like that and those turn out to be true"
i truly do not LOL
Not me getting you to listen to Tracy Chapman and Sufjan Stevens. My impact.  Carrie and Lowell was my go to depression album but now I only listen to it when I’m going to bed because it helps me wind down. It’s my favorite album of all time and it will always have a space in my life.  Let me know if you have a favorite off the album.
I’m sure you have already thought of it but ADHD has a lot of similarities. Hopefully they can get a few screenings in one evaluation so you get a wider scope of peace of mine.
Honestly she does look a little off in that photo (not in a bad way but if you told me that was a Taylor Swift lookalike instead of her I’d believe you)
Maybe it looked off to you because she had minimal make-up in that photo and we are used to seeing photos of Taylor where she is heavily glammed up?  Her make-up in the Folklore and Evermore photos were strictly minimal due to COVID and also to keep consistent with the minimal vibe of the albums' aesthetic.
Our culture(s) really needs to change the way we treat customer service workers. I don't know how people expect you to smile in their face and be nice whilst they yell and bludgeon you with insults.  I know it's tough. Keep your head up. ❤️
Oh my God, YES 😂. And they'll swear that the appointment notice/instructions didn't say that they have to bring their appointment notice and photo identification WHEN IT SAYS JUST THAT! They clearly just didn't read it (but will lie and say they did and, once again, catch an attitude). Ugh...  But no worries. If they get caught up it's not on you, it's on them LOL people are something else...
The cover with the yellow is so pretty! I'm glad i didn't end up getting  the indie green bc the actual color turned out to be nickolodian slime😐💀
That’s therapy for you lol it’s like when someone keeps telling you not to freak out at the spider and no Matter what they say, you will freak out.
Angel Food cake sounds yummy!  And please do!
can you afford lasik? or you're not there yet in life?
Oooh!! Okay: Side Effects by JOSEPH, Orpheus by Sara Bareilles, Out of the Blue by Katie Pruitt. And then I’m assuming you already love Slow Dancing, but if you haven’t heard Aly and AJ’s cover of I Need My Girl, that’s life changing too.
It’s on my playlist titled “covers that brought a gun to the studio”  It’s really so phenomenal and brought me a greater appreciation to the song
Me too. She’s incredible. Her Mental Illness (GSC is the lead single) album is a masterpiece. It’s top three in her discography for sure :)
diversity is a hot topic but i do hate it when other ppl try to speak for a group of ppl. irdk where to put myself in this but abbott elementary is a show about black culture, afaik. I haven't watched it but the white characters seem to not try to overshadow the black characters which, i think to me is a great way to talk abt black culture. so, for me, i wouldn't want to invade a space made for black ppl. we are all in the fight against racism, but when media is made for a specific group, i dont think we have the authority to enforce ourselves into it.
Allegedly. Some think it could be a metaphor for being scared of dentist and the dark and not actually about being scared of dentist and the dark. Personally I think it’s actually about being scared of dentist and the dark but my friend thinks is about dentist and the dark which I think could be cool and it’s fun how everyone derives their own meaning but it’s unlikely that was intended.
Because no one can say they* believe victims if the only difference if they recognize basic 101 Rape culture and victim blaming rhetoric is the gender of the perpetrator.  Unless the person just doesn’t don’t believe victims. In which case I have nothing to say about this, I refuse to act in a way that has chilling affect on victims and I think it’s obvious people pretend it’s more complicated or uncertain then it is because they’d rather pretend strangers they don’t know who make music they like are good people whose product they don’t have to think about what their consumption says about them.
You don't play The Sims????
I know! You're two for two :)  I've been trying to just dive into recommendations that peak my interest to try and find something new that clicks with me. Carrie and Lowell has kinda blown me away to be honest. I've just played it through a second time back to back. It's hypnotically beautiful. It normally takes me a few listens to click with an album but this was an instant love - so thanks for the rec :)  Favourites: Death with Dignity, Should've Known Better, Fourth of July and The Only Thing. Out of those, Death with Dignity is probably my favourite...but there's not a really bad track on the album tbh.
thanks for this! im still thinking if ill continue with this one i found cuz i found another psych that seemed cheaper. (reddit didnt notify ur reply btw)
Omg thank you! It was driving me crazy!
That’s possible but it’s her whole face shape that looks different to me and this is the first time I haven’t recognized her (aside from the cats movie but that doesn’t count)  I’m hoping one person responds and tells me they don’t recognized her either lol
which did you get! i think the pink ended up pretty but some people on the ldr sub were upset because it was a darker pink than the marketing photos displayed.
The indie exclusive is sooo ugly. Idk what they were thinking
Not yet bestie. Let's manifest a $ugar Daddy🙏 ^^/s
omfg i LOVE orpheus!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i listen to it at least 6 times a week
> Side Effects by JOSEPH,   just listened  A+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
> Aly and AJ’s cover of I Need My Girl, that’s life changing too.  OMFG i love slow dancing, and i'm listening to this and am loooovvvinnnnnggg ittttttttttttttttt
omg lol that playlist title is so dramatic ahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahaha mine is just called "Acoustic covers of 80s, 90s and 00s songs" LOL
I agree. I am not going to expect Black creators to include Asian characters in their stories for the sake of representation and inclusivity if it means the results might be half-baked. We have to keep in mind that they created these stories based on their experiences and their culture. It's best to leave them with what they know first-hand, instead of trying to force something.  Besides, we have shows created by Asian people and starring Asian people. The most recent example is Beef created by Lee Sung Jin which stars Steven Yeun and Ali Wong and is literally out on Netflix today!
I get what you're trying to say it's just my anxiety is working overtime on that last bit and making it sound like (pardon my exaggeration for effect my brain likes to spiral) because I expressed any doubt over the truth of the matter and wasn't so full-on turning-against-her that I'd be already either cutting off contact with anyone I know who likes her music and owns her merch or encouraging them to burn said merch and somehow obliterate the ashes and trashing even the critically-praised songs as songs because "she made them so they must have inappropriate/bad subtext" (maybe even bringing up the argument I've seen her detractors use even before all this went down that the childlike imagery and adult themes in combination are a signifier of pedophilic tendencies) I must be supporting anyone who has ever done this stuff and might as well be pre-crime-arrestable for being likely to do it myself.  TL;DR (as sorry about the spiral) I'm worried I not only have to not like her music but have to cut off all traces of ever having a positive connection with her and her work or that's morally equivalent to being guilty of the same thing
I do NOT, I am sorry, even tho one of my sisters was like the product manager or whatever for them, and is now doing that new version of it... the real life or whatever??? maybe i should???
The only thing is my favorite. And the others you mentions are highlights to me as well.  If you really fall in love with the album listen to his album the greatest gift. It’s outtakes and remixes from Carrie and Lowell. Honestly listen to the song “the greatest gift” asap because it’s currently my favorite song of his. I wake up to it everyday it puts me in the mood to appreciate life.
I ordered the light pink but it hasn't arrived yet! My 2nd pick was the target dark pink (the bifold is so pretty!), but my decor is green so i went with the amazon. I get why people would be annoyed but imo the pink/purple is still really pretty, i def have no complaints.
It's soooo different from the sage green that was pictured. I feel bad for the indie record stores too, now they're stuck dealing with unhappy customers/ returns
it honestly makes me cry??
Definitely will. Thanks for the rec :)
it’s so pretty! and sounds actually amazing you’re gonna love it
it is such an emotional song... omg im gonna listen to it right now
