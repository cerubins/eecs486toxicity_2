Just think of each planet as a different country, and the Senate as the UN
Same with Naboo and Tattoine.
Not all planets had one government. Like the Mon Calamari, Naboo has two native species as well. Humans and the gungans. Then there‚Äôs Mandalor, which was in constant state of Civl War. Oh and don‚Äôt forget how Tattoine was controlled by rivaling gangs and slavers.
Our planet is all we know. If you have differences, you can go to a different state or country, but you're stuck on this planet.  In star wars, you can go to a new planet like going to a new country. Join a planet ideologically similar to yours.   I'm sure there are plenty of people on Earth wishing they could hop to a different planet right about now.
Same way back in our human history we started off with small nations that ended up turning into bigger nations. Especially with technology and fast methods of space travel, eventually one of the logical next steps is for the whole planet to become united. Makes things easier in a lot of ways.
No the greatest force feat was Qui Gon becoming the first force ghost.
Anakin defeating the son and daughter on Mortis
Maybe if he didn't die from Force overdose.
Nah, getting Shmi force preggo was pretty wack and has to be top 3
I just though he cleaned himself up before leaving the planet.
Social Distancing Level: (Jedi)  Master
That was trash
Ugh
Do we know if he was the first ever, or just first in the recent/recorded history of the then-current Jedi Order?
I mean that was the force itself though, idk if that‚Äôs considered a feat.
Canon star wars is trash lmao.   Star killer bringing down a star destroyer?   Now that was impressive
Canon luke is so weak. He becomes a crotchity old man and won't even show up in person to fight his emo nephew, he uses the force to project an image of himself and immedietly dies because he forced too hard. That's not that impressive really. That being said you are free to enjoy the sequels. It doesn't make you less of a star wars fan.
Eh, I thought it was pretty cool. Overall I come down on the ‚Äúnot a fan of TLJ‚Äù side, because I‚Äôve got a lot of problems with that movie. But Luke doing force projection is not one of them.
I don‚Äôt think we know for sure, but functionally it‚Äôs the same thing, since nobody in that era knew about the technique and he had to figure out how to do it either way.
Not 100% sure. Im not too up on the canon in other media aside from the movies tbh. That being said Qui gon was a true believer in the force even more so than yoda. He literally felt the force instead of contemplating it. He lived in the moment and trusted his gut. The council didnt like his defiance but he was the truest jedi because the force was the only thing he followed. Being so willing and accepting of the force instead of bending or using it probably helped his connection to transcend.
That was Palpatine that did it. [Darth Vader #25](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Vader_(2017)_25)  > he encounters Force visions of his pregnant mother Shmi Skywalker Lars and Darth Sidious, who is implied to have manipulated Anakin's conception through the Force.  It wasn't a question sorry for that. More citation for those who are misguided.
wow thank you for your approval ü´°
Luke was never supposed to be that powerful. He was a plot device to help redirect the truly powerful anakin/vader to destroy the true evil. I mean cmon he was half ass trained by the last dementia ridden jedi leader in a swamp over a couple weeks. Most true jedi including anakin, obi wan, qui gon, and yoda trained for half their lives or more. Cut luke some slack he wasnt "the chosen one" and yoda wasnt even that great he just happened to be able to hone his skills for 600 years.
But doing something new and novel for the first time ever is different than overcoming the blinding dogma and lost ways of the current era to do something that was commonplace before.
And that certainly was impressive in the context of the time, and possibly even the centuries and generations surrounding it. But in the grand scheme of 25,000+ years of galactic Force-using history? Possibly not that impressive.
His master, Darth Plagueis the Wise.
You‚Äôre misinterpreting that comic. That was a vision Anakin had, that‚Äôs clear in the full context of the comic, and the actual writer of the comic came out and clarified that palpatine did not create Anakin.
So you‚Äôre asking if Qui-Gon had heard about the technique and set out to rediscover it? As far as I know, we don‚Äôt have an answer to that question.
Well if anyone else did it in a nearly impressive manner id have to assume itd have written into the canon somewhere
No, I'm telling you, issue 25 Darth Vader it shows Palpatine behind it.
If that‚Äôs true, then Luke is a Palpatine and Rey really is a Skywalker.
It‚Äôs hard to say unless you just read wookipedia or something since unlike Clone Wars there isn‚Äôt as much filler episodes
Plucky heroes trying to save a peaceful planet from the greedy hands of the Empire, resulting in them getting into fights with Inquisitors, Darth Vader, Mandalorians, and even Thrawn himself.  At the end the planet is liberated, but at a cost.
Lol, is there a tv show blinkist?
If the Ahsoka series is going to be successful, it will have to work and make sense to people who have never seen an animated show.  Everything you need in order to understand it will be integrated into the live action series as a standalone experience.  None of the animated shows will be required viewing.  Recommended, sure.  But they have to make it work for viewers who haven‚Äôt seen them.
do you mean reading wooki for each episode individually?
i see, but i'm trying to understand more of the characters like thrown, ezra and sabine cuz i've seen that they will appear in the show and i don't want to be lost
**Thrawn** is a hyper intelligent Grand Admiral Chiss alien in an empire that actively detests aliens. He is not like other imperials as he does not care about glory, honor, pride, or wealth, only results. He is a efficient pragmatist that actively encourages those under him to improve and learn from their mistakes. He values art and strives to understand others, and has earned the undying respect of most under his command and even from the likes of Vader and Palpatine. He is often considered a ‚Äúgood‚Äù Imperial.  **Ezra** is a force sensitive youth who grew up on Lothal, his parents died at a young age. He got mixed in with the group known as Phoenix which includes a ex Jedi known as Kanan Jerrus who survived the Jedi purge. He is eventually trained by Kanan as they undergo difficult trials. He has a special connection to the planet Lothal and to animals in particular. He and Thrawn disappear into unknown space, never to be seen until now.  **Sabine** is a Mandalorian who was an outcast from her planet and family for dark reasons. She helps Phoenix in attacking the empire. She has a love for colorful art work.
thanks for the detailed response, appreciate it!
Grew up at the same time as the prequels so I want to make that clear, New Hope is pretty mid.   Also don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs necessarily an unpopular opinion but the ‚ÄúVictory Celebration‚Äù is better than ‚ÄúYub Nub‚Äù, but also grew up with the special editions so another caveat lol
It would have been better if Lucas knew Luke and Leia were siblings since the start.
The Original Trilogy is in my Top 10 all-time favorite movies. There is no denying that they changed movies forever by the technological advancements they invented and all of the filmmakers they inspired.  I say that to say this: the movies are not holy and should not be reverently placed on an extremely high pedestal. They're silly and goofy and have some bad acting and not the best writing within them. Any problems with the Prequels and Sequels are also present in the Original Trilogy. And that's fine! I think the Prequels and Sequels are disliked by people who hold the Original Trilogy to too high of a standard and act like all of the other movies or shows could never measure up, when they're all generally on the same level.
Victory celebration is a 100x better than ‚Äúyub nub‚Äù
Ewoks are awesome
Luke vs vader in empire is overrated
C3PO is never funny, only annoying.
They work better when watched chronologically after the prequels.   Also, the special editions were a net positive for those films
Return of the Jedi is a pretty weak film in comparison to A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back. The first act is an almost entirely unrelated side quest that barley has any barring on the main plot. Boba Fett‚Äòa death felt straight out of Looney Tunes. The Ewoks are really silly and probably should have been enslaved Wookies. Leia being Luke‚Äôs twin sister is incredibly derivative of ‚ÄúI am of your Father‚Äù. The only thing I absolutely love about the film is the dynamic between Luke and Vader.
Episode 4 was groundbreaking technically... but is not nearly as good as everyone credits it for.   It's actually as corny as episode 2.
Cantina theme is unimpressive
I like most of the additions in the special editions.
There really didn't need to be a trilogy
I like George‚Äôs edits and find them all to be improvements
I liked that every re-release would have minor changes. Part of the fun rewatching them was finding the changes. I miss that.
It‚Äôs the greatest combination of 3 films in a single story ever. And it‚Äôs not close.    1) Star Wars  2) Back to the Future  3) Lord of the Rings  4) The Dark Knight  5 ) GodFather   Will say Spider-Man with Tom Holland is an easy 6.   Godfather clear had two of the top ten films ever but three is bad.    Star Wars has two of the top ten films ever and ROJ is probably a top 100 or definitely 200 film ever.
Luke can be annoying.
Vader and Chewy should‚Äôve smashed(to contribute to the plot)
A New Hope is boring and quite dry in these times.  I grew up with the prequels. But didn't properly get into it till much later.  I can appreciate A New Hope, and I get it establishes characters, and basically "How it all started". But my god, I'd rather watch the others.
Here‚Äôs the thing, Luke and Leia were never meant to be siblings in the first place. Luke‚Äôs sister was originally supposed to be an entirely original character, but when Lucas condensed his plans for Episodes 6-9 into one film, he decided to have Leia be Luke‚Äôs sister.  His original plan looked like this  * Episode IV and Episode V happened as planed,  * Episode VI was effectively an extend version of the first act of Return of the Jedi, featuring Han Solo‚Äôs death and Boba Fett as the main antagonist. This film would have also featured Luke‚Äôs final confrontation with Vader, before exiling himself. * Episode VII would have continued Luke‚Äôs Jedi training * Episode VIII would have introduced Luke‚Äôs sister, who again, it an entirely separate character from Leia. * Episode IX would have formally introduced the Emperor and featured Luke‚Äôs final confrontation with him.   SOURCE: http://www.theforce.net/latestnews/story/gary_kurtz_reveals_original_plans_for_episodes_19_80270.asp
The only movie where I thought 3PO was actually funny was ironically Rise of Skywalker.  I actually laughed at a couple of his bits in that one.
>Also, the special editions were a net positive for those films  Based on the state of them today, I'd mostly agree. The improved CGI helps a lot and the Greedo murder scene is significantly less objectionable than it was on initial release. There are still some things I wish they'd left out.
It's true really.  Though it was pretty important to get Han back.  I think the bigger issue is that Luke's whole plan is nonsense and insane.  They get everyone close to Jabba separately, with their heaviest hitter in a cell, and then from there it entirely depends on Jabba acting in a very specific set of ways for everything to be in place at the right time.  If they weren't the protagonists of a Star War, there is no way it would have ever worked out.    But you know, I was 8 when that movie came out so it will never not be my favorite. It was the first Star Wars thing that I knew was coming and had to wait for. Realizing that a lot of people much younger than me had the same experience with the prequels was an important turning point in my attitude about the prequels.
Cantina Band #1 is mid...but Cantina Band #2 is fire.
Best comment ever than you for giving a source üòÅ don‚Äôt have any gifts but if I did you deserve it
Farm boy gets saved by creepy old man whose been watching him since he was a toddler gets taken away. All I got really
Uneducated boondocks teenager gets the best K/D ever by trusting his gut.
After the suspicious death of his legal guardians, an orphan, along with an old religious wack job and two drug smugglers join a anti-government terrorist organization, where they take part in an operation that results in the deaths of 2 million loyal soldiers, pilots and military officers.
So an orphan, a religious zealot, and two drug smugglers walk into a bar‚Ä¶.
A long time ago in galaxy far far away an orphan farm boy on a desert planet wants to go to space school to be a pilot like all his homies and his dad. His uncle says no and they buy some robots from some desert rats to help with farming. One of the robots runs away it's on a secret mission or something. Farm boy follows the robot into the desert and gets attacked by sand people. Farm boy gets knocked out immedietly because he forgot he's only a level 1. An old wizard guy saves the unconcious farmboy from sand people and tells him he's also a space wizard. The runaway robot has a hologram of a space princess that he plays message for the space wizard. Space wizard tells farm boy he's also a space wizard, gives him a laser sword and tries to convice the farm boy they have to kill an evil space knight who killed the farm boy's dad. They find the desert rats have are dead killed by stormtroopers. Farm boy runs home and finds his aunt and uncle are dead. Space wizard and farm boy need to leave planet and hire a space pirate and a walking carpet to fly them to alderaan. But aldeeran and gone and that's no moon. It's a giant evil space ball. They get sucked into the giant evil space ball. The space princess is on it. They form an elaborate plan to rescue the princess. Do so. Space wizard faces evil space knight. He dies they leave. Farm boy gets consoled by space princess who lost her entire planet. Then farm boy, pirate, walking carpet and princess meet rebels. They form a plan to blow up evil space ball. Only farm boy can do it because he's good at hitting desert rats. But not those desert rats. Space pirate takes the money from rescuing princess and leaves. Farm boy gets to be a pilot woo hoo. The rebels assault the base. They are loosing. Space pirate shows up to save the day. Farm force skypes with space wizards ghost. Farm boy blows up giant evil space ball. Evil space knight gets lost in space. Big party the end.
And civilian contractors that results in a galaxy wide recession.
Imagine thousands of Jedi on the battlefield Peter Jackson style.
He ruined all his good will with the hobbit trilogy
This movie isn‚Äôt even out yet
Way to be a debbie downer OP
When this film turns out to be fun and critically acclaimed, I'm coming back here to taunt you
Can't be worse than what we've got already.
I still think they‚Äôre gonna swap ford out for a woman.
I can feel your anger, it gives you focus, it makes you strong.
Thanks for sharing this gross site that apparently has an issue with this actor solely for existing. Now I never have to bother looking at it again.
Allegedly Finn got much less airtime in episodes 8 and 9 because of China. Wonder if we‚Äôll see him in this next film
Disney doesn't care about China's box office anymore so if he does come back he will be more competent and used more
Remember diversity is good, until east Taiwan says otherwise.
I can‚Äôt stand people like this  The film and a character get announced and some misogynistic douche starts üò≠   If you‚Äôre not a fan of the franchise then don‚Äôt watch but talking about it failing when it‚Äôs one of the most profitable franchises in media history and everything you complain about breaks box office numbers just proves how dumb you are
Agree üíØ and the amount of people who defend Kathleen is sickening.
I can‚Äôt stand people like this shit dicked bastard right here
Luke could still be apart of it as a force ghost but yeah the whole character was misused
lmao, join the club.  They tore down Vader and replaced him with whiny war crimes idiot boy.  You'll live.
Blah blah blah blah. We get it. You don‚Äôt like the new movies.
Disney Star Wars is like a shitty all you can eat buffet: it‚Äôs great for people who think more is better and don‚Äôt give a shit about quality.
The levels that Disney star wars stoops to constantly shocks me. This is a clear insult to everything George set up. This was LUKE'S JOB. Instead, Luke was thrown to the gutter, and the job was given to Rey. But if all of the reasoning given for Luke's fall really WAS VALID, what's stopping rey from doing the same? In universe, obviously. Out of universe, the reasoning is clear: current Lucasfilm sucks. But character-wise, what's holding back?
And it‚Äôs not even a good character as it stands. You would think after the prequels that Disney would be a *bit* more careful in crafting their own story and universe. But NOPE they just said fuck it and got two competing directors with no universal vision or story to create the multi billion dollar trilogy with little thought put into it besides money all the while being overseen by at this point a incompetent manager.  *And* they gave EA, fucking *EA*, exclusive rights for all future Star Wars game titles. Because again MONEY.  Ackbar was killed without ceremony, Han is dead, Lea is dead(can‚Äôt exactly fault Disney on that though) Luke is dead, the Warlord era is non canon along with the interesting characters and stories it produced because Project Cinder had to be a thing, the Dark Empire saga Disney tried to do was half assed crap, and Thrawn *might* be botched and discarded depending how the story goes.  And unless the writers *actually* do a good job this time around with Rey and her story/character then it‚Äôll just be more crap. Even the Mandalorian is starting to suffer from too many subplots and side characters.
Yes they did, all we can hope, that Disney pays for their act of desecration.
wow what interesting and definitely not rude insight. Do you consider yourself one of the non-toxic people in the fandom? Do you enjoy shutting down people expressing frustration?
It really is. Like I'm lost now. I was fine ignoring them, but if disney is really gonna keep promoting this clear kick in the teeth of George's story... IDK man.
I mean‚Ä¶ she talked to Luke, who explained his mistakes to her and told her not to repeat them. That‚Äôs a pretty logical reason for a character to not repeat the same mistakes
I‚Äôm just sick of seeing the same bad-faith arguments every single day. Star Wars fans have this undying need to shout their opinions as loud as possible, and it‚Äôs annoying.
Yeah man if only Luke had any idea of the mistakes of the jedi of the past.... hm...
The issue is that Luke, who saw hope even in the most ruthless mass murderer and was proven right, somehow lost hope in his young nephew and tried to kill him.  Luke was done dirty and Mark Hamill even came out to say it.
where is the bad faith?  Also if you don't want to see opinions about star wars maybe get off of r/starwars bro it isn't that complex
What
well, Yoda and Obi-Wan did tell Luke that the only way to win was to kill Vader, and Luke deduced that this was a flaw in their philosophy, and that it would be a mistake, going as far as to tell them that they were wrong. Therefore. Luke does know that yoda and obi-wan are flawed jedi, and he knows what mindsets and ideals should not be carried on.  Luke also had access to yoda, obi-wan, AND anakin as force ghosts so it's not like he wouldn't have been able to get more information.   He still failed, so it's only logical for rey to fail, otherwise disney would be being inconsistent, and we wouldn't want that now, would we?
I was looking for zeb orrelios, in trailer
I understood that reference. Jabba does get captured a lot. But he always escapes, obviously!
Where?
In more than one occasion ezra says "Jabba the hutt" when he is asked who he is.
Where?
Nice, my home base still looks like a shack.
Looks better than half the sets in The Mandalorian this season
Very cute! Nice work!!
No. Season 2 episode 11 happens a couple years after that Andor episode. And in the Rebels episode, the prison break was triggered by Ezra‚Äôs broadcast, which isn‚Äôt the case for the prison break in Andor. So they must be two different prison breaks.
What do you mean "in one sitting"? That's over 27 hours of sitting.
Haters going to hate. I like the season.
What backlash? It was a great episode
Overall, love the new season.  I do hate when they use phrases like "address the bantha in the room."  lazy writing
I want to see some cheeks clapped, and we all know Bo ain't a bottom
I've been sour on some episodes this season but this one was fine.
She adores Grogu and admires Din.  What a power couple.
Same, bro.   And I love how in every episode something cool happens.
People seem to hate it. I thought it was Star Wars at its best.
It was woke asscheese and I'm pretty sure you know it
Well if that ain‚Äôt the quacta calling the stifling slimy.
That bit DID seem a bit forced.
She‚Äôs got to be almost a decade older than him right? Bo was a fighter during the clones wars and Din was a kid
What the hell are you talking about
Woke?
My brother in Christ, this is Star Wars. Just because Lizzo showed up doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs only now getting political. Even the original films were political and ‚Äúwoke‚Äù as fuck.
Yeah, and Leia was a little girl who was able to get nabbed by intergalactic kidnappers despite them being slower chasers than a fresh foaming glass of coke after you've downed a fifth of vodka, meanwhile at the same time Han Solo is a grown man transporting drugs for notorious crime lords, hitting up every pretty woman in a space bar all while having no qualms about putting a blaster hole in some assholes forehead should they ever have the audacity and lame fashion sense of wearing an orange vest over a teal body suit
The guy is a neckbearded alt-righter, don't try to understand him.
Maybe it‚Äôs something to do with Bo-Katan rightfully gaining the dark-saber? Personally, I liked that. Mando doesn‚Äôt really seem like a ‚Äúswords guy‚Äù to me. (I know it‚Äôs a bit more complicated than that but I‚Äôm here for the space wizards fighting evil space wizards, give me some slack.)
She definitely knew how to handle a sword better than Din, but there is nothing "woke" about that. She's a better trained fighter.  I gotta assume OP is just an incel who hates seeing women on TV at this point.
For Halloween in 1999 I went as Obi-Wan Kenobi and got the Padawan braid at Walmart, but that was 23.5 years ago.  On a whim, I checked the website of an independent costume shop in my town, and they have this [Jedi Blister Kids Costume Kit](https://www.dannystrixkix.com/product/RU5209.html) that says it features a Jedi braid. I tried to Add to Cart to see if it ships anywhere or is local pickup only, but I get an error message that I don't know how to overcome. They have a phone number at the bottom of the website for internet sales. Maybe if you call them when they're open they can give you information about if you can order it from them, and if not, maybe they can give you enough information to find someplace else you could buy it, because I am not able to find any other websites just by Googling the product name.
Yes. Even tho Disney made some questionable decisions its still an amazing franchise to watch.
IMO, one of Star Wars‚Äô biggest strengths is also what divided the fandom, its variety. What do I mean? Well the prequel trilogy are about as tonally, thematically, and athletically different from the original trilogy as possible. Rouge One is pretty good, but it‚Äôs a war movie as opposed to a space opera. Andor is a spin off of Rogue One, but it‚Äôs a lot more slow paced and dialogue heavy then the rest of Star Wars. The Mandalorian is very episodic, while Kenobi is serialized. None of this is inherently bad, but it‚Äôs something to keep in mind if you decide to start exploring more of what Star Wars had to offer. You might like something and not like something because it doesn‚Äôt feel like Star Wars.
Depends, people usually choose a small part than a greater whole.  The OG, the Filoniverse, and Reylo are all Star Wars fans.  Like the Balkans, a simmering contempt for each other.  If you can take that in, you'll be fine.
Just watch A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi, then read the X-Wing Series and the Heir to the Empire trilogy, and you'll have plucked out the best of Star Wars and not gotten mired in the filth.  Star Wars has been on a steep decline since 1999 and despite what may look like hype in here, nothing has changed about that.
Star Wars is big material wise. There are a bunch of rabbit holes you can go to and focus on. There‚Äôs the old Legends continuity and it‚Äôs 40+ years of stories. Can just dive into just the video games, comics, or the old Ewok cartoon and specials people seem to forget about. Heck you can find people who would deny that either the Prequels or Sequels ever existed.  Is every entry perfect? Course not. All franchises have their up and down times. And the phrase ‚ÄúStar Wars has been ruined‚Äù has been said so many times for several instances it loses meaning when you start counting.
Plenty of time to get hyped
Well boys, time to get in the cryogenic chamber. Who wants to freeze my head?
üé∂IN THE YEAR 3000üé∂
why they releasing it on a Monday
Crap, gotta go find Fry and hop in his tube to get frozen.
Time to deliver a pizza to I.C Weiner.
Oh good. I'll have plenty of time to watch all the other Star Wars movies and shows in chronological order, so I'm up to date for the Ashoka series.
How are we gonna watch it when we're all living under water?
Never wanted to be a vampire before but I guess now I've gotta go figure out where to find one
Think I'm gonna go take a nice looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong nap
It's a placeholder date
I wouldn't be surprised if they're meaning ezra who was never a Jedi
I really do wonder what Star Wars will look like 977 years from now.
Wait was Ahsoka even knighted?
By the year 3000, a year will be 13 months of 28 days each, so there won't be a December 29th that year.
No, that‚Äôs right.
That date seems a bit unrealistic. Its too soon
I wonder if The Elder Scrolls VI will be released by then.
I've been to the year 3,000... not much has changed BUT they do live underwater
I hope the delay makes the cgi look good now
No, no, we must be patient.
My God, a million years
Aroo!
I can, after I deliver this pizza to I C Weiner.
There was a guy named Joel...not so different from you and me.
[Weblink](https://giphy.com/gifs/xS1J9vxU6kA6GP7leo)
Not much has changed but they live underwater!
Monday is Star Wars day in 3000
Only if it was the year 4000 then it would be 1977 years from now (the year the first Star Wars came out)
I'm pretty sure the council knighted her to make up for the scandal of her false imprisonment. I don't remember if she was officially knighted and then left or if she turned them down and left without officially achieving the rank.
Both it, and GTA 6 will be in beta.
He worked at Gizmonic Institute, just another face in a red jumpsuit
It's been that way ever since the end of the Star Wars Trek, not to be confused with the Star Trek Wars.
No they didn‚Äôt she‚Äôs technically still a padawan
He did a good job cleaning up the place, but his bosses didn't like him so they shot him into space
Should‚Äôve been bigger
Has this been released yet?
I love your art style. These are great
This at style has an Animaniacs vibe. I like it a lot.
*squeal*  *Combat mode engaged. Press white button to disengage*  Dun dun dun, dun dun dun DUN dun dun dun dunnnnn
Thanks!
Said all that, and you don't even know that the three films aren't a trilogy.  One film is set post ST about Rey. The other two are set before she is born, and have nothing to do with each other or the new Rey one, other than all being Star Wars.
Lol it's still hilarious that people thought retconning the sequels was ever going to happen.
There was never any incentive whatsoever for Disney to retcon the sequels. It's odd to me that people thought they might.
While I didn‚Äôt enjoy the sequel trilogy as a whole for a variety of reasons, I‚Äôm actually extremely interested in this Rey movie, and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll realt the mistakes of the sequels. Above all else, the sequels suffered from a lack of foresight and poor planning. They teased mysteries without a clear answer in mind. They introduced good characters and didn‚Äôt know where to take them. I doubt this Rey film will suffer a similar fate as it‚Äôs being billed as a stand along endeavor, at least for the time being. I think just focusing on one Rey film at a time is a great way to avoid making the same mistakes as the sequels, while still continuing on with the rich potential of the Star Wars universe.
Calling out toxic super fan of the sequels? Never heard of those lol just toxic fans that hate the sequel trilogy kind of like what you‚Äôre coming off as‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
You can't honestly expect Disney or Star Wars to retcon billions of dollars worth of movies because fans didn't like the plot or characters. There's also been no precedent for Disney/Star Wars to just start completely over, it just hasn't happened and probably won't happen because branching off from finished eras is better.  The problem with all the hate for the newly announced Rey movie is it is paradoxical. Yall flame tf out of Rey Skywalker and the Sequels but refuse to even consider that the new movie may be a chance to right some wrongs, improve characters and flesh out the universe.
How about we watch the movies before we decide if they're good?  Or don't watch them and don't talk about them?
Kathleen Kennedy is just brazenly taking open-assed dumps on our heads at this point.
They're not making a new trilogy for Rey. There is one movie focused on her while the other 2 are focused at different points of the star wars timeline.  Now that thats out of the way, I honestly get your fustration. The sequel trilogy is a huge mess that annoys basically everyone. Everyone would be more happy if it didn't exist or they retcon it out of existence. But I don't Disney would have the balls to do that. Admitting mistakes is something they suck at doing.   Actually another thing. How in the hell is Kathleen Kennedy still in charge. She managed to crash and burn what was supposed to be one of the most profitable franchises into the ground. It's a miracle she's still in charge. Then again, even if she is replaced, I feel like the one who would replace her would still be a bumbling idiot who can't manage star wars and run it further into the ground.
Yeah, alot of idiots loved the mess
Look at you, fitting the description of what I claimed. Downvote me and keep pushing pea brain
Lol not reading all that. You are part of the issue it seems
Yeah, thing is, alot of these bots LOVE IT and if you don't then you are a POS etc etc. I'm blocking all of the people who disagree so I see less of the toxic new fans
Maybe, just maybe, the reason she hasn't been fired is because Star Wars isn't doing nearly as bad as you think it is.
Imagine making a post and not wanting responses. Dweeb
In his timeline, he is the first sith and lead them in the war against Jedi if I am remembering the book correctly.
No argument here, completely agree!
Wow I completely expected the opposite, glad to see another Ronin fan!
Yup it was amazing. I loved the whole episode though. It felt like a very one off clone wars episode in some respects. I know lots of people on here didn‚Äôt like the episode, but I enjoy seeing random planets in Star Wars that we may never see again
Rogue Squadron isn't cancelled but in a limbo state as stated by [Kathleen Kennedy during the 2023 Star Wars Celebration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qz6s7kvuwMc&t=216s). She says it is still in talks about it will become; perhaps a series not a movie
Seem so crashed and burned with the amount of development hell projects that I‚Äôll only believe it when I see a legitimate trailer.
Haha those are egg-cellent!
For nowruz as well, we color eggs, in march. I made a captain rex one this year
Very cool!!
You bet. I hope it has huge ramifications for not just the series but the entire franchise
Looks more like star charts to me.
I thought so
I want to find out it's how Jedi moved around before hyperdrives were invented in a now-lost historical era. That's how I viewed the Lothal cave paintings. It would be neat to see it tied to the more mystical aspects of holocrons too.
There are stars in the World between worlds.
Similar to the between worlds that happened in rebels
I love this and I hope this is true
There are stars in lots of places, doesn't make them the world between worlds.
I am aware of what op is referencing. Yes, it is similar, but I don't think it's actually the world between worlds.
I'm just pointing out the similarity and curious what you all think.
Yup. I personally think it's a star chart, being that part of this is about how Thrawn and Ezra were lost in space for so long. To my eyes, while it has certain similarities with the design of the world between worlds, I think it's closer to a navigational chart.
Rebels is some of the best Star Wars content there is, in my opinion. And yes, Seasons 3 and 4 are as good or better.
Clone wars and rebels are fantastic for the most part
The animated shows are far better than any of the live action shows so far. Except Andor of course.
I think animation and Star Wars are a perfect fit for each other. Not that everything needs to be animated, but animation just seems to give so much more freedom than live action.   Also you‚Äôre in for a treat with seasons 3 and 4 of rebels.
Carrying Star Wars tbh.
I put off watching Clone Wars and Rebels for years because I just have a difficult time getting into animation.  After finally having watched them and with my bias against animation I can honestly say that I loved them both. It‚Äôs not all fantastic story telling from start to finish, but the highs in Clone Wars and Rebels are among the absolute best in all of Star Wars content.  If I was to make a list now of my top 10 or 20 all time Star Wars moments, the vast majority of them would be from Clone Wars and Rebels.
I think it‚Äôs excellent. I only got into the animated content in the last couple years, and boy am I glad I did. Clone Wars Season 6 and 7 is some of the best writing, action and mini-arch‚Äôs I‚Äôve ever had the pleasure of viewing. Rebels is good too, but simply, there‚Äôs more Clones material to watch.   Secondly, live-action material can be really time consuming, difficult and expensive to create. For instance; Anakin versus Obi-wan. The two of them against Count Dooku. General Grevious. Dooku and Yoda.   Meanwhile, *the force*, lightsaber battles and space battles are (imo) easier to create and explore greater options with animated creations. There are less boundaries and constraints for what can be created. Say what you will about the plot, but the sequel trilogy fight sequences, even the VIII battle was seriously lacking, in comparison to III or the animated programs.   Frankly, seeing characters from these shows transition to the live action screen has been difficult for me.   I know a lot of fans have gripes with the acting and appearance of Rosario Dawson as Ashoka; I have none of those issues. MY issues, are that the character whom she plays, is EXTREMELY talented as a saber duelist, and she‚Äôs incredibly mobile; jumping, moving, dodging. In Clone Wars & Rebels, she does amazing feats, and in the Mandalorian feature, she gets partially disarmed by a nobody. This is no one compared to The Inquisitors, MAUL, Darth Vader, etc, etc.   In truth, my main concern for upcoming live-action is staying true to the characters and their abilities. Superficial issues will always occur and are to be expected. However, if abilities are severely nerfed due to budgeting or age of the actors & actresses, then I have a serious gripe.  Edit: I‚Äôm not sure how many fans would agree with me (especially since many don‚Äôt watch animated material), but I would prefer to see more animated programs. It doesn‚Äôt ALL have to be live action. The latter brings in more views, though, and views = $$$$.
Which parts of the USA are like that? Very strange to me, there have always been animation aimed for older audiences.
I've enjoyed the animated shows.  They can be pretty hit or miss and have a lot more highs and lows than the live action stuff, but overall have been worth watching.
Ewoks and Droids are too kiddy for me, 2003 Clone Wars is GOAT, 2008 Clone Wars is great but has too much filler and Rebels only has a few good episodes.
Clone wars and rebels are both really good, tbh I'd put rebels above clone wars
The new animated shows aren‚Äôt worth watching and aren‚Äôt even canon so who cares
The prequels needed replacement, not rehabilitation.  These animated shows are like putting a bandaid on someone's cut off hand stump
The only animated show I‚Äôve seen is the original 2D Clone Wars.  I enjoyed it.  Then I watched the Clone Wars movie that kicked off the series, and hated it so much that I never watched the show.
Yes especially when Disney makes the live action sets look cheap and fake and small
What I meant is that there are some people still clinging on to this stigma, despite the amount of evidence to the contrary. Like the voters at the Academy Awards.   Link about the Academy Awards voters: [https://www.cartoonbrew.com/award-season-focus/definitive-proof-that-academy-voters-are-ignorant-about-animation-96680.html](https://www.cartoonbrew.com/award-season-focus/definitive-proof-that-academy-voters-are-ignorant-about-animation-96680.html).
If you peruse Wookieepedia, you would find out that they actually are considered canon.
Bad Batch is canon and is definitely worth watching. The S2 finale literally directly links to Rogue One.
The series is so, so much better than the movie, especially seasons 5-7.
I liked Kenobi.
As bad? No,but it certainly isn't great
It's kind of a mess. I'm not even sure what the story is anymore. Take back Mandalore? But the story there was it was poisoned? But they know it isn't now? So who do they even have to take it back from?
No you arent crazy this season is even more atrocious than usual
At first I thought I was just having Andor withdrawal, but as the season has progressed I have become convinced that it is indeed far worse than the previous two
Not as bad as Kenobi or TBoBF, but the downward trend in the quality of Disney+ Star Wars continues, with Andor being the only real standout SW content since Season 2 of the Mandalorian.
Yeah it's terrible.   The show runners distracted by all the other shows coming up maybe?
Not sure that it‚Äôs Disney on this one. This season is a hot mess. I didn‚Äôt like Kenobi but loved Andor. The Mandalorian has gotten away from the ‚ÄúWestern‚Äù style roots of the show and is now just trying to connect dots as fast as possible.
Pirates of the Caribbean came to mind.   Also, where was the Nevarro defence?
To be fair, the first season was limited and formulaic at times. Small challenge adventure that resolves in each episode with a fairly shallow over-arch.  I just put it off as appealing for a younger demographic, and still enjoyed it.
Good for you but it objectively sucked
>So who do they even have to take it back from?  That large Imperial presence in the system? The one that destroyed Bo-Katan's castle? The one that was explicitly said to be more powerful than any known Imperial warlord
Looks like they‚Äôre just circling around to Moff Gideon again.
Andor was amazing. It sets a high watermark for what we should be expecting from this franchise going forward
Nevarro looked so different in season one. It actually looked good. Why does it look so cheap and fake this season?
That one that looks like Temuera Morrison.
Fives or rex
Fives! Also Tup, he wasn‚Äôt around much but I love the name.
Probably Rex. But I absolutely love Crosshair.
Tech
Rex
99 gets my vote.
Fives
Rex is best girl.
Cody, Boss, Rex, Alpha, and Fordo
Rex and Hunter! Crosshair is also an amazing character and can‚Äôt forget Fives either.
Cheesy, I know, but it's Rex. Obviously, his core stuff is great, but I just really love old Rex in Rebels too.
In terms of design, Vaughn. But in terms of the actual character, Hevy.  "I don't." o7
Rex, mostly because of Rebels.  Also 99. :(
Crosshair
Ordo
It's a toss up between the Delta boys, the Omega squad lads, the Nulls, Fordo and Alpha. At the moment it's Scorch, I miss him and his chatter
And is voiced by Dee Bradley Baker when animated.
Dang. Pretty good and even better that it‚Äôs made with a normal pen!
Thanks a lot!
It was my favorite movie of the sequel trilogy.
I like everything about it except for Starkiller Base.  If it had just been a huge dreadnought or some other kind of a base it would have been fine.  Oh, and how tf do you miss Leia hugging Chewie after Han has died?  Apart from that it was quite good.
Force awakens bangs. Great job at just capturing the vibe of Star Wars. Also unpopular opinion time:  Similar structure to a new hope but different enough to not be a copy of it, reminds me of the phantom menace. Still very much in the ‚Äúit‚Äôs like poetry‚Äù realm for me.   Not the best Star Wars, but the *vibes* are off the charts
I liked it, and it's still my favorite of the sequel trilogy. Sure it's a rehashing of A New Hope, but I mean, at least it's a good movie at the same time.
The only movie I actually liked from the sequel trilogy, and  it was basically just a copy of A New Hope
Really like this movie.I hate that it gets lumped in with the other ones
I really liked it when it was released, it gave me lots of hope for the future of Star Wars. Now all it does is remind me of the bad parts of the sequels.
It‚Äôs fine. A little safe
Started pretty strong, fell off towards the end. Created some good plot lines and possibilities that were basically all squandered with the next two movies.
Great potential, lackluster execution.  Overall a solid start to a new trilogy, let down by future installments.
I had a lot of fun watching it in the theaters multiple times.  It is what it is.    I‚Äôve always felt it‚Äôs biggest mistake is leaving off at a cliffhanger with Luke and Rey, so episode 8 was handicapped by having to pick up at that moment and not have some time pass as we had in every other movie.
I liked it.  It was basically a fan fiction version of Episode 4, but very well done fan fiction at that.
The Force Awakens is a perfectly fine and unoffensive Star Wars film in of itself, but in the context of the wider saga its horrible directive. It‚Äôs follows the same basic plot and structure of Episode IV, and while that‚Äôs debatably what the Star Wars franchise needed in 2015, it clearly wasn‚Äôt what the series needed in the long run. It started a chain of events that led the state of the Galaxy to be exactly the same as it was at the end of Return of the Jedi, effectively making everything Luke, Han and Leia fought worthless as it all gets destroyed either before or during Episode VII. That being said, The Force Awakens is in no way a bad film. It is a Star Wars film though and though, which is its biggest problem. It‚Äôs not unique or original in comparison to the original trilogy.
Derivative of the original Star Wars in every possible way.
I agree with your opinion! It‚Äôs my personal favorite of the trilogy even though Rey was a Mary Sue!
Least favorite of the sequels but it was fine.
A rehash, like the rest of trilogy.
A good start to the trilogy. It‚Äôs a fun adventure that does well establishing the characters. Gave us way more time with Han and Leia than I ever expected in an entire sequel trilogy. On the downside, it‚Äôs a bit of a departure for Star Wars, lacks some substance, and its nostalgia can feel quite pandering in places.
Liked it at the time, but its like - if you read a book and like the first third of it, but then the rest of the book is the worst rubbish you've ever read, do you still care that the book started off well?    Thats where I am with TFA - simply dont care.
It created so much potential in terms of character development for EVERYONE.   Of course, it was wasted. On its own, I think TFA is the best of the sequels.
The most enjoyable of the Sequels
Fun flick. Really captures that Star Wars vibe. Has a few stumbles, but nothing that truly detracts from the fun.
It‚Äôs a decent movie on its own merits (if you treat it as a deliberate homage to episode IV) that was ruined in retrospect with plot threads set up either going nowhere or reaching an unsatisfactory conclusion.
Very well executed. Fun, exciting, well-paced and excellent cast and fight scens. Also very unimaginative in almost every respect. At minimum they should have thrown out the x-wings and tie fighters. It's a star wars movie, you gotta come up with a bunch of cool new ships, minimum.
A crappy remake of the original and destroyed the perfect ending of Return of the Jedi
It's a nostalgia grab first and foremost. The only original thing it does it kill Han Solo, arguably for no reason. Each character is written poorly when compared to who they're based on. Finn noticeably suffers as comic relief with awkward moments and jokes that don't land. Rey had so much potential to be her own bad ass, she could have been the next ahsoka. Instead, she is the second most egregiously mistreated throughout the entire series.  The first most mistreated character goes to who Rey is based on, Luke.   Lucas said Star Wars is supposed to rhyme. He meant that while presenting new movies, there would be old call backs an tie ins, not a regurgitation of his first trilogy.   Oftentimes, when I see a particularly bad Star Wars movie or episode, I wonder to myself if it was really worth selling the golden goose into immortality. Yeah, Star Wars is going to live on as long as Disney now, but in what state? Who knows. What was once a few masterful movies about a beloved story has turned into a blemished repertoire of films.   Its poetic almost. You have those that will love Star Wars no matter what, those that will lament when it is mistreated, and those that now think it is beyond saving. In that trichotomy, I see the Light Side, the space in between, and The Dark Side.   I fall into camp with the Bendu.
I mean, they didn‚Äôt have to pick it up right at that moment. They could‚Äôve started it a couple months later and easily explain that Rey had been training through that time if that‚Äôs what they wanted to do.
Never heard that one before üòÇ
Could they really skip past when Rey and Luke meet for the first time?
They did an awful job anyways, with Luke tossing the lightsaber off the cliff, so I can‚Äôt see how it would be worse to just skip a few months.
As awesome as this is, I bet you could do this with lots of actors.
Looks like the back of my head too‚Ä¶
Diff hair
It is indeed a human man
Careful, you're gonna pull a muscle reaching like that
The thing that stands out to me though are the ears. They‚Äôre pretty bloody close to an exact match
Wait a minute‚Ä¶
I love Lars and this comparison. He‚Äôd be perfect. I just don‚Äôt want to get my hopes up.
No brown,silver,gold,pink
We also got pink, cyan and indigo, if you include the Fallen Order selection
Well now I want a Reservoir Dogs group of Jedi, each with the lightsaber that Grandmaster Joe Cabot assings them.
I don‚Äôt want a pink lightsaber, I‚Äôll trade you mine for your white one‚Ä¶
That is a really cool campaign story you got there!  Personally IMO if the any Mandalorians were to ever join the Rebel Alliance during the first Galactic Civil War  the empire would be defeated probably even before the Battle of Endor even if it was just a small platoon of Mandalorian Commandos helping   Also in your campaign story you mentioned the purge? it wouldn't be much of a purge if there are still enough of Mandalorians to still have a functioning government that could go in production mode to build spaceships to help fight these war    But still a great story and sounds like a fun game to play
>Have they officially confirmed this actor as Thrawn, or is it still just a rumor?  Yes, the actor accidentally let it slip in an interview in which he then said "I'm afraid I prematurely shot my wad on what was supposed to be a dry run, if you will, so now I'm afraid I have something of a mess on my hands".
Well done
Nah. He blue his big chance.
Looks like he's dead
*Thrawn explaining why his Noghri bodyguard is snooping around Vader's ship*  - I'm afraid it's merely a cloaking agent from a sadly blunderous afternoon.
Oh Thrawn, you blowhard!
What a perfect character to bring back! A strong link to the Jedi culture of old and a strong link to Ahsoka without letting yet another Jedi survive Order 66.
Where is he from?  I don‚Äôt remember him ever. I know it‚Äôs a brain block and I‚Äôm tired, so help! Hehe
That whole trailer made me squeal with the light several times! Ahsoka is already the project I was the most excited for; this trailer just jumped my hype up for it 100%  Let's be real like I really needed a reason to rewatch rebels üòÅ
I was like "Why is this random droid in the trailer getting applause?" so I had to look him up.
He's literally older than Yoda, I can't wait to hear stories.
He‚Äôs from an episode of The Clone Wars where he helps some younglings build their lighsabers.
A big blue box according to a high republic book.
Ok I did not remember that and I‚Äôve watched all of CW. Thanks
Hah that‚Äôs fantastic.  Love Doctor Who
The ship they're all on gets hijacked by none other than Hondo when they're returning to Coruscant.
Oh yeah!  Thanks for the reminders. :)
If he likes Harry Potter then tell him the Jedi doing that to Grievous would be like someone at Hogwarts using a forbidden curse on their enemy
Honestly, he's not wrong. A simple force lift, pull, or crush should be more than sufficient to incapacitate Grievous. That's a pretty boring story though. There is a ton of stuff that doesn't make sense viewed through that lens.   The nature of fantasy stories is that they require the willing suspension of disbelief. If he's going to complain that a Jedi should be able to make short work of Grievous, then is he also going to complain that the ability to create artificial gravity means they can create weapons of such awesome destructive power that they make the Death Star look insignificant? Is he going to complain about being able to hear those ships in outer space?   He's either willing to buy into the fantasy or he's not. If he's not, that's fine, but that's his problem and he should stop trying to make it other people's problem too.
Jedi don't typically use the force in an offensive manner. The Sith most certainly would but the Jedi use the force mainly for defensive purposes. It's at the core of their identity. They're pushing boundaries even participating in the war as Generals.
I have to ask, is he really watching or just listing things to complain about later? Grievous is probably only in 10 episodes total and he's far from a major character in the show, so by the time you're in season 4 there are both better things to complain about and the show's gotten intense enough that you should be enjoying it if you have any hope of enjoying it.   Also, ask him why Kenobi didn't do it in the movie!
Grievous was designed by dooku.  Dooku knew he would come into conflict with Jedi.  His design was intentionally made to limit force based weaknesses.    Dooku was an incredibly cunning man.
Mace Windu did it in Tartakovsky Clone Wars, but the important thing to admit is that your dad is right, and that all prequel and prequel-derived Star Wars is poorly concepted and executed.
I like to imagine that Sifo Dyas' blood while didn't really make Grievous force sensitive still provided him with a certain level of resistance to force abilities.
I think sign language would be a good option. Perhaps a back-up vocoder she can use to translate sign language verbally for those who don't understand it. One of the conceits of the Star Wars movies that I love is the idea that most people know multiple languages, and can converse across them with relative ease. No reason that Basic can't also have its own sign language analog that is well known.
Thanks, I actually really like this idea, I'm thinking now maybe she could use the force telepathy thing for maybe while in battle so she can get a message out quickly. I'm thinking about having her wear a mask similar to Plo Koon's and that could be the vocoder.
Sounds good. If I might suggest, for characters who aren't force sensitive, perhaps her "telepathy" is less actual words, and more strong feelings, like feeling a compulsion to take cover behind a specific object, or being struck with a moment of clarity and knowing which target to choose, where as force sensitive character can get actual verbal messages. Just a thought.
By not talking about Thrawn they keep us talking about Thrawn. It's building hype.
Because it's Will Smith
Want to keep us guessing
I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs going to appear in Chapter 24 but who knows.
I wonder if Thrawn isn't going to have the role in this we think he will. Perhaps the main antagonist will be Morgan Elsbeth and the two dark side force users working for her. The Emporer wasn't a huge part in the OT until ROTJ, so maybe Thrawn will just be more in the background.
Because it's fun to keep fans wondering
Well, they‚Äôve got us talking about it.
The people that follow casting news around a show are 100% going to watch the show. Is there precedent for withholding a casting reveal like this?
I've wondered about this casting long enough that I thought it might be Jude Law and the Skeleton Crew was a fake project so
Please no
Yeah, I'm betting he won't show up until the final episode of season 1 and that may be when the reveal is.
So I searched *how to create hype* and these were some of the top results...

Look for common themes in each article.
thank you so much
Be careful or you‚Äôll cut your arm off
With accelerated aging, I think a very big chance
It is possible because Rex is confirmed to be the older bearded dude in ROJT during the battle of Endor. Say the Ahsoka show takes place 5-7 years later that is 14 ish years to add on to his age. Whatever role he will have, it won't be very mobile lol. He probably would be for advice or guidance for Ahsoka.
Yeah, it's possible that they don't include him. I think it would be a little strange because of how important Rex was to her, but it's certainly possible that he's not around.  I think he would be retired by that point, personally. A well deserved retirement, but they could have Thrawn be his one last hurrah before he gets to retire.
Flair should be TV
Rex could be dead by then. He‚Äôd be like 72 by episode 6. Maybe he‚Äôs still alive but he could be dead as well.
Yes, there is a chance Rex is not in the Ahsoka show.
They confirmed he was *there*, not that he's Nik Sant.  As for Rex being in the show, who knows? He would be very old. Always a chance though.
It was only showing me a few flairs for some reason. TV was not one of them. It is showing now.
Naboo wasn‚Äôt space Alabama. She didn‚Äôt have to justify it I don‚Äôt think. Also, Padme seems like the type to maybe have a donor.
Ever notice how much time she spends with Senator Bail Organa?
Padm√©: ‚ÄúThere was no father. I can't explain what happened.‚Äù
I am watching Episode III and I was wondering how did Padme explain being visibly pregnant to her constituents and the senate? She is not publicly in a relationship with Anakin and is not seen with other men.
Later Media explains that it is very common for women on Naboo to have children outside of a relationship.
Naboolabama is my new favourite place
Yeah, Jimmy Smits is clearly the father. That man has aged like fine wine üç∑.
I am confused as to why an explanation to them would be necessary? The republic is not generally packed with religious nutheads who think they deserve to be told about such things.   If I were her, I'd be much more concerned about being noticed by Kenobi, since he was really the only outsider who had a chance at putting the pieces together and finding out who the father was. And in fact, he did figure that out, though sadly too late to do any good.
In the novel it's explained her voluminous robes she usually wears while out on the Senate floor was able to hide her pregnancy so it wouldn't be very noticeable.  But she and Anakin both knew that time was running out and mainly were hoping to make it to after the war.
Rex or Ahsoka too
Maybe? I had those down as probably already know and don't plan to cause trouble? S7 of the clone wars shows Rex knows about their relationship since he stands guard on their calls (and Kenobi alluded to Padme which means odds are he's at least aware, even if Anakin and Padme are not aware he knows about them, and Ahsoka is close friends with both and my the time the pregnancy would be a concern she'd been booted from the Jedi and was no longer on good terms with them, should she even want to say something. I also got the sense that Ahsoka knew pretty early into her apprenticeship since there's several parts where she both uses it to call Anakin on his hypocrisy, as well as other random bits scattered throughout the show where she alludes to having at least a suspicion, through her body language.   Putting together the bits with Kenobi from S7 and episode 3 it seems he knew they were involved, and probably could see Padme was pregnant, and since he doesn't formally ask about the father until after the fall of Anakin, my guess is he didn't ask and didn't want to know who the father was so he could maintain deniability if asked by the council. He probably had a very good guess but still had hope of saving Anakin from himself so he didn't want to put himself in a position where he could be forced to compromise Anakin.
He had a huge ego and believed he was ‚Äúthe chosen one.‚Äù  He wasn‚Äôt going anywhere.
He could have whenever he wanted.  If the war had ended, he  probably even would have since that would be the only way to live as his childrens father. But he also *wanted* to be a Jedi and considered it his duty as long as the war was going on, so he couldn't.
He could have.  In the novelization of ROTS he did not quit because he was having the dreams of Padme dying and wanted to become a Jedi Master to be able to access the forbidden knowledge of the Jedi archive to find a way to save her.  Also why he got so pissy about not being granted the rank of Master.
He wasn‚Äôt treated badly.  He was overly emotional, selfish, egotistical, temperamental, suspicious, insecure, and emotional.  Those are dangerous things for an unstable Force user.  The Jedi tried to help him learn patience, restraint, humility, and self control.  It didn‚Äôt turn out so well for anyone involved.
First: He was not treated bad, but was judged in reason of what the Order stands for, and what he does, which is being a badass warrior with no patience or wish to be a councilor or diplomat.  If anything, he was treated way better than he should have been.  Second: It would have become a struggle between Palps and Kenobi.  In the comics, Anakin already express his wish to leave to Obi-Wan and Yoda, even as a kid, and they just encourage him to think well about it, but are mostly ok if he chooses to leave.  Kenobi even express to Yoda that he promised Qui-Gon to train him, and he was going to respect his last wish with or without the Order.  So, by the point of RotS, the fate of Anakin would have been hanging on if Kenobi quits with him or not.  If he does, Kenobi doesn't go after Grievous, and if Sidious still tells Anakin about being a Sith, having Obi-Wan at his side to help him think would turn Anakin away from the Dark Lord.  After all, Obi-Wan absence is what Sidious needed for his opening.  Now, if he quits, the war would be going on more time, but by the time of RotS, the Jedi was already suspecting of Palps, and since they were not really fans of the Senators, there would have been a matter of time until they got to the truth.  So, the end of all would have been again, in hands of Obi-Wan.
Depends on what he quits. Post Clone Wars quiting the Jedi would have more easily led to his fall because then he'd become part of Palpatine's circle until Palpatine thought he was ripe to turn.
Then he would have left. Obi-Wan would have *maybe* gone with him, but I think he would have seen Anakin being trained up until Knighthood as having fulfilled his promise to train him, and at that point there's not much else they could do.   I think they would try to talk to him about staying, especially if Luke and Leia are born. I don't think Anakin ever would truly walk away though.
I believe he did enjoy being a Jedi and the things he was able to do as a Jedi.  As Lucas say's he was greedy and wanted more.  Basically he wants the best of both worlds.  He could've left at any point if he really hated it but he didn't want to.  Also I don't think they treated him poorly or it was a bad place to work.  And he was able to love just not get married.

That will take a long time. There is a lot of other literature out there worth that investment. I would only bother with stories that you have a strong interest in, and check reviews. Imo, Timothy Zahn‚Äôs Thrawn trilogy is as good as it gets.
I just love to read. I‚Äôm gonna read ‚Äòem all. :)
Pretty sure the only canon game is fallen order. Could be wrong about that though, someone correct me if so.
Yep. Actually a little bit over 3,000 years if I remember correctly. You think that's wild, it's set like 200 years after the original knights of the Old Republic and knights of the Old Republic 2.  But if you really want to dig into the lore of the setting? There are galactic civilizations millions of years old. Dig into the old EU and legends material, you find out that this galaxy has been a boiling over war zone for millions of years.
Not really since it's not canon.  Also, shouldn't you watch The Clone Wars Season 7 before Episode III?
Battlefront 2 campaign is canon
*Squadrons*, the VR games, and a few of the early mobile games are also canon
Is it worth going back and playing? Will I ruin my order and everything?     This is the order I'm going in currently about to start Season 6 Of clone wars.  [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CxUtJ2guSGJ34n-QQPa3BiyM4\_sfDLutV941vm1Ot2E/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CxUtJ2guSGJ34n-QQPa3BiyM4_sfDLutV941vm1Ot2E/edit?usp=sharing)
Too spoilery
Oh good to know. Will probably play through that now. The only other one that I haven't played that looks cool to me is Squadrons. Canon or not?
Squadrons too.
Had very slight assumptions that the others may have been canon, never would've assumed any mobiles though lol
There is such a huge difference of time between that game and anything else that it might as well be a slightly different setting. Over the next 35 centuries the Republic and the Jedi are going to forget everything they know about the Sith, nothing that happens in the game affects anything in the current continuity or vice versa. Some of the stuff in the game can help give you background information, like who and what the Sith are and why they hate the Jedi. But you can get that just as easily off of wookieepedia
Only the last 3 eps tbh
Pretty sure it's canon also but don't quote me
Yes, it's canon.  Heck, a certain character from Rebels shows up in the game.
So It won't ruin my order? and by ruin I mean wont spoil?
I agree, but might as well watch the whole season together instead of splitting it
Lol you're good, I won't. Same thing I did with my original comment.
Not at all. The game, in order to make money, included a bunch of cosmetic Easter eggs from the mandalorian and clone wars and a bunch of other Star wars products, but none of them includes spoilers you can play the game all you want and still have no idea what's going to happen next in whatever series you're watching.
Thank You!!!
I 100% believed that Mandalorian was shot on location.  Sometimes it's noticeable, and I do think that they should do more actual location filming, but Twitter is far too dramatic about it.
I think it's amazing and I can't tell at all that it's not real during the actual show.
It's a good tool to be used sparingly, but it seems like it's being used more than practical location shooting now and it's getting to be pretty visually obvious.
Sometimes it's not good to see what is behind the curtain.
The shows that use it feel cheap, and I'm pretty sure use of The Volume is part of the reason why.  Andor does look a lot better.
A lot of the sets that take place in outdoor areas end up looking barren and uninteresting. It's the same problem with George moving to CGI being the majority of special effects in the prequels- suddenly the galaxy didn't have that lived in worn down look that gave star wars it's charm
I mean yeah, visually it looks fine, but I just started to notice that the framing of the scenes all looked the same. There isn't a lot of variance in the backgrounds, and like I said, it's almost always flat and shot from similar angles.  I mean here, I'll watch the Ashoka trailer and the andor trailer, and just see what stands out to me.  All of the shots in the desert temple stick out to me, there's a lot less detail in the columns and the stonework in general, and you can kind of see where the foreground just sharply ends.  Ashoka and Sabine talking in the white city with the spires sticks out.  About 1:05, she meets the male wolf, that's volume for sure  About 1:22, the double bladed guy, that one feels WAY too much like a volume shot.  Those were just the big ones.  I saw more, but those were the big glaring ones. It feels like I'm playing a video game I guess? Where my character is the most detailed part and the backgrounds are all a little lower rez, less bright, and have fewer details.  That's kind of what I'm talking about. For a lot of these shots, the scene is the same size and shape, if not from the same angle too. The background is never too dark or too bright.  In the andor trailer, there are almost NO shots like these, and no two shots really look the same. You have big, real environments, people moving close to and far away from the camera, and a variety of angles and distances.  Idk if that makes sense, but that's more what I'm talking about
I mean, yeah, but reading about a cool new filing technology shouldn't be enough to kill your enjoyment of it.  The video I watched was the honest trailer for Andor, where he points out that this show wasn't made on the volume, that's all I peaked behind the curtain tbh
What's funny though is that people do often say they look cheap, but I've yet to see anyone give an example of a scene that actually uses the Volume when they complain about how cheap it looks. It's always the scenes on a real set that they bring up.
He wasn't thinking clearly, because he had just been attacked by a ~~woman~~ womba.
Oh come on women aren‚Äôt that scary
That‚Äôs what kissing your sister does to a man‚Äôs psyche
Stupid auto-correct.
He didn‚Äôt kiss her yet but definitely thought about it though lol also doesn‚Äôt realize it till the next movie
üòî it was just a joke
He looks like he gonna tell the story of John Wick.
I believe the story is that he was a Jedi that fled to the Unknown Regions after receiving Obi-wan's warning message.  So he's a fallen Jedi.  I'm not entirely sure of the apprentice.  Their lightsabers are both Orange.  He's likely not associated with the Sith, rather following his own dark path, or perhaps he studied a dark cult in his travels through the Unknown Regions.
Given the location of that particular shot, I feel like he may be even older (possibly Old Republic era), and stumbled into the New Republic era via the World Between Worlds.
‚ÄúHe wasn‚Äôt exactly the Sith Lord. He was the one you sent to kill the fucking Sith Lord.‚Äù
Now I think that's a huge stretch. Lightsaber designs during the high republic were pretty wild too, not just old republic. But I mean it's possible and I'll eat my words if he ends up being from there
The sitha yaga
I once saw him in a cantina kill 3 Pykes with a comlink, a fucking comlink.
I'm really glad people are casting him to act not just in mocap suit lol, hope he has a big role in The Batman part II
If 1 year ago you would've told me "never more than 12" would have been the hypest line in all of Star Wars I would've said you're crazy. And I would've been wrong
I honestly wouldn't have been mad if we just had 10 episodes of the prison arc in Andor. Those two were spectacular, and the supporting cast was also pretty great.
2nd best speech next to Luthren...üíØ
I‚Äôm ashamed that I had my doubts when he popped up in Andor. He (and everyone else cast) was riveting.
Shite swimmer tho
I'm still gutted that we don't know what happened but the implication is that he either drowned himself or went back into the prison and was killed
I have no idea who this is. But I did like his acting. Just binged season 1 of andor.
He was great in this and a whole bunch of things.  I remember being really skeptical of him in movies (as not Smeagol) when he was in 13 Going on 30 and his whole part was 100% a Tim Curry impersonation.
Absolutely
I‚Äôm glad they gave Serkis another chance to actually flex his acting chops. It seems they at least realized they squandered him in the ST.
What movie or tv show is this? Andy is fun to watch.
Acting? You should see him do the [Thriller dance!](https://youtu.be/hrQlEnUYuB4)
Flair should be TV
Sorry its been some time since i saw Andor.  can some one explain the never more than 12
To be fair he‚Äôs also really good at acting in a mocap suit as well.
I haven‚Äôt ‚Äúhoop‚Äùed aloud at Star Wars since Duel of the Fates debuted.
There is >!One. Way. Out!<
This show‚Äôs reminding me of the old head cannon for the gritty star wars show meme from back in the day.
And the fact there are ***two*** to compare. . .    *chef's kiss*
Have you forgotten about Marva‚Äôs speech at the end?
You know what? You don‚Äôt deserve happiness, but you deserve this r/angryupvote
He was recaptured and then used for the emperor‚Äôs cloning experiments, leading to the creation of Snoke.
He's the guy who motion-capture acting for Smeagol in LOTR, King Kong, and others, plus several live action roles like Klaue in the MCU.
This guy is actually Snoke
To be fair acting in a mocap suit the way he can is more impressive than bormal acting
I definitely yelled ‚ÄúOH SHIT!‚Äù at my TV. I was psyched waiting for the next episode all week.
Damn it you guys!!! I'm watching both when I get home...the goosebumps already!!!
Maarva‚Äôs funeral speech ups the comparisons to three
I didn't...I watch that again!!!
"how many sith are there at one time Master Snoke"  "Never more than 12"
And to be fair, bormal acting is way harder than normal acting ^/jk
You're not wrong! I only watched it once through, time for a rewatch (after my rewatch of Rebels that I'm already in, for reasons)!
Nice score.  I'd say that's worth like 500+
Wow I had no idea. I didn‚Äôt even remember having this üò≥
I took a quick look on ebay and completed ones were in the 300-400 range. Unopened def more.  May the force be with you!
He‚Äôs said a bunch of times that he doesn‚Äôt really have interest in reprising the role, especially not in live action. He was even hesitant to voice Kanan again for Rise of Skywalker.
For real. Dude loves Star Wars, and really dug into that role.
They should just kill him off completely. He‚Äôll never see it coming!
Love Freddie <3
They‚Äôll have to de-age him so he looks like this photo, but yes.
Agreed
I hope so. That would be awesome or at least as a force ghost!
Too soon
No force ghost?
YES
He's a bit more grey than that now
Please no. My heart can‚Äôt take that shit
Does he? He clearly loves and respects the role, but I haven't really seen anything about him loving Star Wars as a whole. I know he did the tabletop game with Sam Witwer, but that see.ed more about his love of tabletop RPGs than his love of Star Wars
That‚Äôs not how Force ghosts work
Unfortunately Kanaan would had to have learned how to become a force ghost before he died. Qui Gon taught Yoda and Obi Wan, and Yoda and Obi Wan were able to teach Anakin just before he crossed over into the afterlife.
I *think* those are [PK-Series Worker Droids](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/PK-series_worker_droid), but not 100% sure, tbh.
The PK-series worker droid
Literally never noticed that before.
"Lil droidy bois"
That‚Äôs definitely it thank you!
I have no idea what this means but I like it
I am all in for a Sith singing Let It Go and then dismembering some fools that once left her for dead.
This is actually the Star Wars series I am most looking forward to because Amandla Stenberg is an absolutely fantastic actor and I am so glad Amandla is joining the Star Wars Universe.
Evil sith snowman confirmed
Revenge story centered on a Sith cultist whose fellow cultists betrayed her and left her for dead... because she manifested powers she couldn't control?
Throw in a big song in the middle and I‚Äôm in
Just the movies and spin-off movies? Watch them all at 1.5x speed, and you'll get through them in roughly 17 hours
Start with the 78 holiday special and then play it by ear from there.
If you've only got the 4th, marathon of Rogue One & Episode IV thru VI.  If you have a bit of time each day, start a weeklong binge with Phantom Menace on the first, wrapping up with The Last Jedi on the 8th.  Shame they never made an Episode 9...
Set fast forward to the highest speed.
I think there's been more than a week's worth of runtime for quite some time now. Assuming you count more than just the movies.
Aren‚Äôt the lightsaber‚Äôs orange not red? Also, they can‚Äôt be Sith. Although what they are, we‚Äôll just have to find out
They can change the kyber crystal
Live action Sabine Wren, my beloved
Evil Chopper noises
Where is Bo Katan? Is she safe? Is she alright?
We didn‚Äôt include Zeb?
I like all of the designs but Hera. Honestly she's really difficult to pull off and I think they did the best, but it just looks like a decent cosplay.
Chopper, my favorite Sw droid except for Bollux!
Hera seems off‚Ä¶this might sound stupid but she just looks like somebody painted green. I‚Äôm not sold but I‚Äôll wait for a few episodes before I decide anything final
I don‚Äôt like the green they chose for Hera ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I hadn't seen any of these yet. They look great!
Man I'm so fucking excited for Hera and that little robotic war criminal
I hooted out loud when I saw chopper
Chopper is full of war crimes and i love him
Since the trailer i really want to watch rebels again
I wonder how Ezra is gonna look in the series actually, obviously that is just an old hologram of him from the days of the Ghost Crew.
As a rebels fan this makes me very happy to see.
Idk about the casting choice for Chopper ü§î
Hera just looks like Mary Elizabeth Winstead in face paint. Kinda odd
Hera looks kinda tall for me but I‚Äôm super picky
[removed]
Why didn't you include Zeb?!?
Hera and Ezra just look like cosplayers
I expected sabine to look a bit different, but I'm pleasantly surprised regardless...   Ezra got me worried though, hard to tell from just the hologram.  Last but not least, we shall see about Thrawn
Glad to see the characters, but the actors just aren‚Äôt really doing it for me
So excited!  Can‚Äôt wait for this!
No Zeb??
Our boy chopper looking good and ready to cause chaos.
Granted we've only heard 1 line, but Hera felt much more like a mom than this actress.
Y‚Äôall forgot Bo Katan
Now I‚Äôm not sure who to simp for - Ahsoka, Bo, Sabine, or Hera?
She's not a main character on Rebels, despite starting in animation. By that standard, there were a few other folks I could have included.
Tbf, its just the animation. After all, she (and her species) have human facial features like everyone else and its only the twintails that look alien... bring that to live action and you literally get a person painted green. Its not like this hasn't happened before though.
Statement: Your choices leave something to be desired, meatbag, but as you otherwise have good taste I suppose I can spare you. For the present.
That‚Äôs a deep cut.
We've also only heard one line from her but I think i'll have a harder time getting over the voice, Mary Elizabeth Winstead just sounds so much younger
Gotta agree, I think we're in the minority but she just doesn't seem like Hera, from what we've been shown. Imo, at least. Something's just...off visually too but who knows maybe she'll end up spectacular either way.
Buddy i got news for you, *all* the aliens are just people painted green‚Ä¶
Yeah I have to agree, it looks like something you‚Äôd see at the Star Wars hotel experience thing
I got the same feeling from the trailer. Looks like a random woman in a half-hearted Hera cosplay. Not the actual character.
I have to agree, it feels more like someone trying to cosplay as Hera.
[removed]
Same. Just started today, and finally got my partner to start watching it because of how great that trailer was.
[removed]
All simultaneously of course
The correct answer is Chopper
Yes
[removed]
I think canonically Hera and Mary Elizabeth are 1 year apart in age.
Either that or they're wearing a Halloween mask and big hands.
[removed]
That‚Äôs hot
Or else he‚Äôll come and eviscerate your entire village.

How long what? How long ago?  The kenner line in the picture ended in 1985
She is nice and wholesome. I  just find her a bit boring though. Her achievements are given too easily and that is to the character's detriment. A bit more struggle would have made her more relatable.
I like the characters, but those movies were ass
If you enjoy Rey, great. If you don‚Äôt, great.   Let people feel the way they want to feel. Starting your post with get over it makes you no better than the problem starters on this sub.
Concur.    My daughter's (10) favorite character
I really like almost all of the sequel characters. I just think they were handed stories that wet limp. If Disney is keying up to do some stories in that era, I'd watch them hoping for something fun.
I hated the sequels, liked Rey well enough, hated Rey skywalker. I'll probably pass on the new movie.
I'm sure Daisy Ridley is a good actress. She was great in Twelve Minutes. She was just screwed over by bad writing in Star Wars. But a movie about rebuilding the Jedi order should have been headlined by Luke and set after Return of the Jedi. Now i know they're showing Luke rebuilding the Jedi order in the TV series but from what we know from the sequels it's set up to fail. So I'm just really not interested in the new Rey movie.
She's ok in my opinion, she's a badass who can beat down a whole group of men if she has to.  However I do not approve of Rey Skywalker, I just don't
I like Daisy Ridley. I like Rey. I don't like how her story was written in a way that completely hijacked Luke's.  **Star Wars OT:** Rebels vs. Empire. A young hero who is the offspring of a villain becomes a Jedi on a mission to defeat Palpatine and The Empire. He does, and goes on to rebuild the Jedi Order.  **Star Wars ST:** Rebels vs. Empi - uh The First Order. A young hero who is the offspring of a villain becomes a Jedi on a mission to defeat Palpatine and The First Order. She does, and goes on to rebuild the Jedi Order.  I mean come on. Like the actress and the character, but let's admit that this aspect of her story is bullshit.
I definitely like the character and the actress... Im ok with the sequels overall but there are many things that could have been better
Shoulda made her sith appearance permanent she‚Äôs no skywalker
She's not my favorite but I don't dislike her. Im excited to see more of her though
TRUTH
I adore Rey. She's my second favorite character next to Obi-Wan.   I think her introduction in TFA is absolutely beautiful and some of the best scenes in the whole saga. I love how much we learn about her without any diologue.
Rey and Ben were good characters and could be wayyyy better with better writing. Finn could have been a good character but all he said was scream ‚ÄúREYYYYYYY‚Äù every single movie.
Wasn‚Äôt a big fan of the character but that‚Äôs probably because of bad writing. I hope this new film gives her better development and a better storyline
I agree. The hatred for her is every bit as embarrassing as the hatred for the prequels. People need to get real problems if this is the sort of stuff that bothers them.
I love the sequels and it has a lot to do with Daisy and her performance as Rey.
All due respect but no. I dont like rey. I find her to be a very boring character that had so little progression.  And the writers didn't do anything to help daisy ridley.  So don't tell me to get over it. You get over it with this nonsense.   Because thats the truth. I don't like rey. I don't like the sequel trilogy. But I have no problem with anyone that does.  I'm glad you like her. I'm glad others do. Genuinely.  But that doesn't mean I have to, so get out of here with your post.
ü´°
I liked her hair today. It reminds me of my mom.
It‚Äôs ok to like Rey and it‚Äôs Ok to dislike her.  I don‚Äôt blame Daisy Ridley. I blame the crap writing and how she just went from unknown to super powerful Jedi in one movie without a journey to get there.  What a strange post and strange comments. You say how you don‚Äôt care, but yet you keep criticizing and antagonizing people who disagree with you.
mary sue
Same. Loved her from the first scene.
r/DarthRey   Join our Rey appreciation subreddit. It's a great wholesome community of Rey fans.  Rey just needed a reason to go with her being so powerful in the Force. Maybe have a strong dark side connection. After all Yoda once said about the dark side: https://youtu.be/y1hCMKav3LE
I agree the idea of Ray and the other characters was good it's just how they were written out to be why people don't like them like if they were written differently or as a example written by let's just name a random director let's say who's making mandalorian I forget his name or maybe the og people would like the movies I mean I liked episode 7 the force awakens I minus they killed home dude Han solo but other than that I thought it was a decent movie and when I saw last jedi I was expecting something epic granted all we got was Luke hiding on a distant planet which if it was for a different reason would of been a
I agree but I also agree with everyone else yeah the idea of the sequels characters are good but the writing that they did for those movies why people don't like it I mean the force awaken wasn't half bad but at the end of the day no sense in arguing because Disney is just going to make what they want with it being good or bad only time will tell
Sort of like suddenly being the best fighter pilot in the galaxy when you‚Äôve never flown in outer space before.
Similar to Superman it‚Äôs nice to just have a positive nice main character, getting sick of ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù anti heroes or whatever, Rey is actually rare these days.
She was relatable I don‚Äôt understand, physically she overcame issues but that‚Äôs the boring part of any character. Internally she struggled with legacy and who she was which I thought was relatable enough, especially for a Star Wars main character which let‚Äôs be honest, are not complex. Luke and Anakin were basic as heck sorry.
This. Even if the new movie with Rey is an absolute banger that writes her in a compelling way, that won't undo the damage the ST did to the OT's characters and their legacy. There's so many ways to pass the torch while honoring the legacy of your old heroes. But they gave her his story.  Both born on a desert planet. Both are the offspring of a villain. Both join a rebellion. Both get trained by an old wise Jedi in the 2nd film. Both take down Palpatine (she did it more directly) Both restore the Jedi Order.  Like they literally painted Luke as a sad old man who failed, so she could hijack his storyline and be the actual hero who successfully restores the Jedi. It's fine to like Daisy, I do too. But it shouldn't be a conundrum why her character rubbed so many fans the wrong way.
The prequels? Yeah they were lol.
Nah.
All that matters really.
I like the sequels a lot though people over exaggerate the problems. The first two were solid.
Agreed. I love Finn especially he was great!
I‚Äôll give it a chance. I think they will do her character justice.
No you wont
Bad writing? It was perfectly functional in the first two, maybe a bit bland but no Star Wars character is that interesting sorry.
On the contrary I would rather see her rebuilding cuz she didn‚Äôt get as much interesting to do. I wanna see them do right by the character they set up. Luke has enough content and TLJ rounded out his character perfectly. Luke is my favorite but someone else deserves some spotlight and Rey is great.
It wasn't the right direction for her character, I thought the whole "she's nobody and that's okay" story arc was much better.
Very true. I liked the first two but the last one wasn‚Äôt great. That being said there isn‚Äôt much Star Wars after Empire that was anything great, so whatever.
Yawn. The attempt to make her play with her ‚Äúdark side‚Äù was so cliche and lame in TROS. However, clearly she should have been her own person instead of a Skywalker but Abrams things waving things people recognize in front of their face will satisfy people.
Yeah, I certainly like other characters more, but she is still good. She's my friend's favorite though.
Exactly. This is called visual storytelling and it‚Äôs on full display in TFA.
Based.
No u.
Thats so sweet ü•∫
Or maybe she has a really strong connection to the Light Side, despite being a descendant of Darth Sidious.  That would be really fascinating to me and return to the Star Wars themes of temptation, choice, and fate vs. free will.  Rey being bred for the Dark but choosing the Light is a fantastic character direction for me and truly captures the spirit of Star Wars.
Its the struggle.  Rey had the hero's journey without the pesky middle part and they didn't explain why very well.  I like Daisy, but Rey, to me, is very boring.  She's so OP that actually challenging her is daunting, and when she's challenged everyone else is kind of redundant.
Luke is literally my favorite character, so sick of you idiots. They nailed it, he's a fallible human being, that's what makes him endearing. They literally nailed his character and morons who think Anakin is good whined lol. So pathetic.
Finn's opening scenes in TFA were absolutely amazing. Really had me full of dreams about the traumatic experience of being a trafficked child soldier. His extreme anxiety. His unwillingness to trust. They set him up so well but just pushed all of that away in favor of extra screen time for other stuff.
üçª personally i was to see a.bacck in time saga like old republic or a palpatine movie or mini series
Whole trilogy was ‚Äúyawn‚Äù but good on you rey your little heart out
I feel that would work more as nature vs nurture. Rey being dark side by nature and the whole "do I still have a choice" arc. I think you can do more with that that fate vs free will.
It‚Äôs funny how fans of every Star Wars era can have friendly discussions about the good and bad parts of their personal favorite era except Sequel fans and more specifically Rey stans. Why do you all resort to personal attacks so quick over Star Wars?
You sound really aggressive and childish with your name calling.  Maybe get some rest.
Everything you said is true. Pure delusion.
Very true. He was great in TFA. Was okay with him taking more of a backseat in TLJ but I expected more for the final film that didn't deliver.
High Republic is pretty good actually if you haven‚Äôt read any of that yet.
Nah, nothing that makes people so angry is ‚Äúyawn.‚Äù Pretend not to care.
Like I care it‚Äôs literally a fake stupid movie series really like I care idiot.
Yeah. There was nothing inherently wrong with his TLJ side story, but they could've focused more on Rose being a grieving and staunch rebel having trust issues with a paranoid ex-stormtrooper. And bring up both of their unique skill sets a little better.
I have some books on an order list and that's one of them but imo seeing the evolution of corasant and deep dives into the unknown reaches would be dope
Whatever you say!! Enjoy your new trilogy
It‚Äôs okay I understand why you act this way ;)
I think what they did was funny so i liked it
Yeah. I just want a different old republic series, frankly the old one was too uncreative IMO.
Okay? I don‚Äôt care
If you comment back at all I won, HAHAHA, I WON HAHAHA,
I liked it enough that I think they could have made it the major feature of the movie instead of the fleet stuff. It needed mooooar.
I would like it further back like the wars between Jedi and mandalorians
It‚Äôs almost as if ALL of Star Wars is one continuous story.
MFW people still wanna treat the animated stuff as lesser compared to the live action stuff when nearly everything about the current canon has shown otherwise.  Also The Mandalorian has been used as a backdoor pilot for other shows and continuing Clone Wars + Rebels plot threads since season 2, so I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre so upset about this now.
Everyone should watch TCW and Rebels anyway, they're great. But you're being overly dramatic about this.
Yes that's because Clone Wars and Rebels fucking rule.
My dad hasn't watched any of the animated shows, and he still enjoys watching The Mandalorian. He had no issues understanding Bo-Katan or her motivations, nor did he take issues with Ahsoka showing up, he just thought she was a cool Jedi, and when I showed him the trailer for her series today, he expressed interest in watching.
It finally pushed me to watch TCW.  It's a little disappointing. I do miss the original vibe of the show a bit. That said, it's fun it's more expanded.
I have given TCW several attempts and just cannot get into it. Dave Filoni is an awesome writer, but I think he is kind of stuck in TCW world and keeps trying to plug those characters in. Was Ahsoka really necessary in the Mandalorian? I will keep watching it because I've enjoyed the live action shows, but that is always in the back of my mind.
This is great news!
This sounds like a major win to me. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Well, I‚Äôve never watched Clone Wars. I know!  I know I‚Äôm missing good stuff.   I have thoroughly enjoyed this season of Mando. So, I guess I‚Äôm a Clone Wars fan now?
Awesome!
I don't understand this logic of saying a show suddenly "changed target demographics" after 2 seasons.   Pretty sure the current viewers also watched the previous seasons.
Maybe if I whine enough the cartoons won't be cannon...
I‚Äôm sorry, but the Dark Saber showed up in the first season, so as someone who watched and loved the animated shows, I feel like the connection was pretty obvious from the beginning.  Also, the animated shows are some of the best stuff in Star Wars. Clone Wars somehow made the prequels better for me. Rebels is outstanding and expands the lore so much, not to mention the fans have been waiting to find out what happened for years now, and I‚Äôm pretty sure Filoni had been wanting to bring his (and George‚Äôs) characters to live action for some time now, they just needed that $$. Just one woman‚Äôs opinion though.
What if‚Äîand hear me out‚Äîthere can be *new* stories that don't have to circle back to the main story every time. Mind = blown.  (By the way neither the Mandalore nor Thrawn plots are part of the main "continuous" story. They're not part of the movies at all. They're just part of the animated shows)
I'm the opposite. I watched The Clone Wars first and was excited for something new and different. Now it's just the same old stuff again.
Viewership for season 3 is actually lower, and if they continue to shift the focus away from Din it's likely to become less appealing to the casual fans who liked the show before.
A lack of news doesn't mean it's canceled.
Was it announced as having been canceled?  Or was it just not announced because it‚Äôs already been announced and has no further update at this time?
So many announcements, so little films
Yeah, like Ryan Johnson's trilogy which has had zero development for like 5 years ( I love the last jedi)
Don't rain on my parade.
The latter. Like most of the previously rumored/announced stuff.
Josh trank film cancelled, James Mangold boba fett cancelled, game of thrones guys trilogy cancelled, patty jenkins film cancelled, feige film cancelled.
Pretty sure I saw something from him that he still plans on it but won‚Äôt be doing anything with it until his knives out trilogy is done.
I got 5 credits says that Rey flick doesn't get made.
Considering the show is called ‚ÄúThe Mandalorian‚Äù and the series started with one Mandalorian, and has progressively been more and more about what it means to be a Mandalorian, I think this has been the best season so far.    > There is no point in taking grogu from Luke, he literally did nothing of worth this season,  He chose to stay and be a Mandalorian. I don‚Äôt see how his being there experiencing Mandalorian culture is doing nothing of worth.  He literally hopped into a ship to rescue Din.   > They show us the methasaur for 10 seconds, bring him up twice with nothing of worth of trying to tame him to bring the mandalorians together.   I have no doubt we‚Äôll see Bo Katan riding it in the season finale.  > Last week the show us that moff is free with possibly death watch freeing him or him framing the mandalorians, and now this week we spend 35 minutes on a side mission of a side mission of a detective story. I‚Äôm sorry but what is the point. Sure it‚Äôs cool but it has nothing to do with the story.  It kinda has everything to do with the story. This adventure mystery created allies that will lead to Mandalore being recognized again, and now there is a plot thread of where these nanodroids came from.  But hey, you don‚Äôt have to like it.
I have enjoyed it, but I‚Äôm also easily entertained.  I think it is probably hurt by some great seasons and so one that probably would have been loved a few years back just seems ok or meh now.    A loose story of getting the Mandalorians to quit their shit and play nice with each other is a fine enough purpose.  And I figure it‚Äôs now to a point that they can have multi season plots with stuff put out on season 3 with the payoff on season 4 if they go that route.    As to the Bo-Katan part, I can‚Äôt disagree with your point, but it also does not bother me to have him co-star in it instead of leading the story.
I don't mind the overall story, but the scripts have been pretty average. Lots of clunky dialogue that doesn't really come across as very natural conversations, they sound a lot like the various aninated shows. Hope that makes sense!  And also bringing back Grogu could have been delayed, he's done very little this season and it seems to kind of waste the way S2 ended.
Not all the episodes are out yet tho right? Some of these things may be tied in by the end. You should wait until you've seen the whole season before judging it as a whole.
Shouldn't be unpopular opinion, considering audience is dropping.
Cool. Thanks for sharing.
Well we‚Äôve got 2 episodes left to cram in Bo riding that space donkey.
I've preferred this season over season 1 & 2. I thought Andor was the best thing since Empire Strikes back.
Ok. I will say that nothing is value might have been the wrong choice of words. But all of those things are what I have I complained about being of only 7 minutes of actual content. They could be more efficient with all of those things to create more time to develop the plot properly.  As with the Methasaur, there you said it. She is probably going to ride him in the finally, and that‚Äôs the problem. We only have 2 episodes left and I simply can‚Äôt believe that is enough time to tame a monster thought to be legendary.  As with grogu, I feel like him being with Luke a while longer would‚Äôve been a better move. But with mando, if they wanted to spend of the season going on adventures at least they could‚Äôve included more season on din training him.  Hopefully they can tie it well enough for Ashoka.
I understand you. Also I‚Äôm not opposed to Bo but I think if this season could‚Äôve been her own show and focused more on her, it would make more sense
Totally agree, and thank for actually understanding my take on grogu, he could have spent more time with Luke then some time with Mando to create this character like Vezla who would unite jedi and mandalorians.
I‚Äôm not trying to jump ahead, but only 2 episodes left it‚Äôs kinda difficult to tie both moff and Methasaur plots well enough without making it a pacing nightmare. I‚Äôm just frustrated that we‚Äôre 6 episode in and the whole season feels like filler with 5 minutes of importance each week.
That‚Äôs what I thought, but so many of the community seems to think other wise.
Man. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been saying, they could‚Äôve spent a couple of episodes of Bo interacting with it and building a relationship with it so that she can tame. But now Bo will magically be able to tame a space monster that was thought to be a myth for thousands of years.
Don't you get it star wars is supposed to be campy and boring! It's part of what makes it so fun!  EDIT: Marvel
It‚Äôs the sad truth. Everything is becoming a cash grab, no passion.  But why did you edit your comment it was hilarious. Lol
George Lucas in 1977: So I made sure that I would get the profits from merchandising and then just made so many fucking toys of stuff that I never even entertained the idea of putting into my stuff so I can make so much money.  Fans: After 45 years of watching I'm suspecting to think that the owners of Star Wars are hoping to see a buck.
> Summary? It‚Äôs all a money grab.  In other news, water is wet.
Always has been
What clanger did she drop?
Yes, Disney wants your money - yesterday, today, tomorrow and every day thereafter. These events are for fans, but they‚Äôre also for investors to see what they‚Äôre investing in. Disney is a publicly traded company and all the things we want cost lots and lots of money.
I've never seen it as a must-do. Hell, one year for Anaheim I won 2 whole event passes and I still didn't think it was worth the cost to fly out there.  Crowds suck. The panel news is fleeting and online asap. The merch even if unique is pretty easy to get. Outside of meeting or seeing the famous folks, which isn't my thing, I don't get the appeal.
Tbf I understand what you mean even though I actually enjoyed myself today there wasn‚Äôt as much copslay as I was expecting that being said it was ridiculously overcrowded and there was essentially nothing to do except shop. Mandalorians where everywhere but that is in style at the moment I didn‚Äôt really see any kylo Rens and I definitely saw a couple of Vaders. I don‚Äôt know if anyone else feels the same but it did definitely feel way to overcrowded and the lines were ridiculous. Tickets were far too much and pretty much everything there you could‚Äôve bought online I also spoke to a lot of people who weren‚Äôt able to get into the panels and couldn‚Äôt pre order tickets and not getting into that made the day a bit pointless overall I definitely enjoyed myself but I‚Äôm not looking forward to checking my bank account later today and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth it. In my opinion the biggest problem is the panel and the amount of people.  Edit: I think it needed to be bigger in general it was surprisingly small and cramped they definitely could‚Äôve opened up the entire Excel centre and had stands there would‚Äôve allowed for more and taken the pressure of the amount of queuing and standstill areas that felt more like a nightclub dance floor  They only used about 3/4 of the centre and even if they just opened it up and let people sit and eat or hang out in there like they do with comic con it would‚Äôve been way better
You didn‚Äôt see one Darth Vader cosplay, but you did see hundreds of people cosplaying the new characters.. and somehow that‚Äôs bad?  Isn‚Äôt that a sign that the new characters are popular and beloved?   Anyway, there have been ‚ÄúStar Wars is ruined now‚Äù folks since Empire Strikes Back. Always have been. Always will be.   As with everything in the entertainment industry, it IS a business. That said, the people making Star Wars love Star Wars. They may not be making the Star Wars you would have made. But they are making the Star Wars that they loved.   That love absolutely RADIATES off Dave Filoni, Jon Favreau, Diego Luna, Pedro Pascal, all the artists at LFL and ILM.   Maybe what they‚Äôre making doesn‚Äôt resonate with you. That‚Äôs cool. Probably a sign to move on to another thing. If ANY franchise wasn‚Äôt bringing me joy, I‚Äôd step away and never look back.  Life‚Äôs too short, y‚Äôknow?   Maybe you‚Äôll come back to it. Maybe you won‚Äôt.   If you‚Äôre looking for permission to walk away, maybe this is that moment for you.   Wishing you peace and enjoyment on your new thing, whatever it is, sincerely.   (But also incredibly weary at having lived through 40 years of ‚ÄúStar Wars is ruined now‚Äù takes.)
There should be no down votes. Anyone that loves Star Wars should clearly see this. Kathleen Kennedy is driving this franchise into the ground.
Maybe you just outgrew it and you need something different to explore. Perfectly normal.   I realised this the moment I came out of theatres having seen The Last Jedi. I was too old and Star Wars is for children. No way around it.  Just treasure the memories you do have of the old content :)
Came here to say this. Making money is literally what they‚Äôre suppose to be doing. Lucas film isn‚Äôt a non profit and won‚Äôt exist unless they are financially successful.
That there's room for a second season (meaning that they're probably green-lit for a second season), and Filoni basically just joked that she needed to save things for their panel tomorrow (today in the UK).
And yet here you are, almost a decade later and still watching. Funny that.
For 300 bucks you can get the actor of Jar Jar Binks to send you a message on Cameo. That‚Äôs about as good as I can find.
I know of the character but haven‚Äôt seen Rebels and only saw the first few episodes of Clone Wars.  I‚Äôm positive that I will have no trouble following the show.  I‚Äôm more excited about her show than the Acolyte, by far.
Maybe a few things should be known...like what Fulcrum is and Ezra's radio message at the least
Forrest Gump of Star Wars. Impossible to kill but doesn't have any effect on the overall story.
I highly recommend watching both series. There are lists you can find online that have the ‚Äúessential‚Äù episodes, if you don‚Äôt feel like watching 11 seasons. But you‚Äôll get a much better appreciation for the characters who are going to be in Ashoka (especially Rebels).
Yet the world still knows and adores Forest Gump. Sounds like a win for Ahsoka to me.
So I'm not wrong
These bounty hunters mustn‚Äôt be able to aim for shit with barely any room for their mouse and no surface other than a semi reflective inconsistent wooden table
The mando blaster photo. I must have that link!
Oh wow that's such a cute setup for you and your wife. Wondering where Embo is but otherwise looks gorgeous.
Wooooo buddy. my wife doesn‚Äôt game much but when she does she‚Äôll break out the mouse pad. Also we both play with super high DPI. Works just fine. Lol.   I also use a mouse pad when I game but I hate the look otherwise.

I want my own little war criminal, this is great.

About 1/6 scale I assume? If not, I think it‚Äôs close‚Ä¶ which means it will be a perfect fit right next to any Hot Toys 1/6 12‚Äù figures. Definitely getting it here.
I NEED this. Love Chopper.  Can you pre-order it from anywhere or is there a street date?
Korbanth are the best IMO
Price range would help.  Neopixels range from less than $100 chinese cheapos to $1000 or more custom tricked-out replicas.   What are you looking for in a Neopixel?
[A little of his story using the star wars narrator's voice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCe3dKDQXCM)  [Dreamer Voice with Clone Wars voice](https://i.imgur.com/vqHf9cc.mp4)
Yooo how did you do this?
A 3d printer. I could have used a clone trooper toy and just added in the details and the paint job but it was simpler to just print a figure.
Probably a bit of a hot take, but I kind of hope not. I was never really a big fan of the protosabers in Legends.
If we're going off the same basic timeline the EU used for lightsaber history i'd rather they stick closer to that where something like lightsabers existed already but were ceremonial things that arent practical to use versus actual weapons they imbue power into.  Even protosabers just seem tooo.. modernish for 25,000 years ago.
What if one of the final moments of the movie is The ignition of the first lightsaber.
Personally I'd actually rather see no sabers. I wanna see vibroswords.
It depends if Disney and Hasbro thinks they can make money off of the belt and saber combo.
If you go into the Path of the Jedi, the first Jedi used Force Forged Swords.
I mean it is kind of a dumb design but that's kind of to be expected of the first lightsaber
That would be cool, they could use some kind of other weapon for most of the movie to show how long ago it was.
It will. They will 100% make a black series saver and im probably gonna buy it
Or it could be just the force and blasters
I'd be more interested in what the fan community and 3rd party lightsaber makers come up with .
Oh good point
Tem can only do so much
Doubtful maybe cameos when they have their helmets on
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôd be necessary tbh. Not to mention that they‚Äôd be pretty old during the whole Mandoverse timeline, and it‚Äôd probably be pretty challenging to have Tem play 5 or so very physically unique clones in the same show. I absolutely adore TBB, but I think it would be best if they stayed in animation tbh.  That being said, they could definitely pull it off if only one member made an appearance, but again, idk how well that‚Äôd fit into the story. Definitely hope we see Omega in live action sometime though!
I'm sure Omega will, idk about the rest
It's hard to do with Temura being so old.  Unless they can deep fake him somehow.
PLEASE!!!
Obviously you can cast different dudes as the Bad Batch. They're not identical so they don't have to look like Tem.  If you cast Temuera Morrison as Echo (since he's the only one who's technically a "Reg"), the rest of the Batch (aside from Omega) would have to be played by actors of a similar age; which makes sense as clones age quickly. Calvin Tuteao could be Crosshair. Maybe Cliff Curtis as Hunter? I dunno. Honestly I'm not sure who could play Wrecker aside from The Rock (he's not Maori but he is Polynesian, and he's old enough to fit in with the others while still young enough to be in the kind of shape Wrecker would need to be, but god only knows if he could pull off the accent).  If the actors for the rest of the Batch are roughly that age then the actress for Omega would be... I dunno, late teens early twenties? Drawing a blank there; I'm not a casting director so I don't stay on top of who the up-and-comers are.
Plus, deepfake technology, even since they used it in Rouge One for Tarkin, has come a long way. I‚Äôm sure they can use that to add a more Clone-like appearance.
Bob the Jedi!
Can I start the ‚ÄúFuck Pong Krell‚Äù line in here?
Is Pong Krell not an extremely memorable villain and suitable nemesis to the 501st? I know he's not *likeable*, but he's a villain; he's not supposed to be.
Fuck yeah you can. Fuck Pong Krell
/r/fuckpongkrell
I think whether a character fits here has less to do with whether or not they filled their roll well, but rather how much the hate for them has reached meme level status. And Pong Krell definitely has a meme level hatedom.
I thought of Kotor with the orange/ bronze blades yeah, but KOTOR 2 has my favorite Saber customization options anyway, so I always think of KOTOR.  Double checking the [Wiki](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Heart_of_the_Guardian) it appears both Jedi and Sith few this crystal favorably and of a legendary status to their respective sides.
Yeah, the colour doesn't imply much about the characters going off of the non-canon KoTOR stuff, if the Mantle of the Force appeared it could be something to do with the Light and Dark sides of the Force. Chances are that it'll just end being another subtle KoTOR reference, some sort of Revan reference would be great ü§û.
"The only thing I'm surrounded by is fear and dead men."- Vader
That one panel where Vader learns from Boba Fett the identity of the pilot who destroyed the Death Star.
This would be amazing. The one thing I want from Star Wars is more Maul.
The scene where Vader is surrounded by a Rebel army, and he proceeds to demand their surrender. The army refuses, then...think the Rogue One scene x 10000.
 Vader inside the dark side dimension
Is Grievous just there?
What series of comics is this from? I assume Maul.
If we ever get a live action Vader show they better include that scene
Yep. Same first thought.   The story from ‚ÄúVader Down‚Äù as live action would be the most bad ass thing ever.
Pretty much any scene that makes Force Uses more than melee fighters in combat would be absolutely amazing. Avatar the last Airbender shows of more if what a Jedi should be able to do than what the movies depict.
That would be awesome, such a pivotal moment in Vader‚Äôs life.
Me too, seeing Maul and Dooku fight Palpatine and Greivous in live action would be insane.
That one left me with a lot of questions, I‚Äôd like to see that in live action too
I think he fights Dooku in this scene (is it still called a scene if its in a comic book?) but yeah if I remember correctly in that panel he‚Äôs just kinda standing there while Palps talks some shit
It‚Äôs Darth Maul - Son of Dathomir (2014) #4.
I wanna see sam witwer in maul makeup
I'm sorry, was this a Star Wars commercial or footage of The Departure in The Leftovers
That is still a beautiful game
When the rapture happens I'll be sure to thank EA
I fuckin loved this game
Can't believe this came out even years ago.
Wasnt too bad. But the VW one with the kid pretending to be Vader!!!!   https://youtu.be/eGZNocni6zE
Battlefront (2015) > Battlefront 2 (2017)  Battlefront 2 had some cool content, but the *feeling* and atmosphere of Battlefront 2015 was absolutely incredible and unrivaled.  2015 was way more cinematic and immersive. The Scarif and Death Star DLCs especially remain some of the greatest experiences in gaming.
Oh god, they're all dead! They died like Jedi but they're still dead! So much death. So much senseless loss. /s
I don't get the hate for this game. I thought it was awesome when it first came out! Now it's years later and my 6 year old plays it sometimes lol
Anna Kendrick in a Star Wars commercial? I didn‚Äôt see that coming. But great ad nonetheless.
Never seen it but fun
Star Wars fans during The Snap.
Is this game still active on PS4? God I do miss this game. It was blast tbh. The launch was a joke lol from I remember it was hella pay to win type stuff. But gameplay wise and visually. Great
I need to go play some bf2 multiplayer‚Ä¶.
Too bad the game was shit.
This trailer made me hype for EA Star Wars Battlefront 1, which made my disappointment of the game all the greater.
If only that game was good as well.
IDK if you should promise kids that heaven is full of endless videogames..
Never saw that before. Thanks for posting it.
Dang everyone on that server playing naked AF.
I didn't remember that commercial and until I saw the gameplay, I didn't know what it was going to be advertising.   I thought it was something like, using Star Wars as a way to promote suicide prevention or something.   Turned out much less dark than where my head was going.  Beautiful game. Gameplay was meh.
One day video games will be like that, put on a headset and enter the battle.
Oh if I could just blink out of existence like that. How sweet it would be...
I never saw this commercial. Was it for movie or game? I was confused when i watching first minutes and later woah
I think [APB reloaded executed the same concept much better](https://youtu.be/6XS495HftQ8). This just looks like a rip-off of the biblical rapture.
Nah, the one with the guy stuck at the office, reminiscing about his Star Wars childhood with his best friend, and then rescued by that same friend in the X-Wing, was much better.
This was a masterpiece. Gave me so many memories, I realise now, were the good old days. I would give anything to get back in 2015 just for one more day..
Oh. Thank god it wasn‚Äôt a bunch of Star Wars fans appearing in a strange universe, naked and afraid. Pleasantly surprised.
And such a great game too
You say ingenious, I say oddly terrifying.
Came to say the same.   Great show !
That show was pure emotional torture porn like wtf.
Lol you must be thinking of a different game, the game didn‚Äôt even have anything from the Prequels era, how you gonna remake a game 10 years later with half the content missing from the original  Ass
I can completely imagine some church making the exact same commercial about their hokey religion.
Odd, right?
üòÇüòÇ
üòÇüòÇ
People wanted something more like the OG battlefront 2
Not enough content at launch  Only 4 maps and no space battles  The completed game is pretty great and a good nod to the OT, but most people had already quit by then
I hated the sequel and it sucks that nobody plays this anymore. I really miss the deathstar dlc.
Reading comprehension is not your strong suit.  Bozo
Star Wars got that covered
*See 'The Leftovers' on HBO for that.
Somehow
Luke is the biggest question they need to address, I assume they're going to put him in the Filoni film, and that's a big budget chunk to make him look good.   Din, Grogu, all them with Thrawn will be simple. I assume Leia will be indirectly mentioned along with Han, but wont pop up and they'll talk about how they're busy with other stuff, new parents maybe.   Luke is the biggest question, because if he's not a big part of that fight they need to explain why. It can be something as simple as he's still scarred from the OT, but they can't sideline him for Thrawn without saying why, IMO.  Leia is easy, she's got politics and Ben. Same with Han, he's got other stuff. Thrawn is a Jedi level threat though, it's like having Thanos pop up and not having the Avengers show up if Luke doesn't come out to fight.
Yes, and they will make the OT look stupid and incompetent.
The Grogu clone stuff will probably tie into Snoke's creation.  Yeah it was announced Filoni and Favreu are doing a movie to tie up the Mandoverse, so it'll be everyone teaming up (probably not Luke, though he'll show up in a cameo) to beat Thrawn. Thrawn will be introduced in Ahsoka, but will presumably wont be the main Villain and will lead into the movie.
Sequel trilogy is 25 years after Mando starts, so the only real connective tissues will be the cloning and maybe the creation of Starkiller base.
Earnestly I assume the end game is shipping them beyond the outer rim to fight the threats beyond that are bigger than this pitiful vanity contest between sith and Jedi.
I still hold out hope the events of the early 90s Thrawn trilogy can still happen and Ahsoka and crew fight a Dark Jedi under Thrawn. The Thrawn trilogy with Luke, Han, Leia, etc. is just too good to give to Ahsoka.
Palpatine has returned
They have to recast. He looked really good in BoBF but you could tell they had to hide the limitations and cut away when certain lines were being said. Unless they have some incredible new tech in development it‚Äôs just not ready. And even if it was I‚Äôm not sure how I feel about it in a movie. A cameo on a show is one thing.
Could do deep fakes for han and Leia like they did with Luke in Boba fett
Just recast! And how was he scarred by the original trilogy!? He was hopeful and saying thanks to the force ghosts!
"Here's the real important battle that really defeated the Empire that wasn't in the movies and Ahsoka was there but also it didn't actually save the galaxy."
Thrawn will likely be the main villain of the whole Mandoverse
Cause that‚Äôs what Star Wars fans want, like being nothing but a bitch riding saddle
They can only improve.The improvement from mando season 2 finale to book of boba fett was very noticeable.Give it a few more years and they can nearly perfect it
Wha-huh? Luke looked amazing and twice as good in Boba as he did in Mando and the technology only gets better with time. It doesn't stay the same or get worse.
Getting a genuine performance out of a photorealistic deepfake or cgi character is incredibly hard. You could argue Avatar is the only one to really do it, so maybe Disney can utilize that technology.
He looked great, but the deepfake technology used still has limitations in terms of performance. If you notice, they cut away during certain lines or show the back of his head, and all of his lines are very calm and stoic. Basically what I‚Äôm saying is if they needed him to do a scene where he shows a lot of emotion, it would be really difficult and would risk falling into the uncanny valley. You can get away with it in a cameo appearance on a show, but it would be risky for a big budget movie. They‚Äôd have to be really confident in it, or borrow tech from James Cameron for a really convincing CGI character.   Or just recast.
Possibly.They don't have to be a huge part though.Have han and chewie lead a space battle with hera.Have Leia be on coruscant or hiding with Ben until the conflict resolves
rofl at borrowing tech from Jim. Dude spent a billion dollars and took 13 years to make a sequel that looks exactly the same as the first one.
That would be the way to do it. Zeb gives me a little hope. His cg was amazing. The head turn was perfect, even the muscles twitching on his head. But he‚Äôs a non-human and was on screen all of 30 seconds.   I just feel like it‚Äôs too big of a risk. Less than perfect versions of the core characters would be bad.
Yes, he did do that, and both movies look fucking amazing. Not sure what your point is here.
Yeah that was motion capture.Idk if that's possible with a human playing another human but who knows
There‚Äôs de-aging (Kenobi flashback), deepfaking (Mando/BoBF Luke) and performance capture (Rogue One Tarkin and Leia). All very different processes. I‚Äôm sure if they want to use the legacy characters they‚Äôre going to test out all of these.
There is no ‚Äúnew trilogy‚Äù at this point.  Three separate stand alone films, each taking place in a different era.
The ‚Äúfirst jedi‚Äù movie feels like it‚Äôs intended as a soft reset on the Old Republic era. Could be a trilogy or start a trilogy after a time jump to the Mandalorian wars or something else they cook up.
Alright go ahead and give LucasFilm a call and let them know.
The first of the new movies appears to be Dawn of The Jedi, which explores the origins of the Jedi
They'll get there. The pretty much bookmarked it's place in canon now so they will come back to it later.   The Mandoverse is the main focus right now and with it leading to a movie I am all for it
I think it's cool they're moving forward with the timeline.
Seems like the idea is to throw out movies and see what sticks, essentially.  A better idea tbf.
Idk about that.His film sounds more like a one off.Ild republic stuff was like 1 to 4 thousand years before phantom menace.His story takes place 25 thousand years before phantom menace
That‚Äôs my theory on it, since the timeline they announced actually mentions the old republic
The First Jedi film is set before The Old Republic era. In an era called Dawn of the Jedi
In legends, yes, but they don‚Äôt have to craft it like that in the new canon. Luke said ‚Äúa thousand generations live in you now‚Äù so they just have to determine exactly how long a thousand generations is.
I know, that‚Äôs why I said what I said
Read it twice, it's pretty low for me. The Eckstein audiobook added some good points though
When does it take place?
Just started reading Thrawn and picked up Dawn of the Jedi. Excited to read these!!
I love this one! great read
How is this? When does it take place? I really into the novels but haven‚Äôt gotten to this one yet.
Is that book canon?  I need to read it either way.
What are some of your favs? I might have to make this a habit. I‚Äôm usually reading non-fiction
I happen to think that EK just isn't a good writer. Though her Queen trilogy, imo was much better than Ahsoka
I believe it almost exactly a year after Order 66!
Between 3 and 4. I don't recall an exact date
Thrawn was EXCELLENT! Just ordered Dawn or the Jedi myself, will be starting it after I finish ‚ÄúThe Queen‚Äôs Shadow‚Äù.
Ehh, that's tricky. It was canon when it was released but that was before Disney+. Between Clone Wars S7 and Tales of the Jedi, most of this book doesn't really work in canon anymore. Still great tho.
Not him, but Lost Stars and Thrawn are both excellent
- All of the High Republic series - lost Stars - Catalyst (RO prequel) - From a Certain Point of View books - Bane trilogy - Revan & Deceived books from the Old Republic  - Padawan (obi and qgj book)  Those are my top tier books
Yep. 18 BBY, at least some of it takes place on Empire Day (exactly one year after RotS).
Cool I will give it a read thanks
Lost stars is definitely one of my favorite too
Are there two books around Obi-Wan and Quo-Gon? I recently read Master & Apprentice and loved it, didn‚Äôt realize ‚ÄúPadawan‚Äù was about the two of them also! Any info you‚Äôd be willing to share?
Rebels is great and it's a show that gets better as it goes on. The best part about it is the characters, they really feel like a tightly knit family and you come to care about all of them.
It's my favourite Star Wars story I think, it's really well done and the characters are all great. I love when they lean into lore stuff, especially in later seasons.   Enjoy the rest of your viewing experience, hopefully it holds up for you and you love it as much as many of us do. It's so much fun seeing these characters pop into other stories.
If you have plans on watching the Ahsoka series you are going to need to watch rebels
If you're hooked after only a few episodes then you're going to FUCKING LOVE Seasons 2 through 4. Holy shit. It's amazing. It's epic. The Ahsoka series is basically Rebels 2.0.
Oh man you don‚Äôt even know the half of it. Rebels didn‚Äôt catch me immediately but I‚Äôm SO SO glad I stuck with it because it gets better and better the further in you get
I hear season 1 is weak. And it picks up well after that.
I'm in the same boat. I've been a sw fan since the 90s but never wanted to watch CW or Rebels. Well after Ahsoka appeared onscreen I felt like I had to.   Im in the final season of Rebels and i must say its perfect timing
Perfect time to start it tbf with Ahsoka now looming on the horizon.
Watching the Ashoka trailer had me wishing I hadn‚Äôt yet seen it. Enjoy the journey!
It just keeps getting better, right up to the finale!
Rebels is the best piece of Star Wars media in my opinion. It‚Äôs just embodies what Star Wars has always meant to me. Mystery, adventure, heroics, humor and darkness all in one.
As my family got deeper into Mandalorian and they introduced Ahsoka, I told my wife she is going to miss out on much of the world building, reference and character arcs the Filoni-verse was creating. By season 3, my son had finally started asking if we could watch SW Rebels at night and by season 4 my wife had finally told me had she known she never would have started...and that was validation.  I also told my now wife I loved her for the first time after I skipped work on premier day to see Ep 3 ROTS before she had a chance to see it with me, after I subjected her to all the  films back then. She was so pissed I didn't share that moment with her that I knew she was the one.
I loved every single episode and have watched the entire show through 3 times.
Absolutely agreed. I don‚Äôt think there any greater character development in Star Wars than what the Ghost crew receives. My favorites in the franchise next to the likes of Maul, Boba and Mando.
That‚Äôs what inspired me to start. Reading the thread on the trailer made it clear I needed to her know some characters!
I agree. Not a big fan of Season 1 but OHMYGOSH is it worth it for the following seasons.   Then again, I feel similar thoughts about the TCW. First few seasons I could do without, but the ‚Äúno-filler‚Äù list helps
Yeah: season 1 ain‚Äôt particularly strong, but I‚Äôd still watch it the full way through it does a solid job of introducing and getting us to learn all the characters and overall still has some solid ass moments.  Season 2 really picks things up, and by season 3 the series is absolutely must watch Star Wars TV.
Perfect time to launch into the re-watch!
If you watched the episode of Mandolorian with Ahsoka in season 2 Ahsoka asks where Admiral Thrawn is. That's a reference to rebels
you dont have to enjoy or even partake in ever single material they put out, it doesn't mean you arent a fan
You're still a Star Wars fan. You don't have to be head over heels in love with everything in the franchise. Especially such a vast one as SW. Maybe take a break, explore some of your other fandoms and come back to it.
It it doesn‚Äôt spark joy, then move on to something new.   I‚Äôm loving the new stuff. But if I wasn‚Äôt, I‚Äôd move on and not look back.   I used to be the biggest fan of Star Trek you ever met.  But then i didn‚Äôt like the shows post-DS9.  I just stopped watching them.   Every new show, i try a couple episodes and see if i like it.   Strange New Worlds is the only one i like, so i watch that.   Am i still a Star Trek fan? I guess I‚Äôd say yes.   But like anything, there‚Äôs stuff that speaks to me, and stuff that doesn‚Äôt.   Like all art, really.
You don‚Äôt have to love everything. As we learned today with the new announcements, there are lots of different types of stories to choose from. Some people love all of it, some love only parts of it. We‚Äôre all Star Wars fans just the same.
If you want to be. It's up to the individual to declare themselves a fan or something or not. I don't know what it is about Star Wars that make people feel differently, but it's really not that complicated. Star Wars is like anything else that's designed to entertain, it's basically just a hop on/off bus. Jump on when you want, jump off when you want, it's your call.  If you're not enjoying the view, then simply hop off for a while. You can always come back if/when it gets better, and if you find a different bus you want to hop onto instead, then don't feel bad about it, that's just life.  I've hopped off the Star Wars bus and put my fandom on the backburner when it's a slow release cycle or I'm busy with other things in life, it's not a big deal. When things happen and I have more time, I jump back in and get hyped and all that with everyone else.
I watched Lucas Star Wars and abhor Disney.  Only you can make that choice.
Do you like a Star Wars movie, show, or any other piece of media? Then you're a Star Wars fan. Not enjoying recent material doesn't mean you aren't a fan.  I'm a big fan of the MCU. I haven't really watched any of the shows since Moon Knight and I skipped Eternals. Doesn't mean I suddenly don't like all the other movies.
You're still a fan.  I kinda pulled away from Star Wars outside of watching the Force Awakens for years.  Didn't really get back into it until right before TROS came out.  I've even struggled a bit getting started with Bad Batch and Mandalorian this season.  Sometimes our interest in our hobbies come and go.  We bounce around a bit.  Doesn't mean you can't pick it up later.  Also with something big like Star Wars, you don't have to enjoy every single bit of media.  You have lots to choose from.  Some people like the Jedi, others the Mandalorians, still others the mechanics of ships and war, etc.  May try focusing on the parts you know you like.  But don't force yourself.  Again, we all get burned out and sometimes we just need a little break before coming back.
I‚Äôve never watched Resistance and still consider myself a fan. Good point.
Picard S3 has been perfect. I didn't like the middle section of S2 at all, and I did enjoy S1 while a lot of people didn't. But S3 has been absolutely choice.
Resistance is weak as fuck and pure little kid shit, and completely unneccesary and disconnected from everything else other than that it takes place in the timeline of the sequel trilogy.
What did they change? Watched 2 episodes of Picard s1 and hated it.
Not sure what you're asking really, respectfully. But each season has kind of felt singular. S3 has been the reunion of all the TNG Enterprise-D crew and yeah, it's cool as hell. There's Changelings mucking about and fucking shit up. In S2 they time traveled back to present day Earth and it was boring and went in circles but I still thought the season wrapped up in a fun way. It's all subjective. I'm a huge Trek fan, and I love Discovery too, which a lot of people also hate. Yeah, it's woke as fuck and they're all up in their fee-fees crying a lot, but I still enjoy the hell out of it. SNW is basically a perfect modern version of TOS.  DS9 is still my all-time fave.
WTF!?!? This would have been much better!  BTW, for those who don't wanna watch a separate hour-long video to find out what Dooku said to make Anakin mad, it was >!that he was the one who sent the Tuskens to kill Shmi.!<
This is so much better. What the hell, why would you change this?
I like how he drops his saber and how fast he grabs it again.
Palpatine vs windu and the council jedi was also supposed to be better
Damn that would‚Äôve been sick
Did Hayden Christensen really do all those stunts?!? üëÄüëÄ
How long until someone CGI's this whole clip into a 'final' version for youtube?
I am glad this didn't happen  Count Dooku toyed with Obi-wan, defeated Anakin definitively, and held off Yoda for a while  For him to utterly get murked by Anakin is just anticlimatic  I prefer the current fight where he's shown to be a near-Vader level threat who can still defeat a Light side Anakin and Obi-wan together, but once Anakin goes full Dark side, he defeats Dooku  It also lends weight to why Anakin was seduced by the dark side
I gotta say though its not a very Dooku fighting style
/u/savevideo
In my opinion they didn't show Anakin's pimp hand enough.
Honestly having some kind of connection between Dooku and the Death of Shmi is the one of the greatest mistakes in Star Wars. Throughout fiction the story of don't kill for revenge is regurgitated, and it was a particular storytelling moment between the two characters that was lost.  Honestly if Lucas wasn't trying to shoe horn Tattooine into the story to explain why Luke is there, there was so many better places to go story wise. Ultimately Uncle Owen could have been a loyal Naboo Guard who decided to keep one of Padme's children safe and it would take 5 minutes to show.
Thanks for this lol. It would've taken the narrator the same amount of time to say this as it did for him to plug his hourlong video that I have no intention of watching.
Might it be because the actor wasn't so young anymore. The guy that played Count Duko was very old
Rey does the same thing when fighting the Praetorian Guards with Kylo.
The Arya Stark special.
According to Ewan, Hayden actually created his own move/s.  [They both got very good](https://youtu.be/VlRQYGrM4Do)
I think it was intended as a parallel between Tyranus and Vader, insofar as both of them intentionally caused visions for the hero by torturing the hero's loved ones, provoking the hero to rash action.
In the behind-the-scenes video for the dooku-yoda fight Christopher Lee said that a stunt double did most of the actual lightsaber fighting. It would totally have been possible to do this I think.
‚ÄúThe guy‚Äù  Dawg
Not even close, she drops it to the other hand with such a slow ass timing too. This fight flows so well, he leaves it in place, dodges the arms chop and goes back without skipping a beat.   Also Idk why they went for sparks when lightsabers collide in the new shows. The slight flare gives it so much more weight imo.
Yeah I thought that was pretty common knowledge. They just pasted Lee‚Äôs face onto the guy for the wider shots.
He didn't base the movies on any books?  The story is movie original, any books are adaptions of those movies.
If I remember correctly the books are based on the movies or the movie scripts. They were written after the movie was filmed but not yet released. Movie tie-ins.  Id check Amazon for them.
Oh but which were the original books?
the movies are the original, the novelizations are novel adaptions of the movies and share the same name as the movies.
Yeah ill check amazon for em i hope i can find them thbx for the help
YouTube grifters with their garbage takes starting early.
I see the "you have to hate this or you're not a REAL Star Wars fan!" whining has started early.
It's hilarious how mad people get over this
If I had a dollar for every time someone dropped a bad take and alleged they spoke for ‚Äúaudiences‚Äù and ‚Äúthe fans‚Äù, I could buy Star Wars!   Obnoxious.
No way in hell I‚Äôm clicking on that
And here come the haters already crying about Rey‚Äôs return. Want some cheese with that whine?
Can we ban mentions of these guys please?
I loved Rey‚Äôs character and I can‚Äôt wait for this movie. The sequels had issues but Rey was not one of them.
YouTubers and shitty clickbait videos, name a more iconic duo
Really? This announcement made me the most excited. I've also seen a lot of excitement online.
You know that's bs
yall are so mad lol
It's easier to get clicks and views with hot takes and negative reviews.
If you hate SW so much then why do you care? Just leave. I don't follow things I hate.   You just want to spread negativity and false rumors
The "fans" feeakout reactions when this movie comes out and does good numbers (as long as it's well written) will be hilarious. Keep crying.
The sequel movies were garbage, and Rey's poorly written character was a big part of that, but she has to be in any films set in the near future. And she's a good actress, if you just give her some good lines to say, there is no reason to think these movies can't be good. But I hope this time they actually plan the movies ahead of time as a set rather than handing them off to different teams that dismiss the plot of the movie before theirs.
The Last Jedi turned me off from Star Wars completely.
Odds are none of these movies will get made.
If they don't like it, they can always turn to Star Wars Legends verse (where the Sequels never happened at all)
The way I see it they still have the option to turn and stick with Star Wars Legends verse (where the Sequels never happened at all)
Idk kid. Maybe we care about the story and are annoyed that Rey Skywalker palpatine is returning?
Why, because they have a different POV and opinions?
Yeah, whatever.
People lost interest because how Rey was written.If word of mouth is good even the most skeptical of fans will see it
It's Rey and the ST that's complete BS.
Maybe we care??
It's easier to take a premise, and then utterly ruin it to the point it became a cheap, soulless imitation of what came before.
I don't hate SW; I just hate the ST and everything that came after it.   You're in denial about the current state of the franchise, which has continued to receive diminishing returns.
>The Last Jedi  2nd best Saga entry after Empire. Crazy opinions some of ya'll have. JJ is the one who negated all the cool shit Rian did. And I like JJ!
This isn't a stockholders meeting. This stuff is already in development.   Although I'd still be surprised if they released a sequel with Rey, especially if it's only one movie
A loss of $30b at the B.O. will not make Disney/Marvel happy.  Let me know how you think about that one.
Lol
Because there‚Äôs nothing constructive. All of it is the same rage baiting incel stuff, like dude it just got announced fucking chill out before you start hating on it.
A logical reaction to something that shatters you narrative.
Why are you being so dismissive, because they have a different POV and opinions?  Oh, so you resort to condescension, instead of hearing different points of view.  Typical.
So why would she return to a character that hasn't been well-received; is it for the money? Because let's face it, she has had roles, but none have been particularly noteworthy. If anything, SW lessens her chances of being in more roles than Boyega and Issacs.
Yeah that‚Äôs why the crowd at Celebration went nuts when Daisy Ridley came out. They were so turned off they couldn‚Äôt help but scream!
Ooo good one.  Hey next time you think about posting a trash video like this just uhhh don't.  Thanks.
What Rian did was awful. Having Leia appear to be dead, then Deus Ex Machina her by Force pulling herself back to the blasted remains of the ship; despite NEVER showing that ability before in any SW media OT and ST combined!! Killed off the most potentially interesting villain in such an anti-climatic way that defies logic, having whatever-her-name-is Purple Hair Lady perform a maneuver that wouldn't be out of place in a sci-fi anime, but in SW? WTF?! Finn is utterly wasted; here was a potentially interesting character; a former Stormtrooper who could've and should've been the main character who potentially had an interesting character arc that would've been exciting to explore and emotionally connect with by being a Jedi Master; reduced to comic relief. I can clearly understand why Boyega was so disenchanted with the franchise.  So no, Rian didn't do any cool shit to SW sequel trilogy; he utterly wasted whatever cool ideas TFA set up.  In conclusion, the ST SUCKS.
Lol and those other movies were in different stages of development too and they got canceled . Just like odds are these will as well.
Cheers goggle
Oh, so you resort to petty insults, instead of hearing different points of view.  Typical.
Is it my narrative, or the narrative of Disney/Marvel?  Nobody cares about SW anymore; only the those that treasure the OT, EU, and other media that has it's heart, soul and tears, that do. The current SW and to a certain extent, The Mandalorian, have seen diminishing returns due to poor writing, character development, character motivations that make no sense whatsoever, and the firing of Gina Carano.  And Disney is laying off workers left and right.  So tell me. Who's narrative is really being shattered?
The question you should be asking is why is Disney so dismissive to its audience concerning the quality of the franchise?  I'm not being dismissive nor condescending; I'm stating the blatantly obvious that the franchise as a whole (with the exception of Rogue One) is declining in quality.
The character actually *has* been well received; by young girls.  The Rey costume has been very popular during Halloween.
The characters were well received. It‚Äôs the films in general that wasn‚Äôt, Rey was still one of the most popular Halloween costumes every year a Star Wars movie came out
Yeah just saw the video of that. The crowd fucking loved her coming on stage saying she‚Äôd be back
Sarcasm.
If anything's trash it's Rey and the ST; and it's not because she's female, it's because how the character was conceived and written. So next time Disney/Marvel thinks about creating more trash SW movies like the ST, write to them and say just uhh don't.  Thanks.
>Having Leia appear to be dead, then Deus Ex Machina her by Force pulling herself back to the blasted remains of the ship; despite NEVER showing that ability before in any SW media OT and ST combined!!  I've seen some bad takes on here, but being this mad about *the daughter of Anakin Skywalker having force abilities* has to be top 3 for me honestly.
It‚Äôs not really an insult if it‚Äôs true.
Why would anyone wanna hear this kind of shit? What about their trash opinion is so important that it warrants being posted here?
It‚Äôs been the same types of videos saying the same thing ever since Disney bought Star Wars and at this point I‚Äôm tired of it. Here you are making the same bad take literally as soon as a film was announced, I wasn‚Äôt insulting you I was pointing out a fact.
He didn‚Äôt resort to petty insults but I will, you‚Äôre mentally Ill
It‚Äôs you. You‚Äôre the one stuck in the past and ignorant of how popular the new content is.
>and the firing of Gina Carano.  LOOOOOOOOOOL.  Says everything I need to know about you to never take your opinion seriously.
> he narrative of Disney/Marvel?  What in the wide world of sports does *Marvel* have to do with this?  > Nobody cares about SW anymore; only the those that treasure the OT, EU, and other media that has it's heart, soul and tears, that do.   So is it *no one* cares or only the very precise cherry picked demographic that still cares? You're all over the place with your "argument"  > The current SW and to a certain extent, The Mandalorian, have seen diminishing returns due to poor writing, character development, character motivations that make no sense whatsoever, and the firing of Gina Carano.  Feel free to cite literally ANYTHING that would establish any of this, much less the correlation you're trying so hard to push. > And Disney is laying off workers left and right.  While still reporting revenue growth, like most other major corporations in America.
I'm not a young girl and I liked Rey. Eff the haters.
Kids in general have respond well to Rey and the whole sequel cast. At Galaxy's Edge they're always excited to meet her and Kylo.
No it‚Äôs not
...did... did you watch the video of everyone losing their goddamn minds when Daisy walked out?  People do actually like Rey, you know. What weird reality do you live in?
People were mad because she *never demonstrated those abilities in the OT*.  It comes so out of nowhere, it's like a big-lipped alligator moment.  I know movies require suspension of disbelief, but that scene has taken it too far.
Popular?   Then why aren't the new SW toys selling and sitting on store shelves?  Popular alright. Popular in the sense they're selling poorly.
The question is, can YOU cite ANYTHING that would argue if Disney/Marvel TV shows are pulling in ratings and profits?  Feel free to do so.
I did too! This film taking place after TRoS has me very excited.
What reality is Disney living in?
lol.
They are‚Ä¶.  The saltier than Crait phandom is hilarious.
> Then why aren't the new SW toys selling and sitting on store shelves?  So, toys sales are the only indicator of popularity. Got it.   But really, I'm not sure where you're even seeing Star Wars toys "sitting on store shelves" considering Hasbro has been so beyond fucked for years now, they can barely deliver product on time or in the wanted quantities for stores to maintain a stock.
I think [this](https://youtu.be/EE-xtCF3T94) will answer your questions!
> The question is, can YOU cite ANYTHING that would argue if Disney/Marvel TV shows are pulling in ratings and profits?  I mean, I havent' said ANYTHING about ratings, so not sure why you're invoking that here like its some kinda gotcha. And, again, why are you even talking about Marvel here?   But, here's a link to Disney's most recent federally filed fiscal report which shows revenue growth in not just the last fiscal quarter, but also the fiscal year overall.   https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/the-walt-disney-company-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-earnings-for-fiscal-2022/
https://www.businessofapps.com/data/disney-plus-statistics/   D+ made 2.8b, 5.2B, and 7.4b per year from 2020 to 2022 (respectively). Looks like they‚Äôre doing great after a quick google search!
Burden of proof is on if you're making the initial claim.  It's still hilarious to see the people in there replies dunk on you regardless.
The one with the rest of us.  The one that you're apparently refusing to live in with us.
Phandom? Is that what we‚Äôre calling a community of people that hate something? If so I‚Äôm in.
That‚Äôs pretty pathetic.
I was agreeing with you‚Ä¶
Kinda, in as much as that pilot had been hit and was going to crash/explode anyways, so they decided to try to take out the bridge. It wasn't a premeditated plan though, it was an act that arose from circumstance. Had that A-Wing pilot not just taken a critical hit, I expect they would have remained in the fight.
100%
He got hit and was losing control.  He was dead anyway, might as well take them to hell.
No, pilot was going to die ans did the best out of the situation. The tactic was "concentrate all fire on that super star destroyer" or something like that. So the takedown wasnt as lucky / random as it seems it was earned by high efforts
As others said the pilot was hit and said fuck it.
Maybe
I don't really see how this is a gamble - pretty safe and smart strategy imo. Covering all of their bases here.
These 3 films make some sense though, when looking at the bigger picture.   A ‚Äúold republic‚Äù era film which could lead more into that timeline.   A film in the already popular Mandoverse which not only serves as Filonis film debut, but could serve as a ST prequel.   A sequel to the ST, which could help reinvigorate interest with the ST along with Mando.   Basically make 3 different movies and see what sticks, and keep building on that.
Either way, I won't be too interested until they get Boston Dynamics involved to make 'em walk!
The current BD unit does not in any way lend itself towards a build.  I think there will be another BD variant in GE, but not a build. Using the same controller is just a good business decision as it keeps costs down.
You could customize BD-1 in the first game.
I wouldn't be surprised if this BD is a way to test demand for an rc BD. If it were to happen, I would think they'd give us our choice of body and leg colors and then head and visor shape.   Things like the controller definitely keep costs down. But I wouldn't be surprised if this was a step toward seeing if customizable BD would be profitable.
Please advise, if Dave Filoni's Ashoka shirt is on sale anywhere
If you put the last 4 episodes of clone wars together and made it a 2 hour movie it probably is in my top 3 for star wars movies. If all the right pieces are there filoni could make a masterpiece.
No Rian Johnson trilogy?
This is hard to watch knowing everything that we know that goes on behind the scenes. I feel bad for them, their brand of star wars (the one we all actually care to see) feels suppressed by the powers that be at Disney and Lucasfilm. You can get the general sense from watching how they and those associated with their projects talk about it. I would love to see what Star Wars looks like without Kennedy.
The Disney plus shows look cheap and have terrible writing. I have very little confidence in the direction SW is taking
This is who is spearheading SW no wonder it is in shambles. Age of the Rebellion and Reign of Empire covers the same time frame.
Why all the downvotes its the truth.
Yes, it can be bought in the official store on the show floor
Kathleen didn't seem to rule it out *yet* in her [video with IGN](https://youtu.be/qz6s7kvuwMc?t=260).  It's in [the sticky](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/12emwl2/star_wars_celebration_2023_megathread/).  As time goes on, it does seem less and less likely.  Rian isn't mentioned directly, but its kind of implied by the interviewer and Kathleen gives a very general answer.
We all hope not.  He's done enough damage to the franchise with his "subverting expectations" bullshit.
Serious question but was the rian Johnson trilogy ever announced? Or was it just an internet rumor? I don‚Äôt remember him every being at celebration to announce his films like the movies today. Let alone any sort of premise.
Stop.  It's happening.  Get over it.
Seems to me that he's having way too much fun with Knives Our to be in any worry to go back to Star Wars, especially because he knows the only harassment against him will start again.
>This is hard to watch knowing everything that we know that goes on behind the scenes  Can we drop the unknown clickbait drama? Look, there is plenty of star wars stuff I dislike and that I like. You can dislike the content without buying in to unsubstantiated rumors of "behind the scenes drama" which is yet to have any factual basis.  Now I'm not saying there isn't any behind the scenes drama, but I like to deal in facts. And there are there are plenty of things to be critical of without basing it on rumor.
This is such a wild opinion.
üòë
Interesting. We shall see. Crazy the amount of announced and now defunct projects in general.
In my opinion, Johnson was pushing for Star Wars to go to New places, where the issues were beyond just Jedi and Sith and their unending war, but issues if democracy and capitalism that gave rise to fascists in the first place  Johnson made a movie that visually and thematically better fits into KOTOR than it did with the Skywalker Saga. There are lines spoken by Kylo Ren theat echo the teachings if Kreia. But what he had to work with was half written derivative drivel. It's the writers job to know precisely what's in the "mystery boxes", you don't end a movie by introducing the most important character in the franchise is the last 30 seconds.  Johnson in interviews since demonstrates an insightful understanding of what Star Wars is and can be.   But hey I get not liking something star wars because it didn't go the way you wanted or expected. I dislike Rogue One because it doesn't have a happy ending  and will never watch Andor because I don't like Rogue one, and I'm tired of prequels. They're a terrible position for writing because of the massive plot armor of characters in the original story. It's why the characters of Ahsoka and the Clones are so fantastic: with few exception none are guaranteed to survive until the end unlike Anakin and Obi-Wan and the rest of the named Jedi.
Both Kennedy and Johnson confirmed he would get a trilogy and would begin work on it after he finished his work on Knives Out.  He's still involved with the ~~story group~~ brain trust.
https://www.starwars.com/news/rian-johnson-writer-director-of-star-wars-the-last-jedi-to-create-all-new-star-wars-trilogy
They didn‚Äôt mention it
I dunno what he was pushing it towards with a film that had so many problems and contradictions to an established universe.  Rian's responses on twitter to fans with "manbabies" and "assholes" and Mark Hamill looking like he was visibly ill after premiers and on record stating he disagreed with how Luke ended up just flies more in the face that he knew what it was supposed to be.  I like the Prequels fleshing out characters that otherwise you don't get much insight about in a 2 hour movie and setting things up and expanding the universe outside of just the Skywalker Saga.  Andor is great though I will admit I was starting to question what it was doing in the first few episodes and was falling asleep it paid off halfway through and ended great.
It wasn‚Äôt about expectations just flat out sucked
Where?
Nice thank you!
Why would they.  Is Rian Johnson in this video? Is Kathleen Kennedy? Why would they discuss it.
> "Rian has been unbelievably busy with Knives Out and the deal that he made at Netflix for multiple movies. I've had meetings with Rian; he's somebody that's come in as part of our little brain trust discussions along the way. He remains very committed to what it is we' re trying to do. He just literally hasn't had the time to devote. That's what I'm saying: Anyone who comes into the Star Wars universe needs to know that it's a three, four, five-year commitment. That's what it takes. You can't step in for a year and shoot something and then walk away. It just doesn't work that way. So it requires that kind of nurturing." - Kathleen Kennedy  ...  > "No it isn't true, I'm still working on the trilogy. With all due respect to the movie bros, who I'm sure are lovely kind bros with good fraternal intentions." - Rian Johnson, in response to if the rumors are true that his trilogy is cancelled  Sorry, not story group. *brain trust.
What‚Äôs next for Star Wars?
Did you watch the video? They're clearly talking about *their* projects.  Watch the video next time.
So it‚Äôs not on the radar? Interesting.
Dave Feloni and Jon Favreau are not involved in Rian Johnson's films, which have been confirmed to still be happening by both Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy only months ago.  Sit down.
Seems like it wasn‚Äôt really a confirmation. Wonder they they didn‚Äôt mention it here?
Because Dave Feloni and Jon Favreau are not involved in Rian Johnson's films, which have been confirmed to still be happening by both Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy only months ago.
First sith should be Michael fassbender unless they save him for something old republic
Ke Huy Quan. I loved his performance in Everything Everywhere All At Once. I envision the very first Jedi to be very meek and selfless to a fault, but his ability to tap into the Force transforms him.  He could pull it off so well.
Someone fairly unknown. Or Tilda Swinton. I like Tilda Swinton, but probably not Tilda Swinton.
A species that is really strong with the Force. We know that Yoda's species are strong with the Force but I don't think they will choose that species, since we already have Grogu. I am hoping for a Zabrak since they are one of my favourite species, and they seem to have a great connection with the force, and other magic.
Hayden Christensen. Seriously. Anakin was supposed to have been created by the Force right? Maybe the Force was trying to find balance by bringing back the original Jedi?
George Lucas
Andy Serkis and Ahmed Best.
Me
They should be an alien üëΩ
Why one? Could be many Jedi.
I want it to learn heavily into the fantasy side of Star Wars.
Chris Evans
It should be an alien so anyone
Fassbender would be so good as Thrawn. Do we know who Thrawn is played by yet?
Oh, yes! This would be an excellent idea.
Wow, I didn't know I wanted this so much, it would be awesome
I love this idea, it makes me happy.
Genius!
Someone unknown would be the Star Wars way and what I would prefer honestly
I have a strong feeling that it‚Äôs not going to be a white male.
If they‚Äôre casting a Chris, let it be Chris Pine, the best Chris.
Nope
Why does the race and gender of the person matter?
Nah, I prefer Evans. Pine can be the Villain.

I mean it's possible.Hard to say though because I know they probably won't show him until the show airs
