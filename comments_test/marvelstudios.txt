I’m not as invested or excited as I used to be. But Marvel are slowing down their output, which I’m hoping will bring the quality back up.  Having said that, I am really looking forward to GOTG3, as James Gunn is a pretty dependable director.
Not really. I enjoyed all of the recent movies and shows. 🤷‍♀️ I mean my only complaint now that I’m getting older, is that it’s A lot of content. But I still have hype for Deadpool and Secret wars and Daredevil… honestly they just need to space things out more then 2 months😆 but I still love the MCU, and look forward to most of what’s coming up
It’s a more common feeling than you think. I’m on the same boat. Even with NWH, it feels like they’ll just invalidate the ending and have MJ get her memory back the very next movie.  Most of my friends, myself included, are fatigued of superhero franchises in general. This goes for both DC and Marvel. Everything is becoming more and more generic imo.
i was looking at the marvel rumors subreddit and apparently ticket sales for vol 3 have been pretty bad im afraid a lot of people are starting to lose interest :(
yea i really hope guardians and secret invasion are amazing. apparently the marvels has been testing very poorly 😭
Ticket sales don’t really concern me, I just want a good story.
Yes,  it's all worth watching at least once.  Release order is also chronological order  Daredevil s3 doesn't make much sense unless you've seen Defenders
I've seen every season in the saga minus all of Iron Fist and thought it was an incredible experience. I hear Iron Fist season 2 is an improvement, though. What I did was watch a recap video of IF S1, and it made enough sense to me.
I can see it being that Scott genuinely believes (or is manipulated into believing) that they killed Kang and Kang isn't a problem anymore, so he won't warn the Avengers. I can see Loki/Sylvie being the one who comes to 616 to warn the heroes.
If that theory from New Rockstars is true, and Ant-Man came back with his family to the wrong MCU timeline that is controlled by Kang, then it would actually be the new group of Avengers who would actually save him but the person who would inform them about Kang will more than likely be Loki.
If the theory about the ending is true, he's not going to be able to tell any of them.
I think Bruce since with Tony gone he's the smartest og avenger and they would have gotten kind of close in endgame   Strange is in the dark dimension I think, and he probably doesn't really know shri all too well that we know of.  They'd be foolish not to get the word out, but hank pym is that type of foolish and apperantly so is Janet since she never told anyone about Kang and she knew about him the whole time.  Like others are saying the theory that he's trapped is pretty convincing and interesting though.
*pushes up glasses* i ThINk yOU mEaN eARtH 199999 (I’m kidding I fucking hate those guys they need to touch grass or a vagina or something)
You misspelled nInEtEen-NiNeTeY-nInE-nInE-nInE (stupidest number I've ever heard in my life)
Shit is so goddamn stupid like how about picking any number but that
Looks cool
Rock solid profit for black panther wakanda forever - definitely a win for the studio
Two of them (1&2) are going to be Avatar and Maverick, what about the other two?
Common MCU W
Finally some good news for marvel. Now I can say that I like this movie without having a sniper aiming at my head as I type this >!S.O.S. sniper is watching me!<
So the real production budget was 200M$ and not 250M$.
Namor was awesome but it’s too bad they chose the least interesting character in the franchise to carry it on. Let Angela Bassett be BP. She rules.
10. Smile - $101M  9. Thor: Love And Thunder - $103M  8. Puss In Boots: The Last Wish - $120M  7. The Batman - $177M  6. Jurassic World Dominion - $229.7M  5. Black Panther: Wakanda Forever - $259M  Probably   4. Minions: The Rise of Gru  3. Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness  2. Top Gun: Maverick  1.Avatar: The Way of Water
Probably Deadline is subtracting Tax Credits.
Personally, I always thought it made more sense for Nakia to take on the mantle. She was already built up as a badass field agent and humanitarian with a strong moral compass. Shuri should've stayed in the genius tech support role.
Literally anyone. Shuri is dreadful.
Since seeing that Do You Realise was on the soundtrack, I've been convinced somebody major will be dying in GotG3. It is the most perfect song about death I've ever heard.
Deadpool talks a lot but he wouldnt hold Captain America's shield with his cock, dude. Come on. Give him a little credit.
Why would old man Cap be in a Deadpool movie?
Come on it was funny idea man
Maybe for a retelling of the deadpool comic: “the good, the bad, and ugly” like Civil war from 2016
But it's out of character dude. It's not an Adam Sandler movie!
Well I thought it would be funny and something deadpool would do like “Oh that’s so deadpool! LOL”
Is it a Deadpool thing to hang Captain America's shield on his cancer ridden cock, tho?
ok Ok, I get it i get it, it’s a bad idea, but come on deadpools so cheeky i thought He would do it man, come on!!!
It would be cool to get a Deadpool style movie about Ronin
It would be much better if you use a better font for the characters, and six 浪人 are too much, one is enough.
Looks awesome
Before 2010-  Banner was in the wind, still hiding in Canada, i think  Thor was in Asgard  Cap was on ice  Tony was just rich  Pym had buried Pym Particles and hated SHIELD  Carol told him to contact her in an emergency only  Strange was a normal doctor  Matt wasnt active yet  Peter was 9 years old  The Black Panther was a huge secret  Basically, there was no one to recruit
Because he wasn't taking the ... initiative.
Because Ironman was the first publicly Known Superhero… that’s kinda the point of Ironman 1-2. Captain America was Frozen, Captain Marvel was off planet. All Fury had was Shield…. There was no known superhero’s
Because he was off planet
SHIELD opposed the idea because they didn’t want a group of heroes to fight them when they tried to rule the world. Remember how they were secretly Hydra? I’m sure they were pushing back on Fury’s idea for a team of powerful individuals that weren’t controlled by them.
I imagine the idea of a team like that would be difficult to run by a corrupt group of leaders, especially when Nick Fury at the time wasn't particularly high-ranking.   While yes, the big spaceship did add credence to what he says, there also weren't many people to add to this team in the first place. Most haven't been discovered / been created yet.    The only exception is Ant-Man I guess? Who has blown off S.H.I.E.L.D. and is so secretive about his stuff that most of his own company thinks it's a myth.   I wouldn't say that adds up to a good case for the S.H.I.E.L.D. board of directors.
Wasn’t the World Security Council opposing it? You know, the ones who were secretly Hydra (Gideon Malick)?  Also, other than Captain Marvel, there were no active supers known about between the 90s and 2008. So there was no one to be on the team.   Not only that, but doesn’t he mention that the Tesseract recently stated to act up? That probably motivated him to put his plan into action.  So, during that time he saw no credible threat to warrant a team, which is good, because there were no eligible members anyways.
>Carol told him to contact her in an emergency only  Strange how that entire films plot has mostly left my head, just a few flashes of scenes
Badum Tss
Probably less than half, but even that put in key position can make it seem more dangerous
You should probably do a rewatch before secret invasion then
Honestly don't think a CM rewatch is necessary. If you remember the general idea of the Skrulls and their refugee status, that Fury and Talos are allies, that's all you probably need.
I don't think I can, the only other one like that for me is Thor Dark World life is too short to rewatch something your brain finds forgettable I'll have to trust in the recap they give
Your professor would be a bad friend if he was giving out contact info to strangers. Connections are important for any job but you don’t start with one of the top dogs. It’s ok to have dreams but temper your expectations.
*You need to desist right now! Your delusions are out of hand!*
From fresh grad to executive producer for Marvel? Yeah that ain't happening lmao. You're literally dreaming if you think she will for some reason hook you up with a job. Even if nepotism is rampant everywhere, a billion-dollar company is not going to hire a 21 year old with no work experience hahaha.  The professor backtracked cos he knows it's a stupid idea to just give a random her business info.
Its good to Dream
The cringe levels in this sub keep getting higher and higher.
My uncle works at Nintendo, I can hook you up
No…because there is no opportunity. You are no closer to becoming an executive producer at Marvel because your professor knows a top Marvel exec than I am to becoming the Pope because I own a bible.
The producer is most probably Trinh Tran.  She has executive produced Infinity War, Endgame, Hawkeye and will executive produce Echo. She was also an creative executive in The Winter Soldier and associate producer in Civil War.  Before that, she was Louis D'Esposito's assistant.  She is the only female top level executive at Marvel Studios.   Unless your professor told you this a few weeks ago. Then, it may have been Victoria Alonso too, but now she's been fired.  Anyway, I say, if you like film and you can do it, then do it.  Nothing to lose.
I feel you fam. My cousin knows the Alibaba guy from when he came to my country as an exchange student and I’m still waiting for them to give me a high position there and then help me be CEO later down the road even though I have no interest in e-commerce. Very disappointing :(
What's worse is the OP's degree doesn't even have anything at all to do with movie production 🤔
It is her, but I couldn't get her contact info
Moon Knight and Daredevil would be fun because DD's probably one of the only heroes who could immediately pick up on the multiple personalities  Also watching She Hulk acting as Moon Knight's defense attorney would be a trip
Hulk and Black Bolt. Imagine having those two where one cannot speak (BB) and Hulk trying to explain things with his limited vocabulary.
More Thor and Doctor Strange!
Yelena and Spiderman
Squirrel Girl & Silver Surfer. Each episode is them investigating different planets, meeting new species/creatures, learning about the history, language etc. Determining wether it needs saving/protecting or condeming it for Galactus to consume.
In the original draft of Endgame, Wanda was supposed to survive and team up with Rocket. That would have been interesting.
Wong & Madisynn
Hela and Ego.
They did  Punisher and Spiderman thing in the 90s. It was decent. No idea what issues they were. i just remember it saying non mutant mayhem on the cover
Luke Cage and Shang Chi
I mean it might never happen, but I'd like to see Rocket pair up with Bucky. What we got in Infinity War was really cool despite only being a few seconds of screentime.
Captain Marvel and Hawkeye.   Then he keeps winning everything by shooting arrows at things and she has no idea how he ended up as the overpowered member of the duo.
Deadpool and Howard the Duck
Mordo and the Department of Damage Control--the DODC has mostly focused on superhumans who get their abilities from tech or inborn powers, but it'd be interesting to see Mordo feeding them inside information on how to hunt down sorcerers or nullify magic. It's not where I think either group's arc is headed, but in principle it'd be exciting, especially since magic combined with government intrigue isn't something we've seen in the MCU before.  Also, I'd love to see the Kingpin meet with Sharon Carter or Val, since their criminal endeavours would bring those characters together reasonably naturally (maybe Kingpin wants to turn Mac Gargan into Scorpion to hunt down Spider-Man or something like that). He's a much more intense and brooding character compared to their relatively upbeat personalities, and seeing their personalities play off each other could be fun.  And this is another unlikely combo, but Khonshu meeting Zeus would be hilarious, since they're both gods who (apart from similar levels of arrogance) are polar opposites in personality. I just want to see Zeus try and placate Khonshu by inviting him to a divine orgy.
Nebula and Kraglin 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
We will get this, but I have hilarious visions of Bucky and Red guardian
Luke Cage and Kitty Pride.
Kamala Khan and Wanda.  Wanda badly needs a family atmosphere for her mental health and Kamalas family are really welcoming and kind. Wanda could teach a lot too these days about the necessary limits of using power.
Loki and Rocket would have hilarious banter
Nick Fury and Starlord
Moon Girl and Moon Knight. I mean, they both have Moon in their name, so it’s a natural team-up.
Doctor Strange and The Punisher. I'm pretty sure they'd hate each other.
Okay now you say it, Ms Marvel and Punisher would be cool to watch. She's gonna remind him of his daughter. It'll be like his relationship with Amy Bendix
Why do I feel like they'd recreate that edited strip of Moon Knight saying "Oh fuck a lawyer!"
There is one other hero that diagnosed a split personality with his tingle.
Always wanted a fight scene between those two
Misunderstanding central here they comeA
They got along well in the short time we saw them
Two spiders, hopefully it doesn't end like in real life
You had be at Squirrel Girl.
That, sounds like a moral play and I'm here for it
Yeah, Wanda's grief would've been hard to watch though
They seem to get along really well
You mean wongers
Destroyers of the universe.
I also remember a Punisher and Archie thing that was surprisingly well received despite apparently starting out as a joke and being perceived as a joke when announced.
Well Luke works with Iron Fist so this makes some sense.
That makes it better, because we can see what it might look like.
Add Punisher and we have a great throuple
That would be hilarious. I can see it now, Hawley smugly shooting arrow after arrow and Captain Marvel's more and more confused and angry face as he beats entire armies with nothing but his sharp wit and sharper arrows.
That would be a funny film
Mordo probably is trying different methods to fight sorcerers.  Kingpin and Sharon would have a gang war over New York.  Konshu would never go to an orgy, not even sure if he has the required organs for it.
I see it, gentle giant type there
Nothing else matters until they recreate the “Random bullshit, go!” edited strip
Lol Archie like the super old comic strip character?
They partly did if I remember correctly, the motion was done but the line went unspoken.
I'm partial to [this one](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JehEH4ESaafXMyZkB88rphIsvBE=/1400x0/filters:no_upscale(\)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23387352/43604364_538583009928073_594013042396626944_n.png), personally.
Yep, the Punisher was chasing a man called the Red or something like that and he mistook Archie for him. Then the actual guy who was a weapons dealer kidnapped Veronica and Punisher and Archie teamed up and saved the day! And that makes more sense than the entirety of Riverdale post season 1. Trust me, it goes bat shit crazy
I had alot of Punisher comics when I was a kid. I kind of wish I would have read these sounds hilarious.
You can probably find either a digital or a physical copy somewhere, it was quite successful from what I've read so tracking down copies should be a breeze. Also interesting side note, there were two different versions made. An Archie styled one where the cover reassembled the standard Archie comic format, and the Marvel where it matches the Marvel layout. I just find that interesting.
I always struggle with decisions like that. Would be hard to pick which one I'd like more
It would be based off if you read Archie or Marvel more, I read Marvel more so if I had to choose one I'd take that but both would be good as a collector's piece.
It’s been announced that he will be playing the president, and not just a general.  Unfortunately, I think the Hydra angle is well worn territory.  It’s not likely that will be returning.  If anything, the other global factions will be at play.  We have the Ten Rings, the rogue Black Widows, the Power Broker, the Skrulls, and Baron Zemo, not to mention Talokan and Kang and any other new threats that will get announced.  I think they chose Ross because he will be trying to introduce his own peacekeeping force in the Thunderbolts.
>I mean think about it. Ross has been constantly talking about making a super serum for his soldiers to make an army of Captain Americas.  Captains America, thank you. Like Attorneys General or Surgeons General.
I think there's a simpler answer: MCU Ross has been portrayed more as one of Cap's enemies than Hulk's.
No.
Maybe you're right. Didn't take this into consideration  that Bucky , who was supposed to be a part of the Thunderbolts, will take part in any missions that smells like HYDRA.
Understood.
The BTFE Program that Ross was put in charge of in 08 Hulk was to recreate the super soldier serum and Leader was intrigued about that aspect of Bruce. Hence why Leader had that reaction when Bruce would insist that he wants a cure. Leader doesn't see it as a disease.  It was said that before Bruce came on, the test subject were captured terrorist.  Betty was also part of the program like Bruce. With the threats becoming more than country vs country since then, I think Ross wants Leader to create more soldiers.  I can see Joaquin falling victim to Leader and Ross work, similar to how Joaquin did with Dr. Malus in the comics as Sam had to rescue him.  Betty might be brought on because she can consult on the subject and her father is at it again.  To me, Sam vs Ross is such a great idea. Sam usually counsels those that struggle to carry on after serving. Ross continuously finds ways to keep going or is at least pulled back in.  i can see this being the soul of the conflict. Ross persistence vs Sam's patience.
Damn, this is even more jarring considering how prevalent in every one of the movies' posters, like he was (literally) bigger than Scott and Hope.
The charges haven't been dropped yet, despite Majors lawyer saying they had video evidence, so there must be more to this than it seems. And Marvel is probably waiting for the charges to be dropped, but if they aren't, they already have replacement actors on standby
Well, that’s not a good sign for him.
The real question is why is the wasp on the cover she has 3 lines in the whole movie
It would be hilarious if they somehow edited M.O.D.O.K (aka Darren) into being the main villain
So weird since he’s literally the villain
HOF bag fumble
Majors allegedly filmed his Loki 2 scenes, but there's rumors there will be multiple Kangs in there. A perfect opportunity to mix up some different actors in a movie universe that has shown it's totally ok with that.
Does digital mean Disney+?
Love how innocent his legal team made him sound stating they had video evidence and yet here we are, weeks later, and he is still being charged.  Move on from the wanker already
Marvel's likely playing it safe as they attempt to navigate this situation legally and publicly.
But he was never even in this specific poster to begin with. It came out like back in January  Edit: literally look up the imax posters instead of downvoting me when I give you the correct facts... this sub just wants to jump to every conclusion first before they look at facts
I wonder how close Disney is to cutting him loose, I wonder what they know.
They are definitely laying low on promoting him until his name is cleared. I really do wonder if they will recast tho…
even if this whole ordeal with majors is cleared up, disney has a pretty strict measure of optics on its company and property. even though i dont think he will be replaced, i think its inching closer to that
I would agree with you if Cassie, Hank and Janet weren't also absent from the image.
Is that not him at the left of Scott's head?
[He's still on the Blu-Ray cover.](https://www.marvel.com/articles/movies/ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania-digital-dvd-blu-ray)
Not saying much considering only Ant Man and the Wasp are featured at this point
You can see his outline behind ant man’s head
This is also the art for the cover of the Blu-ray. Which has Kang, Janet, Hank, Cassie, and Bill Murray. All of which are missing from this promo image.   Don’t read too much in to it
Majors can be recast.
He’s literally right behind Antmans head with his arms out on his floating platform.  *edit* shoulder
he’s edited out the movie and mickey mouse will be taking his place
Kang was never in this poster.
I feel slightly dumb, but if it says “digital only” does that mean it won’t be available on Disney+ until a later date? There is a difference, right?
Geez I wonder why
It's a single tweet and it also doesn't have Janet, Hank or Cassie. I wouldn't read too much into it yet.
Kang is to the left of Scott's inside of the light to the Quantum Realm.
I have no chill in my anticipation of owning this movie! It was incredible. It had a flaw or two but it was still awesome
They're probably gonna hold off on using Majors or his likeness to promote anything until this whole thing gets resolved (Especially since, if the allegations are true, they'll likely recast and try to make people forget about the Majors version of Kang).
It’s JOEVER 😭
Ooooohhh, shiiiit!
Hopefully this means either Kang is getting recasted or their moving up their plans for Doom. Way too early for God Emperor Doom though that's for sure but yet again Doom has gained godlike power like 6+ times so it'd be nothing new for us comic fans.   Personally though I don't want to see God Emperor Doom until like 2030 because Doom's a very complex character that needs a shit ton of development.
Absent along with the majority of the cast
I saw the same ad on another platform and it had Kang as well as everyone else. I think this specific ad just has the duo and I don’t think it’s anything deeper than that.
God this whole things sucks so fucking bad
Kevin Feige panicking right now.   "Shit! Fuck! Tits! Bring in Dr. Doom! Fuck waiting! Bring him in now!"
So only the two titular characters are shown? Shocking
It’s not called Kang: Quantumania 🤷‍♂️
I feel dumb, but why 2 hours of bonus extras?
All of the kang variants suddenly look like MCU uncle Ben
Literally called it, Marvel is gonna edit him the fuck out of everything and definitely recast him, I mean it’s easy since there’s so many variants gives Marvel as easy out and to avoid ruining their brand unlike the DC catastrophe with Ezra Miller/ Amber Heard even though those movies don’t matter anymore and they rebooted the universe, their only releasing them so they don’t lose as much money as scrapping them entirely
As someone already mentioned, Kang is still on the Bluray/DVD cover (for now). If he gets removed from that, that would be a notable story.
That's fucking stupid
He's on the steelbook release too
Seems like a lot of people are ready to move on. I on the other hand want Majors back as Kang. Not enough young male black actors out there that are rising to fame. To say, just replace him with whatever black actor you can think of is demeaning, at least to me it is. Are black actors just replaceable? There’s no talk of finding help for him, nor looking into his past to see what he has  dealt with, or if he truly has any mental disorders. He’s just guilty, no trial, no support, just throw him away.   I get it, on the surface, no one wants to publicly support someone who may have committed domestic abuse. With that said, people still support Josh Brolin, Johnny Depp, Stone Cold Steve Austin, Mickey Rourke, Glenn Campbell, Vanilla Ice, Jason Kidd, James Caan, Christian Slater, Slash and Axl Rose, Ozzy Osbourne, Tommy Lee, Sean Penn, Nicholas Cage, Charlie Sheen, Billy Dee Williams, and Terrence Howard. No need to idolize Majors, but we also don’t need to end his career because of a mistake he potentially made.   He’s a young gifted black actor who is crossing over into the mainstream. Not many black actors will ever get that close. I support keeping Majors as Kang. Just as those other celebrities were given a second and more chances, Majors should get his.
Where can we watch this digitally on the 18th?
Antman and The Wasp vs some one-off villian.
Wow, that's a major omission!
Is it that hard to not hit/strangle/abuse your significant other? Or at least not be accused of it?
This could've been avoided if *someone* didn't wham, bam, Kang-a-lang
Already starting to get rid of him, huh? Damn that was quick.
You don’t need to remove Kang from it! You just need to remove Jonathan Majors! Get his helmet/mask on it instead. As long as you can’t see his face it’s fine right?
Replace Kang’s remaining storylines with Ravonna Renslayer taking over, portrayed by Gugu Mbatha-Raw from Loki.
He needs to be recast
Well, Pfeiffer, Newton and Douglas are also absent here so Majors' omission isn't necessarily because of the stuff going on right now.
Isn’t it strange that Disney had no problem casting Josh Brolin as Thanos who was arrested in 2004 for domestic violence?
Hot take but it's a good thing we are gonna get a recast.  Not because Jonathan Majors is a bad actor, I think he sold the role really well and is a good fit.   But the movie he premiered was so underwhelming that there's really no way for me to associate that version of Kang with anything substantial. I mean, they really fumbled the intro of the next big bad my opinion   A recast will force them to start again with another conquering variant that looks different.   It is a perfect chance to make him much more menacing.
Only on Digital? It will not come on disc?
Americans new trend towards any accusations “Guilty till proven innocent”.
Looks like they will be recasting Majors with a new actor for Kang. It's too bad, but that's the reality if allegations are true.
Maybe they don't want to spoil lol
Will they drop majors?
Not really there is a lot of other characters not on this
Is it wrong that I kinda hope they use this as an excuse to scrap most of their future plans and start working to reboot the MCU centered around the X-Men? We lose all of the current baggage, get all new characters, and can get an all new Avengers in a decade or so.
God I still can't believe his lawyer released those texts. I swear to God she was trying to get him in deeper shit or something, how can you be that tone deaf.
The average moviegoer has no idea who the blue guy was. Will replace and 65 percent of people won’t notice and 2 percent will be vocal about it
They did this to Creed III too. JM is no where to be found on the digital promo
Ah yes, the latest movie people with GED educations think will be the deathknell for Marvel
🙄🙄🙄 please don’t recast him .. Majors killed the role
He was never on this specific poster
That heir cut looks gross on her
I honestly don’t think recent events have anything to do with that, they just wanted to have the spotlight on the heroes
jesus tapdancing christ. is EVERY fandom gonna be nothing but a loosely interconnected and endless tournament of spot-the-autistic pendant lately?   so you're more perturbed by the promo materials featuring the chars the franchise is named after instead of the prick who it turns out is just another testosterone poisoned woman beater? good for you. that's a brave stance these days. good luck and have fun w that in your feature sperg-lord rants about how the multinational conglomerate is ignoring your valuable input about how best to utilize and present their IP. i could see you having a bright future being the human answer to questions no one fucking asked.
I said it a thousand times in comments, and everyone said I was stupid. This is the beginning of the end. The kang saga is fucked.
[removed]
Kang drama don’t matter to me. I pre-ordered the steel book.
For someone who Marvel claims is "totally innocent", they sure seem like they're slowly backing away from him.
The MCU will basically die if the allegations are true against him.
When you need to sell DVDs but you don’t want to cause unwanted drama.
Hmm
Does no one see him in the light in the background?…
The daughter is noticeably absent.
LOL
LMAO
With the problems with the actor..,
I’m still disappointed at this whole situation *sigh
I’ve been curious about how Disney will handle the digital and home ent marketing, given how much of the theatrical campaign centred on Kang.  Makes sense to focus on the ant family. I wouldn’t be surprised if MODOK is given more focus too.
Wait it's not coming to Disney plus?
Oh dang, I don’t see Kang!
Who?
Kang’s silhouette is between them, on Scott’s shoulder.
Lots of posters released before the movie even came out don’t have him in it either. Just google it
That's a really bad picture lol
Yikes.
Duh
They should get Shamier Anderson from John Wick 4, dude was dope!!
Not shocking.
I didn't even know something bad was happening with Majors til I saw this post.
Uh oh....
stop please no
he's there! you can't just see him since he's in quantum size
With advanced technology he has actually been completely replaced with Wookiee
I mean, so is Cassie and she had more screen time than Hope.
Oof…only strengthening the rumor that he will be recast very soon.
Majors out.
They really need to get that video evidence out asap
So I assume it’s not coming to Disney+ on the 18?
Yeah he gone.   But it's the multiverse so they can just replace him with the Steve Buscemi variant.
Time to replace the actor with Ezra Miller.
Will MCU recast Kang?
It begins….
Burying the lede here: Blu-ray date is May 16th.
I’d like to give the benefit of the doubt since this poster is just Scott and Hope anyways but also those texts are not helpful for his case
any word on the Disney plus release?
Well it is an Ant-Man and the Wasp movie 😂
This is just a cropped version of an [existing poster](https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2023/01/18/cb98175d-6d4d-4272-a63e-9a0203d8291d/quantumania-imax.jpg?auto=webp&width=1080&height=1350&crop=0.8:1,smart) for the movie, so yeah they probably picked that poster on purpose, but it’s not like they made an entirely new one.
Rut Roh Raggy
He-Who-Tries-To-Remain-Relevant.
That's him in the back
I think it's just a stretch, everyone else is absent too.
No d+ release?
Meanwhile, from the direction of eastern Europe, a metallic-enhanced voice can be heard shouting,  "Now is the time for *DOOM!*""
*Evangeline Lily breathes a sigh of relief. *
This must be the Chinese poster.
😂
Lmao now thats a trash-ass poster
So, did Majors actually do something or is it an unsubstantiated complaint?
This makes sense when you consider how hard Janet worked to not tell anyone about the timeline conquering threat she discovered and just hoped would sort of…stay tiny
It's the IMax poster. I think it Kang coming out of the portal in the back. He is heavily whited out, but still there.
He’s literally the entire background, just blurred. You can see his eye on the right and the edge of his mouth below
He's still on the front cover though
Well I see Ant-Man and the Wasp at least
It was in theaters?
That’s cause it’s not called Kangs adventure in the quantum realm
He's right there above Scotts shoulder dude
Let's go!
The Original Poster is the same basically  https://www.laughingplace.com/w/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/new-ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania-posters-released-for-imax-reald-3d-and-more-1.jpeg
Hope still has that god awful haircut at least
That's what we call a professional "whoopsiedoodle". This will be such a sought after role.
Council of Ricks >
I thought Majors was innocent?
Hooooooooly….. Damn, they move quick.
YIKESSSSS
Also with Alternate ending I hope!
Wasp was barely in the movie besides popping up on like three random occasions to save Scott.
Oh just remove him from the movie, why don't ya
Get John Boyega to be recasted as Kang. Problem solved dude deserves it especially after he was treated in the Star Wars movies
He who remains in legal troubles
"Why does Kang look like Don Cheadle now?"
I read the first line really fast and thought Marvel was trying to convince me to buy Marvel Studios 💀
Great movie!
well this is a bit of a bummer for him
Probably for China.
That’s cause he only has like 2 mins of screentime
Scrap the whole Movie...SAVE YOURSELVES !!
RIP to a career
Just watched Creed III and goddamn Jonathan Majors was amazing in that movie.      If the charges are true, then he really blew it big time.
When does this hit D+
Kang was an awful villain so hopefully he’s gone
Just recast him already, he's not that special anyway.
D+ too?
These people at Disney didn't learn their lesson from Depp-Heard:  Wait until the facts are all in and the law has decided before rushing to judgement. I suspect this will be a non-issue, legally.
That’s hilarious considering he was THE draw for the movie
#I will burn them out of TIME
We'll just put the anti-vaxxer front and center instead.   &#x200B;  I really hope they haven't gotten their vision for the future screwed yet again.
Wait so was the dude actually an abuser? A lot of people were defending him in the comment when the accusations came out
I'm sorry but why is she standing like that-
So is hank, Janet, Cassie, and bill Murray
Just announce a replacement already.
It's nothing new, I saw recent releases of Beetlejuice with no Alec Baldwin on the cover
I am assuming this poster was created when there was a rumour on Jonathan Majors physical assault case.
this is how i’m finding out
Well Kevin Hart is available
I loved Kang probably the only thing i loved in that mediocre movie.  I don’t know if the court of public opinion is just flexing to ruin careers.  If they were to make any changes to this movie is for someone to fix that horrific hairstyle of Hope.
☠️
Well my dad's been preaching it to me for years but it's starting to make sense. I guess drinking really does ruin your life. This dude was basically 30. He went out one night and ruined his life.  He was the next big thing in Hollywood. Kang, Creed, and that was just the beginning. Brilliant actor done before he could even achieve greatness.
they should recast him with don cheadle
Kang is not the hero.
They should release a copy of the film where Kang is digitally removed from every scene, voice and likeness.   Why? Because I think it’d be funny to see them act against that.
Man I don’t know maybe the actor got arrested for assault or something. (I’m being sarcastic btw, I know what happened)
Are they going to edit him out of the move too? xd
Well we all know it wasn't him it was one of his variants... 😏
That and the Creed 3 marketing. Hope the rumors or media claims aren’t accurate, for a multitude of reasons of course.
This is so interesting
Hahahaha  MORDOCK and Bill Murray become the main villain, and they completely remove Kang.
Imo Kang and his army felt underwhelming in the film if we took out the actor's screen presence
As absent as he always was from that image. Believe me, I saw this every day 30ft tall passing the IMAX in Dublin.
So is Janet, Scott's Daughter, Hank, and Modok. I would't read to much into it.
This barren ass poster is actually a great microcosm of the film. It’s nothing without Kang. Marvel has big trouble on their hands
Kang with its lawyer trying to figure out how is he going to skip prison, sorry the time core or whatever.
Jonanthan Major's hand reaching towards you is not a great image right now
From hero to zero
The girlfriend tried covering up for him but since his idiot lawyers released the texts, now everyone knows he hit/strangled her.
Or they're just being cautious and not trying to promote an actor who has been in the news for the wrong reasons recently, no matter how that situation ends up playing out.  Promoting the Ant-Man in the *Ant-Man* movie should be the lowest bar to clear, anyway.
From what i read previously, regardless of circumstance, assault charges cannot be dropped in New York, not easily at least. Because so many victims retract their charges out of fear.
>replacement actors on standby  \*Terrence Howard has entered the chat\*
Yeah makes sense and it's the rational prudent thing to do
This lawyer has proven to be a shithead. Seriously I know someone has to defend criminals, but fuck his gaslighting ass
I don’t think they’ll want him back regardless of the outcome
The charged aren’t likely getting dropped. Those texts were quite damning and backfired on him greatly when he thought it would clear things up. I bet the video isn’t as black and white as they thought either.
What happened
I think people have severely overestimated the significance of that video. Even if it is in the cab and shows him not doing anything there's no indication that the Injuries actually happened there, just that the argument started there. Seems like the lawyers are saying that the video absolves him because already people are taking his side entirely based on that despite it not being released and the charges still holding.
Right decision until it’s sorted out. It’s unlikely he’s innocent at this point but I’ll wait until evidence comes out to decide how i feel about it due to my distrust of NYPD and their treatment of black folks.
What charges? What did I miss?
Yeah probably not
Not really. Until it's settled legally, Disney is just covering their ass.
It’s more of a poster than a sign.
Disney is really just avoiding any PR blowback damage from what’s going on with Majors by just not promoting him at the moment.  I wouldn’t look too much into this and just focus on his actual case (which Disney absolutely is and is making calls as it goes on).
At this stage I’d be really happy to see John Boyega get the call to replace him, seen a few people suggest that and I think it’s a great call. Especially since it can easily be explained with the whole variants and multiverse thing.
The movie really should have been called Ant Men and the Wasps.
Antman AND THE WASP: Quantumania
They had their little moment when she broke through the army of Antmans.. and then she got mad at her mom.  Yeah.. that’s about it.
Yeah Cassie or Janet would make more sense
Janette Van Dyme is also The Wasp so you know...
From my understanding she got cut from most of the movie for her antivaxx activism during post production
But she's got an new haircut!  I want it I want I wanti it
Its a lady.
They will edit in a giant MODOK in the background pasted over Kang’s face lol
And he also played a bad guy in this movie, too!
For what it's worth, most video posters I've seen for Creed III haven't had him on it either.
He's literally right beside Scotts head...
I think it just means digital retailers
Yh
Love how everyone on this sub took his lawyers baseless claims and fuckin ran with them, like there are threads just dunking on everyone because there was video evidence proving his innocence
Maybe is both, Marvel chose a poster that doesn't have Majors, given the situation he is in rn.
Nobody is arguing that they removed him from this poster. They're saying they're not using him in digital promotions
But still, they're promoting a movie's home release without advertising the generally agreed upon "best bit": Majors' performance
After the reception of the movie where literally the only positive was Majors’ performance it makes zero sense marketing would choose this poster unless they’re sidelining him.
But the narrative!
Asking a lot from Reddit with that edit
This is NOT the time or place for logic!!!  This is the time strictly for rabblerousing and your comment is completely unnecessary!  EDIT: holy hell, I either misjudged my need for the /s, or the people that genuinely react this way are out in force tonight!
They still hired Josh Brolin after his controversy and keeping Jeremy Renner around. If the charges drop they're probably gonna keep him.
Kang is the big bad. Those are side characters. Posters always have the hero(es) and the big bad and the big bad is not there.
No one else has noticed this somehow
What is this, a villain for ants? He needs to be at least 3 times that size.
Wonder if that's because the Blu-ray covers have already been manufactured so they have no choice but to go with it.
Holy shit that is terribly done.
I really want a steelbook with just kang on it i cant lie it would look so hard
How do we know that’s not Janet? 🤔
That’s obviously not what they meant
All phasers have been replaced by walkie talkies.
This is a great comment LMAO
Shocking The Wasp is there, she barely appeared in the movie.
Deleted scenes, interviews, BTS etc.
...that actually looks like Terrence Howard.
Disney plus?
Or maybe there is also an ongoing investigation on them as well!!! ... I know the exit.
And Jeremy Renner was accused of domestic abuse too
…are you seriously not getting why a current domestic violence charge is getting more attention than a random arrest 8 years before brolin took the role?
We don't know they're gonna recast yet
Yeah which is why Kang was the focus of nearly all the trailers lol
No, actually he wasn't.
Was he?
Source?
If you think a lawyer making a statement in defense of his client counts as exoneration our jails would be empty. I think you need to revisit the meaning of that word.
He wasn't.
His lawyer claims they have testimony from the driver exonerating him  In no way, shape, or form is that “exonerated”. This is coming from a defense attorney putting out PR statements.  What else is he gonna say? “Oh yeah, my client is definitely guilty”?  That said, Majors is entitled to the assumption of innocence until proven guilty. We haven’t seen any evidence to support or contradict his claim of innocence.
I mean he wasn’t. The only evidence we’ve seen is texts which sounds like an abuse victim trying to justify their abusers behaviour- I shouldn’t have grabbed your phone was said in order to justify his hands around her neck- that is no way near a justifiable reaction
tf? Marvel hasn't said a single thing about his arrest.
Dramatic much? They can recast the role if it comes to that.
They might have al least two very good alternatives for recast, not including Terrence Howard.
Well I’ve got bad news for you….
"It has... Begun!" - Shang Tsung
Ezra Miller retreats quietly.
Something happened, a woman received injuries to her head and neck, and Majors was present.  The victim later tried to take responsibility, and said she instigated the attack by Majors.
This ain’t no ink blot test bro….
Johnny Depp called, they don't fucking care.
It's what's happening with Loki 2
He seems like a great guy but I don't think he's a very good actor. I'd prefer Lakeith Stanfield if race/age has to be the same.
April 18 possibly
Can ruin or save you. One DWI and a catching myself drunkinly driving backwards on the wrong side of a highway saved my life. Straightened my ass out.  I could have killed others and myself. I learned my lesson and been straight shooter ever since. I'm so embarrassed about drinking. Even 20 years later.  I hope he gets help, if things are true (based on texts kind of acknowledging he did rough her up, then he need to help himself). Consequences.
Block his face with added lens flares
There's nothing about Kang as a character that can't be swapped out for a different actor. They don't even need an explanation because it probably wouldn't even be another 3 or 4 years before the next time the character would be needed in a movie so plenty of time to forget. If they really did want to give an explanation, they just say "variant" and problem solved
Majors hasn't done anything as kang that can't be replicated by another actor that isn't a potential abuser, it'll be awkward for a year whatever happens but it'll settle eventually.  Despite all the grindelwald controversy i don't think I heard anyone even mention the change in casting when it actually came out beyond "oh yeah mads was good"
No they dont.  Kang is a character.  A strong enough actor can replace Majors.   They've replaced other character's actors with little explaination.   I made a comment about how Kang's situation as a multitude of variants can *actually help* with his replacement.   Easy peasy, a "ripple" occurs across the timelines, changing the Kangs.  They blame the MCU Avengers, and vowing to destroy them.
They've made Kang go down due to such stupid planning twice now that I think the franchise would benefit from having to pivot to a new idea.  Or bring in a one true Kang - A Fitz from Agents of Shield who slept to get to the future but never found his Jemma. He had all the tech a Kang needs, and even a Darkhold-created Hydra alter-ego in his brain.
BIIIG TROUBLE  in little marvel!
“Big trouble”  LOL no
Yes, that was a dumb move by his attorney. They basically confirmed it, but pushed the blame onto her.
The texts weren’t even exculpatory in any way lol. She basically admits it happened by saying “it was my fault for reaching for your phone” or something similar.
I’m promised I’d wait for more evidence, but sheesh those texts…  It’s like an accused thief showing off to everyone their favorite black-and-white stripped shirt, ski mask, and oversized bag with the $ symbol on it.   How the fuck were those texts supposed to exonerate him?
What a fucking mess.
Oh I didn’t hear about this. Last I heard she retracted her claim but that was like the weekend it happened
Also the New York prosecutors office and court system runs super slow.  It might be the end of the year before they get around to this.
Want more Kang variants? Edward Norton may be free.
They were apparently arguing in the back of a car, she believed he'd been cheating on her. He received a text, she assumed it was from the other woman. She tried to take the phone from him. There was a struggle, at some point he wound up with his hands around her throat, squeezing hard enough to leave bruise marks.
About a week or two ago, Jonathan Majors got arrested for a DV incident involving his girlfriend. Allegedly, he was texting another girl, his girl wanted to see his phone, he got irate and attacked her. Again, allegedly. However, it seems pretty likely he's guilty, but we won't know for sure until the dust settles.
Ya, it seems that the initial decision is to take a step back and see what happens. Other than Loki, I don’t think he’s in anything for this year or next year, so they can kick the van down the road for a while before seeing if all the various versions of Kang went and killed each other offscreen.
Agreed, this seems more like hedging their bets rather than an official decision to recast.
Take my angry upvote good sir.
It's not just Disney. Michael B. Jordan shared some BTS [photos](https://www.instagram.com/p/CqhZkBluXdo/?hl=en) to hype up the release of Creed III on digital 5 days ago and not one picture had Jonathan Majors in it.
I never noticed the resemblence until you pointed it out but yeah he's perfect.
Boyega's an objectively great, award-nominated actor, but after his clashes with the creative team on Star Wars, I imagine he's persona non grata for other Disney projects.
I like him but I don’t know if he has the gravitas for the role. He never struck me as someone who can portray a super villain.
Or Antman Waspless: Quantumania.
Antman and 2 minutes of The Wasp: Quantumania!
Ok but then why isnt Quantumania also featured on the poster
Man you really went to a lot of extra trouble there spelling Janet
good
I hated that haircut dunno why they didn't make her wear a wig. Eh to each their own i suppose.
A 64x64px stretched out picture of MODOK.
I got that reference!
Very clever
This made me choke.
Badum tsssssss
Hehehe
Damnit, I don’t want to laugh at this, believing we should wait to find out actual facts.  But you forced me to laugh.
Besides, he performed as the antagonist in the film.
You got to be super lazy to make a four-letter word into a two-letter word
It shouldn’t be a notable absence if they using a poster that existed before the controversy.
How dare this film poster only include both title characters!
Every single Batman Begins poster: "Am I a joke to you?"
This is literally not true lmao, there are tons of posters that only feature mcu heroes and this isn't even a poster it's just a promo image
No, this is an old poster and he was never in it
How do you not see that lol
You see the *brightest* part of the poster, in the upper center of the background, between Hope and Scott? The guy with the cape, whose floating with his arms extended?   Right there is a Major character.
In the glowing effect there’s a shadow of him
Nope, digital means you can buy or rent on demand
Theres guys like brad pitt that was accused of DV less than a year ago and nobody batted an eye. Just saying
I guess the "lol" wasn't clear that was a joke, how can anyone take that seriously? Haha
Eh it's all muddy. His lawyer claims they have testimony from the driver exonerating him and texts from the woman admitting fault. But those texts (at least the ones they released) kind of sound like a hostage letter.   Sounds like everyone's taking it very seriously though
There was a report they where in contact with his team on a way to move forward.
While I agree they can recast but I believe I also am kind of drained on the MCU.
Every new movie should have a new kang lol or every arc
No way they weren't planning on doing anything with Kang for 3-4 years.
It's me, I'm here, get over it.
Honestly this is their saving grace. Anyone else and they’d be absolutely screwed, but this happened to happen with an actor that is legit open to having ANYONE play them simply based on the fact that he’s outlined he has thousands of variants  Have no idea what they’ll do going forward, but they have to consider themselves slightly lucky since he’s easily replaceable  Wish nothing but the best to the woman involved in this, and if his name is exonerated then will be happy to see him back
They can just recast him, it's not a big deal. No one liked this movie anyway.
You not a fan fan know Kang everywhere
Plus almost nobody has seen this movie anyway
Or a whole bunch of actors. I think it’d be cool to have a bunch of different actors play various different Kangs, even to the point of surprise twists when we discover that the guy we’re up against is a Kang variant.
I mean luckily with the multiverse they could just kill this Kang and bring in a new actor to play one of his infinite variants.
Terrence Howard as Kang.
Remember when they had to replace Dumbledore and everyone got over it? They can do the same here. Half the audience won't even know
I agree they can recast, but it’s silly to rewrite history and say Majors didn’t crush it in his two primary appearances. HWR and Kang were both excellent. Perhaps someone else can come into the role, but that actor is now going to be saddled with a ton of baggage as Majors has already established the character. Majors basically got to build the characterization from scratch, someone else now has to come in and, as you put it, “replicate” that.
Mads Mikkelsen should play Kangs
I'm hoping for Tony Todd Kang vs Keith David Kang vs Kevin Michael Richardson Kang vs Kevin Grevioux Kang.
LaKeith Stanfield would be a great replacement if they recast. Super talented but not as physically imposing as Majors. Which with costuming it would be no problem.
I agree that a Kang switch should be made earlier rather than later but those fantastic beasts sequels are dogshit. The reason they don't mention the Grindelwald switch is because the whole set of movies are forgettable.
People arent actually happy with the change on Grindelwald. Mads was good but the movie was already badly written with or without him.
Marvel should just have Renslayer turn out to be a lady variant of Kang, and make her the big bad.
John Boyega could do a great job as Kang. He deserves another chance with a big franchise especially with how Finn was mistreated in Star Wars.
He’s a pretty good actor, it’s possible but won’t be easy especially having already made one film.
Except they have already filmed most of the next few films.
Majors hasn't done anything that deserves a replacement.
He didn't abuse anyone..
"Potential". I don't know the details, or really care, but I do wish fanbases would refrain from starting a witch hunt before the verdict.
I really hate that your guilty until proven innocent and even then your still guilty to many Johnny Depp still guilty it doesn't matter that he won to many he still did it. Even if Jonathan Majors wins this does it matter to many hes still tarnished and many will still think he did it. It is just the world we live in now. I mean I bet people will be mad at me for thinking Depp innocent so I mean what does anything matter once your accused your always guilty this guy is doomed. There is literally nothing he can do to clear his name 100%   HE IS AND ALL ALWAYS BE TARNISHED AT THE BOX OFFICE SADLY.
Depp was better in that role though lol
Just get Don Cheadle again. He's done it in the MCU before, and also I really like him as an actor and want to see him in more things.
How was it twice? One underestimated Ant-Man, and the other predicted exactly what would happen. He wasn't even sad to go. We really don't need AoS Fitz and Jemma coming back. That era is over
Oh the lawyer suggested that? I assumed he went rogue and posted that, kinda baffling a lawyer thought that was a good idea
It's probably the nail in the coffin, honestly. Even if he can get the charges dropped he just announced to the world that he strangled this woman. The case doesn't matter, public opinion does. He's gone.
Seriously, was there nobody present to say 'Hey, these texts WILL NOT help matters' ?
Yikes. People on this sub who were so confident he was innocent must feel stupid.
It’s very normal behavior, unfortunately. Domestic violence victims commonly apologize to/defend their abuser by saying sorry “for making them angry” or “forcing them to put me in my place”.
She said something like "what you did" and everyone is just wondering "so he did do something, what?"
They released a text message where she said it was 'her fault' because she 'reached for his phone'.  i.e. They're in a textbook abusive relationship, and she is making excuses for her abuser out of fear.
This is exactly what they were counting on. People like you. Sorry you got duped.
Im sure they arent busy at all
The problem is doing that affects multiple scripts moving into production so a decision needs to happen sooner, rather than rewriting half way though filming.
Looking forward to Avengers: The Doom Dynasty
The Creed III digital poster is literally MBJ swinging at someone.. no sign of Majors.
I actually liked Majors as Kang but Boyega could honestly sell the villain scowl even better. I really want this.
Certainly. The mouse never forgets.
Wasp has honestly been such a disappointment in the MCU.   Got her suit at the end of the first movie. Wasn't in Civil War. Wasn't in Infinity War. Had a decent showing in Ant-Man 2. Got snapped. Came back and did virtually nothing in Endgame. And then had nothing to do in the cap off in the third entry of their movie.   The Earth's Mightiest Heroes version of Wasp is what I've been looking for. And it's just been 10 years of nothing.
Antman and the Wasps Quantum Role
This looks like something ryan from pitch meeting would say, lol
What movie did you watch?
Whatte do you meane
That’s what she said!
Woah waiting until we find out the facts?! You know this is the internet right?
You know that it’s a joke and is or isn’t funny regardless as to whether he’s guilty or not. The facts are irrelevant. It wasn’t an accusation of guilt. It was playing with the insinuation of guilt. But, sure, restrict your laughter…that makes sense.
Could've even just said ya
What word are they even trying to say lol
There are many other posters that feature him prominently, and the choice to use one that doesn't feature him at all is what is being noted.
I mean, we noticed though
Shiver me timbers, one movie is exception to the rule
Talking bout mcu
I typed in “[Quantimanium poster](https://i.imgur.com/ol6GhSW.jpg)” into google and the first 10/10 images have a giant Kang in them.
What? The Blu-ray cover is a poster from at least 3 months ago.
There’s nothing that indicates that is kang. It’s a blurry silhouette in the far far background. 99% of people won’t even see that
I see it. A 10 pixel high blurry silhouette of a main character that 99% of people won’t see still counts as an omission imo
Most MCU movies are available to stream the same day they come to digital.
Poe's law
> His lawyer claims they have testimony from the driver exonerating him  In no way, shape, or form is that “exonerated”. This is coming from a defense attorney putting out PR statements.

We haven’t seen any evidence to support or contradict his claim of innocence.
I'm aware of that, but that isn't what the pc said.
Ngl, as a long time Marvel fan (since the comics), I would not mind if the MCU took a long break (5 years or something)
Marvel 'bout to pull a Doctor Parnassus.
This is the way.  (couldn't resist)
He’s in Loki season 2. Did everyone forget the Quantumania post-credits scene already?
kang wars is slated for 2 years from now. Wild assumption but im guessing he was gonna be in that.
Lol its literally still the biggest film this year. Its a BO flop for its budget, but plenty of people have seen it lol
Yeah honestly that's a good way to go.  I don't think you even need to acknowledge it
This is very much like Dr. Who and his enemy the Master
[removed]
My coworkers and I were talking about Secret Invasion, and theorizing maybe some of the heroes or even side characters were actually Skrull all along. Rhodey randomly came up as a suggestion, we laughed a bit. But then further went along to say "what if Rhodey ends up being a Kang variant?" We meant it as a total joke, but it would be wild if some side character turns out to be a Kang variant that isn't inherently bad or something.
Or an alligator
I joked with a friend that this would be a great way to bring back Terrance Howard then kill off his Kang.
As long as they are all black though.
I love this idea.
They should have the guy who played Namor be the new Kang. Id watch that.
They should get Terrence Howard
Isn’t everyone a variant though?
Cheadle Kang: I've been here all along. Deal with it.
That’s pretty smart…
Exactly. They’ve already established that variants don’t necessarily need to have the same appearance.
Like what they did to replace Heath Ledger after he died filming "The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus."
That’s what they did for The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus. When Heath Ledger died, they finished the movie using Jude Law, Colin Farrell, and Johnny Depp as transformations of Ledger’s character as he travels through a dream world.
I think that's the route they'll go if they have to recast, rather than just one actor. Makes it seem like a more intentional decision narratively than "why had to recast because Majors was abusive."
That's what the original plan was anyway
Didn’t he already play all the Kang variants?
Literally don't even need to acknowledge it in universe, of all the still kicking kang variants they've had like 2 minutes of screen time
When he shows up: "It's me, I'm here. Deal with it."
Not sure that would work, Mayng
Next time baby
Can we not with the stunt casting lmao
I honestly forgot that depp was even grindelwald to start with. Maybe that's because he started as Colin Farell so the change stands out less but I literally don't think I've heard anyone say they preferred depp
Yeah, I think a lot of the fans are overthinking this whole thing.
I knew and that second guy wasn't nearly as good.
I mean he did a good job I'm not denying that, I just don't think it's anything another actor could match. You don't have to replicate it either, grindelwald didn't even have the same accent and was essentially a different character but in the grand scheme its just not that big a deal. I'm just saying it's hardly Oscar as moon Knight
🤷🏻‍♂️ Terrence Howard established the character and Don Cheadle was able to pull off making his own Rhodey after that recast
I honestly never thought anything Majors did with the character was that impressive, but I haven't bothered voicing that opinion until now because I knew it would get me dogpiled.
He didn’t crush anything. He wasn’t Heath Ledger. 😂
They should completely subvert expectations and have Stephen Merchant show up as Kang. Accent and all.  "Erright AAnt-Maan, let's see heow ye deul with me urmy of Kaaangs."
I know his role was completely forgettable, but he was already some asshole in *Doctor Strange*.
I never thought about Tony Todd or Keith David Kangs but now I demand them.
I'm hoping for John David Washington personally, son of Denzel. He’s got his Dad’s intensity and would be perfect for the part IMO.
Chops wise, Boyega can definitely pull it off. But he doesn't have the menacing screen presence that Majors has . This Kang is naturally large and appears powerful, kind of a breath of fresh air vs the CGI / Mocap Thanos of the last saga.   Idk man, I just dunno.
I know he's a good actor, but I don't think that his performance as kang is outstanding or distinct enough to be impossible to replace if necesary
That sure is the story he and his reps are pushing. The problem is that when stuff went down a LOT of people emerged saying *"oh yeah, he's awful, you didn't know?"* and Disney fucking heard that. *Everyone* heard it.   Dunno whether or not he ultimately needs replacing but there still could be a lot to consider.
>We really don't need AoS Fitz and Jemma coming back  Oof that's certainly a take
The lawyer released the texts to TMZ alongside a statement trying to spin it in his favor.
Makes sense if the video is even worse and they think this is the best they have to provide some framing to their narrative before it leaks.
Probably went to the same law school Alex Jones lawyer from the Texas case last year sending an entire backup of Alex's phone to the other attorneys
Well, something definitely happened. Unless it was the one armed man, he could be in some trouble.   Because blaming the woman for encouraging the attack isn't a great strategy.
Everybody knows that. Except Majors and his lawyer apparently.  We should probably check on the lawyers family too
I mean mate. The biggest thing to me is bruise marks from strangulation and other marks, which has been the one constant detail that everyone can agree on, don't just appear from no where.   So if Majors didn't do it and it's all overblown. Where did they come from? Because notice not once has the lawyer said she inflicted them herself. And even then, strangling yourself to the point you bruise you neck is not that likely.
Not if he’s simply recast which it looks like that’s the direction they’re going.   Unless you mean in terms of doing that recast.
Kang, the character, has nothing to do with this. Easy recast- or multiple recasts. Disney is only sweating what’s in the can and likely has a shortlist of replacement actors.  Idris Elba, Don Glover, Alsis Hodge, Leslie Odom Jr., Mos Def….
This is DCEU levels of planning if it were to happen
To be fair, they rewrote parts of Quantumania at the last minute and the changes ended up making it into the film.
Last scene of Loki is Owen Wilson coming in and saying “Ya, there were just a bunch dead variants of that guy lying in a big stadium.  Weird”
Negl I can dig.
Everything about EMH is better than the MCU. Mcu hulk is a fucking travesty.
Wow wow wow.........................................................wow.
So how are we going to replace this character we just introduced won't that be difficult   Actually it will be super easy barely an inconvenience
Antman and 2 minutes of The Wasp: Quantumania! From Marvel Studios.
https://youtu.be/ughzBnuRWv4
Yeah
Tbf he's on the DVD/Blue ray cover
I never said they never have the villain on,  I said that they don't always have them. Also you're ignoring that this isn't a poster it's a promo image like I said
They are talking about the OG post cover.
Maybe but they would of specified it was coming out on Disney+
What?
The James Bond franchise had five or six different actors for Blofeld.
They would love to!
They already killed one variant at the end. There's no reason why they can't just hotswap another variant in as an even bigger evil Kang. Or just change the actor and act like nothing happened
I’m surprised there isn’t talk of replacing Majors as Kang in those post-credit scenes.
I haven't actually seen Quantumania yet. I usually wait for the movies to release on Disney+.
I was about to be like nah, that isn't coming out until like 2025. Then I realized it is 2023. When did that happen and why did nobody tell me?
It was a movie.
In Loki a lot of the Lokis looked like Tom Hiddleston, but there was also a child, an old man, a muscle bound Black guy, a woman, and an alligator.  This is not the unresolvable problem people are making it out to be.
I'd argue it's an easy recon. Multiverse Kangs changing their appearance so their enemies don't know what to expect.
Some of the Kangs were literally non-human though, even in that scene. There was a green alien looking motherfucker. So no, they don't all look the same and that leaves plenty of room for recasting if need be.
That won't be a problem, it'll be super easy, barely an inconvenience since it's only a post-credit scene, they could easily make the change in the next installment.  They did the same thing with Thanos. (Was shown to already have the gauntlet only for it be retcon in Infinity War)
I certainly don't know Marvel's existing multiversal lore very well, but I always imagined multiverses to have some form of "nearness". Everything Everywhere touched on it a little bit when she jumps into the hotdog finger universe. You have "neighboring" universes that are relatively similar to your own; same basic physics and world events, but you have a different job, and as you go out further, you start seeing the ones where it's still same physics, but some major world events are different, and you go out even further to where cats are the dominant species, and further out, mass actually *repels* other mass, etc.  So what I'm saying is, that's just the Council of Kangs of this multiversal neighborhood. And He Who Remains wasn't actually protecting the entirety of the timeline/multiverse, just the portion he could reasonably reach before things started getting too weird.
Also I think Loki season 2 has completed filming...
Just make a brief plot point about the council needing more diversity & so it was changed.
Iron lad is a Kang variant who is young and realizes that Kangs are bad and tries to save the multiverse from them. He starts the 'young avengers'
Or do acknowledge it in a cheeky wait like they did with Rhodey when Don Cheadle came in , “it’s me, I’m here, deal with it”
It's so easy to just say that at some point something changed in the multiverse that caused Kang to look different. Like, "after Kang's defeat at the hands of the Ant-Man, Kang decided to go into hiding by changing his appearance so he could keep the element of surprise when he next meets the avengers"
Kayng
Just gotta divide zero a couple times. 1x1 = 2, mayng.
For all time, baby.
I think this person is talking about actual Dumbledore here, though both cases are technically relevant. In the original series, the person playing Dumbledore died and was replaced after the second or third movie?  Also relevant:  Marvel replaced Warmachine and played it off with him entering court where he had to say his name, and his first line was something like “I’m here, it’s me” to assure “the court” (the audience) that it was the same character. And then just rolled with it. Very well done.       But honestly of all characters for this to happen with Kang is such a good one- they *already* showed us a scene full of Kang variants that do not all look like him. It’s already established and relevant plot. Done. It shouldn’t be an issue *at all* other than finding the right actor for the role but marvel casting is good at their job.    Even if it was a bad transition though?  I’m so glad we aren’t continuing to promote (known) abusive assholes. Safety is more important than media.
I too remember Colin Farrell before he morphed into Johnny Depp
I preferred Depp by far.
Oscar better never do anything wrong, I will never accept anyone else in his roles
Or Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark
Terrence Howard was a side character who was replaced after literally the first film in the MCU, not the hyped up twist villain of an entire show and the main villain of another movie.
its ok faygo lover. i didn't think Kang was all that interesting either, and hated what ever that voice was that Majors decided on for Kang.
What Majors did was fine and okay.  I feel people were picking up on abusive character seeping through and thinking he was a genius. No. He's just an asshole.  (I too thought his Kang was mediocre and sleepy)
Dogpiled? I think you mean assaulted....
Also a good choice.
What??? Maybe I haven't seen anything good that he has been in but that dude is so bland. Lemme know what you've liked him in so I can give him another chance.
I hear that. The movie wasn’t great to begin with, despite how hyped I was.
I mean, they had a really good closure for them. I feel like bringing them back would kinda take away from that, at least in my opinion. They deserve to enjoy their retirement with their baby
A good take too.
Is it though? AoS is kinda long done.
Yikes, I mean not that I’m rooting for him but that a genuinely surprising move to make
I have a feeling that what the lawyer was spinning was that the video proves him innocent but what really saying is “the video shows that I can argue self defence and get this plead out or thrown out easily.” Which then classified him as innocent in the eyes of the law which is how she then spins it to it proves him innocent because when argued right and looked at a specific way it can legally do that.   The releasing the texts though have fucked everything up because now public opinion veryyyy quickly shifted too being against Majors. If the video really proved him 100% innocent like the lawyer said then to qwell the storm brewing the the texts being released they would have released the video to show his innocence.   Since they haven’t it’s likely the video doesn’t look good especially when paired with the texts and while a legal argument could still be made, they know releasing it will decimate Majors in the court of public opinion.   Honestly surprised TMZ haven’t managed to get hold of it or parts of it to show.
Yeah he made himself out to be a repeat abuser
I mean form that text alone, its proves he did it, and she was covering it up, isnt it classic abuse? Her feeling the need to protect the abuser saying it was her fault he lashed, etc?  Im surprised he hasnt been fired, Gunn got fired so much quicker for tweets and so did Ralph form the Flash
Thank you for mentioning this. I haven't followed how the case has been going and I've just been waiting for a final resolution. That detail says a lot.
I (and nobody on the outside) really knows what will be done yet.
They can recast and make it seem he is different cause of tbey multiverse or just straight up not aknowleagde it
Wow
That's idiotic lmao
Those were likely made and manufactured long before Majors fucked up. Would involve recalls of movies and expensive to redo and replace. So makes sense he would still be on that stuff but promotional material outside of that seems they are now avoiding as much as possible showing Majors.
This movie was a promotion for Kang and Majors was the most lauded part of it critically. There is no reason they wouldn’t put him on it other than the recent controversy. If its not that their marketing is incompetent.
No they’re talking about the blu ray cover still having Kang on it which the person responded saying maybe it’s because the Blu-ray were made long before all this happened. Which is true.
If you say so
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe%27s_law
I feel like there was another character they had different actors for, but I can't remember who it was
They also had 5 or 6 different actors for James Bond.
haha time moves ever forward friend.
And all the Peter Parkers too!
It's like they say it just to hear the same response over and over.
Or... a bunch of them ganged up on Kangs in that council and killed the Majority.
There’s a alligator version of Loki in the MCU. Anything is possible.
Also, looked different from GotG onward than he did in Avengers 1.
> a Kang variant who is young  So definitely not Don Cheadle. He was looking rough in IASIP
That wasn't even an acknowledgement though.  Plus it probably doesn't make sense to make a cheeky joke about an abuser
I get it but like, why would they bring even more attention to the fact that the actor they hired as the face of the phase potentially strangled his girlfriend. They'll likely just recast and not bring it up, they don't want people thinking about it
Antmayne
Very few comments get an audible reaction from me and this one was one of them lmaooo  “Look at my council, mayne” 😭😭
Well he was also replaced do to racism and greed by the producers.
I liked his performance in Loki S1 and Quantumania but the post credit scene with the Council of Kangs was just too much for me to take seriously, literally feels like an SNL skit performance. Had to look away at some point
I also love NyQuil pills
I thought he was fantastic in BlackkKlansman, just off the top of my head.
I get that, I enjoyed it a fair bit personally and I do think majors did a good job, but I really don't think he actually showed his best in the mcu yet
This. Let that poor couple rest.
Yeah, either the lawyer doesn't care about winning or Majors insisted on releasing the texts because he deluded himself into thinking it would help and the lawyer didn't want to get fired.
I'm all for giving someone the benefit of the doubt, but it's been a week. If that's his best defense, he could soon get cancelled by Hollywood.  So his girlfriend said she's sorry the cops arrested him, and it was all her fault for provoking him.   I'd hire a new lawyer immediately.
>Im surprised he hasnt been fired, Gunn got fired so much quicker for tweets  Probably because Disney faced an even larger backlash in doing so and, even though they got him back for Guardians Vol. 3, Gunn got scooped up for DC during his brief dismissal. Not to say Majors doesn't deserve to be fired, based on the evidence so far, but as a company that is fueled by profit and not morality, I can see why Disney isn't so quick to jump the Gunn this time around.  So long as Disney is isolated from Majors' controversy, their strategy seems to be to ride the fence and downplay their connection by removing him from promotional material. They won't fire him so long as they don't get caught up in it.
It’s common in the UK
Damn I guess it is 🤷‍♂️
No they aren’t. He’s literally commented elsewhere saying the poster from OP’s post is from the IMAX release.
Disney is trying out this new strategy since they know Disney+ is hurting their box office.
[removed]
Felix Leiter might be it
It was a huge trademark dispute so they killed "a blofield ish" character to kill off the headache
Some of them aren't even named Peter!
They just can’t really grasp what an infinite multiverse really means.
"The Council of Identical Kangs has been replaced by the Council of Different-Looking But Still Conventionally Attractive Kangs. The plan for conquest remains the same, of course."
>Majority  The beauty of this pun...
“We heard these Kangs were domestic abusers.  We’re bad guys, but we’re not bad guys” said George “Kang” Clooney
And don't forget Throg.
Three completely different looking dudes are Peter Parker.
Aunt May
Thanks I was super proud🤣
Imo his small part in Loki was better than what they gave us in Antman. I wanted to like it! They probably cut a lot of majors out so maybe there’s a better movie in there somewhere. This whole situation sucks cause for everyone and certainly including the victim, because dude can act.
It’s 100% Majors forced the issue and made them release the texts. The texts pretty much were textbook in being messages from a woman being abused. Majors has shown no remorse or care and doesn’t think he has done anything wrong and releasing the texts essentially sealed it for a lot of people that Majors is a classic DVer and honestly thought this proved him innocent because well she grabbed his phone so obviously he had to do something right.   For normal people these texts confirmed that yeah he’s beating her. For someone like Majors he sees them as his ticket out and that will show the public he’s innocent because in his mind he sees nothing wrong with what he’s done.   He thinks he’s to big to fall.
I mean, for him to do that in the first place, he would have to think that’s acceptable behavior. So I guess it makes sense.
Laughs in Amber Heard.
>I'd hire a new lawyer immediately.   I keep thinking about this and I keep coming back to this having to be something he himself insisted on. I just can not see a world where any attorney would recommend or even really allow this to happen unless their job depended on it.
> Not to say Majors doesn't deserve to be fired, based on the evidence so far, but as a company that is fueled by profit and not morality, I can see why Disney isn't so quick to jump the Gunn this time around.  You're comparing apples and oranges here. The backlash that came from Gunn's firing was because it was asinine that they fired him over some very in poor taste tweets from a decade prior and which he had apologized for.  Nobody is sitting here advocating for Majors to keep his job despite the DV allegations, in fact I would imagine most people here would be furious if Disney *didn't* fire him.
Don’t you mean: Dn I gs it is
What are you talking about?  >He's still on the Blu-Ray cover.  >Wonder if that's because the Blu-ray covers have already been manufactured so they have no choice but to go with it.  They’re clearly discussing if he’s still on the Blu-ray cover because it was made and decided long before this drama happened.
You say that like it's a bad thing
Nah, clearly they're talking about M
It means the studio is filled with morons for doing it and all stakes are dead, but it also means you can replace the actor without much trouble...so it evens out.
Because the movie showing the vast infinity of the multiverse saw like… three New Yorks and a few random glimpses of paint and shit
So... Michael B. Jordan?
"Now... shall we Reed the minutes from the last meeting?"
This would be a Rick and Morty bit if the Council of Ricks wasn't already a jab at Kang. It could feature Rhett Con somewhere to really hit it home.
Big Venture Bros energy 🤘
Spider-Ham
>He thinks he’s to big to fall.  Which is absurd, Marvel contract or not. He hasn't been in the limelight that long.
It’s important to hold on to judgement here, still. Apparently there is video from a taxicab or something. It could be possible that she hit him when she took his phone and he reacted to that. It’s possible she was goading and antagonizing him and getting in his face for a while just pricking his fingers until he snapped, waiting for the “he hit first” defense.   It is also true he could be a terrible abuser and deserve to have the incredible opportunity and fortune laid before his feet taken away.   But at this point, until we know all the facts we just don’t know.   To be clear, I’m not defending. I’ve been in abusive relationships before. I see those red flags in the text messages as well, but we really don’t know the whole story. Whatever reality you live in is completely different to the reality of everyone around you. And not around you. Like, if the internet has taught me anything is that their are a billion truths out there stranger than any fiction I could come up with
What does this have to do with Amber Heard?
Right. How could a smart attorney not see that this would backfire immediately?  Maybe it was all they had to work with.
>unless their job depended on it.  Couldn't she have just dropped him as a client? She doesn't *have* to represent him. I think the lawyer might just be a bit dense tbh.  But also, it's possible she assumed the public would just side with Majors. It's very common for the public to 1) take the famous persons side and 2) victim blame victims in DV cases.  It probably didn't turn out that way since he hasn't been famous long enough to have a passionate fanbase.
The point is that Gunn's firing was a knee-jerk reaction that came back to bite them, so they're likely to be less hasty in making any decisions on Majors until they absolutely have to.  Whatever the truth about Majors, and whatever the public opinion, Disney doesn't really catch any heat from this until the next time he appears in one of their projects. (Probably Loki S2, which recently had its release window changed from "Summer" to "Coming Soon".)  If there's even a 1% chance that Majors comes out of this clean, that it really was all a misunderstanding or a plot by the girlfriend or something -- then Disney has nothing to lose and everything to gain by taking the wait-and-see approach for as long as possible.
I think Disney can pretty credibly say they’re waiting this out to see what the courts say and pull back on things like the marketing you’re seeing here without making any moves they can’t take back.  With Gunn, while I agree that it was really dumb, there wasn’t any disagreement about the basic facts of what happened. Just how much it matters now.
I respect that Disney hasn't fired him yet what happened to innocent until proven guilty. I hate the rush to judgement we got going on here. Depp never should have been let go from the Harry potter franchise in my opinion and he ended up winning in the end but he still to many is thought of as guilty. I mean things aren't looking good for Jonathan but what if he is innocent and we ruin another innocent actors career.
I did mean that thanks for reminding me🤝
I am talking about you reply to u/aftermathxcvii   Not the actual original post.
If the word “infinite “ doesn’t paint a broad enough picture, no movie will explain it.
Kangmonger
Finnmonger John Boyega
It’s really not though.   In very little time he has become very well known and every one of his performances have recieved a lot of praise. He’s the new Thanos for marvel. He also was very well recieved in Creed three.   But I mean once you are the lead villain for multiple marvel movies and contracted for that, it’s not absurd at all for him to think he’s to big to fall now. Plus it’s very standard for abusers to be narcissistic as well and think very highly of themselves.
Why would you drop an extremely wealthy client when they start entering legal trouble?
Again. So am I. The fuck are you talking about lol?
I typed a reply to them but just gave up. 🤷‍♀️
I’m not prepared to watch Rocket get experimented on with that version of Creep playing. God damn.
Attempted to replicate all the canonical known songs Peter Quill has on his Zune and walkman. Let me know if im missing anything.
Ugh I remember my first Zune
I had a ZuneHD in 2009. For the time, the build and interface was top notch.
There's a simple solution – put out something really good. I know, easier said than done, but they've done it before. They bounced back from *Iron Man 3*'s Mandarin controversy and *Thor: The Dark World* with two of their best movies in *Captain America: The Winter Soldier* and *Guardians of the Galaxy*.  With the list of things that's gone wrong for them recently, I would hope Marvel Studios realized they can't continue to take their audience for granted.
Honestly, I don't know if there's anything they can do to change the public opinion at this point. I'd like to say "all they need to do is put out a few great projects in a row" but they've already done that towards the end of 2022 and it didn't stop all the complaints.  I've said it before and people always seem to disagree with me, but I don't think people are judging these projects solely on the quality of them. I think people are sick of the MCU and are therefor being much harsher than they used to. This is evident in a lot of the 'Quantumania' reviews where many critics spent a significant chunk of their review complaining about the state of the MCU and how much they dislike it. They didn't just stick to reviewing that individual movie.
The MCU had been "controversial" in terms of people saying they're shit movies with undeserved success for like a decade, I think the "end of the saga!" shit gave people a warped perception of how this franchise has been seen throughout the years. Outside of Ant-man's surprise flopping The MCU isn't in any worse shape than it's been before.
It’s so funny that if you talk to people that are in the general audience category no one even thinks about the dumb shit we argue about in this Reddit. 😂😂😂  Fans overreact to every single thing and then put on their couch CEO hat and start coming up with the worst irrelevant narratives and then are shocked when it doesn’t extend outside of internet babble.
😆 all they have to do is Show the X-Men and people will switch up. Or just drop a fire trailer for Captain America 4 or Deadpool 3. 🤷‍♀️ Marvel is fine, they just got Critical acclaimed Smash hit movie 5 months ago with Wakanda Forever
Yeah, these headlines are always super redundant   >	HOW WILL X STUDIO COME BACK FROM DISAPPOINTING MOVIES?!  By making better movies? It’s not that difficult to explain lol
>There's a simple solution – put out something really good. I know, easier said than done, but they've done it before.  It isn't that simple though because people just ignore all the good projects and focus solely on the bad ones.   They put out 'She-Hulk: Attorney At Law' which people were mixed on.  Then they put out 'Werewolf By Night' which most people loved.  Then they put out 'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever' which most people loved.  Then they put out 'The Guardians of The Galaxy Holiday Special' which most people loved.   Then they put out 'Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania' which most people didn't like  Instead of saying "they've put out a few bad projects lately but they've also put out a lot of great ones", people just focus on the bad ones and scream "THE MCU IS DYING!!!!!!!"
I'm a long time marvel fan, been disappointed recently. I think you're right, and they've got three good shots to get me back on board - Secret Invasion, Gotg Vol. 3 and The Marvels are all properties I've been hyped for long before the current slew of mediocre outings.
I'm hoping Secret Invasion and Guardians 3 end up packing a similar one-two punch as the 2014 movies did.
Your second paragraph is definitely valid -there's audience and critic fatigue on some of these projects. If they aren't exceptional they get picked apart or judged by phase 3 standards. Those ant man 3 reviews were a def example of that . If ant man 3 was released in phase 2 it would be fresh im betting
What great project did they release in 2022 other than the holiday specials?
I don't think a lot of people watched the Special Presentations, and people's feelings about *Wakanda Forever* were wrapped up in their feelings about Chadwick's passing. I don't know if the movie itself was all that well-liked.  If they can get back that creative spark that they used to have - hell, just give us a *Shang-Chi* and a *No Way Home* without an *Eternals* spoiling the fun between them - I think attitudes towards the MCU would turn around.
THIS^   The quality has not declined in the mcu in the slightest, it has had the same ratio of good to bad just with more projects so there’s more bad. But people just ignore the good?
I distinctly remember some reviews of the movie saying "it just feels like a setup for Kang", and while there's some truth to that...how else is marvel supposed to set up Kang?
>The truth of the matter is that a couple of very niche MCU specials on D+ aren't even going to be a blip on anyone's radar, regardless of their quality, when their movies and flagship shows are floundering.  If people aren't going to watch the content then they shouldn't have a say in how the MCU is doing. Anyone who didn't check out the only two specials this studio has ever released shouldn't be allowed to screech "THE MCU IS DYING!!!!!!!!" and be taken seriously.  >And I'd say the general reception of Wakanda Forever was far more mixed than this sub would have you believe.  No it wasn't. The only reason people say that is because they didn't recast T'Challa when a lot of people wanted them to.   Box office: $859.1M  Rotten Tomatoes: 84% critic rating and 94% audience rating  Metascore: 67 (which is really good considering how high the bar is on that site)  Cinemascore: A
You're just lobbing out opinions on wakanda forever with no facts . How do you know if people liked the movie in and of itself ? Stop projecting your own negative feelings on these   projects. Objectively bp 2 was well review critically and performed well at box office . Those are the facts
>I don't think a lot of people watched the Special Presentations  Well then those people shouldn't have a say in how the MCU is doing. If they're not going to watch the content, they shouldn't be allowed to share their opinion on the quality of it.  >and people's feelings about Wakanda Forever were wrapped up in their feelings about Chadwick's passing. I don't know if the movie itself was all that well-liked.

The creative spark is stronger than ever. 'Werewolf By Night' is easily the most distinct project this franchise has ever put out. Much more creative than 'No Way Home' lmao.
I know right -  the reviews didn't make any sense  , used inconsistent logic and reeked of bias . I'm like did you guys try judging film on its own merits ?
Yeah that's literally the opposite of mixed reaction - people think when they don't like something the reception is mixed.  wakanda forever by all objective measures was a success and well received
I was going to make a similar post.   By literally every metric you can use, Wakanda Forever is a good movie.  You didn't even mention that it was nominated for multiple Oscars and even won one.   Of course, you'll get haters dismissing the high scores saying the critics didn't want to be called racist/insensitive toward Chadwick's death.
Why shouldn't peoples' opinions matter if Marvel isn't making stuff that interests them anymore? There's a ton of people out there who skipped *Quantumania* in theaters because they were scared off by the bad reviews or the bad word-of-mouth, or just thought it looked bad. They might not even check it out once it hits Disney+. They're the people at the root of issue here; they're the people Marvel needs to win back over.  And, like I said, people's opinions of *Wakanda Forever* seem to be more wrapped up in their feelings about Chadwick. You look at the reviews, and you'll see all the praise is for how it tries to eulogize the first movie's star and for Angela Bassett's performance. The criticism is reserved for the story, characters, script, effects, etc. You know, the actual movie part of the movie. And that 84% on Rotten Tomatoes and 67 on Metacritic don't look as good when you realize those scores put it in the bottom half for the MCU on both sites. If nothing else, it's at least a huge step down from the first one.
You're delusional if you think the TV shows are even comparable to the reach of blockbuster movies. I bet the average person who might go see a MCU movie in the theatres doesn't care or even know about Werewolf by Night or the GotG special.  The biggest downfall of the MCU was that overall, Phase 4 has been a let down after their peak of Infinity War and Endgame. Biggest offenders being Eternals, Doctor Strange 2, Thor 4 and Antman 3. If those 4 movies were moderately liked as BP2 or were big hits like Thor 3, the general audiences' sentiment of the MCU wouldn't have regressed down to DC movies or Star Wars.  Phase 4 has been directionless. More divisize movies than any other phase. Perceptions of superhero movies have changed since the early 2000s. Movies like Shazam 2 would've been fine 15 years ago but it's a bore these days (which is why I predict Blue Beetle will flop). They lost 2 of their most charasmatic leads (RDJ and Chris Evans), with no one to lead them since Chadwick passed away. We can see that there are at least a dozen reasons why things are the way it is right now.
Both Black Panther movies are overrated but are pretty decent movies. As in above average for a MCU movie imo. I don't think any Marvel movie deserves an Oscar except for Infinity War and Winter Soldier.
That's nice you can count that but it was still profitable and was third highest grossing film in the last 5 and it made profit . Like how you remove all contest like the fact Chadwick - the main character from the first wasn't in the film . That amounted for dork of the decline. Doesn't really prove your point
Wait but how can you judge the quality of something you haven't seen? Then your only opinion can possibly be that you saw the trailers and didn't fancy it. That other people disliked it.  You wouldn't be able to pass judgement on the quality of something you didn't watch, how could you possibly? Would you do that with a Music Album as well? You didn't the advert so therefore the album is bad? Or you didn't listen but someone else said it was bad so therefore it is?  Seems silly, no?
>Why shouldn't peoples' opinions matter  You're on Reddit. Those opinions never mattered.
No one's saying they're judging the quality of it. They are - as you said - just seeing the advertisements and listening to others' opinions and determining for themselves if they actually want to watch it or not. That's the initial test that *every* piece of media has to get through. No one has the time to watch literally everything to determine in hindsight if they made the right call watching it.  Look, you can't say something is bad if you haven't seen it, but by that same token you can't say it's good either. It doesn't matter how good *Werewolf by Night* is if the vast majority of Marvel's usual audience chose to skip it. One of those things outweighs the other. Winning back over the people who've grown tired of the MCU is what Marvel needs to do to bounce back.
The “I didn’t ask for any of this” on the actual poster is heartbreaking lol
Does anyone know what Rocket has on his head on James’ doodle? Looks like a neck brace.
God, seeing this poster just makes me realize how heart-shattering this movie is going to be. GotG 2 is my favorite MCU movie and it broke me emotionally. This is going to do so even harder by the looks of everything. I'm not ready.
/random - I put a slash through my 7's too. Idk, I just think it looks better that way. So it doesn't get mistaken for a 1.
I am going to cry so fucking hard when Rocket dies oh god oh fuck
I'm slap-happy from a long day of work, so I decided to simplify each of the expressions in Gunn's sketch as much as possible, relative to the significant figures presented in each of the 4 distinct pieces:   1. The top row stands alone as a single expression, & it simplifies into a single number with 3 sig figs: **-1124.853**  2. Everything up to "wh" will condense into the following expression (which has 5 open variables & thus cannot be solved) with 3 sig figs: **17/Ǝ + Ɐ - ∅/51408743027.834 - 1764Σ + 4.25/R - 827240261886336759422.639**  3. From the "wh" to the period after the *m* makes a compound inequality (which has 7 open variables & thus cannot be solved) with 6 sig figs: **18 > M + 17Q - 5.825042 ≈ 13569980418174090907801371960.685125 = Q + Q^(2)/88 + C - 9.470650 + Ⅎ - F/.364511 - 1.5∴ + 478562311058240836.435294Δ < 317/Δ + Ɐ - m**  4. The final equation after the period still has 3 open variables (treating the film's title as a single known value) & also has *no rounding*: **7265787 + 4π/3 + ⁷√55 + Ɐ - .12m/(17Q) = Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3**  *Note:* Several of the nonnumerical & nonarithmetic symbols used are actual mathematical/logical operators (for example, Ǝ, the existential), but they appear to be used here as variables instead, so I've treated them suchly (because otherwise the expressions wouldn't be actionable at all).
I'm excited for the movie and have great respect for James Gunn and the whole teams talents.  One of my pet peeves is garbage math in movies.
Gunn has my kind of handwriting
Thats so fucking humbling
Release the Snydersketch!
Does anyone know if the math actually adds up? I feel like I'm supposed to know, having taken university calculus, but Idk what it looks like to me.
I've seen this tweet and the IG post many times but I never read the caption, I thought it was some kind of a fan art lol
Did anyone actually do the math? Does it really equal Volume 3?
The original looks like the “innocent men” puppet.
I do find it cute/funny that they followed his gibberish scribblings like exactly.
Racoon Adam Jensen
That looks like the "halo" sometimes used for patients who've had cervical spine surgery, to support their neck/stabilize the head.
Looks like neck brace for intense surgery or something, I feel like at one point the design of baby rocket was going to be more tragic and body horrorish, I imagine Disney wanted it to be more of a marketable cute thing or maybe Gunn thought it would be too dark.
I think it is? Maybe they put something in his brain and his head needed to be stabilized while it healed? Or spine, since raccoons are usually not always bipedal? It's a bit more noticeable in the sketch, but he also has things screwed into his chest. Maybe some of them are like heart monitors, but the poster looks like some kind of frame.
I thought it was a security device to keep him from escaping captivity.
Did you watch the holiday special? Cuz that made me cry.  Big... Manly, tears...  Not like a little baby...  There was definitely only manly sobbing...
GotG2 had one of my favorite final acts of any Marvel movie because the emotional aspect was so well done, but I thought it was a weaker movie than the first overall story wise. Hoping volume 3 gives the best of both worlds!
I am ready to get hurt again.
I feel like we already know so much of it based on the trailers. I hope they haven't given away too much but will see.
I don't put top hooks on my 1s.
He may not die but the flashback scene may be intense showing what he actually went through. I Hope Rocket doesn’t die.
This is being baited so hard that to me it’s OBVIOUS he won’t die (but instead be turned back to a regular raccoon who can’t speak, with a tearful goodbye)
Relax, you're only a genius on Earth.
It’s wild that the quick, gibberish math that Gunn doodled to get his basic idea across seems to have been replicated exactly, down to the symbol. I wouldn’t expect any actual advanced algebra or calculus, but that the artist seems to have been told “it should look just like this” is something.
if you like be[ing humble, listen watch this song about be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzUKcXxbU4U)ing humble
\*monkey paw finger slowly curls in\*  snyder tweets out crudely drawn wonder woman rule34
Gunn commented on Instagram he was just doodling there so it's most likely gibberish.
who's adam jensen? sorry for not googling but I'm curious and google is on a different app
Seems like that's what it is, with the chest and shoulder supports. Also he has some similar things coming out of his legs.
Haven't gotten a chance yet, but I definitely need to do so apparently. I sob every time I watch GotG 2 (at least three separate instances). How in the Hell does a movie with a talking racoon and a tree baby hit me so hard emotionally?
We accept all tears here brother.
Ho  Ho  Ho  Ho
Do you put top+bottom frames to make your I different to your 1, then?
Yeah I’m guessing Rocket gets reverted, Drax dies, Peter learns to let Gamora go and Groot stays growing lol
Either way someone’s dying and that’ll wreck me just as bad tbh if he gets reverted that’s honestly even worse
if you turn him back into a normal raccoon why would there be a tearful goodbye instead of having a cool raccoon buddy that's smart enough to open jars and stuff?? there are no rules about having a space raccoon they can't stop you
No fucking way lol
Haha, well played.
Popstar was great
And yet that awful theme still plays in the background.
Would make sense.
Main character from Deus Ex, famous for saying "I didn't ask for this".
>and google is on a different app  That's the laziest thing I've heard all day
And a fireworks festival in space...  I'm not crying, you're crying!
Yep. And I try to avoid using lowercase l near numerals.
"I wasn't even supposed to be here today."
You were the one who wanted to win..  And I just wanted a sister.
This. I love this
I don't like fan art posts...until I do. Super fun.
Hola gatito!
😂😂😂❤️
Cute
Only took me about 2 months to photoshop 😼
Why is this the most relatable comment ever
El gato de la Luna dice: "Hola!"
If this does happen it would surely help alleviate SDCC
Lucasfilm has done it for Star Wars Celebrations for several years with big success.
Do a real life Avengercon from Ms. Marvel
They said that they wanna try that Avengercon thingy from Miss Marvel
It really depends on whether they're going to utilize the D23 model or the Star Wars Celebration model.  The D23 model is more of a showcase for upcoming projects, whereas Celebration is more of a traditional con experience.  There's also the issue of location. New York (Marvel's original home), Atlanta (where they do a ton of filming), Anaheim/LA (where Marvel Studios is located along with Disneyland), Orlando (where Disney World is located) are all potential options, but that leaves out a pretty wide swath of the country. Celebration has had great success in Chicago, so I wouldn't be opposed to it being there or rotating around the country.  There's also timing. D23 and Celebration are every other year - would MarvelCon follow the same pattern?  And then there's impacts on other conventions, most notably SDCC. If there's MarvelCon in August, is Kevin Feige going to do Saturday Hall H at SDCC? Will Marvel talent still go to C2E2, NYCC, DragonCon, ECCC, etc.? Will Marvel still have a presence at other cons?  Honestly I'm surprised that it isn't a thing already, but it does seem like a logical extension of the brand.  Maybe then I'll be able to get RDJ and ScarJo's autographs to complete my Original Six collection.
I think it would be a big success, but if it means they would pull out of all the other cons, they could really hurt the industry at the detriment of smaller comic punishers.
Wonder where they would have it. NYC? ATL? LA? Or New Jersey?
I'm going to cosplay as Batman. That'll show 'em!
Great idea! They should of done this sooner! But make it solely Marvel related. Don't try to shoehorn in Disney projects like it's D23.
They should actually live stream it
Tickets starting at $1500
Hopefully one in Southern California
“Deodorant Mandatory”  *nobody attends*  “Marvel ded”
First E3, now seemingly sdcc. Is there a reason why companies are doing their own conventions these days?
I would just hope for multiple conventions across the country. It sucked growing up never being able to attend a comic con cause it wasn’t anywhere close to me.
Why hasn’t Disney already done this? Three days of Marvel followed by three days of Star Wars with one day of Doctor Who in-between. A week-long nerdfest that would put SDCC out of business.
So Star Wars Celebration for Marvel?
I’d love this. I miss going to conventions it’s been years.
There’s a special con in Minnesota this year just for the X-Men, called The Uncanny Experience. I don’t see why they couldn’t do a Marvel one.
They should be careful.  Water is where that Namor dude is.
Marvel-Con
It would be funny if people came in dressed as dc characters
I'm shocked they haven't done one yet. A convention dedicated to all subsections of the Marvel world (publishing, film, television, gaming, etc.) would be a surefire success financially. Not to mention it'd be great to have panels with folks from all the teams chat about the inspirations they take from each other
I would be bored
Great idea! But absolutely don't tell Reed Pop.
As long as it’s not the financial strain of Supernatural cons, I’d be down.
Irl avengerscon
 something needs to happen this year or next year at minimal.
Supernatural does this and it works well for them, although this would obviously be on a much wider scale. It would probably be better for other cons tho in terms of overcrowding and stuff of people just there for marvel
Ok.
Everyone who goes to this, make sure your wearing anything but marvel cosplay
It makes me think of what happened to E3.  If Marvel pulls out... then DC... then...
There have also been Star Trek conventions since the 1970s.  I think this could work for Marvel, easy.
This exactly!
Same!
I mean New York comic con literally started as a marvel con
I think they would stick to Orlando or Anaheim just like Star Wars. If you're there, you're going to hit Disneyland or Disney World. (Yeah, I know their in London this weekend.)
>D23 and Celebration are every other year  Hmm?  There was a Star Wars Celebration in 2022 and there is one happening right now.
They would probably make it closer to celebration as they'd still be expected to present at D23, just like Lucasfilm does.
Counterpoint: a bunch of the big cons are really crowded now and having Marvel step away could alleviate it, especially if they have it at around the same time.
They could still have a presence there, just smaller. Star Wars has it's own convention but it's still present elsewhere.
Damned if you do, damned if you don't.
Probably rotating locations like they do for Star Wars Celebration. Anaheim will be one of the location so they can get people to go to Disney California Adventure for Avenger Campus.
I think ATL deserves it. They put up with them shooting almost everything in ATL. Closing down streets etc. They also get a huge tax break from GA. Only fair to host it there. Plus Dragon Con proves you can host a huge con in ATL. I’ve been and it’s amazing. Not to mention one of the hotels they host in is the same one they used for shots in homecoming and Loki!
It's easier than ever to make announcements on your own and create buzz (and arguably more beneficial since you won't be overshadowed by the hundred other announcements that weekend). More freedom/control, no sharing profits, reveal things on your own schedule.   For the case of e3, companies don't even need their own convention, just a livestream to show their pre rendered cgi trailer for the game they started development on 3 weeks ago
Pop culture conventions are much more popular than they used to be. Companies probably figure that there's enough demand for them to hose their own conventions, where they'll have more control and more focus.
Damn, that looks cool, I wish I could go. I went to a big comic convention a few years ago and there was like, no X-Men stuff. Not even in the huge vendor hall.
Then it goes back to its roots and an enjoyable experience and venue that is just that, a comic book convention. DC and Marvel can still have a presents but only their comic and graphic novel. No big media events.
Does anyone other than those two have enough pull to have their own convention? Sure those are the two big comics companies but SDCC has been expanded to include non comic geek culture for a while. The name may be no longer accurate but it will still be the place to announce things like science fiction and horror projects.
Star Wars Celebration is currently happening in London.
This is why I love smaller cons and avoid the larger ones. I love it when artists and writers give a panel and there are a few dozen people in the room.
Yeah, and the big cons aren't just overly crowded, their content is very bloated because of the shift towards "general pop culture". Smaller creators and companies have a harder time standing out.
This sounds amazing tbh.  NYC, LA, Chicago, Atlanta (considering so much is filmed for Marvel in GA anyway)  I’m a sucker for the idea of international cons hosted near simultaneously, too. London, Hong Kong…
Paris would be cool at some point since there's a Marvel area at one of the Disneyland Paris parks.
Dragon con brings in so many people, plus with all the other cons they do in Atlanta, it's a no brainer that it's a nerdy hotspot
The G.I. Joe con is in ATL, which proves you can host... small cons there, too.
I got real tired of fighting for entry into NYCC (when I went as a kid it was easy to just buy at the door day of). Now (or at least pre covid) it’s like a mad rush to buy online months in advance. And it felt so corporate when you get in — like it’s the comic brands, but then it’s the geico booth, then a car brand, etc.   I then went to a smaller “local” one and it was actually very enjoyable. Local shops and some smaller artists that I hadn’t heard of before; and you can get great pieces from them if you like that. It’s also fun seeing celebrities (granted not “a-list”) not behind a curtain signing autographs.
People think SDCC would die without the big corporations but it was there before them and they will be there after them. Not to mention the location of the Convention center in San Diego also adds to the attractiveness of the venue. You can get out of the con and there's a lot of stuff to do.   And heck even if Star Wars has it's own con they still attend SDCC and have panels there even if it's in a smaller capacity.  If SDCC goes smaller it would honestly be great for a lot of people who don't care about Hall H and want to go to the con without any hassle.
Oralé!
I've never been to SDCC but I hear it's a nightmare. They have cool stuff, but it sounds like most visitors wouldn't get to enjoy much because the crowds and long lines.
Smaller conventions still exist. They don't all have to be SDCC-sized blowouts that focus on general pop culture. And even if the non-Marvel/DC companies can't support their own dedicated conventions, they could help create more general comic conventions and have a lot of pull in them.
Yeah, I think the point is they Atlanta could easily host. There is even giants building specifically for hosting big events like cons. Would be a huge missed opportunity to not host the first one in Atlanta.
I went to a local con when visiting family in NJ and met Larry Lieber there (Stan Lee’s brother). Bar none the best time I had at a con, we had a good chat for a few minutes and he’d answer them like I was a friend not some generic fan.
Last large con I went too was WonderCon some years back. Getting tickets wasnt hard but it was crowed AF. It was just the wife and I. We had fun in our cosplay and still had a good time. This was when Agents of Sheild was still airing and we wanted to get into their panel. So the 2nd day when the panel was going on we got in line and took turns holding the spot. After many hours of waiting, we were the first people not let into the hall. First damn cutoff. So frustrating.   There is a local con where we live held at a community college. Small venue and small crowds. My wife is a huge Hellboy fan and Mike Mignola was giving a talk. There had to have been less than 20 people in the room. She was able to have a back-and-forth conversation with him and had a great time. Cool dude.
Mike is a great guy my brother and I ran into him at a coffee shop and talked to him for probably 15 minutes
Considering when this show was greenlit, it’s been a remarkably fast turnaround, when pretty much everything else has been delayed so much. I’m assuming there won’t be a lot of VFX in this compared to other shows and movies.
[Another sign to confirm this is that recent reports indicate that X-Men '97 has been moved to 2024 from its Fall 2023 release date.](https://twitter.com/CanWeGetToast/status/1644017649897320448)  It seems Echo and X-Men '97 have swaped their release dates.  That means X-Men '97, Ironheart, What if...? Season 2 and at least the first half of Daredevil: Born Again are currently expected to drop in 2024, with Agatha: Coven of Chaos, the second half of Born Again, Wonder Man and Spider-Man: Freshman Year in 2025.
I’m hoping for an Andor situation where everyone’s expectations are low but it becomes the best thing they’ve produced in a while
Whatever happened to iron heart? I thought that would've release this year over Echo (not my opinion on the shows, ATM my anticipation for both is the same. It just seemed like Iron heart had more reason to release compared to echo. Especially if the thunder bolt rumour is true)   Also the same can go for what if. Wasn't that meant to release last year?
This is the one marvel show so far that i have zero interest in. I loved Hawkeye but didn’t find echo interesting at all. I can’t see how she’s be the main character
It's what Alaqua Cox said some time ago
People have been whining a bit about Marvel delaying stuff but there's honestly still a lot of Marvel content this year. We already had Ant man. Now we'll have GOTG 3, Secret Invasion, loki, echo, the Marvels..like that is plenty.
Am I alone here by saying I have zero interest in an Echo show? I could not care less about her character in Hawkeye
Some people don't wanna here this, but Marvel are working on way to many stuff to only be releasing 2 series a year. This whole "spacing out projects" is not sustainable. There going to have to release these projects at some point.
It would be hilarious if this ends up being one of the best D+ shows with all the hate it’s getting.
I’m sorry, who exactly asked for this? Marvel is extremely overwhelming as it is and we’re getting an Echo series?
Maybe it could turn out like Andor?
People be like "tHiS mUsT bE tHe LeAsT iNtErEsTiNg PrOjEcT tHeY'rE mAkInG"  And I'm just here like "I want to see an indigenous disabled person kick some ass".
Well I'd be glad to have this around my birthday. Daredevil *and* Kingpin back? Just heaven
I’m gonna at least give it a chance. Seems fair to me.
I feel like I’m the only one who is actually excited to see this series
So, Secret Invasion, Loki, Echo back-to-back-to-back with little to no break in between?
Yeah… I think this and Agatha ima skip. I’ve literally watched everything MCU but idk what Disney is thinking in green lighting background characters story arcs
A trailer hasnt even dropped for this show yet and ya'll already trashing it. Ridiculous.
Probably should have just rolled this character into the Daredevil series
😴😴😴😴
And nobody cared.
Just cancel it.
Well I'd be glad to have this around my birthday. Daredevil *and* Kingpin back? Just heaven
The only good thing about Echo was that I heard Christmas Island for the first time  Why can't we just get something original that's not just like everything else on the platform
The show that nobody asked for.
Wow, I just, really care so much about this show. I'm so glad it's getting an earlier release. Definitely my most anticipated show of the year. Wow can't wait  Why is this a thing again?
For anyone wondering why this project was greenlit so early on, it’s because Disney wanted to have an Indigenous hero in the Marvel landscape. That’s it. It’s for representation reasons. And I’m actually 100% in support of that. I just think until she proves herself to be an interesting character in the MCU, she doesn’t need her own solo project. But her involvement in the films and tv shows as a whole? Love it. More representation. Totally on board w that
Zzzzzzz
i’m excited for this show. i’m anticipating it being a decently large push further into street level antics in the mcu. between daredevil, hawkeye, and echo i think fisk is going to be a really fleshed out villain and we will get to see a lot of him before he finally becomes a big bad and requires an avengers response. that’s how he should be imo, a threat that grows and grows but thanks to corruption and naivety he’s left alone until he has an entire city under his control.
I really think they should just release all episodes of Echo the week of Thanksgiving.
Greenlighting This show was a misstep.
Of all the Marvel content they are pushing out, this one probably makes the least amount of sense. It's a show no one asked for, and likely no one is really looking forward to, and it seems like it should have been the first victim of Marvel's new direction to cut quantity and increase quality.
Who actually wants this show?
Whoever wanted this show made must have sucked good dick to get a random side character her own series.
Who is this show for? Watch it’ll will be the worst release
Ngl i don’t have any interest in this show. Echo just doesn’t seem like an interesting enough character to warrant a whole show
The show noone really cares about
Never knew Echo existed before the Hawkeye show. What’s her deal besides being deaf and having trained in martial arts? Does she fight crime? Is she a member of some team? Is she a Mutant or Inhuman or something?
I’ll reserve judgment until I watch the show, but I do think it’s a weird choice to prioritize a solo series for this character
Yeah for 2 years i thought Andor would be DOA. I had no interest in it. Then it became probably one of the best things Star Wars released in years. I feel the same way about this that i did Andor. So surprise me Echo!!!
So that would keep the number of shows this year to three... noice.
So are there many people who are excited for this because of the character herself or is a majority of people going to watch this for Daredevil and Kingpin?
I'm a bit sceptical of those series due to the quick turnaround. Will still be worth watching though.
This show will met with the some harsh reception.
NGL, I’m only gonna watch this for the Daredevil connection
Glad its coming out sooner but this one is my least exited. Echo was a boring character, dont care about her story. At least Daredevil is in it.
I’m looking forward to it! Unpopular opinion but I found her a very interesting character. If nothing else I’ll watch for Alaqua Cox because I felt she did a great job in Hawkeye, especially when you consider it was her first ever acting role.
Who asked for a Echo show 🤦🏾‍♂️?  Who am I kidding? I’ll be tuning in every Wednesday in November 😅.
Anybody else just got not at all interested in this one?
So…  Secret Invasion: June 21st-July 26th Ahsoka: August 2nd-September 6th Loki Season 2: September 13th-October 18th Echo: November 22nd-December 20th Skeleton Crew: December 27th-January 31st  I don’t think Disney actually wants these shows competing for viewership on the same day so I think their release will one after the other.
Or just scrap it
Bro Marvel is loosing their edge, this show makes no sense right now. This is so off what marvel should be doing with more recognizable and popular characters
🗑️
…anyways
Bro what is this show even going to be about, is it following the girl who was kingpins follower or something
I'm really looking forward to this, so hopefully we get an official date soon. Had no idea who Echo was prior to Hawkeye but I absolutely loved her character on that show
One would hope, all the street level stuff should rely more on fight choreography and practical effects like the Netflix MCU stuff
Wasn’t the show rumored to be dealing with magic and some stuff related to her heritage?
Interestingly enough,the OG Daredevil creative dude said they definitely would've used light CGI touch ups if they had the budget Born Again has,so as long as there's no awful CGI like Charlie Cox's neck not connecting to the suit like when She Hulk lifts him up, I think it'll work  Only thing I fear is a CGI version of Kingpin where he goes into rage mode and punches a wall and they do a zoom in and it's the ugliest looking CGI rage face ever  Remember in Spider-Man 3 when he's falling and they for some reason,CGI'd Tobey's face? That's what I mean
You’d be surprised how much VFX Marvel can cram in there.   Hawkeye was chock full of it!
Wait they’re gonna split born again?
This is why they need to cut down the content and focus on stuff people care about. The good stuff is getting put off and people are left to complain about the mediocracy of the shows no one asked for.
So annoying, I’m very hyped for X-men 97 and wish they hadn’t wasted a dime on Echo.  I’ll skip for sure
No offense to anyone, but IDGAF about like any of those outside of Daredevil
I've been watching the 90s xmen, what's xmen 97? No spoilers,  is it just a continuation of the original?
I Hope Iron Hearts cancelled. Too much VFX talent poured into something just not worth making.
Ironheart is being delayed to 2024 as result of Marvel's new strategy to focus on quality over quantity
The entire show should be strictly from her point of view, kind of like silent films, you get context only from what you see.  That would actually make me interested.
This is probably a Daredevil prequel and less a Hawkeye follow up.
Same but let's at least be open-minded and give it a chance, you never know what they might have up their sleeve.
Yeah a new character in an alright spin-off TV show getting her own show is pretty ridiculous. They gonna give Karli Morgenthau from FATWS a show next?
I mean she is a character from marvel comics. And the mcu bases their movies and TV off those characters and plots. So having an echo show makes logical sense.
People are complaining it isn’t enough? I thought the consensus was that it was way too much content.
I remember 1 or 2 years ago when Marvel had a huge lineup of TV shows, where we'd get a new episode of a show for almost an entire year straight.  Then shit fell apart and now we have months of nothing.
You’re gonna get the same “I am excited” from 10 people who think they’re in the majority lol most fans and let alone non marvel fanatics could care less about her and I honestly care less after seeing her in Hawkeye. She was the last character that marvel needs to spend time on for a tv show in their bloated schedule.
I have no hype at all. Largely because Echo is a shitty character. Shitty might not even be the right word. Just undercooked and uninteresting resultantly.   Echo is a character that Marvel has been pushing for years but has no idea what to do with. So they just throw shit at the wall and hope something sticks. It’s really like:  “What if Kingpin had a secret adopted deaf daughter and she becomes his nemesis Daredevil’s lover?  Get it?! He’s blind, she’s a deaf woman named Echo! That has to be good writing because they both have disabilities that deprive them of one of their senses yet are superheroes! Brilliant! No! Wait! Nevermind! Let’s make her friends with Wolverine and they can tour Japan together where she becomes a ninja! Scratch that! She’s an Avenger now! Nope, nevermind, she can be killed by Electra and then resurrected in the exact same way cause when two things happen the same way it must be good writing! It’s, like, thematic. So she’s in The Hand now. Actually, I don’t like that. Let’s hook her and Hawkeye up and she becomes Ronin. Ehh, or maybe she can be a stripper and start hooking up with Moon Knight. Nope. Not loving this. Just kill her again. Wait, changed my mind. Resurrect her. Maybe this street level hero can become a supporting character of the galaxy faring Captain Marvel? Oh! Wait! I got it! I know she’s not a mutant and has absolutely no history with the X-Men, but let’s make her the Phoenix!”.  Seriously. That is her character history in a nutshell. Marvel just has no idea what to do with her and it shows. Hell, Marvel seems to realize that as they’ve even poked at themselves for it when Luke Cage and Jessica Jones interview her for a nanny position and she gets mad that they don’t remember she was (briefly) an Avenger. But I digress.  My point is because she has never had a consistent characterization or arc, she’s just not a very interesting character. In fact, she is so uninteresting as a character it seems Marvel just sticks her into other people’s identities and pointless relationships because they have nothing else to do with her. So I really just don’t have a lot of interest in seeing her lead a project.  Edit: people downvoting need to read up on the character. I’m not making this shit up. This is her character history.
“Am I alone here by saying-“  No, there are so many marvel fans with different opinions that you will never be alone, especially with this opinion which is pretty popular
She was an ok support character.   She is not a lead character.   I’ll watch it, and chances are it’ll be good but I don’t think anyone was asking for it.
Am I interested in her specifically? No. But I see this as a Daredevil Born Again lead in. Pretty sure D’Onofrio and Charlie Cox are confirmed to appear in this. So I’m down.
No you are not alone.  The fact that this show was green lit it baffling.
No you are not.
Im with you. She was fine in Hawkeye but nothing about her in that made me want to see her lead a series. I hope it turns out good though.
You're not alone. Zero excitement here.
Same here. I just thought it was good to have a deaf character also be a badass. But I don’t really need a whole show about her. Of all the MCU shows and movies, I’m probably gonna skip this.
Only going to watch it for any DD/Fisk stuff.
Nah, I don’t really care either, and I’ve been stoked about everything this far.
You are not alone. I am not interested in this show at all.
The character itself isnt much but I am looking forward to it because there's a chance it is street level and Daredevil and Kingpin will also be in it.
Nah I’m excited
Am I excited? No. But keep in mind we don't even have a trailer yet
I'm with you on this.
Scoopers gonna scoop but there are no plans to slow releases down.  Bob Iger sauid they were keeping Marvels output the same but no longer giving characters trilogies - it's Star Wars that is getting its content cut, not marvel.
I don’t get it at all. They were doing fine. I think cutting down will make people lose interest even more. I get taking time to make the best products but they still need to be putting stuff out.
I mean, they switched strategies when some of these shows were already shot or in production. They’re going to release them as planned, and then in the future they’ll slow down. I expect the remainder of phase 5 to be stretched out quite a bit, and Kang Dynasty and Secret Wars to be delayed by a year or so a piece. They definitely need to let these projects breathe, and it makes sense given the critical reaction to Love and Thunder and Quantumania. If we got 2 shows and 2-3 movies a year, that would definitely help the cause.
I mean good for it if it does but people saying "I'm not interested in this character" is hardly "hate". It's not a crime to not be interested in things...? I love Daredevil and I'm very excited for Born Again but I know some people here who could care less about the character and have expressed those sentiments, I'm not going to perceive that as "hate" when people say they don't care about Born Again. Because that's not hate, that's preference, like? Stop the victim mentality already gaawd
Its genuinely not at all interesting, no offense whatsoever man. I dont even look forward to it especially after seeing her in the hawkeye show
It was greenlit before Hawkeye even came out, so I assume that the creative team and Feige specifically are the ones who asked for this, presumably as an important chapter in the street level story that they started in Hawkeye and will continue in Daredevil: Born Again.  I do understand not being thrilled with her character in Hawkeye or excited for her own show, but it's not unusual that they're making it in the first place.
Who in the world would be interested in a show about a deaf Native American hero?  Let's think...
I agree. I like my superheroes like I like my rice: white and plain.
Feige basically did after meeting with Alaqua Cox for the first time. He saw a badass deaf Native American and figured that’s great representation. Echo as a character in the comics is essentially a mess that nobody knows what to do with. Echo in the show was just kind of underwhelming, certainly not deserving of a solo series after what we saw. Maybe it’ll be good, but this was something that was rushed for a reason that likely has little to do with the story they had planned.
A series with rave reviews (I liked it too) that no-one watched. I imagine D+ would rather it be like Mandolorian, worse in every way but with an audience.  I’ll give Echo a go. The character doesn’t have much comics history based so may give writers more wriggle room to make it interesting.
I think you’re the audience they’re hoping for. Personally, someone being deaf and indigenous is not enough for me to be interested in a person’s story.  But, then again, I never got in the ethnicity as a fetish train.
I’m very pumped for it
I think given the writers and show runners they’ve brought in, this could be very, very cool. I’m not going to write it off at least.
Not exactly. There will be 5 weeks in-between each release.  I can see the schedule being something like this:  Secret Invasion: June 21st-July 26th  Loki: September 6th-October 11th  The Marvels: November 10th  Echo: November 22nd-December 27th
I’m personally fine with that considering there will have been an 8-month gap between shows; the last episode of She-Hulk and the debut episode of Secret Invasion.
Yup.  Seen it all but after the disaster that was Ms, Marvel… I’ll be skipping any tertiary characters.  I look at it like comics.  When they have the big crossover events, I buy the main event comics and whichever characters I like.  I just skip the lame character singles and read the last page in the comic store to see if there was anything I needed to know
Indeed. Making a series out of a side character is bizarre.
Very wrong
Agatha also lol.
Sometimes she’s just a martial artist sometimes she’s the fucking pheonix no writer knows what to do with her but they have to meet a diversity quota put out by the guys at marketing so here we are.
Boy do I miss the fight choreography of Captain America movies
Heritage maybe but I really doubt magic. Iron Heart is dealing with magic. But Echo is pretty strictly dealing with organized crime, that’s her whole thing, like a combo between Daredevil and Punisher.
Oh god I really hope they don't add CGI veins to his face/neck, I just don't need that in my life
Yep, that's the rumour. 9+9 episodes with a short gap in-between.
This is it 100%.   Someone above mentioned the show might be alright because it might have kingpin and/or daredevil in it.   Imo supporting characters don’t deserve their own series. That’s the real reason for mcu fatigue. We get bored waiting for the main characters to show up
Nobody cares about Iron Man until after the first movie.  Guardians of the Galaxy was seen as risky because it was a big change in direction.  They're bound to keep trying new things.
What about the people who care about all of it?
Well I don't recall asking for a 90s X-Men revival. But "No one asked for this" is such a silly thing to be saying so I don't say it.
Guardians of the Galaxy?, Ant-Man?.  I saw the same arguments with these two about how Marvel should not do Guardians and Ant-Man cause nobody cares about them.
*mediocrity
Cool lol
Yep  Will pick up right where the original ended, will have the same voice actors and will be provided by Marvel Studios.
For real, that and echo are major head scratchers.  I would literally be more interested in a squirrel girl show than either of those
Who are you to decide that it's not worth making?
I think one episode could be like that. If it’s the whole thing I’m totally in but I don’t think they will be that bold.
Watch them pull a Book of Boba Fett and make Daredevil the main character halfway through
There’s thousands of characters in the comics, plenty of them are and work best as side characters. Having a show of a d list character that has had a very lukewarm response (live action)  that almost nobody is interested in doesn’t make sense. Marvel was simply on a project greenlighting spree to fluff up disney+. Still, it may be good and surprise lots of us. I wouldn’t bank on it though.
Different people, different complaints.
Fandoms are inconsistent.
I've seen some people complain about delays saying they liked it when there was something to watch each month. Consensus is still that delays are better but I've seen some people here saying they were okay with the old ways
I remember someone leaked an Excel file a few years back with all the shows/episode lineups. But of course a lot has changed since then.
It’s certainly hard to justify the Disney + subscription when there are large gaps in releases for content I actually want to watch.
I've said it before and I'll say it again. If Echo is never in Hawkeye. I'm more inclined to give this show a chance if it's her first appearance.   The way they introduced her character in that show was fucking abysmal. They took her mimicking abilities away from her. They rushed through her 15 seconds of fame in the comics. Her story after episode 3 sucked from the Kazi to the Kingpin stuff. I went into that show thinking Echo was this really interesting character. Because they ran to Deadline a few weeks into production to announce she was getting her own show. And I left Hawkeye thinking they completely lost their minds.   Like I thought they were going to take Kazi and turn this man into the clown at first, and build that up as this villian for her in her show. But they just killed the dude in an incoherent fight scene and story.   Like the dog had a more clear point A to point B story.
Lmao that's a perfect writeup.
Damn, I knew that her journey was messy, **but not this messy**
You summed it up pretty well
The mcu isn't identical to the comics though. So doesn't that make her comic history moot?
Every comic book character's history is convoluted garbage like this. What's your point?
Right? People saying this as if it hasn't been the most parroted question on this sub about Echo
She was a typical MCU antagonist to be killed off in her first appearance, yet somehow she got a solo project.
When you need other characters to keep the audience interested in your show than that pretty much confirms that the show is pointless.
Bro got downvoted for saying he’s excited for a Marvel show on a Marvel sub. That’s crazy, not surprising tho
real. me too
Why
People hilariously misunderstood what Kevin Feige and Bob Iger were saying.   They didn’t say they would slow down, they said they would space out the releases to where there is less competition so they are the main topic of discussion.   People let their conformation bias misrepresent what they read. Marvel is not slowing down in any way shape or form.
The show isn't even out yet. How do you come to any conclusion without seeing it yet. Are you a time traveler?
I was not aware the deaf, Native American and the deaf Native American community was all in on Echo.  Regardless, I’m still confused on why she needs a completely different show for representation instead of trying to consolidating her with other characters to bring the Marvel franchise in a bit.
I see what your doing but honestly that’s a narrow audience that actually would be interested
And with a prosthetic leg. This character is gonna mean a lot to many people. Including me. I’m currently learning ASL so I hope they do a good job with that aspect of it.
I feel like the only person who watched Andor and thought “meh” 😂 It had a few moments I enjoyed but overall it didn’t light my world on fire or anything
Yeah, the placing of Loki now hinges on whether or not Disney wants to run Ashoka (starting in August) vs. the Marvel show.  They have in the past, but I'm not sure they want to do that with two of their biggest Disney+ properties.  We'll see.
It works.
If that turns out to be the schedule, then great. At least there will be something to look forward to during the holidays.
If it ain't white, it ain't right. If it ain't male, I'm gonna bail.
Same man, sometimes a CGI fest just can’t replicate really good stunt teams
>!i like how with zelma being introduced in iron heart there’s going to be more dr strange supporting cast introduced in her show than his own movie!<
Although there does have to be some source for her power since it hasn't really been introduced yet. She's just good at fighting so far, but it doesn't seem like she has the echo powers yet.
Getting veins to your face and neck is also pretty damn easy as well and you can still look decently human
So they found a way to sorta cheat it into having a 9-episode release schedule.   Sneaky bastards.
I thought it was 6+6+6 with gaps every six episodes?
Supporting characters like Wanda Maximoff, Loki, and Hawkeye?
But echo is a character even within the comics they have no idea how to use. Her material is all over the place. Iron man has a long history to use and the guardians while more obscure, as a team there’s stuff to be done with them.   Echo just isn’t the character you give a solo TV show to.
Great for them but also I doubt they’re EQUALLY as hyped for echo as they are for daredevil or wonder man or literally anyone who isn’t echo lol
They have material you can work with, especially ant man with so many years behind him. Echos already a mess in the comics she doesn’t need a solo TV series
Awesome, that's good to know. Thanks!
The fact she’s a bad character
Watch them pull an Andor, and Echo blows everyone away with solid writing and fantastic fight choreography.
I just don't understand the logic behind this emotional response  to a show that is wholly optional to watch. The mentality of seeing the og post then taking the time to type out "this is stupid. / Am I the only one uninterested in this? / This is gonna be shit. / something something forced diversity." It would be a lot better if these posts created actual discussions rather than the same negative opinions regurgitated over and over.   I also never in my life came to a conclusion on any form of entertainment without actually reading or watching said entertainment. That is most baffling to me.
Yelena even overshadowed her on Hawkeye 💀 like Echo's stint on Hawkeye was supposed to be this ala T'Challa in Civil War moment whose introduction gets you hyped for their solo project but Echo literally became a footnote in Hawkeye. It's not good when a cameo like Yelena overshadows her official MCU intro. I came away from Hawkeye wanting a Yelena + Kate Bishop project, not an Echo one. Sorry, they really dropped the ball there. All I'm going to say is good luck with the viewership. Even Ms. Marvel who is a fairly known comic character struggled with viewership.
Sadly, that is the abridged version. 😂
Sure. But it doesn’t change the fact that this IP is being centered around a pretty bland character, with no meaningful history to draw from, no memorable arcs to adapt, and really just no consistent personality or characterization that the fans love: a character who was essentially created as a gimmicky attempt at telling a Romeo and Juliette story involving Daredevil dating Kingpin’s daughter, and then having nothing to do with her since. Really, the character should’ve died after shooting Kingpin. Her story had ended. It would’ve fit the tragic undertones of the star crossed lovers angle and it would’ve given Murdock even more guilt to struggle with.   But, for whatever inexplicable reason, Marvel kept her around. However they didn’t know what the hell to do with her. And they haven’t made her anyone beyond that initial original paper thin premise. So we are left with a bland and uninteresting character around whom a project is being based, when there are dozens of characters on the bench who could give rise to such better stories.   I mean, FFS, there are only vague rumblings of Ghost Rider, Nova, and Silver Surfer. Yet we’re getting an *Echo* series? It’s just hard to get excited for that, is all I’m saying.
Most comic book characters become this after decades of history. But Echo has only even been this.
They are convoluted but at least their stories are their own and there's an iota of consistency with their core stories and traits. Echo literally just attaches herself to other characters to give her any story or any personality. Like that shit is not good character writing at all. The character can't stand on her own.
That can be applied to a few of mcu projects lol. How many people watched Civil War soley because of Spiderman?
What a ridiculous statement lol. What shows do you watch? With one character? And no other characters? Weird. Never heard of that show.   Would this show be pointless in a stand-alone sense? Yes. BUT WE DONT OPERATE THAT WAY. Everyone who watches is gonna be watching because it’s all part of the same series in the end. The Marvel Cinematic Universe. Think of it like a TV show. One long ass TV show. This “season” will be focused on this chick. And feed into the larger story to come in the next “season” on Daredevil’s show.
Ye it's kinda wild.  Iger said Disney were going to slow down production in general, outsource some of their regular programming to 3rd parties to save money (i.e. all those twee family films aimed at 6 year olds) and do less Star Wars stuff but not slow down Marvel and that was apparently too complex for the internet to handle.
Plus. I just have to say this. It's not a coincidence that they're spacing out releases when the old CEO is ousted after it comes out how much of a money sink Disney + is.
>They didn’t say they would slow down, they said they would space out the releases  How do you space out the releases without releasing less content?
They literally never said they came to any conclusion about it. They said they’re not interested in it, it’s really not that hard to understand.   It’s weird how you’re bothered because *someone else* isn’t interested in this show. Why do you care? Why does it bother you?
Why do you presume the show is being made for representation? No one said that.
Because we all know it’s impossible to be interested in stories about people that are different from you lol
Think the problem Andor faced was how to get over how humdrum life can be in the Imperial run equivalent of Vichy France without some of that boredom leaking into the show pacing. I think they just about succeeded, but I’m older than most viewers so used to shows letting things breathe.
I felt that way in the first two episodes, but then man oh man did it get good.
Maybe they’ll push it back or even reshoot it bc of the Jonathan Majors stuff
Quite the assumption.  X-men is my favorite comic and it has people of all backgrounds.  Just because I didn’t like Ms.Marvel (it was bad) doesn’t make me racist lol
You are the fucking worst element of this fandom. Anyone is not interested or doesn't like something, all you can do is start screaming homophobia, racism or sexism. Fucking pathetic. Not everyone laps up anything Marvel shits out unlike you
There's no replacement for a great stunt team imo
Hold your breath for 30 seconds before saying the line and you'll really get your veins to pop in your neck and face
That came from a significantly less reliable source.  9+9 is a more reliable rumour.
How’re you comparing Echo and Agatha to the either of those 3? They’re not on the same level at all
These characters were all main characters in *something*. Agatha and Echo weren't main characters in anything, especially Echo.
Like the other guy said they’re just not comparable lol.
Nobody cared about 24 episodes around Cassian Andor either and people can't stop going on about it now.  You never know what you might get.
It sounds like it will heavily involve daredevil though and kingpin. Hopefully Kate bishop is heavily featured as well. My guess is it will have a lot of other characters featured in it with just echo at the center. We only know daredevil and kingpin though for sure.
It's about representation. Believe it or not it really is important for viewers to see themselves in mainstream media. It may not be overall as popular but any character's show can be amazing if the writing etc is good.
Ah just fuckin wait until it comes out Jesus Christ. It’s been 15 years of overreacting before you see something ever since Health Ledger was cast in the Dark Knight.
Exactly bro exactly
Idk, Echo was a cool side character I wanted to see more of in Hawkeye and Wonder Man I know absolutely nothing about. Different people are excited about different things
I feel like storywise Echo NEEDS to come before Daredevil anyway, and it ties into his world. So I'm excited for it
Absolutely agree on this
How? Sure she was a plot device in Wakanda Forever but she was still enjoyable as a character in that and contributed to the climax fight? But what makes you think she will be a bad character in her own show?.
I literally said none of the options you listed. Might as well not respond if you’re gonna make it seem like i said things i didn’t come close to saying. It’s actually pretty simple, the hype and public interest in this show and character are quite low, so people are wondering why marvel is allocating resources to a project almost nobody asked for, Especially when the term “over-saturation” is being thrown around with marvel so much.
Oh I watched it because literally all Avengers face eachother, not because of Spiderman..
Everyone was so trigger happy to see the MCU flop that they just ran with it and didn’t fully comprehend the statement. 😂
You can tell it was going to happen when Chapek slated Kang Dynasty and Secret Wars in the same calendar year. He had no clue what he was doing.   95% of this fan base doesn’t grasp that Marvel and Feige have a boss to answer to. Iger was behind the moves that really made the MCU a juggernaut so it’s good that he is back.
“I think one of the powerful aspects of being at Marvel Studios is having these films and shows hit the zeitgeist. It is harder to hit the zeitgeist when there's so much product out there — and so much 'content,' as they say, which is a word that I hate. [Laughs] We want Marvel Studios and the MCU projects to stand out.”  This is the quote from Feige.    Hitting the “zeitgeist” is when you are the only thing that’s being discussed across pop culture. For example they hit lightning in a bottle with WandaVision, it had everyone paying attention week to week.   Being that there are so much content and shows that capture the total attention of popular culture think (Andor, Severance, House of the Dragon, etc) if you release these around the same time you have a divided attention span within the audience.   So to combat this, they reshuffled the releases of their projects away from other major releases to give their projects the best chance to capture undivided attention week to week.   If I’m not mistaken the last 2 years had around 12 total MCU projects released (6 a year). This new reshuffle still has 6 releases a year (3 movies, 3 shows). There is no slowing down just better strategic planning for release and marketing.
"Its genuinely not at all interesting" ≠ "I'm not interested"
My dude, you were clearly implying that. Don’t try to back track.
It’s just not what I watch Star Wars for personally. Humdrum and boredom are not words I want to associate with the Galaxy Far Far Away.   I can watch a reality based thing for that 🤷🏻‍♂️😂 but each to their own really. I’m not gonna join a campaign against the show or anything 😂
I just kept feeling that way pretty much throughout. It had some bright spots though I won’t deny that and act like the whole show was crap or anything.
Maybe - he's not just a cameo in the series tho.
"I'm nothing without my stunt team"
I would also add that Kathryn Hahn's portrayal of Agatha was interesting, and her appearance in WandaVision was enough to build good will for her upcoming show. Echo's appearance in Hawkeye was a completely uninteresting snorefest, and her character was the worst part of the show. Zero hype for this show whatsoever.
I get what you're trying to say. Don't judge a book by its cover. Except the comparison would make sense if Echo wasn't such an E tier character. Iron Man was at least B tier in comicbook culture before the MCU even existed. It's a proven character that has over 60 years worth of stories as a sub or solo series. Comparing Agatha or Echo to Iron Man is like comparing Condiment King to Two Face or Mr Freeze.  There are characters like Spiderman and Batman where there are so much content and decent stories, Hollywood can pump out movies for those characters for the next few decades. No one cares about Echo. Maybe the few thousand Echo fans vs millions for whatever popular character these days.  An Echo and Agatha TV series over Nova is just laughable.
Ppl still don’t care considering the ratings for that show
That's logical fallacy. We're not comparing movies about new characters / movies about old characters. We're comparing movies about characters people ask about / movie about characters people never asked about. Marvel has dozens of characters people just dream to finally see in MCU / solo project, yet they greenlit obscure character that already had her chance in comicbooks and wasn't interesting to anybody at all.
I will be happy to see Kate Bishop again soon, I already miss her. I wish they'd invest in her character, Hailee Steinfeld was amazing and people really became attached to her after Hawkeye. If she is in Echo then she and Daredevil will be my main reason to watch it
Speculation and having expectations is not allowed
I agree with this! I thought Echo was kind of a badass in her own way. I think her relationship with Fisk is gonna be really cool to explore. And I think that Marvel has an eye for lower-tier comic characters and knows how to elevate them. I’d say I’m more excited for Echo than Wonder Man, Agatha, and Ironheart, personally.
She’s obnoxious as shit in her comics and I just don’t care for the character
Not looking forward to an upcoming show based on the footage I saw of the character in hawkeye, hope that helps you understand
No, I implied that people exist that might be interested. I absolutely did not imply appealing to them was the sole reason it was made. That's a different statement.   The point is just because you, personally, didn't "ask" for a show doesn't mean it wasn't worth making. Stop acting like you speak for everyone. It's absurd.
I get that and if the plan is to widen the scope of a franchise from a very narrow focus of telling the same trilogy story over and over then there will inevitably be shows people are less keen on even when others say it’s great.  The thing I really don’t get is there’s so much love for KOTOR and still nothing in that setting. They’re either playing a really long game or just don’t know what they’ve got.
I agree her portrayal was good, but in my opinion Agatha is a good example of less is more. I do want MORE of Agatha, but I think a whole miniseries about her takes away some of the mystery and excitement of the character. I'd prefer she shows up randomly with her own agenda to tear shit up like the badass she kind of was in WandaVision.  That's just my opinion on the subject thoufh
I’m sure deaf women like having a representation in media. I wouldn’t say “nobody cares about”
I don’t remember anyone asking about Cassian Andor so I don’t see how the comparison is a logical fallacy. I remember a lot of the same “who is this show for/why are they bothering” comments before Andor came out as I’m seeing for Echo. The two are directly comparable.
"iF yOu HaTe iT sO mUcH tHeN wHy ArE yOu HeRe??"  Some people want this sub to just be a literal circlejerk, and not even the chicanerous kind
MCU isn't the comics and if you don't care for the character, Just don't watch the show. I mean let others who enjoy the character enjoy the show.
I have absolutely no clue why you’re implying representation is important but refusing to come out and say it. But I’m not going to indulge whatever crisis you’re going through.
Oh I agree. I’m not hating on the show really. It just wasn’t something I enjoyed myself. And it’s a weird feeling to be so against the majority opinion haha. Doesn’t happen to me often. All I ever saw about it was praise tbh and I just didn’t get it myself.  And yeah. I’ve been waiting for KOTOR based content for a long long long time. The Old Republic era could be so rich. You can do ANYTHING with it. The current eras biggest problem imo is a lack of many evil force users because they are hamstrung by the canon of Sith being rare in the galaxy at this point/the rule of two. There was none of that shit thousands of years ago. Sith could be much more of a common enemy.   And Revan is simply a badass character that needs to be on screen at some point
I'm sure deaf women can speak for themselves. I mean, I'm not sure, but I suppose they can, so there's no need for you to speak for them, that's what I mean.
So force representation for the sake of quality content. Imo, if anything this feels like pandering because who walked away from Hawkeye saying, “I want more Echo?” Hell after his series I could careless about a second season of Hawkeye let alone her.
Me voicing my opinion doesn’t stop others from enjoying it lol 😂
Let me be direct: it's not a democracy. And *no* show is necessary. Marvel makes what they think will be interesting. Watch it or don't. But stop saying things like "no asked for this" because that's just being silly.
Just don’t fucking watch it if you’re not interested instead of bitching about it. Jfc
This has nothing to do with forced representation and everything to do with mediocre writing, which is the problem across the board with these shows.  They shouldn't stop trying out new or lesser known characters because the MCU wouldn't exist without that mindset.    What they should do is stop approving scripts that could benefit from another draft or complete re-write from a stronger writer.  It's boring ass writing that's hurting the MCU, not diversity.
I'm a hearing woman and I walked away wanting to see more of Echo.
Cool, not every piece of marvel media ever made was intended with you as the target audience. Why get so bent out of shape over a show you can just… not watch? Idk. Let people enjoy things
I mean you want the show to be cancelled. If that wish came true, others won't be able to enjoy the show. I was talking from that perspective. Also Ironheart has more than a year worth of post-production to go through. It's filming wrapped last year and it's supposedly coming out next year.
I think people misinterpreted my “forced representation” comment. I’m for representation and diversity. What I’m not for is checking off boxes for specific demographics just to say hey we’re representing insert group here. I consider that pandering and not genuine representation. And I’m saying that simply based off how they wrote her character in Hawkeye. She wasn’t written well enough to justify making a series about her to begin with. That’s why I’m having a hard time trying to figure out what other reason could it be but pandering.
I’m a hearing man and I’m interested in seeing Echo in her own series. 🤷🏽‍♂️   Dude up there has severe main character syndrome and thinks he speaks for everyone 🙄
Because he feels that if you or I get what we want, that means he's not getting what he wants. And that just cannot stand.   As a native man, I'm stoked to see a native superhero go out and kick ass.
The problem is more people are complaining about the quality of MCU. I don’t have to watch it but I’m a Marvel/MCU fan and I would like to see them prioritize quality over pandering. This is one of the reasons MCU is changing up shit as  is. Let’s stop pretending like there was a mass influx of ppl demanding a Echo series after watching an underwhelming Hawkeye season.   And if I’m not the target audience then who the hell is? As of late,MCU isn’t really winning casual non comic book fans over or art house type of audiences over either.   IMO, nothing feels genuine about this character having her own series. If they wrote her better I would say differently
The show could be great. That’s fair. It does have a lot going against it though. Namely that the character from the comics does in fact, suck, and that (in my opinion), the characterization we saw in the MCU wasn’t that much of a departure from that character. Could be good. Could be bad. Wouldn’t be surprising if it was bad. Much like Echo!
The groot one is my favorite
You can go 🤞
Thanks, please suggest some ideas please!
They don't need to top it. Trying to constantly go bigger will eventually tire people out.  I say do more stories with the X-Men, Fantastic Four and all those characters that they have and will introduce in the Multiverse Saga.
Secret Wars is three years away. Let's wait for it to come out before we starting worrying about the next saga.
Personally I would want them to collapse the "multi-verse" in the MCU after secret wars, perhaps even squash the quantum realm? Getting rid of time-travel and multiversal travel going forwards to keep the stakes up.
Honestly, I think Marvel should scale back significantly after Secret Wars. Endgame felt like a "where can they go from here" movie, and I think SW has a monumental hill to climb just to match that level of grandeur. Afterwards, pull back and focus on smaller stories and characters. Don't get too caught up in the "what's next" mentality.
I imagine after the next 2 Avengers films, we see a bit of a reset (not a full reboot).  I could see the multiverse coalescing down to another iteration of the “Sacred Timeline” kind of situation and our new universe has the likes of the X-Men, F4, etc.    I don’t think it will be too hard for them to lower the stakes from universal & multiversal threats down to ground level or international/global.  And I honestly don’t think the fanbase will mind, either.  We will be ~20 years into the MCU and they could orchestrate it into an almost “hopping off” or “jumping on” point for the continued franchise.
That's why I wish they'd do more grounded stuff like Homecoming. I liked Ms. Marvel because it was so grounded, but why did she have to save the universe? Same with Moon Knight - it worked really well as a psychological minefield with cultists, but the kaiju fight between gods was its weakest point.  It really strains when every climax is bigger than the last, and reduces everyday people (the whole reason why heroes do this) to scenery, if they're around at all.
You’re not wrong. Same way I feel about mcu Spiderman 4, what can you do after you do a film like No way Home. But that’s beside the point, MCU has to move onto the X-men and fantastic four, more importantly the X-men. You need a great director or bring russos back. But you need to somehow make mcu world in a way that X-men work, let’s say the events of secret wars makes everyone on earth just hate ppl with powers after all mess they caused now mutants slowly emerge. Creates a great atmosphere for the X-men
You don’t need to go bigger every single story, and it won’t work if you try.  Take Spider-Man for instance: No Way Home was fantastic, but going bigger after that is NOT the way to go. Instead they should be (and supposedly are) going smaller, more personal with the next story arc.  That’s where they should go with the MCU *as a whole* after the Multiverse Saga. The next avengers threat shouldn’t be “all of reality may end” but “earth may be taken over” or something like that. Go smaller, with a more personal, emotional conflict.
You might find it weird but it’s already  given us Krasinski as mr fantastic 3 spidermen  Black Bolt, Quicksilver A deadpool movie with wolverine and TVA, And xmen and fantastic 4 still got OPTIONS, Slow your roll and enjoy the ride,  Dooms gonna be massive
There is so so so much more material. There's a reason people are still buying comics that have been in publication for 40-60+ years.   Without Google my thoughts instantly go to onslaught (hell....everything xmen:Sauron, Mr Sinister, Omega Red,Mojo,etc), galactus, annihulus, super skull, mephisto....there's more if I sat and really thought on it but I'm fairly confident we will be getting marvel movies long after any of us here are gone at the pace they get these stories out.
What is so inventive about Battle world anyway?
After secret Wars is 100% making X-Men and F4 family the center of the MCU. Avengers will only assemble for the end of saga films.
See my main problem is what are they going to do with Doom? Dooms a very very complex character who needs a shit ton of development, like years of development. He's also easily the scariest villain in Marvel because there is no permanently getting rid of him ever. Doom is easily the cockroach of cockroaches. He can facetank everything and survive, EVERYTHING!   Also just to let you know Doom can survive on pure willpower, hatred, and anger. Dude was thrown back in time 100 million years, heart turned into stone, blood turned into acid, and he survived all of that time only to come back and masquerade himself as the Marquis of Death's apprentice just to kill him. And the Marquis of Death could literally destroy entire universes like nothing.
We're kind of seeing this with DC.  They already had they're multiverse event, and now they're sticking to the multiverse.  Animation and movies are separate and are part of the DC universe, and don't necessarily contradict each other. If one thing works in a movie, they reinterpret in a animated project, and then maybe do an actual crossover.  Marvel is still separated (Sony/universal*) so it might be harder for them to combine everything. Since DC kind of took their time to tangibly connect the multiverse, it feels marvel is trying to do that now

You won’t have to worry about that if they keep the current writers for secret wars and kangs dynasty
People have been concerned since Endgame
Doom. That’s where we go after, earthbound and Doom!
The summit for the MCU was Infinity War, and once you reach the top there is only one place to go, the only success since is Spiderman and Sony makes them. So far phase 5 hasn't started well, Antman was a total failure. They need to fix Thor....again. They let a man child ruin one of the best villains in Gorr the god butcher, anybody who has read the comic would surely agree, its goes on and on.
They have to make it through these movies and stick the landing first, before worrying about what comes next.  Honestly, these Avengers movies are the ones I'm least looking forward to. The feat of putting more characters on the screen than IW/EG seems like it's just a numbers game.   Please give me some good FF and X-Men movies if you want me invested in the future of the MCU.
The answer isn’t to try and go bigger.
I think they will just reboot after secret wars, or keep it as it is and focus more on the mutants side of things
It’s the perfect opportunity to recast and reboot the whole thing, keeping what’s working and getting rid of what isn’t while fully adding in FF and X-Men.
Just get ready to reboot to be 100% honest. There will be a whole new generation of fans for them to start over with and rake in all that cash again
I think they should focus on some other heroes and their back stories. Not everything has to be a buildup for some grand finale.
Civil War II
It's comic book storytelling, there will always be something on the horizon. There are plenty of more big time crossover events in Marvel History, maybe not on the scale of universal destruction or multiversal war but plenty, for sure.   House of M  World War Hulk  Dark Reign  Avengers vs X-Men  Axis  Civil War 2  Onslaught  Contest of champions
Honestly I don't want to see it be topped. I think it would make more sense and take more effort to make a consistent almost general cinematic/tv universe. I think if done the right way marvel could hit their stride of the best comic book content in this period. Like we're past Thanos and Kang and universe destroying events. Through the multiverse, through many tragic deaths of heroes...we've seen a live action modok and some wild out there looking comic accurate designs now already. So everything doesn't need to be down to earth and we can glide into some true comic accurate stuff. Give us an avengers team within a tv show or movies that's just dealing with life and earths own big bads. Like a non cheesy version of CW shows or 90s live action shows with some major cues of the 90s cartoons (X-Men, Spider-Man, etc.) Spider-Man in his daily life working at the daily bugle, helping at feast with Miles, fighting doc oc, hammerhead, Mac gargan, black cat, etc. X-Men dealing with juggernaut on the loose,  fighting sabretooth, or another general villain. Maybe a Young Avengers tv show. Movies then could just be one off lighter team up movies that don't need to result in some addition continuation and purely unique else world stories(basically an expanded what if universe).
They're doing the multiverse thing this early becoz they want to merge the fox universe with the mcu . and the events of Kang dynasty and secret wars will be the perfect catalyst for it.
James Gunn basically just said this in regards to writing a movie post-endgame. He emphasized that the stories have to be *about the characters*.   GotG3, though it isn't out yet, looks likes it's entirely about Rocket. His origin, his connection to the living tribunal and how he'll feel responsible to stop him   Edit: I meant high evolutionary, my bad.
Yeah this was my immediate reaction after reading the main question of this post. They're probably not going to "top it" in terms of scale ever. I find that extremely hard to believe that it would even be possible. What they need to do is then live with that world. Figure out what the new status quo is after Secret Wars and just give us stories that are natural progressions of all the character's journeys.  I think, to a certain point, the "saga" structure is a little restrictive in the sense that there has to be a culmination, an ending. They have to build to something. I would hope that, after Secret Wars, they maybe evaluate that they don't need a big event to build up to. Just make good stories with the cool characters.
My theory: we already saw the "end" of the MCU. It was episode 6 of Loki.  All time happens all of the time, and the multiverse leads to a multiversal war. He who remains kept the multiverse in check, he's gone, it goes wild, he exists again, eventually wins the war, Loki and Sylvie find and kill him,   rinse repeat.   So we're gonna get the story of the multiversal wars for the next X years, it getting solved and merged into one universe, and then we can have infinite spin offs forever.
I understand that, but it’s going to feel a bit strange seeing them raise the stakes so high at the end of this saga before lowering them again in the next saga. If you ask me, I’d say they should have saved the Multiverse Saga for the far future (I’m talking towards the end of the MCU, assuming they’d even end it anyway).
Yeah, this. Honestly, I'm kinda annoyed at how so many people expected the Phase 4 films to be even bigger than Endgame, which was the culmination of three phases of build-up. And as you say, there's not even a reason to go bigger every time. Like, there can be some big villains still (Galactus, some Celestials could threaten Earth), but I'd still enjoy it if we got some more down to Earth stories.  Have the X-Men fight it out with the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants; have the Fantastic Four thwart Doom's latest plan, only to discover they were fighting a Doombot while Doom relaxed at Latveria; have Spider-Man take on Kingpin in order to save New York...
Probably gonna get delayed though if we’re being honest. I’m probably gonna guess another 4/5 years from now.
You’re right. But I just find it strange that Marvel is exploring the multiverse this early in the game instead of saving it for down the road. Like, given how grand and ambitious the multiverse is, you would think they would save it for the last few phases in the MCU.   They could have dedicated this current saga to introducing the X-Men and Fantastic Four, and have them all work with the Avengers defeat the Skurlls or some other threat unrelated to the multiverse.   But who knows. Maybe Marvel will surprise me!
To add to this, with the MCU likely having a bunch of different heroes and groups at that point, it'll be easier to play with the level of the stakes more because each set of characters is dealing with their own things.
I hope they find a way to do the reset & establish the mutants being a part of human history, not a new development for mankind.
I haven’t seen those shows yet, but I see where you’re coming from.   I’m against adapting Secret Wars to the big screen. After all, some of the actors aren’t going to be around forever. I also think the idea of a bunch of heroes and villains being brought together in a fragmented world sounds epic!  However, I’m worried how they’re going to pull it off given how many characters they’ll be introducing, and the way phases 4 and 5 have been received and handled so far.
Enter Senator Kelly.
Oh I understand! I just find it strange that they’re delving into the multiverse this early in the game instead of down the line.
A bunch of fragmented universes combined into one. Think of all the different regions the filmmakers can explore!
I feel this saga may be the end of the mcu. Was a good run 70% of the time I’ll give it that. They just keep hiring the wrong people, the fact they havbt fired Loveness and Waldron is very concerning.
They tried that in phase 4 and people complained
I think you mean the high evolutionary not the living tribunal. Unless rockets revealed to be near the top of the cosmic hierarchy with order, chaos, death, eternity etc lol.
>I would hope that, after Secret Wars, they maybe evaluate that they don't need a big event to build up to. Just make good stories with the cool characters.  That's exactly what Feige said they would be doing after Endgame ended.  But the minute WandaVision premiered, people were already looking for clues for what the next big saga is going to be about. They were disappointed when that show ended with no Dr. Strange or Mr. Fantastic cameo or no Multiverse cross-over with the X-Men.   They were asking themselves "why do we need this movie?" when Black Widow came out, especially since Loki was airing at the same time and was painting a bigger picture of the Multiverse and gave some headings to where we're going.   The number 1 question when Eternals came out was: "But how does that connect to the Avengers and the Multiverse etc etc?"  During the entirety of Phase 4 people asked "where exactly is this headed? how are they gonna connect all this to the next big event movie? how will all this culminate? how does X story connect with Y story?"  And of course, posts like the above have been more and more recurring in the last couple of years.  For good or bad, people have been conditioned to see the MCU as an episodic medium with each project doing something on its own but also adding a brick to an overall storyline that has to end with a huge event culminating every single moment that has come before.  The saddest part is that this line of thinking after Endgame had come out and people had the entire picture laid out in front of them. They see the Infinity Saga through rose-tinted glasses because now they can go back and see how each project informed the next and how every detail mattered for Endgame. Back when the Infinity Saga was airing, people didn't care as much. Sure, there was some confusion about what some projects like Iron Man 3, Ant-Man or GotG Vol. 2 were building up to, but people didn't seem to care as much as they do now and they definitely didn't value these movies less or more because they were more self-contained.   I actually think the reason for this might be that IW and EG CREATED many new fans, because the hype of these movies was so unparalleled that it brought it complete newbies. These people essentially binged the entire MCU in one go and they saw how things were building off of each other and then immediately got a conclusion to all that build-up making it feel like an actual TV show binging. And now, those same people can't just chill and watch these projects as they come out.  Either way, if the MCU continues doing Sagas with "Endgames", I'm not fully against it, and while I would like to see a recreation of the Silver and Bronze Age of Comics where each character just had their own comic book run and just having chill, self-contained stories that didn't lead anywhere, I don't think the fans of the MCU want that.
It may feel a bit strange at first, but if we keep going for low stakes we can build up again and in mu mind that'll be the best thing for cinematic universes in general
In a perfect world waiting for the 3rd or 4th saga would be ideal for multiverse stuff but the fox actors won’t be around forever. The average age of that cast is prob 45-50.
Haven't we already seen that though? Endgame had the entire timeline and the fates of half the universe at risk only to be followed up by a Spider-Man field trip and Wanda taking over a small town. No Way Home then had multiversal stakes with hordes of Spider-Man villains potentially transporting into the MCU only to end with Peter swinging off silently over New York. We've seen plenty of small-stakes stories since the end of the last saga because that's how you keep things interesting. As long as they build off of where the characters end up at the end of Secret Wars, it shouldn't matter how big the next thing is. Approach stories from new angles because sometimes there's a limit to just going bigger.
Xmen and fantastic 4 weren’t ready off the back of end game the fox deal was about to go through.. it’s just not realistic they’ve always planted seeds let them flourish over time
Since their plan apparently is to integrate characters from past franchises like Fox's X-Men and Fantastic 4 (if I'm wrong, let me know) they probably want to do it while the actors still can.  Hugh Jackman will be pushing 60 and Tobey Maguire will be 50 when the movie releases.  As far as post-Secret Wars, I'd be interested in seeing a new X-Men story, maybe with someone like Mr. Sinister or Trask as an antagonist.  Have a threat like Galactus be the endgame villain for the MCU as a whole.
Exactly!  All it takes is Villain XYZ to not coincidentally interact with multiple supers (or teams) across various projects and Marvel will have a pretty solid foundation to telling a few different siloed story archs that don't blow up to epic proportions.  I just don't see there being fans out there that would hate a more tempered approach after this next gigantic event.  EDIT: tempered may not be the best word there, but you know what I mean.
I figure they could take the opportunity to pick and choose elements from different universes to establish our MCU’s new “canon” like they have done in comics.  Mutants “always” existing feels like a top candidate to be part of that so we aren’t starting from scratch.
Bingo
He's such a slimeball. I can imagine how he oozes into a room right now.
The entire MCU has been weird imo. They've changed alot of things that worked well in the comics and made them infinitely worse, then they go ahead and kill pretty much every villian off.   I think the multiverse was a good direction to go in since it was an easy way to cop out of previously bad choices made with the universe
I understand your concern. But let’s just give them some time. Since Marvel is slowing down the output of their content in the coming years, maybe that’ll give them to chance to make good movies and shows.
Word, my bad.
Rocket Raccoon vs the Living Tribunal: Who would win?  For the record, LT is legions more powerful than all those you listed.
Even if they were, Marvel wouldn't do anything with them for a time because there were director and writer and producer contracts tied to those properties and Feige wants them to expire before launching the MCU counterparts with a clean slate.    I think they expire in 2024 or 2025.
The original plan was to go full cosmic but the james gunn debacle derailed that
Like Ted Cruz but with more douche?
Problem is doesn’t matter how long you give them you need people with talent writing these projects. Waldron admitted he had all the time he wanted to rewrite multiverse of madness because of covid and that’s what we got.   So multiversal of madness was him working at his absolute peak and he’s writing Secret Wars, is this really what we want?
Honestly that plot sounds pretty good
He got one shot by order and chaos lol
What even was the debacle again?
Sure, let's go with that. (I was hinting at >!what happened to Kelly in the first movie!<.)
But maybe Secret Wars will be good! I want to be optimistic.
Eh, when was this? That doesn't really make sense -- they're the Supreme being of their universe, but he's the judge who resides over all universes.  In Infinity Gauntlet, Eternity just barely lost to Thabos with the Infinity Gems. Shortly thereafter, LT casually *changed the rules* for the Infinity Gems.
A bad-faith political propagandist didn't like that Gunn was criticizing his side of the aisle, so he dug up a bunch of 5-10 year old edgelord gross-out tweets Gunn used to make before Marvel/Disney hired him (& which Marvel/Disney *already knew about*) to slander Gunn. Alan Horn, then president of Walt Disney Pictures, overreacted to the negative press & fired Gunn against Feige's (& Iger's!) wishes. About half a year (& a lot of protests by fans & the GotG cast) later, they rehired Gunn, but by then he'd already started working on The Suicide Squad & Peacemaker for DC.  The timing was especially disruptive because Gunn had *just* submitted his first draft for GotG 3 before he was fired; that movie was originally scheduled for the May 2020 release slot that later went to Black Widow.
Sorry.  You're totally right.  He can pretty much slide out of every situation he is in.    The movie is like 23 years old.  I don't think spoilers are needed.  But sorry for not catching on earlier.
In al Ewing’s ultimates. With Al Ewing being on a bit of a quest to rewrite the marvel cosmology as you probably already know he seems to have nerfed him a good bit to still be a cosmic judge but more on a power level with the other entities.
Ooooooh, yeah I read the arc of that where they changed up Galactus. It was pretty decent. Makes sense that'd be the book to nerf LT haha.  Personally I do prefer when these characters are just so above everything else that nothing can even fathom their power. Has a Lovecraftian feel to it.
That was because the new multiverse was still essentially forming and certain traditional cosmic hierarchies hadn't yet solidified. They can't match the tribunal regularly.
It’s almost as though he wants eternity to take that role of “unimaginable power” with the tribunal as the judge below him as Ewing has started to refer to eternity as this representation of the 8th cosmos and the multiverse post secret wars in both his ultimates and defenders.   But it can be a bit confusing because of the lack of consistency between other writers. Like the dr strange arc a couple years after his ultimates with galctus where dr strange absorbs all the universes energies and is just chilling there in a white room with eternity who tells him he needs to ask the tribunal for permission to remake the universe.
Lol, well there wasn't really much consistency in the old days either. In Silver Surfer, I forget the writer (mightve been Ron Marz), but they established Galactus as like the third "in-between" force to balance Death and Eternity. But that's really never mentioned anywhere else... And then in Quasar (I think), Engelhardt established Eternity and Infinity are really the same entity seen from different perspectives, as are Death and Oblivion.  The rule is kinda just "keep it weird, keep it interesting."
The "self humanization" of nebula looks and character has been one of my favourite  things in the mcu, loved her in infinity war and endgame cuz of this, the paper football bit was my fav
She definitely remodified herself with parts that are closer to her physical features then what thanos had given her. She’s starting to become an actual Guardian member and less adopted daughter of thanos.
She got rid of the metal thing on her face! I wonder if part of her story will be trying to physically, as well as mentally, be closer to the person she would be if she’d never met Thanos. I’m not even sure what her species is normally supposed to look like
Particularly that last picture definitely made her look differently than how she previously was.
Now that she isn't with Thanos all the time, and is spending time with the guardians, people who really care about each other, it is changing her perspective.  &#x200B;  Also she saw how Gamorra, someone who always beat her and was always victorious,and always cruel from her perspective, she saw how the original Gamorra fell in love with Peter Quill. Something she has never experienced and likely  wants deep down inside. So her environment has changed, she is around loving people and witnessing it, and in some ways its starting to rub off on her. This is naturally going to soften Nebula and we are seeing the results.
I thought I remember seeing a scene (maybe in the holiday special) where she said she removed some of the implants Thanos forced on her.
“Nebula as the Gen Z Seven of Nine” is a good jam.
Makes sense to be honest first proper film of her post thanos
It’s the eyebrow, I think
I’m going to also assume that this is easier to just digitally animate onto her face like they did for Vision than to have her sit through hours of makeup everyday to film.
She’s always been hot and I’ll stand by that
I love Nebula with all my heart.
The look change in most of these characters seem like an excuse to speed up vfx production or save vfx money.. also the earlier groot look was way better
Honestly looks like a drop in vfx budget to me
Agreed, But groot keeps getting worse 💀 the latest awful one is the walking head in the latest trailer
For sure. I think she is somehow going to lead the new team of Guardians.   RIP old Guardians.
Sometimes I'm happy with the decisions they make with comic book characters in the movies.
That’s awesome that the team is getting the Annihilation era uniforms.
It doesn't look very good TBH
Eventually she'll just be blue Amy Pond.
...She looks exactly the same?
She looks the same to me, but maybe I just need a side-by-side. That said, her humanization throughout the movies is one of my favorite character arcs. Hurt people hurt people until they actually feel loved and accepted. It’s beautiful and so well done.
Probably to make it easier to apply the make up
Not a fan of the less-mechanical look. Part of it is because make-up departments are lazier nowadays and don’t want to spend extra time prepping actors. This is similar to the *nano-tech suits* where it’s CGI laziness to just add a dithered wipe transition for a helmet versus something more complex and mechanical.
Idk still looks pretty alien to me
She, in my opinion, is one of the most complex characters in the MCU. Karen is an amazing actor to pull it off✌️
Looks exactly the same. No idea what this post is talking about.
Billy Corgan looking ass
It's because she's CGI now lol
My girl cosplays her sometimes ;)
Her eye
Wild Berry Pop Tart goddess
Her voice is much less robotic now than it was in the first film too
I dont see it
Well given that earth was her “home base” for 5 years, she’s bound to be more human like than her old self. Hell she probably knows more about earth than Quill at this point
If you want to none theory reason it is to save on makeup time which for these kind of things can take hours.
to be loved is to be changed i guess
Removing the mechanical parts further distancing her self form thanos makes sense. It’s very likely the galaxy still hates her for being a daughter of thanos and the further she can get away from it the better. Showing she is reformed to galaxy moving forward.
She's had a damn good character arc in the MCU. Endgame reminded me how much of an asshole she used to be
I noticed some of the robotic bits on her face are gone
did i miss something? why does she look and act like more human?
Ohh she got rid of the bit around her eye, I was wondering why she looked different, but I couldn't place it. thanks for the side-by-side!
newbula
Even in the recent trailer she still hates the colour of her own eyes.  That isn't healthy. And it would not be that hard to change the parts out. But I suspect Thanos actually DID put state of the art cybernetic parts into her, so despite Nebula wishing to rip out everything, she probably has trouble finding at least equivalent tech to replace them with. Thanos is evil but he takes upgrades seriously.
I think Nebula's arc is my favorite. She retained her killer skills and persona while adding some human traits and finding some redemption.
Nebula is a Kang variant
I literally just realized she doesn’t have the mechanical part around her eye anymore
Nebula has been best in the last few movies. Almost everything she says that isn't sad as hell, is hilarious. She's just so annoyed with everything.
I think it's more like the X-Men's Mystique case u know
That too but mostly poor makeup and cg
Maybe that is why Peter finally noticed her eyes, because there is more life in them.
I liked the metal thing on the side of her face but hey, she’s free now. You do you.
She’s become one of my favorite characters.   Went from hating her in GOTG (while having a bit of sympathy) to being really into her story and character. I’m glad she got the focus and talent to make that happen
that paper football shit made me cry when she didnt know how to react to winning
Her character was my favourite in Endgame!! Her whole arc and character ist just so tragic, yet she is so strong and full of "humanity".  The whole redemption with Gamora and her finding her new family in a way, and ways to trust others again, was just so emotionally done.  It's not gonna be the same without OG Gamora (also for Peter) 😢
Here she stands, the hero, a Garden of the Galaxy...
She is beyond Guardians, she is technically also member of the avengers along with rocket.
Also known as Karen is starting to get real tired of the 12 hour make up sessions. So let's ~~pull something out of our ass~~ try to cut it down to 6
I know Gunn is more creative than this, but I hope Disney doesn’t push to give her a full head of hair and less drastic makeup and prosthetics. I’m being reminded of Jennifer Lawrence’s Mystique makeup getting shittier and shittier as the X-Men reboot movies progressed. I know a lot of it had to do with her hating the time it took to get into makeup, as well as being sick of the role itself, but still. Disney & Co have had some weird and awful missteps post-Endgame, so not much would surprise me now.
[This](https://i.imgur.com/jvvT9AS.jpg) was how they depicted her in “What If…?” on D+, in a timeline where she was never raised or modified by Thanos. Although Vol 3 does seem to raise some potential issues with this design since in the trailer she has a line about her black eyes not being her natural ones.
She's a Luphomoid, they're basically just blue skinned humans.  You see her [pre-cyborg modification](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/marvelcinematicuniverse/images/3/3c/Heist_Nebula.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20210906003634) in What If.
In What If she had hair and no mechanical parts. So probably that.
Your profile picture is dope.
I just never noticed how black her eyes were.
Seven of nine flashback lol
Agreed
I mean....she's Karen Gillan.
I mean someone prolly decapitated him. It just shows how resilient he is.
Come along, Nebula!
the metallic eye piece
nebula is done with makeup and prosthetic makeup
yeah she was great in the hollyday special too
Same!  I think her character development is pretty underrated despite it being one of the most well done in the MCU.
I agree completely. Her story arc so far is my second favorite in the MCU, behind Steve Rogers.
Yeah, you made me remember the pre eg meme of tony and nebula smashing in deep space
I think that’s because she never won anything. She wasn’t the favored child who always did everything right like gamora. It was a big deal for her.
She may be an avenger but her and rocket are guardians at heart.
It's not really "pull something out of our ass" when it's been a major part of her character's journey the entire time to feel more human and less machine
This is the real reason. They did exactly the same thing with Drax, simplifying his prosthetics.
Well, considering they're going for comic accuracy I wouldn't be surprised if they gave Nebula long blonde hair. It was even in What If iirc.
You didn’t like the blonde wig in “What if?”
In Jennifer Lawrence’s case she was actually allergic to the paint they were using. After that they only painted her from the neck up and that’s why after First Class she’s barely ever in blue form.
I'd be really disappointed. I love Karen and I support her and I think she's naturally beautiful but yo, this is an alien with like 80% cybernetic parts inflicted on her by the worst cosmic extinction level threat the universe has ever seen.  You don't really fix that with the power of love, you know??
I think in that timeline she was still raised by Thanos.  Their scenes showed that she still hate him for what he was like, and T'Challa was trying to convince her that Thanos is now a changed man.    It seems that either Thanos didn't go that far in modifying her yet because he had reformed before then.  Or possibly Thanos might have reversed what he can of the modifications.  Seems like the eyes just aren't something he can reverse.
i felt a certain way every time she said Cha Cha
So she didn't blue herself. Interesting.
Maybe she just got those because she needed glasses and these were cooler
It seemed implied that he modified her, but stopped once T'Challa talked him out of his ways so she wasn't modified as much.
They were replaced by her father as a method of torture
"Go get Kevin Bacon!"  "I've got him."  "Can't outrun me Bacon."  Lmao.
That holiday special was amazing.   I could watch the Drax and Mantis show all day. They have such good chemistry together
I'm sorry, what!!
This guy knows how to read a room!
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)got a link?
Not just never winning. It was the first time in her life she played a game where the point was simply to have fun. It's not violent or painful. And the loser doesn't get tortured.  And I think it's also a defining moment for Tony that makes him realize he wants children.
Also the opponent congratulated her on a game well played instead of hate her for it.
She is still a guardians, but the avengers also respect both and thankful of them for their help during the crisis.
What’s crazy in canonically her and Rocket were Avengers longer than they were Guardians.
True, but I want more of Nebula sassy strutting into the team base and being passive-aggressive with Scott as she passes, or more of rocket scoffing at how actually smart Tony is.
Agreed. It’s not out of nowhere. She’s been trying to get away from thanos for a long time and now that she has a new family, she can finally become her own person and this is the first step for that.
Sure, phrasing was a bit strong, but the point still stands.  Every single actor that has to go through this type of extensive make up comes out years later saying that it was a pain in the ass, and a very taxing process. Batista recently said as much.   I'm sure if she has had any input on her character's look, she must have steered them in any way she could to reducing that time.   And her look here kind of corroborates it
I... I like that "Bond Spy" look too 😅
comic accurate wouldn't be blonde  https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50094/1001866315/original/she-was-key-to-defeating-thanos-in-infinity-gauntlet-but-she-was-never-a-complete-hero-photo-u1
Which episode was that again? Having trouble remembering the exact one.
Veronica Lake Nebula calling T'Challa/Star Lord "Cha-cha" was unexpectedly steamy.
I only watched a couple of them with my nephew, I need to go back and actually pay attention and watch the whole series.
> It seems that either Thanos didn't go that far in modifying her yet because he had reformed before then  Nebula got each of her modifications when she failed in fights with Gamora, that episode of What If never mentioned Gamora (from my recollection), and I can't find any mention of that universe having a version of her, so if Nebula was Thanos' only daughter, she may not have gotten any cybernetics.
seemed easy enough for thor lol
[~~Toosh~~ Touché](https://youtu.be/2bQMjmVmkF4)
He... He picked a pretty set.
She became one of my fav in like 5 minutes in gotg2 , unlike her comic counterpart
Tony absolutely would tho
Oh you were not there
I will take that as a compliment
Didn't he seem to want children in Infinity War, during his introduction with Pepper
Star-Lord T'challa
They were definitely fuckin'
If you do, be sure to watch them in order
Thor got an eye replaced and that's still an artificial eye.  I'm guessing Thanos most can't give her back her original organic eyes, so might as well keep the current ones instead of giving her new artificial ones.
Yeah I bet. He's got Jarvis and his super suits
He’s hooked up with Gamora in the comics. Nebula is a bit jealous
Sauce?
"Want" was probably the subtext, yes. The direct statement was just that he'd had a dream it happened & was asking her if his dream was true.
"Hey Cha-Cha"   Love that episode
Thank you!
Will do, thanks for the tip!
Comic Tony would do anything that moves.
They didnt it was a meme
Basically, there was a running joke shortly after Endgame's release that Tony Stark and Nebula had sexual intercourse.
Her cybernetic body, think of the possibilities!  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=t9O_f6R3Tfo
Idk, Robert Downey Jr doing Karen Gillan just looks weird in my head
Dunno where to find it was 5 years ago
I mean…. Now I kinda think they might have… guess it’s head canon.
[Try this on for size](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DdhJHOSVMAAIV3p.jpg)
I think a YouTube channel CartoonHooligans mentioned that joke in a video about How Endgame should've ended. With Morgan saying Who is that Blue Lady and her kid ?
Lol I mean they could have but remember, it was only a few weeks
That has a very different connotation when we're talking android sex.
#GAMORA SMASH
Gamora🍜
I always felt bad for Gamora and Tony in this, she was too much for him. Girl didn't even take everything off
Oh yeah i  remember that
Stay true to your beloved wife or take the once-in-a-lifetime chance of smashing a blue alien cyborg chick in a frickin space ship before dying...? I think he thought about it a lot.
Would tho
Dude, *weeks* trapped in a ship, with not much to do, not knowing if you’re gonna get out? That idea would be floated at hour 3.
Android sex ain't cheating. Everybody knows that
The comics have already done an America Chavez origin retcon and it kinda fits with your ideas.  America now has a sister and the same powers were given to both by a villain who was experimenting on children. The Utopian parallel was indeed a fake and her moms were just random scientists looking for a cure for their daughters mystery illness.   Not a long jump from that new origin to your idea.
Yes, this is a much more refined theory, I like the idea of Kangs portals being a better version of America's and the utopian parallel being Kangs creation makes perfect sense.
Do we have to tie EVERYTHING to Kang?
If we are tying everything to kang, I would very much like them to introduce Mr. Gryphon and make him another exiled Variant who has been given the job to break earth's defences.   He is the one who hired Val, purchased stark tower and was sunny birchs benefactor.   He could be a norman Osborn figure who leads an attack on Wakanda (Seige adaptation)
> America now has a sister and the same powers were given to both by a villain who was experimenting on children. The Utopian parallel was indeed a fake and her moms were just random scientists looking for a cure for their daughters mystery illness.  I hate it so much and for as many problems as that original solo run had, the origin wasn't one of them. Very glad the movie version kept the original and hope they side-step the awful retcon.
It was inspired by that retcon that I have read and I do prefer her old origin but the new one is a good origin atory and does bring about a moral debate with the mothers. Who knows, maybe they'll adapt the Demiurge into a Goliath like figure.
Too much just fits together for this to be a coincidence
Seeing as he's the big bad right now it makes sense a lot of things would connect to him eight now
Now that, is a great idea.
Fuuuuuuuuuuck no
I also prefer the original backstory as I find it a tad more unique and gives the interesting fact of America not being of 616 and I can't name another main line hero who is like that other than Gwenpool. Maybe Spider-Gwen but is she even in the main line continuity I have no idea. But now she's kind of lost that intrigue that a hero of that nature has.
Kang went back in time to be CEO of many science companies.   Hes the one that created the genetically engineered spider that made spiderman   He also made the chemicals that blinded Daredevil.   He pushed him in front of the truck too.   Kang also kept putting meth in steve Steve Rodgers cereal as a kid that made him 110 pounds soaking wet
Isn't Miles originally from the Ultimate universe but he got transported to 616?
Maybe Kang might've influenced certain events in history such as [insert famous history event here]
when?
I'm talking about the comics here. I remember reading that Miles originated in the Ultimate comics and then after Secret Wars he was part of the 616 universe.
Loved that they used a practical upper suit like they did for the first few Iron-Mans.
can't wait to see her final suit in her show
Didn’t really find the character interesting in WF. Is she a good comics character? Hopefully the show turns it around for me.
Jesus you could take a tire iron to those abs and it would bounce off
Ok
Awful costume, IMO.
The new Iron Man........![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
If Duke was looking at me like that, I would be wimpering, not laughing.
"Talk to the hand" as us oldheads used to say.
The one in Wakanda Forever looked way too advanced and CG-looking. I hope she can have one sort of on the level of the first Iron Man, and not the later suits from IW/Endgame that looked very CG.
[removed]
Yeah, I found her a prick, not even an entertaining one like Tony at the start just a prick. Though that could just be RDJ's natural charisma leaking through in the performance. Then she nearly drowned and whoops! There goes her personality! Seriously I can not name a single trait she had after that moment.
The only people who call her that are people who don't know anything about her. Tony was legit her mentor☠️
It looked like a power rangers suit.  Awful design
Yeah I have zero knowledge of her, but open to her being rad. They just didn’t give her much in WF besides “here have a finished suit!”. Like the arc was non-existent. Invincible Ironman? Down for it. I know barely anything about the comics but would love to start! What’s her first run?
I didn’t find her a prick. I found her a very uninteresting very smart and confused college girl. Didn’t really give us anything interesting about her as a person, just really bland. No suit arc just from trash suit to best suit you can get right away. Zero feeling for her character.
You definitely already had a bias against her and you could've just said that instead of trying to push some dead narrative
When did that happen in the movies?
The MCU just follow current social trends, every white male is dumb.
Invincible ironman vol3 #7 and Ironheart 2019
Happens all the time in here.
She's in the comics.
I'm blocking you now, you clearly didn't know Riri was her own original character who worked alongside Tony, Rhodey and was on a team called 'Champions' I bet the next thing you'll say is she's "woke"
Awesome thanks!
>I don't even think the MCU is in the comic multiverse  It's self-evidently true they can't be, for the obvious reason that Marvel Studios and Marvel Comics are separate creative entities, operating in different mediums.  For instance, either entity might choose to do catastrophic things to the multiverse in their own medium. The other entity shouldn't be forced to incorporate that in their own storytelling.  If Marvel Studios destroys that entire MCU multiverse for good in KD/SW, I wonder if fans will still insist it's all one thing.
Correct. When the comics named the MCU as 1999999999999 or whatever, the MCU movies was just a universe and hadn’t gone into multiverse stories yet. Now that the MCU is doing multiverse stories they’ve established that the movies have their own separate multiverse from the comics. So the stuff that happens in What-If regarding Watcher vs Ultron, Loki series, America Chavez’s existence, and the mid-credits scene of Quantumania featuring all the Kangs, that’s all in the MCU multiverse and *not* the comics multiverse.
Been saying it for awhile now, comics is one multiverse, cinematics is another. Both within a larger Omniverse. Both can have a 616 and 199999
At the end of the day, I'd say the people getting so worked up over it are a bit ridiculous. In a media franchise as big as Marvel comics, there's always going to be inconsistencies when it comes to continuity, and if it keeps going forward, we can't expect everything to make perfect sense. Things are always gonna get messy.  Heck, from what I recall, the comics 616 is supposed to be the "original" Marvel universe, but the fact that it continues to the modern day creates a lot of trouble when characters like Iron Man or the X-Men have been around for literal decades, while not really aging a day.  The way I see it, the MCU is its own Multiverse, and while the comics and adjacent media might reference it (like the ATSV trailer did), they don't really have an effect on it, only stuff we see in proper MCU films or shows does. So, for all intents and purposes, the MCU has a single America Chavez, the main universe we've seen is 616, and the TVA(s) we might see in Loki are confined to the MCU multiverse.
I think the fundamental issue is that Marvel didn’t really have a concrete plan for the multiverse from the beginning, so a lot of what we’re seeing is a lot of retconning and making things up as if goes along.  The Earth-199999 designation came from 15 years ago, right at the start of the MCU, in a guidebook published by Marvel Comics. This was a cute idea before the MCU even considered the multiverse. This designation, however, was never mentioned in the MCU. Instead the most we had for years, was a reference to 616 in one of the *Thor* movies, which for all intents and purposes could have just been a fun Easter egg.  However, when the MCU finally did start exploring the multiverse, it might have become more important or even necessary to affirm the MCU as the “prime” reality, due to Sony’s films etc. So, the MCU’s status as Earth-616 was affirmed in *Loki* and *Multiverse of Madness*.  Where this has become an issue, is that *Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse* already decided that Peter B. Parker was an adaptation of Spider-Man from Earth-616. So, when it came to referencing the MCU in *Across the Spider-Verse*, the film had to reverse the retcon and go back to calling the MCU Earth-199999.  Tl;dr “Earth-199999” was likely just a cute nod without any wider plans or intentions, but Marvel Comics, Marvel Studios, and Sony Pictures have made a bit of a mess by not sitting down and figuring this out years ago.
To be honest, it really doesn't matter at all.
You are absolutely right! And while I used to love the idea of MCU being Earth 19999 and being part of the marvel comic multiverse, it's so much better this way. I dont feel upset when there are discrepencies in canon if the MCU just has to worry about the rules they themselves have set up.
>Only one America Chavez can exist right?  The America from the comics said the exact same thing, only to then get proven wrong
Some other reasons they can’t be in the same multiverse is that there can only really be one TVA, Council of Kangs, Watcher, and the Darkhold was destroyed in every universe in the MCU
[removed]
comic strange knows that he's being played by benedict cumberbatch in the MCU
One reason why people think that the MCU is part of the comic multiverse is that in one comic, Kid Loki has a passport where there is a stamp of the 199999 universe. But it's likely just an Easter egg and I think the two reason you listed are valid enough to show that it's probably separate.
It is a less than nothing argument and the people so worked up and passionately arguing about it need to take a whiff of fresh air every once in a while.  Nothing about the designation matters except to the people who count “actually” as their favorite word.
Honestly I think the issue is more of a meta one. While the comics and the MCU are different multiverses that can each reasonably have their own 616, fans have, for years, used the 616 distinction in conversation, on wikis, etc, to mean that they're talking about the comics, and 199999 to mean that they're talking about the MCU. But now, when mentioning "Earth-616," that definition is muddied and needs clarification, when the numbering was meant to provide clarity, in the first place.
It’s a silly debate, the MCU is fine being 616 because it isn’t crossing over with comics or OG cartoons
I have a theory that I think solves the issue completely. The MCU main universe is both 616 AND 199999.   The multiverse can exist in clusters, removed from each other. The comics are in one cluster, the movies in another, our reality in another (Hence why there isn't any photos of someone running around in a union jack costume ala captain Britain.)  Most beings who "travel the multiverse" are just traveling in their cluster, and can't go beyond it. There is only two exceptions to this rule, spider totems, and inheritors.   Ignoring the baggage of the latter, not because it doesn't fit but because it's too much to get into here, spider-people are connected via the web of destiny, which is tended to by the Great Weaver. I believe this allows the spider-people to traverse the totality of the multiverse.   In short, to MCU Dr. Strange and the illuminati, the MCU is 616. To those who travel the WHOLE multiverse, they know better, that its only the 616 of its cluster, while its compelete  designation is 199999.  But that's just a theory, a... spider-theory? Yeah, that.
The movies are an adaptation of the comics. The most popular and iconic comics universe is 616. Therefore the movies are inclined to use 616 as well. It is not that hard guys
My explanation is this: there must be multiple universes that find out about the multiverse, and that start numbering the various universes. What are the chances they all give the same number to every universe. It's like if Martians existed, but they named their own planet Earth and ours Mars. That's not logic-breaking, it's just a bit inconvenient.
It’s basically like this Earth-1999999 calls itself Earth-616 (as a reference/easter egg to the main comics universe).  Earth-616 is actually the main comic universe.
I kind of wish Marvel would release some sort of guide to universes that exist outside of the comics. Like all the movie and TV adaptions they have the rights to, and could probably work it out with Sony to include the Raimiverse and TASMverse as well. Give them all their own number, make their own multiverse separate from the comics since all these movies and shows are meant to be adaptations of the comic books and not exist alongside them.
The only reason why I don't like them both being called Earth-616 is because it means I always have to specify which one I'm referring to. It used to be that 616 only meant the main comics universe and everyone accepted that. Now it's like "616...the MCU version, not the comics."
Lol get some sleep. It’s wild how people get worked up over fiction.  Life is a lot harder than this 😂
I didnt even think about that, lol  Now with ME being folded into MS, i think they might make it one Multiverse, but IDK
To me, the main issue is that it retroactively makes the previous decade's worth of print discourse more confusing to read in the future.

So there are a few parts to this.   First, the name.   It's 199999 (5 9s. 200,000 -1). The reason thsi is debated is that the designation of the MCU has been stated from the comics side by the only people whos designations matter. The Captain Brittan Corps.   There are lots of organizations that could begin to study the multiverse and each of them can come up with their own designations for each universe they find. Their numbering systems are generally disregarded because these are sigular universal entities. (The Illuminati in Dr. Strange: Multiverse of Madness for example isn't a multiversal group. It's just some people in one universe, aware of the multiverse, studying the multiverse). The Captain Brittan Corps on the other hand IS a multiversal entity. They operate out of a multiversal hub and is composed of the various Captain Brittains from the various realities. So THEIR designations are considered to be "official". And in order for us to talk about this in some kind of way that isn't insane we need to pick one to set a standard so we can all have a conversation. Their designations have been picked. They say the MCU is 199999, so it is.   It wasn't a joke Fiege made. There are official tie in comics and at some point somebody at Marvel in some capacity gave the MCU their Captain Brittan Corps designation.   &#x200B;  &#x200B;  Second, America Chavez.   He Who Remains didn't stop the multiverse from existing before. What HWR did was isolate a singular time line and then prevent it from branching out again so it didn't create new time lines and so that it couldn't make contact with other time lines out in the chaos.   The America we see is the America of the branches of the sacred time line. Traveling the Multiverse of the branches from the Sacred Time Line. I suspect the MCU has not yet made actual contact with the broader multiverse again yet. And out THERE in those OTHER vast, infinite, time lines there would be other Americas, including the comic 616 version.
It’s a weird one, as creatively the MCU is an adaptation of the 616 comic universe, so in theory also 616. But also feels like Disney is breaking its own rules, as 616 is a different entity to the MCU. Feels like a needless inclusion in MoM/Loki.
I've got 2 words mate  #Agent Coulson   Nothing really makes sense any more
I just watched the interview with Jeremy Renner on TV tonight.  That's an amazing guy with an amazing will to live.  I appreciate that you personally care where Fantastic Four #128 or Journey into Mystery #956 or whatever from 1966 takes place in the MCU.    That's your priorities, and I respect it.  For me, today's been all about watching a man come back from a horrible accident and the brink of death to the point where he's learning how to walk on his own two feet again.
The MCU is 199999-616  This should solve all the isseu   This is the way
One Earth calls it one thing, another calls it a different. It ain't that hard.
Well in the new spider verse trailer spider man 2099 said “don’t get me started with doctor strange an the nerd back in earth 1999”
>Only one America Chavez can exist right?  This is, and always will be, completely stupid. I mean, I know that's how it's supposed to be, but, if there are INFINITE universes in the Multiverse, then there are infinite Americas Chavez. There don't need to be an America Chavez in each universe, no. But if there's an INFINITE amount of universes, there's a universe with America Chavez, a universe with an asian America Chavez, a universe with a male America Chavez, one with an America Chavez that it's actually a hippo, and whatever else your imagination can conjure. INFINITE universes.
I just don’t understand why every universe wouldn’t think that they are earth 1.    Also, for something that’s supposedly infinite, we’ve got a lot of really low numbers
It’s pretty irrelevant regardless
“Ah, yeah. Well, whenever you notice something like that, a wizard did it”
Whatever they call it, we all know it's the main movie universe.
We all know its the main cinematic universe we've been shown over the several years. The number is whatever a character says it is for that moment. I try not to put much weight on it. We all know what they're trying to communicate.   I just wonder if the MCU mumtiverse includes the comics or is it a separate entity.
Five 9s. I remember it like this: Nineteen-Ninety-Nine Ninety-Nine (1999(99)).
Marvel Studios is the MCU.  Everything else isn’t.  Sony is referencing Marvel Comics in the Spider-Verse which is a separate entity altogether.
I always assumed it was just 616 of its own multiverse which was separate from the comics multiverse, but then in the Across the Spiderverse trailer Spidey 2099 made a reference to “the little nerd on Earth-199999.” Now I’m just even more confused.
Would HAVE
People are trying to take this way too seriously.
To be fair, you could make this same argument about the movies. Like, if they decide to destroy the multiverse in 'Secret Wars' and Sony keeps making Spiderverse movies, won't it seem a bit strange that Miguel specifically referenced Doctor Strange and Spider-Man from the MCU 616?! Wouldn't it also affect Miguel, Miles, Gwen, etc.?!
And yet Spider-man PS4, a video game created by Insomniac, is in the MU multiverse.  I don't think the MU is canon to the MCU, but it is the other way around.
Doesn’t matter. All universes exist in the multiverse. Non marvel properties included. DC and ours are included. Simply two universes called the same thing. America is incorrect.
It's also important to point out that these earth designations don't really mean anything. It's just a way of keeping track of them all. When Christine Palmer from Earth-838 told our Doctor Strange that they've designated his universe "Earth-616", that was just something they came up with. It's not like the main universe is *objectively* known as Earth-616.  If you want to call it Earth-199999, you can.   If you want to call it Earth-616, you can.  If you want to call it Earth-420, you can.
If the multi-verse is infinite how can the movies have a different multi-verse from the comics? Serious question.
> but the fact that it continues to the modern day creates a lot of trouble when characters like Iron Man or the X-Men have been around for literal decades, while not really aging a day.    My favorite concept is this Spider-Man story I heard of where he ages naturally. Like if the comics went from the 60’s onward so he’d be in his 30’s in the 2000’s  I wish I could remember the name
Sony's Spiderverse/Venomverse calls the MCU "Earth-199999", and the MCU has yet to designate a number for Sony's movies.  What each names themselves may be different from what they are called somewhere else, and those could both be different from what we call them IRL..   They should straighten this out in LOKI S2.
But there are some who like to argue over it regardless, and it's such a pointless thing to argue about.
The America Chavez from the MCU may be proven wrong in the future as well.  But that's not the only reason why the MCU can't be in the same multiverse as the comics.
[removed]
This is it. This is literally the explanation.  I have no idea why people have turned this into something it isn't and become mad about it, lmao. People are legit saying Feige/Marvel called the MCU 616 out of spite or with ill intent to the comics. So does that mean Sony did so out of spite as well when they had Peter B. Parker call his universe 616 (in Into The Spider-Verse)?   No. They're literally just adapting/paying homage to the comics.  Absolutely ridiculous that people haven't grasped this. Seems like people are just looking for a reason to be mad.
I think you missed the point.   It’s not about the universe, it’s about the multiverse. The mcu cannot exist in the comics multiverse because it is a multiverse on its own.  Unless a multiverse can exist in another multiverse
Not sure why you’re being downvoted. It makes sense that within the stories each universe will have its own numbering system. In one timeline the MCU is 616, and in another it’s labelled as 199999, and perhaps in a third it’s labelled 1030 and so on and so forth. One YT channel even suggested that the numbers are assigned according to how many different realities have been sequentially logged so far, that’s why each universe will have a different numbered label.   Of course in truth this seems like a small misstep that Feige has made but not really a big issue. Even Iman Vellani called him out on it. But it is what it is.
Just say 'in the comics' and 'in the movies/in the MCU'...  Literally what the hell is this complaint? You're just complaining that you can't sound more nerdy when talking.
In an interview once, producer Nate Moore said "MCU 616". It's never hard to specify what you mean.
True. Now when you read "616 Loki will always be my favorite" you don't know if they meant the main MCU or main comics. Iman Vellani was right.
Are you kidding?!?
Using your own logic, the TVA is a singular unity that exists outside of the Multiverse, and it designated the MCU as 616.    More importantly, your knowledge on America seems limited, so let me fill in the gaps on why it doesn't make sense.   To talk America, we first have to talk Wiccan, the son of the Scarlet Witch. Wiccan is one of the most powerful beings in the multiverse, the human form of the cosmic god known as the Demiurge, on the same levels of power as beings such as the Pheonix, Eternity etc.  There is only one Demiurge in the entire multiverse, he exists outside of space and time.  Billy as the Demiurge created a world called the Utopian Paralell, which is a perfect utopia that exists outside of the multiverse just like the TVA. Because America was born in this world, she does not possess variants, nor does anyone else from this world. Now this has been retconned in the comics back and forth several times, the retcon was overwhelmingly hated,  which brings us to the MCU.   The MCU completely ignores the retcon, and we see the Utopian Paralell in her memory bank. One could argue it wasn't since it was never named, but the official marvel website confirmed that in the MCU she still comes from the Utopian Paralell, and it exists outside of our multiverse. America also explains she doesn't dream, further confirming she has no variants.   The only thing we do not know for the MCU, is whether Wanda's son Billy is still involved in the creation of her universe, but we DO see a statue of Billy as the Demiurge in the 616 darkhold temple.   In fact, Wiccan is even more proof, because the Demiurge is stated to be a singular multidimensional being, meaning the comics Billy and MCU Billy could not both be the Demiurge if it was a shared multiverse.
America Chavez wasn't born in a universe, an infinite multiverse also doesn't mean everything exists. Infinity - 1 is still infinite.
first the multiverse is not infinite even in marvel comics, it's a quantum multiverse meaning that new universe come from the choices of characters, seemingly endless choices, but not infinite, also Chacez comes from outside the multiverse, she might be an outisder to the whole cycle of expansion
>won't it seem a bit strange that Miguel specifically referenced Doctor Strange and Spider-Man from the MCU 616  I wouldn’t find it strange. Why? Because Sony and Marvel Studios are also separate creative entities, even more so since they're different corporations entitely.  Why some people refuse to see the real world practicality of all this is beyond me.
No, because Spider-Verse is a third multiverse. Earth-199999 is their counterpart to the MCU's Earth-616.
Nah that’s the Omniverse you are talking about. The Omniverse is to Multiverses what Multiverses are to universes.
bro you can't apply real world logic to story logic, what about the storyes where the whole multiverse is destroyed? then was our world destroyed too????
That’s not how that works even a little bit.
You’re confusing the meaning of multiverse and the meaning of omniverse
Multiverses are also multiple, in the next level "verse" - highest level "verse" is the Omniverse.  We, as in our real universe, our world. Was once saved by Reed Richards according to marvel.  We are one universe , MCU is another from the same multiverse. Whilst dc is a universe apart of another multiverse - both multiverses are somewhere in the same omniverse :)
correct and Miguel calling it 199999 is also correct as why would he follow ried's naming scheme unless they worked together. the oddity is how did mystirio come up with 616 to match earth 838 designation for it.
Except that Christine was a scientist who specialized in the multiverse. They likely use a mathematical equation to number universes. If we named Planets by their distance from the sun, every single alien in the universe would have the same name for every planet in our galaxy.   Also, the TVA ALSO labeled MCU as 616, it wasn't just Christine. Also Dr. Erik, a brilliant scientist and astrophysicist labeled MCU as 616 as well, and he accurately predicted the convergence before anyone else.
Yes.  That movie line was simply an homage to the comics not a factual statement that the comic universe and the MCU are the same.
The comics multiverse has the fundamental rule, that Infinity Stone only work in their universe, in the MCU multiverse they also work in other universes (as seen in Endgame and What if), so both multiverses have different fundamental rules and can't be the same multiverse.
Irrational and rational number are both infinite and they have no overlap. Infinite doesn't mean everything. It just means not finite.
You might be thinking of *Spider-Man: Life Story* by Chip Zdarsky. But just a quick math check: If Spidey was a teenager in the 60s he'd be a lot *older* than in his 30s by the time the 2000s roll around. That said, *Life Story* is a good book, I recommend checking it out.
I think the latter. A mutliverse is a subset of universes the may not be the complete set.
A brilliant scientist like Christine would have a better universal way of numbering realities.  For example, if every planet had aliens with their own languages and own culture, if every scientist simply named our planets the distance they are from the sun, every single alien race would have the same name for every planet.   Universes are likely scientifically numbered and named so that they are universal.  How else would Erik, the Tva and Christine all have the same number for the MCU?
Exactly, thank you!
No. The TVA is an organization created by HWR to monitor one specific time line. The sacred time line. They are completely ignorant to the rest of the multiverse and believe that nothing exists except their own sacred time line. They thought the time keepers eliminated all other universes. HWR says, specifically, that he isolated this one using alioth.   The TVA is not really a multiversal entity like the CBC. They don't act in/on multiple universes. They eliminate the potential for new ones while monitoring a single one.    I am well aware of wiccan. Did you notice in MoM that wiccan was engraved on the walls of the scarlet witch murals in every corner? A retcon being hated doesn't stop it from being canon. People HATE beast in the comics right now. It's still him.    So let's put this this way. Even in the comics there are alternate versions of billy. What MCU Kang has done is separate out this time line from all the others. It didn't stop the others from existing. It made this one exist alone.   There is a distinction here from this core time line and all it's infinite variants and the other universes infinite universes and all their variants. Think of Rick and Morty's central finite curve. Still infinite universes. But within parameters that isolates it from everything else.   The MCU was a central finite curve that was then pruned down to a single time line. There is still the rest of infinity out there.   Also, the phoenix is a multiversal entity. And the phoenix has multiple manifestations in each universe.
Yeh but we're not talking about the politics between companies. We're talking about what's happening inside of these movies.   If they establish that the Spiderverse movies take place within the same larger multiverse that the MCU stories take place in and it gets destroyed at the end of 'Secret Wars', that would surely affect the future Spiderverse releases, no?  I feel like saying "they're different companies" is just a lazy way of avoiding answering the question.
Because so are marvel and universal and Sony. Yet all 3 have produced canon projects for the mcu. Real world companies no matter how different can influence the same ongoing storyline.
Yes
I didn’t.
In thor 2 selvig also comes up with 616 on his bender. Given that he's a well published scientist, Mysterio could have easily had his story team pull some papers about multiverse theory to get realistic numbers for a believable backstory.
Coincidence
Through dreams and a variant that actually knows the multiverse. Maybe the story he came up with was all based on a dream and there actually is a world destroyed by Elementals.
Arishem tell me about it
Mysterio dreamed about his doppleganger.
>Except that Christine was a scientist who specialized in the multiverse.  So?! At no point in the movie did they indicate that the earth designations are anything more than just labels for the sake of keeping track of them all.   I don't remember a scene where 838 Christine said "we have used mathematical equations to determine that your universe is objectively the six-hundred and sixteenth one in the entire multiverse" but maybe you do.
Not true, I can provide a source if you need it, but the writer of what if confirmed that Infinity Stones only work in their own universe, and the only reason Ultron was able to do was because A: He was a same universe being and B: Ultron had blurred the universes so much together that it was one big mushy universe soup.   Also the Infinity Stones worked in endgame because they were taken from 616. They visited a different timeline, not a different universe. The Quantum realm exists outside of time AND space.
I was assuming 16 in 1962. I got 28 originally when doing the math of how old he’d be in 1990 but I forgot to add the extra 16 to put him at his 40’s in the 90’s lol  Edit: and yes! That was the book!
Referencing each other for fun is fine, just as comics referenced movies. You take it too far if you think it needs to be more substantial than that. For obvious practical reasons, it can't work.  It's not a lazy answer, it's just the truth.
Being cannon can be both temporary and one sided. Sony may decide to consider MCU cannon, but not the other direction. Likewise, it could be unilateral but later revoked.  I feel like both happened with Agents of Shield  It's fiction, the writers can do whatever they want. There's no law that anything needs to be consistent
Universal? You're referring to *The Incredible Hulk*, which was produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Universal. So Marvel Studios is the creative overseer of that one.  There is no "same ongoing storyline" across all studios beyond cute references here and there and, in the case of MCU Spider-Man and friends, a fun crossover.
Literaly how?have your like read comics? That literaly didnt happen
You said  all universes exist in the same multiverse, dc or marvel, and our world too, so when crisis on infinite earths happened was the 616 destroyed too?
Yeah but Selvig also came to that number in Thor 2
Unless Erik and the TVA talked to the Illuminati how else would they all come up with the same number? Honestly, even if they are using math and science I find it or they'd choose to use the same universal constant to label each universe, but I find that more plausible then pure coincidence.
In What if, Strange Supreme also uses his time stone in Ultrons universe, and timelines are universes.
Exactly correct. People get way too in the weeds with this stuff. The multiverse is a way to do some fun crossovers, placate Sony because Marvel still wants to use Spidey, and also allow Feige to work with the Fox characters again inside the MCU.  The lesson is, don’t overthink it. Most moviegoers that give these movies their blockbuster profits aren’t scouring twitter and Reddit.
The venom storyline begs to differ.
In regards to the MCU our world has an actual designation
I don't think you even bothered to read what I wrote, but since people want to argue something factually correct,  here's the sources, go argue with the writers, not me.   Infinity stones don't work in other universes:  "Happy Monday! Just a reminder that Ultron is using the Infinity Stones to power himself (same universe being). Also he's legit punching across multiverses turning them into one messy universe soup. #Whatif #WhatifMarvel #WeDidOurHW"  Timelines are not the same as universes:  “There’s a slight difference between alternate timelines and alternate realities, but they do intersect."

A post credit tag does not a storyline make.
My brother i read that comic too, and its like superboy prime earth or gwenpool earth its just theyr version of pur world where comics exists , in one of those a character actualy interacyed with the 616, the marquee of death N but he is not a real fucking guy from our world who went into a comics world, wtf is wrong with you?
But the symbiote storyline and sinister six storylines do
I'm not talking about a comic. Our reality is Earth-1218 as can be seen on the Wiki. Why are you insulting me?
Are you trolling? They're just tags.
In the movies too man,  this is not about canon, that is not our real world, we dont exist in the multiverse of movies, and for sure comoanies have no controll over a real multiverse like they do with fictional ones, if they say they are different multiverses they are
Tony presumably made the decision to bequeath E.D.I.T.H. to Peter sometime before his death...even though Peter had been dead for 5 years.
Cap’s shield.  No, not how it doesn’t follow the laws of physics, or any consistent laws for that matter.  In CATFA when Steve notices it, Howard says it is just a prototype, and it is made of vibranium, all the vibranium they have.  What was it a prototype of? Also, since that’s all the vibranium they have, they can’t make more so a prototype is kinda pointless.
On the topic of Far From Home, why didn’t they use Flash’s video evidence to help clear Peter’s name and prove that Mysterio was the real villain by showing them that the drones actively tried to kill his friends (which DODC claimed were his accomplices, which would be extremely conflicting). I thought that that was where they were heading with Flash always making videos.
When the Kree tried to carpet bomb the Earth at the end of Captain Marvel, they shot all the missiles at the same spot in one desert as opposed to … all around the planet.
Yea just rewatched Endgame and theres obviously quite a few “wait a tick” moments because of the events, but theres kind of a subtle one in there and that is, when Tony and Steve go to camp Lehigh Tony is running through the basement looking for the Tesseract and his Edith(?) glasses are actively identifying the contents of sealed containers. It sorta stands to reason that he would have to be connected to some sort of internet or massive database for that to work, yet there wouldnt be internet or satellites for such things to work. Unless he just has a catalogue of….everything built into the glasses.
Okay this is a stretch, but I think Tony destroying the Hammer Drones in Iron Man 2 inadvertently stopped a grander scheme by Hydra for world domination.   While I doubt Justin Hammer was involved in the plan, or even Hydra for that matter, Senator Stern was. Stern was defensive of Hammer during the court hearings and showed dismay when having to present Tony and Rhodey with awards in the end. The Drones were built with the intention of selling to the military, which likely would have been recreated by Hydra shortly after.
Not quite “if you really think about it” but it always gets me in Endgame when Tony discovers TIME TRAVEL, everyone is kinda like “oh cool” like it’s no big deal. Pep gives a quiet “oh” and Cap gives a small smile. Any normal response would have been disbelief like “what! No —— way! GTFOH.” The greatest invention in human history is treated like he solved a crossword puzzle. 😆
Why didn’t Wong or Strange just make a portal to take off Thano’s gauntlet hand like Wong did to Black Dwarf early in Infinity War?
In The Avengers, there’s the scene, inside Tony’s penthouse atop Stark Tower, where Tony talks to Loki while slyly putting on bracelet that controlled the newer Ironman suit. The scene ends w/Loki throwing Tony(not wearing an Ironman suit mind you) through a PLATE GLASS WINDOW and Tony is basically unscratched. Always bothered me.
The “fake guantlet” in Age of Ultron’s post credit scene. Always felt weird that we got a whole segment of Thanos getting the gauntlet only to later find out in IW he had recently gotten it from Etri and the dwarves. In my head, the scene at the end of AOU is the same guantlet fresh out of the forge and takes place in the future, right before IW. We never really saw where Thanos was, so I’m just assuming it was right before he slaughtered the dwarves
The Cap that went back in time and lived through the 20th century knew about HYDRA infiltrating SHIELD, Bucky being tortured and brainwashed, and various future supervillain attacks and did nothing. Also caused Peggy's two kids with her original husband to never be born, which is what they were trying to avoid doing to Morgan Stark.
This one has always bothered me. In the AoU party when they're taking turns trying to pick up Thor's hammer Hawkeye say's something along the lines of "It's some kind of trick.", but out of all the people there he should be the most convinced that it's not.  In the Thor movie Hawkeye witnessed Thor fight his way through a bunch of SHIELD agents, try to pick up the hammer, struggle, and fail. He saw the whole thing!
Doctor Strange's "only way" for them to win. Not only did it rely on a random rat freeing Scott Lang, but it still resulted in trillions of deaths. We can't even comprehend how many died across the universe because of the Snap in those five years. The riots that would have broken out because of the panic, the civilizations that would have collapsed because of key figures vanishing, and the wars started by worlds that either accuse each other or are trying to take advantage of the chaos. Not to mention the suicide rates.
I’ve mentioned this before and people were adamant it makes “perfect sense” but Sharon being believed dead in Endgame when she was on the run.  If the avengers were making a list of all people they believe were snapped, then they logically make a list of people who disappeared after the snap, but had known whereabouts before.  It isnt completely fool proof since they thought Scott was snapped but someone doing a science experiment at the moment of the snap is a billion to one chance.  So basically if Sharon was on the run, they’d have no way to know one way or the other, and no reason to include her on the list of snapped.  I suspect that to the Russos, Markus and Mcfeely at the time Sharon was simply still working for the CIA and could easily be found. It was only later that it was decided (by Malcolm Spellman et al) that she went on the run.
In Infinity War, they go through the trouble of going to Wakanda because they don't want to sacrifice Vision's life just to save half the entire universe. Even given that...I'm pretty sure more than a few Wakandans died in that battle, and plenty of heroes very well could have died. That ends up being trading a lot of lives just to save Vision.
From the moment Strange looks into the future, everything he does or says afterward is to manipulate things to a particular point. Did he actually look into 14 million timelines, or did he claim that in order to give Tony the desperation required to make him willing to sacrifice his life?
I apologize in advance if this was mentioned in the shows/movies.  But how did the citizens of Earth know the following:   1. Thanos was the cause of the snap/blip   2. It was Dr. Strange who gave away the time stone in exchange for the snap to reverse?   2a. How were they aware that his decision was 1 in 5million+ possibilities?   3. How did anyone on Earth know Thanos' reason for the snap? Iirc, he only explained it to the Avengers on Titan, and there was no dialogue exchange when he arrived in Wakanda     I know there's more, but these are the 3 that I constantly think about when watching phase 4 films and beyond.
The HYDRA infiltration of SHIELD.  I get that SHIELD recruited HYDRA scientists. It has historical basis and I’m not arguing against it.  But they’re just scientists and they don’t call the shots. During the Korean War they were sending winter soldier (arguably a case in himself) on missions, which requires logistics and support they have no influence over, certainly not six years after their “long term” plan began.
If you really think about it Infinity war and Endgame could have sucked asshole, but it didn’t, they managed to create two movies with all the heroes in it, and made it work, after 10 years of movies, it really came out great, don’t know if anyone else think about this, but I am greatful that this happened.
When Hulk snaps everyone back, one of the cues that it worked was the singing of birds. This implies that animals were also dusted by Thanos, not just humans. So not only did Thanos destroy half of all people, he also destroyed half of all livestock, leaving humans with roughly the same amount of food, per capita.
In Endgame, they come up with this plan to get back the infinity stones. They only have so many pym particles. So they send everyone all at once to get the stones. That’s just stupid. They could have gone back in time, got more pym particles, then sent the entire team or at least the most powerful avengers, and gotten the stones one by one.   Now, that might not have worked because I’d the soul stone, but that doesn’t mean, given the info they had, that they shouldn’t have sent IM, Captain America, and Captain Marvel to collect all the stones.   I loved the movie and this doesn’t actually take away any enjoyment for me (that would be a stupid way to think about it). It’s part of the reason I think Infinity War is the true masterpiece of the MCU, not Endgame. Endgame is still an amazing conclusion to the infinity saga (I don’t care about Spider-Man being the actual last movie).
In Endgame, why was there such a rush to get the stones to the van, right through the middle of the army that wanted to take them from you?  Just portal them out of there and worry about getting them back later. It’s time travel. It doesn’t matter if you leave in 5 minutes, 5 hours or 5 decades - you’ll still get to exactly when you need to be.  Which is what happened in the end when Cap took them back using a newly-built machine at least a few days after the battle and Tony’s funeral.
Steve's ending doesn't make sense on so many levels.
When Clint takes the cradle from Seoul to New York, Steve, Pietro, and Wanda had no way home. Did they fly commercial home?
In civil war,Steve and Bucky thinking zemo is going use those 5 super soldier how could he? They all are failed ones,that's why HYDRA locked them in chamber. If really Zemo could control them why HYDRA didn't use them for 15 years
Unsnapping cause everyone to reappear exactly where they were when snapped.  So what happened to the pilot of that helicopter?  Did he just reappear in the air and immediately fall to his death?
Wait, Fury in the car was Mysterio?
The location in Germany was Berlin, even though Düsseldorf or Köln-Bonn would've made more sense given that an ICE train takes him straight to the Netherlands, which share a border with Northrhine-Westphalia rather than Brandenburg.
Tony Stark gave his address to terrorists and then wore prototype armour without fully functional flight or weapon capabilities.
Not MCU but Spiderverse.  Gwen got blown into last week, literally! (Kind of a week handwave but fine I'll take it)   My spidersence told me to go to this school (that's not how spidersence works. And even if it was.  Why?  The only plot happening at that school was Miles and he wasn't a spider person yet. Also how did you get into this school?  It states explicitly that the school is exclusive. Miles had to win a raffle and pass an entrance exam.  How is Gwen a student here with no credentials or tracible history and probably no money, possibly no credible ID in this universe)   I don't know my spider-ham/noir lore well enough to know if either of them have an aunt may or could reasonably find this universes version of her (did thier spidersence tell them?  Why didn't it tell them to go to school)  but Penny certainly doesn't have an Aunt May and she doesn't have a spidersence.    I love this movie, non of this griping detracts from that and god I'm excited for more.  Just wanted to point out some things I have thought about on rewarches.
When was Mysterio disguised as Fury in a car? In the meeting in Berlin, Peter and Fury were real, then Fury got shot, and then while Peter was seeing the illusions, Mysterio disguised as Fury while another illusion was playing, depicting the authorities taking down Beck
They could have helped Zemo by giving him Wanda to talk to. Family’s ripped apart by the avengers, wanted to break them, both from sokovia a place of war, she could have helped more than sending Tony Cap or Bucky ever did. They could have a cry session together.
Wanda got familiar with witchcraft by Darkhold but Strange only knew Wanda is familiar with witchcraft for some reason and didn't know a single thing about the involvement of Darkhold in the Westview incident. Either way, Strange should've investigated the Westview if a mentally unstable reality-bending witch kidnapped an entire town like he did something about Loki in Ragnarok.
What I've been wondering is if the TVA pruned the timeline where Loki escaped via the tesseract, how was Captain America able to go back to that timeline to return the stone?...Or did I just completely miss something?
In Infinity War, how did Thor and Rocket know to go to Wakanda once he built Stormbreaker?
Why didn’t the Hulk and/or Tony initially make a wish with the infinity glove that using the infinity glove didn’t hurt them, and then make their second wish?
The snapping would have essentially killed most living things. If you half all living things, you’re halving gut microbiota, White blood cells, red blood cells, and all the other living organisms needed to keep a human alive. You half all those, the humans who didn’t get snapped would most likely die at some point.   And if they don’t die, we’ll when you bring back all those organisms back into a person, you’re going to cause havoc.
I mean...Thanos was right. Curbing the universal population to improve the lives not only of people now but for trillions in the future does way more good than harm. Humans literally do it all the time to animal populations. Thanos comes from a superior race to humans; if we do it to other species; why should we be morally horrified if another species does it to us?
In Civil War, Steve Sam and Bucky think Zemo is going for the base in Siberia. So they call Clint who in turn recruits Scott and Wanda, and those three head to Berlin where the big fight happens.  Except, why go to Berlin? Zemo is already on his way and they can’t waste time. The smart play would be for SamBuckySteve and ClintScottWanda to rendezvous with each other in Siberia.
In the original *Doctor Strange*, Kaecilius wants Dormammu to add the Earth to his domain as a means to avoid death.  The Ancient One draws on the powers of the Dark Dimension to unnaturally extend her own life for centuries.  So then it's fitting that Strange's plan to get the better of Dormammu relies on him choosing to die countless times.
Did Thanos snap pilots in the middle of a flight? Were the pilots brought back at the point they were snapped from like several 1000 feet above the Atlantic Ocean for example or the cockpit of the plane? What if the plane was dismantled?
The TVA is a bunch of diddlers. Part of the process of bringing in variants is disintegrating their clothes and putting them in jumpsuits. Sylvie was a literal child when the TVA took her, which means they undressed a child,
i mean, the biggest one has gotta be the fact that time travel equals near-immediate access to infinite pym particles right? eliminating the manufactured urgency that serves as the entire crux of endgame's plot?  also literally everything that has to do with mysterio's drones lol
Iron Man 1 all happens in roughly a 24-48 hours from the time he finishes his Mark 3 armor to the fight on the roof, meaning Obadiah steals the chest piece, requests a prototype be built (via a call in his car driving away from Stark’s house), and then Ironmonger emerges, if you follow the movie, within an hour or so after the chest piece is stolen - logically it would take weeks if not months or years for a non Stark team to build it.   It always bugs me how fast it all happens in the final third act. Love the movie though…
How come after The Avengers, Nick Fury never told anyone on the team Agent Coulson was alive?  How come Thor didn't seem stunned Sif was alive in Thor: Love & Thunder when it seemed like all his friends (the Warriors Three) were killed in Thor: Ragnorok? Where was she this whole time?  Why isn't anyone phased aliens and gods do in fact exist in the universe? Wouldn't that cause mass hysteria or existential crisises (what's the plural version of crisis)?
When Druig, the guy who uses mind control to make other people fight his battles, calls Phastos a coward.
Yeah I'm trying to think of some sort of rebuttal to this, but I'm coming up short.
You're forgetting the scene in the Endgame final battle where he sits down with his lawyer (played handsomely by Charlie Cox) and updates his will based on recent events
Probably had a list, with Spidey at the top. And if Spidey was dead then the next would be someone like Cap or Banner, etc.  so he didn’t need to update the protocol when Peter was Spider-Dust
He knew he was doing to die, but was confident he would succeed, that’s why he recorded the message.  I’m sure his will had a second choice(probably CAP) if they failed.
Also, at the end of Winter Soldier he just drops it into the Potomac River. Did someone just dive in there and somehow find it and give it back to him before AoU?
Ok, I actually gave this one some thought a while ago and it's not such a far off idea.  You are Howard Stark and you are given 12 pounds of this unique material in the world and you lead the foremost R&D facility in the planet. What do you do with it, in 1942, that makes sense for a war?   Ammunition doesn't make sense, because you don't get the bullets back. It's not enough for a tank or even armor plating a tank. A couple of helmets? Doesn't make sense. Armor? Still not enough.  I kept trying to come up with ideas on what to use it to get some advantage in a war zone and I can't think of anything. I certainly wouldn't think of a Shield myself, mainly because a normal human with a shield at war would be laughable. But a super soldier with a shield would stand a chance.  Howard had already created a number of shields for Steve, so he probably looked at the vibranium and went "what the hell, let's shape it into a shield" and then he figured he couldn't put a flamethrower or spikes or whatever into the vibranium shield, so he called it a prototype \[for a cooler shield that I'll make later once I figure out vibranium\].  It just happened that Steve was more comfortable with a "basic" shield than something fancy and techy.
I always took it to mean that they were just exploring the properties of vibranium, so they worked it into a disc just so they could throw stuff at it and see what happens.  They probably didn't have much ability to work the stuff, so a simple machined form to flatten it out was all they could manage.  I don't think they really intended to create a Greek hoplite shield, that just seemed to work well for Steve.
Kind of a good point but they could have just re-moulded the prototype to refine the shape for the 'final design'? 🤷🏻
It's a prototype of shields.  As in, each version uses different materials.  This particular prototype uses vibranium.
The prototype thing is no big deal. Seems clear to me that they know there is more vibranium out there and they may know exactly where to get it. Just gotta figure how to get some from Wakanda one way or another.
Maybe it did. Peter was pretty much acquitted and proven innocent at least in a court of law. I'm more wondering why mysterio and crew would go out of his way to destroy a kid's life. Like they were all on board just hating on peter and initiating a smear campaign.
>(which DODC claimed were his accomplices, which would be extremely conflicting).  This is the perfect answer to my question haha
It was a very specific carpet they were trying to bomb.
More importantly, the Kree bombs failed once, and then they didn't come back the next day to try again.    On any of thousands of days before or after, the bombing would've worked.  But they picked the exact one day Carol was ready to block them.
Given the trope of "Tony Stark learns from his mistakes," this could arguably be handwaved by him learning from having not having access to his AI in Infinity War when going off planet, so he found a way to locally store as much information as possible to prevent that from happening if he lost access for whatever reason.
Also that scene Tony cuts into the Tesseract metal lockbox by burning through the locks with a laser. 45 seconds later he meets his dad right next to it, Howard even grabs the briefcase the Tesseract is in… but he doesn’t seem to smell freshly burned/melted metal, or notice the broken singed lockbox 2 feet from him that once stored his most valuable resource.
Oh that's a good one.
Or the nano particles contain basically a database in their code.
I love this take.
> There’s just something about it that seems like such a massive shark jump.  I think to an extent I agree, but like, these are movies about space vikings and a guy who shrinks to the size of an ant but gets stronger but can also expand and also get stronger... idk like, you have to suspend disbelief for basically any of it after IM2. The "science" of it is at best a hand wave
Its made all the more worse by the fact it doesn't ever get mentioned.
Yeah this is a good one.
Yeah wouldn’t it be the equivalent of the ice caps melting
EXACTLY!! Like Tom Holland was even in a movie explaining how dangerous that is!!!
I still can’t get over how such a world-ending cataclysm is taking place and the Avengers don’t show up.
Also... time travel now exists *and it's never brought up again.*
I mean, their society is so much more technologically advanced than ours AND they have magic, monsters, aliens, sorcerers, gods, witches, androids, super soldiers, etc.   While I completely understand what you're saying (and sorta agree), it's also possible that discoveries like this just aren't as big of a deal to them lol.  Tony invented nanotech and some pretty decent AI (Jarvis, Friday, Karen, etc).
I read the scene as him having been trying for 5 years to figure out the last piece of information he needed to make it happen. That's why Pepper wasn't as surprised as you might think.
You'd think Hank Pym would be involved in some shit regarding Pym particles. Nobody is asking him for more, arresting him, hunting him, etc. Like the guy literally has the one and only resource required for time travel but nobody really cares.
i imagined that thanos would just rip the portal, the same way he broke out of strange's weird restraints on titan.
This is a weird one for me as well. They *clearly* set up the idea that you can do that, and then never addressed it again. I mean, the whole plot is about a guy  who has a powerful weapon on his hand.   I thought it was strange that the writers included a scene of someone using a portal to chop off a hand, and didn't use that again when the heroes could win if they chopped off someone's hand. Checkov's Gun misfired I guess...  If it could be explained as "well that wasn't one of the blah blah blah ways they won", then why include that scene at all?
There's a scene in Ant-Man and the Wasp where Ghost kicks Scott Lang through a **concrete wall** and all he does is groan a bit before he gets right back up. Stuff like that happens all the time in the MCU, I guess you just gotta go with it.
I think someone confirmed that the post credits scene from AoU does actually take place chronologically right before IW. It's a little confusing and obviously a retcon, but that's the official word.
Eitri made the gauntlet for Thanos, but who says he *designed* it?  What if the Infinity Gauntlet is an old legend? What if pictures of it existed for centuries, like we have old pictures of the Greek gods?  So maybe Odin had a replica fashioned after these legendary pictures, and so did Thanos. The gauntlet he takes from the vault is just that - a replica, a piece of art. Something he had made to remind him of his great quest.  And when it was time to create the real thing, he showed the replica to Eitri and told him he wanted it to look exactly like that. Like in the legends. Like it looked in the storybooks he read as a kid.
For that matter, Odin’s fake gauntlet. Some have theorized Odin once wanted to complete the gauntlet but then changed his mind. Good theory, but why is it oversized?
Yeah, the whole 'Cap staying in the past' really creates a bunch of questions that will never get answered.
- He created an alternate timeline  Or:  - He fathered those two kids and knew everything else would turn out fine.
I will admit, there's another line that he says in that scene that always confused me. He says "You know I've seen this before, right?"  For a long time I was confused what he meant by that, because I had *completely* forgotten that he had a cameo in Thor 1. Which is ironic because when I first saw Thor 1, I remember thinking "Huh, why would you cast Jeremy Renner to have like one line in your movie, and then never show him again?"  I guess this was before I realized that he would be in Avengers.
If you think about it, in a way Strange \*made\* that rat free scott.  It wasn't a coincidence.  Strange saw that in one possible outcome, Scott could be saved by a rat, and through his actions, he set the universe in the direction of that one in 14M outcome.     Think of it this way, if you could forsee 14M different futures, and in one of them, you can get out of a math test through the random actions of some animal, like lets say a rat trips your teacher and he slips a disc and goes to the hospital.  And you know what steps to take to lead reality to that outcome.  So in a way, it wasn't a coincidence, it was a possible future that Strange selected.
After Endgame I had a theory that there were multiple ways to "win," but Strange being the control freak he is had a few items he wanted enacted. The most obvious is preventing the emergence of Tiamut.   These other items might have been and merged hulk and banner along with a dead Tony. It is fully in Stranges character to deem those two as threats and want them mitigated in some way.
But Marvel fans say you're not allowed to think that much about it because it's just a comic book movie  😂
Few deaths happened immediately after Thanos's snap.  Everyone was suffering, but all the survivors had twice as much food, fuel, housing, and money.  So they were OK.  Most deaths happened following Hulk's snap, when the population of every planet doubled overnight.  Many societies would have had no way to feed that many extra people.  Some would fall into cannibalism.
Or she was snapped and a Skrull showed up during the gap so now there’s two Sharons
It's one thing to explicitly condemn someone to sacrifice it is another to say we will do what we can to fight and hopefully survivr. That quote was offered in the future tense, not past tense. Though you know any military engagement will ultimately cause death. You arent condemning any specific person to death. Sacrifice makes death an absolute. Defense means the owness of death is still on the aggressor.
Sacrificing a bunch of strangers to save her lover is 10000% something Wanda would do. And she did.
I like to think that he didn't just look into those timelines.  He Came To Bargain. Five years at a time. Till eventually it worked.  😎
In those 5 years, there might've been some sort of 'hearing' (I know that's not the right word, but I can't think of the word for what I mean) where one or more of the remaining Avengers went before the remaining world leaders and explained what happened. Remember that Nebula (who was on Earth for at least a little while) knew why Thanos did what he did, so presumably she told the others.   Number 2 I got nothing for. Obviously Tony and Nebula knew, but I can't see how that would be relevant for the general public to know.   Good questions though. This is why it would be neat to have a show/movie set during those 5 years. Not gonna happen though. Oh well.
Not really a concrete answer, but in Quantumania Scott's book "Look Out for the Little Guy" goes over the events of IW/Endgame and it's available to the public. Presumably the Avengers told Scott and the world governments what happened.
Guys, you're missing the obvious.  Pepper Potts press conference.
Agents of shield and Agent Carter do actually dig into this a little deeper.  It’s not just the fringes, people like Wilfred malick (and his later family) are in senior positions and are actively recruiting. Heck, Gideon malick was on the world security council.
Almost like Thanos’s plan was madness.
Fifty percent more birds wouldn't make the difference between hearing birdsong or not hearing it.  The reason they heard birds then is because they were trying to listen to the world outside of their compound, since they were eager to see what happened with the snap.
Yeah. I understand story-wise why they went the route they did, but if it were the real world, that 'time heist' was pretty poorly planned haha
This one's easy to handwave because we'll never get a full explanation on how Pym Particles actually work.  Maybe he took the number of vials that he did because they need progressively more with each consecutive jump. Maybe jumping with Pym Particles reduces their effectiveness. Maybe they have to be unique particles, so taking from the same batch twice breaks them.
Thanos also had time travel tech, they needed to either get rid of him while he was available or deny him the stones permanently.  In the end they did both but either one would work.
I don’t think Tony’s gauntlet was as good as Thanos’s, made specially by the dwarves. It started fucking up Bruce basically immediately after he put it on.   I wouldn’t blame someone for not even realizing time travel was an option, since it’s so far removed from most of their everyday experience, but even if they did it would mean putting on a corrosive glove with no idea how it works. When one mistake could mean the end of the universe, I can see why no one tried it.
It would not be hard for Steve to sneak himself and two others (one of whom has super speed, and the other mind magic) onto a cargo plane
Pietro carried them. He can run across water.
I read somewhere in a draft, the original ending was going to be a battle with all those super soldiers.
What if the Earth wasn't in the same position around the sun when they get snapped back? Half of earth's population would be floating dead in space.
Wish they showed it on screen, but the directors confirmed it was like a "wish" situation, everybody just ended up in the next safest place unharmed.
I'm assuming, because the HQ he drives to turned out to be fake, so why would Fury drive there?
Interesting. That's not what I got from that scene. Remember, after 'Fury' got shot, the illusion receded showing that the HQ was just a random warehouse. Perhaps Talos didn't know that it wasn't the real HQ, but then why was it never mentioned that he got shot?   Again, a "If you really think about it..."
But Fury hadn’t been shot when we saw him in London, had he?
And if that didnt work Wanda could turn him into a cheerful gameshow host.
- Wanda has been using witchcraft the entire time, ever since she was a kid. It's a bloodline thing.  - The Darkhold wasnt responsible for the creation of Westview. Agatha brought it to Westview after it was created.  - The Hex had a hex to keep it out of the memories of everyone nearby and with an immediate connection. Her subconscious would definitely include Strange on the blacklist.  The real question is why Darcy or Jimmy try to use any of their Avengers contacts.
No that's actually a really good point. Maybe he can go back to before it was pruned? Time travel is always confusing.
Presumably he just went back to just before the timeline was pruned to replace the Scepter.
Can't the bifrost basically take you exactly where someone is?
Surely the alien ships were visible from space, huddled around Wakanda
Don't think that's how it works
This is the best reply.
The infinity gauntlet doesn't allow you to just make any wish you want.  The function was built into the glove when created.  The first one erased people, the second was built separately to restore people, and then the third was built in a few seconds to beat Thanos.
Is this serious? Obviously the half that gets snapped is "the same half" as the snapped humans. I mean, the humans that were snapped all had white blood cells and red blood cells, and what not, and those were snapped with them (there's no snapping of half the gut microbiota of the remaining humans, because that would actually be more than half of all the gut microbiota).  The real problem with the snap is, as is often said (I'm not claiming to have an original take, at all), that Thanos, who is portrayed as at least somewhat intelligent, uses the infinity stones to obliterate half of life in the universe, instead of just multiplying the resources. Even more stupid is the fact that the whole premise is wrong: there's is no scarcity of resources in the universe, AT ALL, resources are actually VERY ABUNDANT. The real cause for poverty, inequality, hunger, etc, lies elsewhere: either a specific species does not have the technology and knowledge needed to actually exploit all those resources; or they create scarcity to perpetuate specific socio-economic systems (like, in our case, capitalism), which were put in place in a time when the scarcity was actually real.
I believe he snapped for sentient life. Cause he was trying to fix starving planets by diminishing population so wildlife could grow back to be hunted again.
Why are you breaking out white and red blood cells?  Sure they're free floating, but they're not a separate living entity like gut microbes are.    If you're breaking cells out, then each multicellular being will lose approximately half of it's cells, in which case almost all (except for the simplest of multicellular life) will die.
This is absolutely stupid.  If you have magic stones that can magically change the very fabric of reality, of time and space, of energy and matter (and on a universal scale); you can do way better than to obliterate half of all life. You can, for example, multiply the resources, or change literally everyone into being more efficient, needing less of said resources to function.  Also, the whole premise is just wrong: there's no scarcity of resources in the universe. Quite the contrary, resources are ridiculously abundant, specially in the Marvel universe, where literal magic AND multiversal shenannigans are a thing.  MAYBE not all people across the whole universe knows how to, or has the technology, to harvest and exploit said resources. Or maybe some of them are actually creating the illusion of scarcity in order to sustain socio-economic systems like, for example, capitalism (what we do! not fully commiting to renewable energy, planning obsolescence, etc). Thanos could change all of this.  Thanos is, actually, an idiot.
> why should we be morally horrified if another species does it to us?  Well Thanos did have the choice to do literally anything with the stones, including wishing for twice as many resources. In which case the exact same effect would be achieved, just nobody dies. Shit why not use the stones to create infinite resources? A star forge that just pumps out food, water, supplies, whatever? Reality could be whatever he wanted it to be, and he chose to murder 50% of life. Thanos was not right lol.
I'm sorry you're getting downvoted, because I see your point. However, there have been numerous discussions about the idea that halving the population would only set it back like 50 years or something. So Thanos was a bit short-sighted on what the actual effect would've been in the long run.   I upvoted you, because at least you're participating in the conversation.
Because we have ethics and this would be one being indiscriminately killing half of the universe for what only he thought was a good idea. Maybe it was a good idea, to play the devil's advocate. But this kind of thinking clashes with our modern tendency of having processes to follow, and checks and balances, regulations, etc. Technically he was a massive terrorist. One person/being shouldn't be allowed to make that kind of call in a unitarian way.   And it still seems highly unfair for random people to suddenly lose the one life they are given. Resources are limited, but there have been several times humanity appeared to near the possible limit of the earth's carrying capacity, and we've raised the ceiling for it every time with things that more efficiently grow food, cloning of meats, etc. True, there's only so much space to build housing on, but a ton of uninhabited land exists in Australia, America, Canada. And Antarctica could be fertile ground for settlement when it (unfortunately) warms more severely. There's a lot of ingenious methods that scientists continuously formulate to maximize space for living and bolster the amount of food prepared. The way houses and apartments are built could be changed to fit more in the same space without compromising individual units' space. There's no right or actual need for someone to take on a hero complex and try to be the universe's police and kill half the population of it. Human species (Homo habilis and others) overcame complex problems with minimal technology, and by cooperating like this, the human cranial capacity went from about 350 cc to nearly 1500 (cranium, and therefore, brain size). All we do is find solutions to huge problems. We have an ability to continually find solutions to things like resource management, and we already have found some. Not trying to be weird, but this circulated idea of how to tackle societal problems is really dumb and annoying to see perpetuated. It's not that bad. Climate change and some political problems are, but not this.
No, it would have only changed things for a few decades at most. The growth in human population has been exponential, not linear. Also it's capping off and will likely begin to decline no later than 2050.
I thought it was because they needed transportation out and the Quinjet was the best method?
Team Clint doesn't know where the Siberian base is, and Bucky probably doesn't have exact coordinates. Team Cap needs a flight to get out of Berlin, so it's more convenient for them all to rendezvous in Berlin, pick up gear and snacks and fly out together.   I'm assuming Berlin is a convenient place to find a suitable aircraft to travel to Siberia undetected etc,.
Kevin Fiege explained everyone was put in a safe spot when they came back.
"I wish you could've lived to see my prototype. It's not as ... conservative as yours."  The Iron Monger suit was built before he had the power source.
Tony went to the trouble of filming a farewell message to his loved ones the night before the time heist. It stands to reason that he'd update his will in the event that he dies but the mission was a success.   His newly updated will probably include some kind of financial provision for Peter, a scholarship to MIT, control of a planetary surveillance and drone network, etc,...
Yeah I'll be honest I really didn't expect that scene to last 45 minutes but it was a nice change of pace from Marvel's normal cgi heavy final fights.
Stark, SWORD and the DDOC can track the location of vibranium.  We learn that in Wandavision. Kinda ruins the plot of Wakanda Forever but hey.
Damage Control found it? Best I can think of
It took me over a year to finally notice the shield in the shot of Steve in his hospital bed after the big battle. I must have watched it on dvd ten times before someone mentioned it was there on the floor instead of still being unaccounted for.
Cap's shield is also destroyed fighting Thanos. The replacement is made after the battle for Cap's jaunt through time returning the Stones. All the emotional attachment in Falcon and the Winter Soldier is weird considering it's a replica a couple months old.
Yeah Damage Control.  They cleaned up the whole thing
AoU basically seems to ignore the entire phase 2 plot.  Tony stops being Iron Man and destroys his lab with all his suits, and then he's just Iron Man again.
I guess given that they all hated Tony Stark they wanted to do something to spite him in case they failed..with Stark being dead they moved sights onto his protege, Peter Parker. That's the only reason I can think of.
Just like prom night...
It really tied the planet together.
Ya, but didn’t their planet shut down that same day or something?  I mean, I don’t know what exactly that AI did, but if it was also the traffic control for all those flying cars or opened up the sewer runoff when pipes were overflowing, then they had a whole bunch of other issues to deal with due to her zapping it before they could schedule a trip back to Earth.   Hopefully, this is dealt with in the sequel and we get to hear from from pissed off Kree about how she made them late for work and they couldn’t get their TPS forms submitted on time.
Then Carol would come and destroy them. They’re basically dealing with mutually assured destruction.
Yea but generally things make sense on surface level. Like, Thor is supposed to be really strong, so you ignore how the physics behind many of his feats of strength just don’t make sense. But when they directly explain in the movie that the core of the planet is going to crack open, it’s weird that nothing really happens because of that.
I'm sorry but you can't apply the suspense of disbelief with tiamut 's emergence, you have to take in the consequences of this big mass rising from earth's Core.
The opposite.  Melting ice caps would raise sea level.  Tiamut coming up from below the ocean will allow water to flood down into the area it had been sitting, and lower sea level.
TVA said "no."
Hank intentionally never shares his formula. The only other person who ever figured it out is >!~~dead~~ ~~mutilated & stuck in the quantum realm~~!< dead.
The Titan battle was where I was thinking Strange could have used the portal. If he had, the glove wouldn't be attached to Thanos' hand, so he couldn't use the stones to rip the portal.   I guess it bugs me because it was used earlier in the movie, then they didn't use the same tactic when it would have been much more useful.
They really should have showed that on screen. Literally any explanation, even as simple as "his arms are powered by the Stones so theyre too strong for the portal to close". Either that or just never have done it to the other guy in the first place. Feels off.
> why include that scene at all?  It looks cool.     It also demonstrates a difference between Thanos & Cull; the former would not have stuck his hand through that portal.
Yes, there absolutely should've been a sequence where Stephen Strange attempts to pass a teleportal over Thanos's arm.  But the Space Gem flashes on the gauntlet, a colored ray shatters the portal, and also Stephen's sling ring explodes too.  That can further weaken Stephen for the rest of the battle, and give an explanation for why he can't run away back home.  (Until Wong helps 5 years later)
I thought that was plaster?
I mean that’s really the only way to make it work canonically so I’ll accept that. I imagine it was right before he took out the Nova Corps (which surprisingly I’ve never seen any deleted scenes or concept art of, even in the Holiday Special it’s only briefly mentioned. I wonder if we’ll see the aftermath in Vol 3)
That is dumb. Strange's actions in no way determined that rat would be there.
Yeah, though obviously they did not have the emergence of Tiamut in mind when they wrote that scene. And it still completely hinged on a rat, which is something that still really bugs me to this day. We can come up with theories all we want, but they're still just theories we're coming up with to compensate for questionable writing choices, especially since the MCU refuses to acknowledge or explore the consequences of Strange's actions and how many people died because of the Snap in those five years.
"Few deaths happened immediately after Thanos's snap. Everyone was suffering, but all the survivors had twice as much food, fuel, housing, and money. So they were OK."  That is... not how money works. Poverty would still be an issue. Starvation would even still be an issue, because we have enough food to feed everyone on the planet, resources are not an issue.  "when the population of every planet doubled overnight."  It wouldn't even be less than doubled.
The problem is Vision of all people would have seen the logic in the sacrifice and would have given his life without hesitation.
Right? Like something for real. I noticed it the most when I watched MoM and I asked my girlfriend how tf did the doctor know it was Strange who gave away the stone. He was on Titan as well. Like the only Earth Avengers leftover was Nat, Cap, Okoye, Bruce, and Rocket. But still I find it hard to believe Tony and Nebula told Earthlings.  But you could be right about someone holding a press conference, but wouldn't that just be Tony? Cuz Cap refused to sign the accords and therefore would've been arrested on the spot. Idk, maybe I'm overthinking this one.
but then why is he nicknamed 'The Reasonable Titan'?
pretty sure the time travel tech only works with the big time travel platform thing which he just blew up 5 minutes earler.
What?
The time-turner conundrum.
It's not just the position of the Earth but our solar system also moves the Milky Way Galaxy. But everyone was returned to a safe space.
Hmm I dont know. I feel like if Fury/Talos was a hologram, he'd disappear when Maria Hill and the rest of the building did. Also pretty sure he's had his share of guns fired at him.   Honestly maybe we shouldn't be really thinking about it
i think it’s part of the sacred timeline
But the third was also the second, so that doesn’t add up  The stones do whatever you want (aside from reversing the soul stone sacrifice) but it comes at a price of the life force of people who wield them in unison (ie a snap), that’s the whole thing. Both gauntlets were made to harness the power of the stones.
Yes this is serious? I mean as serious as a conversation like this could be. Lol. Don’t seem why this is so “obvious” since it’s all really a huge hypothetical based on the incoherent thoughts of a mad man.   If it was the same half wouldn’t that means it’s not at random? Which Thanos said it was. So technically, I could have blipped and some of my microbes could have stayed behind. Which would eventually die anyways most likely  Also, to your last paragraph. Maybe it’s true about earth. But I’m sure there’s planets who actually do lack resources and are starving. But your overall point definitely remains true about his plan overall.  The only way I see it not happening it if Thanos only meant sentient life, which another user pointed out to me. That makes more sense.  Edit. lol, holy downvotes Batman… why? This sub is so weird. Lol.
What's to say that the gut microbes in a snapped person didn't persist and fall to the ground.  Sure they'd die soon, but then so did the non-snapped in the helicopter, for example.
You’re probably right about the RBC/WBC. Just didn’t know how specific Thanos was. Since they’re technically living things.
Yeah, this might be the biggest "it breaks down when you think about it" in the MCU. However, we needed to have Thanos be a 'Madman' in the movies. You would've thought Thanos of all people could've seen a better way to do this once he had all the Infinity Stones. Not a knock on the movies obviously, but yeah...
He’s also an idiot because when you consider population growth, everything would be back to the old numbers in maybe 100 years, tops.
I'm not a big fan of "double the resources" this would only encourage populations to explode due to the excesses available. Let's assume halfing only gives us 50 years before we catch up, so then, multiplying only gives us 50 years before we catch up again, the only issue this time is there are now double the number of people in need compared to the example of halfing the life...where do you go from there.  The issue isn't with the lack of resources, it's with they way they are allocated or utilised. There is more than enough food produced here on earth to ensure every single human is fed properly multiple times over.....yet we have millions and millions starving.
Well how did Clint, Wanda and Scott get to Germany? Did they just board a regular plane with their arrows and suits? It does break down a little bit...
The quintet belonged to team Iron. Clint brought a helicopter that got blown up.
Y'all talking about Berlin here for some reason while the airport in question and the fight are in Leipzig (specifically, Leipzig/Halle airport). Yes, it's a nitpick and it doesn't actually change the point of the argument, but I felt obliged to mention this
I guess that makes sense in-universe.
Really hope we see more of the impact of Tony's death and what that means for Stark Industries in Armor Wars.
Tin foil hat time, I don’t think that was a recording.  I think Tony is AI now and is still making moves in the background.
They can track vibranium or that very specific vibranium body of Vision?
Plot was stupid anyway. They wanted someone dead who invented something. Things don’t get uninvented when you kill their inventor.
Remember, it’s a more of a symbol and that Steve gave it to Sam that they’re attached to, not just the shield itself. It’s a legacy in their world. Bucky was apart of the legacy and Sam grew up hearing it. It’s a huge deal
Which does make me wonder, where are the scraps of the original shield?
It’s a symbol, man.
You think Skrulls did this?
Aside from some angry protests about the peace treaty with Xandar the Kree/Hala seemed fine in GOTG, and that took place years after Captain Marvel. But I too hope between Secret Invasion and The Marvels we're able to see what all actually went down.
Carol was already working to destroy them as quickly as possible. Nothing else they can do would change that.
I don’t mind the science being wildly inaccurate. It’s fiction. But it is jarring how the other characters in the universe aren’t really interacting with the concept of Tiamut. To me, it should be something almost as significant to everyone’s lives as the blip. Maybe even a tipping point for mass global panic and distrust of powered beings. Admittedly, I’m a casual MCU fan, so maybe that’s why I’m confused about whether Eternals was in the same Earth as the Infinity Saga, or even MoM, NWH, Ms Marvel, She Hulk.
But don't you see? There was a giant volcano that erupted, sort of... 🤔 I got nothin'.
Hank Pym said "no."
Why though, did they have to explain that ant man going up his arse wouldn't work either?  Stop watching movies with cinema sins mentality. Yeesh.
Strange could move a portal over his arm, or Peter and Drax could lift sleeping Thanos and push him through.
He literally saw the future and the exact timeline to see what should be done to make it come true.
If you can see 14M possible futures, and you have the knowledge for how to steer the universe towards that future, you effectively caused it to happen.  It's like doing RNG manipulation in a video game.
Our guy tried to, but they hand waved him off.  He gave up easily because he knew the plot needed him to.
He couldn’t just give it. It was established that only Wanda could destroy the stone, he had to convince her.
>I find it hard to believe Tony and Nebula told Earthlings.  Well there is a line from Tony when he's hooked up to the IV in the beginning of Endgame. Cap is grilling him about Thanos, and Tony say "He wiped my face with a planet while the Bleecker Street magician gave away the store."  So he definitely eluded to Strange giving Thanos the stone, so maybe he ended up telling Bruce about it, because he revealed to the Ancient One what happened. I don't know if you've seen She-Hulk yet, but it's also revealed that Tony and Bruce spent some time in Mexico building a bar/lab, so Tony probably told him everything then.
Thanos had time travel but not Starks GPS that lets them go back to a specific moment in time with no risk.  Nebula sent a signal telling Thanos where/when she was.  Thanos would have had no problem firing endless goons into the quantum realm until one of them got through safely and then he would have followed.
the entire thing was an elaborate illusion for peter/the audience. fake fury in the car, fake fury gets shot.
It was pruned onscreen.
Ya.. apparently that’s not a thought process that’s allowed on here. I’m getting downvoted to oblivion for that thought!l
That’s a good question. Peter was taken via private jet but he was of course authorized to do so as he sided with Tony. I’d assume Scott, Clint, and Wanda all went under the guise of civilians but its shaky logic.
Maybe Clint flew them all over in it? It’s been a minute since I’ve seen Civil War and I’m having trouble remembering the small details.
Thank you for the correction. It's been a while since I've seen the film, so I'm just going by what the other guy said.   I guess it makes a bit more sense for team Cap not to hide out in a major metropolitan area with a strong UN presence.
The dude had back up plans for his back up plans
That'll explain the acronym 😳
Darcy just says they can track vibranium
Tbf Namors people have just about invented pants and might not be up to speed on how science works.
He did change his mind halfway through the movie from let's kill riri to let's take over the world. So he did kinda realize that.   Lol the story wasn't all too great. Still a lot of cool scenes.
The Shield of Theseus
Oh ya. I forgot about that, so I guess they were fine.
😂😂  I rest my case
Yeah, at first I was like "okay it's coming out THROUGH the volcano, that could make some sense..." then that was just its hand, and it's gigantic face erupts from the ocean.  "Nope, world is fucked."
You're reply had me laughing so loud😂😂
Because it really plays like foreshadowing that goes nowhere. They cut off a hand, theyre fighting a guy with a very important hand, he is immunized with hand-cutting-guy holding on to hand-guy's hand........ That's just a really obvious place to go with it. All the CGI in that fight, one of the attacks couldve been him shrugging off that same move.  It's more like they already showed Ant-Man go into a super strong guy's butthole and massify to kill him, then he physically goes up Thanos' butthole, and then.... nothing happens.  They dont need to explain everything, but certainly the things they bring to center stage.
He saw a possible future. Him giving Thanos the Time Stone in no way determined that a random rat would free Scott Lang five years in the future, especially considering there are millions of possibilities in those five years. That rat could have easily not gone in that building or not even been alive. There are just too many factors. Strange had no power over the rat.
Once again, Strange's actions did not steer the universe towards a future where a random rat saved Scott Lang. He did give Thanos the Time Stone so Thanos wouldn't kill Tony and Tony could later sacrifice himself to stop Thanos. But that had nothing to do with the rat. That is not how this works. Strange's actions had no direct effect on that rat.
He also couldn't. It had to be done by Wanda, and she refused until the last moment.
>because he knew the plot needed him to.  This is actually the real answer for the "why didn't X just do Y?" questions haha
They all got out of a van. Scott was even asleep, so I doubt they had just landed in a helicopter and he fell asleep between the helicopter and the van ride.
I always thought the Russos specifically picked Leipzig for their fight because of the Battle of Leipzig during the coalition wars against Napoleon, but that might just be in my history nerd head lol
I'm a plan, playing a plan disguised as another plan
Because Tony Stark learns from his mistakes
He was extremely thorough.
And there were Wakandans there who wouldn’t explain how inventing stuff works?
He saw 14,000,605 futures, not one.
14M some possible futures, out of an infinite amount, too. I had to head canon that he just stopped there and didn't keep looking. Maybe it was a butterfly effect, and he saw that giving up the Time Stone to Thanos at that exact moment led to a series of events that included the right people surviving the snap AND led to that rat being there at the right time AND ensured Tony's survival in the process so he could create the time machine. Butterfly caused a hurricane and Strange, flawed human that he is, assumed it was so rare an occurrence it had to be the only solution. He done lucked out.
It kinda pisses me off that they're downvoting you, because you're completely right. Strange probably didn't know diddly-squat about the rat until after the Battle of Earth; he wouldn't have seen it in his future-scrying, & it wasn't relevant to the actions he needed to take.
That's probably a bit too deep 😄
They could only speak to Namor and he's an arrogant dick who was born hundreds of years ago.   I presume Namor is like Mr. Burns mentally.
So what? By giving Thanos the Time Stone, he couldn't have guaranteed that the only future which remained was the one where a rat that just happens to be alive in five years just happens to be in the right place and just happens to free Scott Lang. Strange is not the TVA, he can't prune every alternate timeline he doesn't like. There were still millions of possibilities after he gave Thanos the Time Stone. I mean, the TVA is literally the only justification for why Strange's plan worked and Strange had no knowledge of the TVA. And untold trillions still died as a result of this.
Strange still had to rely entirely on dumb luck for the rat to be there. If it had gotten eaten before it saved Scott, it's game over for Strange. I can buy him ensuring Tony's survival. That's obvious and calculated. But the rat? No. That is just too random.  But Strange also nearly made things worse since 2014 Thanos almost succeeded in killing all life in the universe, which he wouldn't have done if not for Strange's gambit. Not to mention there is still all the suffering caused by both the Snap and the Blip, since trillions would have died during those five years and even more people would have died after those five years due to the chaos that would cause.  Honestly, it does feel like character assassination as well for Strange to be willing to sacrifice so many people, considering that in the first Doctor Strange movie he was willing to sacrifice himself over and over again by trapping him and Dormammu in a time loop, finding a creative solution to a threat he couldn't overpower traditionally. He did that in Multiverse of Madness too. But he couldn't find a solution in Infinity War that didn't require trillions dying?  There is always another way. And Strange is an expert at finding those unusual solutions.
And that’s not a bad plot point?
Oh it was a bad plot point right at the start when they ddnt notice Wandavisions establishment of vibranium detection, don't see any reason to keep going with it.  I do like the idea of Namor as being hopelessly out of touch though.  Maybe they can put him on the Quinjet sometime and he can ramble on about the decelerationrix or the current price of spats.
We’re here for it
This is so cool!
Tuff
I love it
Looks cool
Btw from where u get the fonts and the thingies
Roynin
I enjoyed the Hawkeye show but what a missed opportunity of not fully telling the Ronin story
I use Picsart
Dude what ?
Well this is an interesting exercise so let me give it a shot and do a quick "what if "breakdown   Avengers 1 happens roughly the same but I think the avengers win the battle of New York a little faster and easier due to strange being more powerful than tony . Strange should be able to beat back Loki and his minions fairly easily especially with hulk and thor to back him up   Age of Ultron doesn't happen because as you said no Tony - age of Ultron ends after avengers sack struckers hydra base obtain scepter and party at avengers tower since wanda has no one to mind corrupt into inventing Ultron . No movie   Civil war never happens since no Tony there. and strange and Steve might actually agree on accords - and the avengers never divide . They go on the run as a unified team since there's no dissension .   Infinity war and endgame is tough because the whole status quo is different- Tony is now on scene as a pro registration hero and the anti registration avengers are underground when thanos attacks . Banner and thor might still be on earth since Ultron never happens so no hulk in space . Thor might've stayed with Jane or gone home to stop the nine realm disarray. Thanos might have a harder time if avengers are unified on earth while still possessing the mind and time stone
Strange: *"While heroes like the Avengers protect the world from physical dangers, we sorcerers safeguard it against more mystical threats."*  He wouldn't join Fury / the Avengers. The Avengers would still form without Iron Man, they might've lost against the Chitauri but let's assume they don't and/or Strange does help out a bit (but still doesn't join).  Ultron never gets made, so no Avengers 2 movie. Iron Man joins later on, Civil War (or basically everything) might get delayed but would eventually still happen and the rest continues as usual.
Assuming Stephen would actually join is an issue on its own but side stepping that issue.  Things get bad very quickly. Stark Industries is still a weapons manufacturer. The good of that is Shield likely gets more advanced weapons via contracts. Negative is that Obadiah Stain is still double dealing.  Avengers 1 Stephen likely stops Loki in Germany. He would be captured and portaled into a secure facility. Thor then attacks the facility and will lose to Stephen. I have no idea how they would deal with Thor after that point, to be honest.  Assuming the helicarrier still becomes relevant, we get to a similar attack from Barton. This time, though, the Helicarrier will crash. The belittle of New York wouldn't happen. There is no Arc reactor or known large powersource there.  Most likely, California would be the battle ground as we know the old Arc reactor is there. Stark Industries is going to be involved in all of this regardless. They are going to get owned.  Hulk is not going to be part of this battle as he wouldn't bond with anyone. Steve, Stephen, maybe Thor, Natasha, and Barton are involved. Stephen likely can win on his own, but Tony will be set off here and have Alien tech. We are not getting Ironman. We are getting Tony at his worst handed new toys with a bone to pick.  From this point, everything is up in the air. The world will quickly advance in weapon technology. Ultron likely still would happen but would likely be a joint project between Stark Industires and the US government. Hydra probably wins.
Strange would have never joined the Avengers. Lol, he would've given Fury the Loki treatment and then everything would have spiralled into something worse.
I don’t think it would’ve worked tbh
Avengers: Strange makes a portal right at the entry of the tesseract portal, sending all the chitauri to a lava pool. Or if he's too late for that, portal the nuke into the enemy lines instead of carrying it up there
Yup they have so many options to defeat the mindless chitauri army - strange's versatility makes this battle a fair walk imo
That's close to what we saw in She Hulk show.
In the context of what they were doing on hulk, I get why they made some changes. Don't know why they ditched the fins/ears, but I get changing the colour.  The movie was already fairly dark (in terms of lighting), having them fight at night in the rain in a pretty hectic fight, I could easily see the audience getting confused by who's who.
I like the idea that he wasn’t done transforming from multiple serums that he got injected with.
Don’t forget his sandals!
You fixed his ears. Nice.
Thanks, I love it.
When will we get a George Lucas-like update to this film with Mark Ruffalo awkwardly photoshopped over Edward Norton and Abomination gets this update?
Thanks, I hate it.
Im still tryna conceive how Emil got these water animal ears and Bruce did not?? Wasnt it the same serum and radiation combination? :)
We saw it in shang chi first
I think they ditched the fins cuz they think hulk will just rip them off, which is stupid cuz that would’ve been awesome to see
We will assume that they are from below.
Maybe his ears were always on
I think with the development of neural networks, in about 5 years it will be easily possible.
True
You forget that instead of ripping his ears off, Hulk instead ripped out the elbow protrusion and stabbed him with it... It was equally brutal
They probably didn’t post their evil plans on the corporate servers.
He hacked the files ***Fury*** had access to. Do you think Hydra let Fury have access to their information?
The point of Winter Soldier was that there was no difference between SHIELD and Hydra. They’re not even two sides of the same coin, they’re the same side. So it’s not like there would be files marked with an octopus or anything. He didn’t find any Hydra files because they’re *all* Hydra files. After all, Project: Insight was Fury’s idea.
HYDRA managed to hide themselves from Fury. Hiding themselves from Tony is much easier than that.
I doubt Hydra had any files on SHIELD's servers lol  They would probably keep everything hidden inside computer-Zola
I’m pretty sure Tony hacked the helicarrier. I don’t think that means all SHIELD servers.  It’s like, if you compromised an aircraft carrier you wouldn’t have every file stored at the pentagon.
Along with what everyone else said I’d bet shield has unimaginable amounts of data so for him to find something he wasn’t looking for would be unlikely
Jesus this question again.
Fair point 😂  Highlight of the rewatch so far was Clint and Maria Hill having a bonnet to bonnet shootout in the tunnel firing several shots each, but not managing to hit what was essentially at the end of their respective barrels!
The guy made time travel safe for use, telling me he couldn’t put a couple of 2’s together to get a 4?  His hack would almost certainly have been thorough from another borough, Zemo just a prime example of what was there to see
>The guy made time travel safe for use, telling me he couldn’t put a couple of 2’s together to get a 4?  Just because a person is smart in one field, it doesn't mean they are in every other field. And considering Tony is shown as being smart in several fields, the movies are already pushing it enough as it is.  My point is: Tony is good with tech. He can hack S.H.I.E.L.D.'s stuff, but he's not a spy, nor a detective. Heck, as someone else pointed out, he probably only accessed whatever files Fury had access to, and considering he wasn't HYDRA, there would be nothing pointing towards them. In Winter Soldier, they have Pierce unlock S.H.I.E.L.D.'s database, and even then, it need confirmation from both Pierce and Fury!
He did tho?  He immediately called fury out for making hydra type weapons using the tesseract
He didn't find out the Winter soldier killed his parents until Civil War
Well, he didn’t put 2 and 2 together when he found evidence of them making full-on Hydra weapons, so no, I guess he couldn’t.
Tony used to sell weapons to bad guys. What makes you think he would be able to distinguish good from bad so early in his redemption arc? They were fighting aliens at the time, not humans.
https://www.cbr.com/who-is-sentry-steven-yeun-thunderbolts-role-mcu/
He is >!the villain in the Thunderbolts movie and is played by Steven Yeun!<  He is >!Valentina's creation, probably through some version of the serum, and while he will be part of the team at first, he will go rogue halfway through as the Void will slowly take over him!<  They will >!release a Special Presentation shortly before the movie as a prelude that will get to dive a bit into the character and his origin before we see him as a Thundberbolts member in the movie!<  These all come from various, very reliable sources.
I really don’t like that casting
To not do movies with him would in my opinion be such a waste since he is such a complicated character that could have a deep exploration  Cool casting rumor, as long as they do him with golden hair after he gets his power I'm all for it
What a fucking waste of such a complex character.  And how fucking stupid to have him face the freaking thunderbolts...  He should curbstomp everyone on the team
I would have prefered another but I like him.  BUT from my understanding the rumers goes that he will become the void and the Thunderbolts will get together to stop him..  The Sentry/The Void should be an Avenger if not MCU lvl threat not a freaking B level team..  If this is true I Fears the MCU is dying slowly
First of all, please hide your spoilers like I did.  Secondly, my theory is that >!the team will realize very soon that they can't beat him, so they will try to bring Robert back on the wheel and then the real villain will be Val as she was manipulating everyone from the beginning, resulting in the Thundberbolts cutting their ties with her and the government and becoming their own independent team of anti-heroes.!<
Not sure why Magneto has to be anyone's dad
No.
No characters in the mcu should be retcon to be magneto's child. They'll just have to bring Polaris as magneto's daughters just like in the comics. When they bring magneto, they'll just have him have 1 child in the mcu.
Stop it.
Umm...why?
No.
You should really hate the X-Men to suggest such a terrible idea...  If someone should be presented as Magneto's daughter *at all*, the obvious choice is POLARIS.
😆
It would be extremely easy to make Wanda a mutant and have him as the father. Wandavision even set it up for her to do an inverse of "No more Mutants".
What is blud waffling on about?
Well, Wandavision already hinted at Wanda's mutant origins with the flashback to her childhood.  If the problem is that she and Pietro already had parents that weren't Magneto, simple, say they were adoptive parents. After all, it's not like Magneto has been there for them in the comics.
The door is over there. So is the report button. ➡️
Polaris probably agrees.
Ok
Magneto could have two daughters, but Polaris' sister will be Jean Frey instead of Wanda.
Why would there be an inverse of no more mutants in the mcu? In which context would this happen? How did they set this up? Outside of it being loosely inspired by HoM there’s nothing to say this would happen
"No, more mutants!"
But that's not gonna happen because marvel studios don't like to be like the comics.
The origin of her powers comes from the mind stone.
Why?
I never thought it would be that easy. My work here is done. Lol.
Dude, just... no.
In wandavision, she ended up altering reality during an emotional breakdown from feeling so alone. It manifested in a way that mimicked the realities that she envied. In this case, the shows. They established that the changes were absolutely real from how Monica's clothes remained the same after leaving the hex, and she created two children. This occurred when she was only using a fraction of her power.   Now take that setup and apply it to MoM. She saw multiple realities where she was happy and not alone. The one she focused on had mutants since we saw Xavier as one of the illuminate. In her final scene, she was showing the same emotions as when she created the hex. She essentially just lost her only perceived chance of having family and felt all alone. She was at full strength in this scene and when they panned away we saw a red flash of light.   The next project was Ms.Marvel where they used the term mutation for the first time in the mcu. In she hulk there were several Easter eggs that seemed to imply that mutants existed. The most telling was an article on her computer that said a man with metal claws was involved in a bar fight.
The fact some people actually want this lol
Tbh, I think it has already happened.
Wandavision literally shows a flashback from when she was a child that makes it obvious she had her powers already. The only thing the Mind Stone did was enhance them, making her aware of them and able to control them.
She doesn’t have the power to make mutants like that, there are meant to be lots of mutants stronger than her it would be weird if she makes them in the mcu. Plus it ruins characters like raven, destiny, sinister, apocalypse, wolverine etc.   Also it kinda ruins the point of mutants who are meant to feel like a more natural phenomenon and having Wanda, who was hated by mutants for like 15 years mutant Jesus is weird
What?
At the end of MoM there was a big red flash when the temple came down. It was established that she had seen multiple realities that she envied, and the main one she focused on had mutants. The next project was Ms.Marvel and they mentioned mutation for the first time in the mcu. She hulk had several Easter eggs suggesting that mutants existed such as a news headline about a man with metal claws getting in a bar fight.
She doesn’t have the power to do that and it would be weird if she did
In wandavision, her kids had powers.
That’s different she birthed them
And her "brother?" Did she give birth to him as well?
Did you not watch the show or? Agatha gave him that power
But as whole   The world rejoiced over his departure lol
I love how he implicitly admits he cares about shareholders instead of the product, the employees or the customers. Classic soulless corporate.
This is the racist who argued vehemently against Marvel making "Black Panther", and who *still* says they shouldn't have made it, even though the movie made a ton of money. MAGA dirtbag.
Like yesterday, still nothing to add, but this: "Lmfao"
If shareholders like one thing, it’s profit, and if one thing is profitable, it’s successfully selling to your customers. A good start to that is actually making a product customers are interested in, something Perlmutter routinely failed to produce. Shareholders should be very happy with his departure.
Lol.
Fuck the shareholders then. Disney should've sacked Perlmutter long ago.
You do you, boo, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise! We are rooting for you! History will remember you! /s
oh no  not the shareholders
I can't imagine spending my twilight years worrying about shareholder value.  He's going to spend the hereafter wearing the chains he forged in life.
He’s a cunt
Every other comment in this sub is Ike Perlmutter. Is he just getting over-reported, or is he incapable of shutting his trap for two minutes?
Nah
I guess this is technically true, in the sense that Ike himself *is* a major shareholder & *he's* sad about this. But other than that, screw 'im.
Good riddance
The comics division needs to expel this sludge.
Don't hit the door on your way out!
Good news, Ike. You can improve Disney immensely by leaving it alone and never touching it again.
Gonna give him credit for being honest there.
If audiences had been happier with Thor 4 and Antman 3, shareholders would've benefitted too.
He isn't even American either, he's Israeli
Ah but in new capitalism, making 1 billion but spending 20 million on peasants is a worse option than making 30 million but spending 1 million on peasants
He rarely talked until this week. There's also only like two photos of him in existence.
I vaguely recall that she met them back around the time she was introduced. But that might have been another new Inhuman, there were a lot of them for a while.
Not in the movies or shows so far. In the comics she's met Lockjaw, the pet of the royal family, and a Google search turns up a [comic](https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2022/6/7/1e161d26-50ea-4712-bd8e-9420c61de0de-image_2022-06-07_183917982.png?w=374&h=575&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress) where she interacted with Medusa, the queen of the Inhumans (the scene should be in Ms Marvel #9, but I've not read that issue of the comic myself)
Yes, she teams up with Wolverine this one time and so he puts in a word with Medusa about Kamala and she sends Lockjaw to be her Inhuman guide.
Fingers crossed she interacts with blackbolt in the Marvels
She has met them, during Kamalas first run she trains with the Inhumans just outside New Jersey for a couple of months.  We only see her "on screen" with Medusa, Lineage and a few others but we know everyone else Inhuman was there from other comics and it would be weird if they never met.  Kamala likes them but ultmately rejects Medusas offer to live with the Inhumans and stays in NJ. Uniquely Medusa lets Kamala go without much fuss, saying that she's special but it's sorta implied that because Wolverine, Cap and Carol know about Kamala and would protect her that plays a part in the decision to not make Kamala choose a side.  Her brother is also left alone, but that might be because he isn't interested in even using his powers and only wants to be an Imam, even though >!he can put Carol Danvers on her ass without even trying.!<
In the comics she is inhuman but in the MCU she's a mutant. Apparently she was supposed to be a mutant.
She's interacted with many of them. She did personalized training at the Inhumans Facility and had a close bond with Medusa in her first series.
Look, you can’t just do that to people, I was scared for your life reading that title
I know she met Medusa at least, as I have the first two volumes of her debut series, and it happens in one of them.
Thanks. I was talking about the comics. I should have said that :) sorry
Cool its abit weird that shes never met the full inhuman royal family tho. Thanks for answering
Does that mean shes going to Hawaii? 😂
Thanks :) i dont know much about kamala outside of the new show and the avengers game so its good to know. Iv always liked black bolt myself and iv found it weird that kamala hasn't been seen face to face with the inhuman royal family (except medusa) thanks for saying
Idk how true that is in the comics when they were made but tbh i feel her being an inhuman is more unique ngl
Its just "honestly curious" how does that scare anyone?
Honestly I'd highly recommend reading Kamala Khans 2014 and 2016 Ms. Marvel comic runs to literally anyone, even if they never read a comic before.   They are some of the best comics ever made. Incredibly well written.
This picture was taken with a Nokia flip phone from 2005.   Source: my Nokia flip phone from 2005
Looks like some of the guardian will end up just living back on knowhere again
It looks so dark and daunting. I like it.
I see about 3
I’m no stickler but this doesn’t seem to adhere to COVID protocols in place on Hollywood-produced film sets still lol.
I hate myself for having such high hopes for this movie.
It looks like a screenshot from a YouTube video? What’s the source?
They found it in the same place Kraglin found that Zune.
Only because it was the last shot filmed, doesn’t mean it’s the last shot in the movie.
Between the uniforms, Cosmo's increased role, and the line about the Guardians buying Knowhere, I wouldn't be that surprised if this movie ends with a new team line-up, setting the stage for future, truer to text movies with the Gunn trilogy being the MCU's equivalent of the Annhilation: Conquest Star-Lord mini.
You think they would’ve revelead this if it had any potential spoiler indications? As someone else said, this was likely the last thing shot, not the last thing chronilogically.
That's why it was filmed in Atlanta.  Pinewood studio
I don't, I expect at least an improvement from what we've seen lately because James Gunn actually knows what he's doing
Most deaths and big scenes were filmed on a closed set.    This was a battle that took place on Knowhere and was last shot of the entire principal filming.
Often times the end of the films are shot first because the actors look their best then. Particularly male actors that have to maintain a shirtless physique. Shoot those scenes and shots first.   Think every boxing film made. The boxing scenes, especially the climatic one, is filmed first.
Knew I was going to get these comments 🙄
But are they not still guidelines that were voted on by the unions that al of these crew members work in? Just because it’s not shot in Hollywood, doesn’t mean it’s not a Hollywood funded production, which of course it is.
I’d imagine it’s easier to keep it under wraps early on as well so it doesn’t get spoiled by people camping out hoping to get a pic.
man got downvoted random asf lmaooo this is true, i’ve seen quite a few interviews about that. a lot of people on camera who have wild physiques at different times in the movie want those shots done first, and the ones where they can eat normal and hide their body with clothing are taken the longest. it just makes sense really
Don’t know why you got downvoted but this is actually true. It’s to minimize continuity risks.  Source: I work in film
I mean... they're right though.
Production ran from November 2021 to March/April of 2022 by then lots of guidelines expired.
Ah ok. Could've sworn masks were still being used until just recently when they announced they'd let the guidelines expire when the federal government is basically saying the pandemic is officially over in May.
Disney: oh course, we'd happily buy the DC properties!
I say this as a lifelong DC fan: if I were at Marvel Studios/Disney, I wouldn't touch WB/DC with a 100-foot pole.
The only way I see this happening is a Lego Marvel Vs DC adaptation. I'm very okay with this.
Too soon, man. Like, do the DCU proper first. Then we can think about a Crossover.  Snyder rushed it with BvS and Justice League to catch up with Marvel without taking time to build up individual characters, for example.
Not going to happen unless its maybe animated.  The live action dc brand is toxic.
Please no, they can both be good separately.
That would be bad. I hope it never happens in a live-action big studio film.
Buff Groot Vs Black Adam movie is a big missed opportunity
Is Deadpool going to show up and shoot all the DC characters and writers?
I think it's possible within the next 10 years.  But not as a main plot point. Just like a fun, multiverse scene where you get a few of the big heroes all in the same room.
Likely the only way to get some folks to see DC movies.
It'll never happen. Marvel has no reason to go anywhere DC at the moment, they're definitely the bigger name right now. Plus, the rights issues and issues of wanting their own characters to be shown as the best would tie the movie up in red tape for years.
As others have said. He needs to fix dc first before looking into this. But hey. If DC animation wanted to do something. Would be nifty.
Gwenpool/Superboy
I'm mean animated is really thr best way to go. Hell a avengers vs justice league or team up animated film would be really cool. Keep in mind one thing dc has been really good at is animation.
I think it will happen when both of their movies start tanking in the box office is the norm. The comics did crossovers when sales were bad.  But that won't be for awhile if Marvel does a good job rebooting X-Men and Fantastic Four.
I always thought that a Marvel/ DC crossover would be one of a few things that could provide the same level of hype as Endgame or more. But DC needs to get an established Universe under its belt first.
It's interesting how places everywhere are putting the headline that he's teasing a crossover when he distinctly didn't do that, and much worse that people will just copy the headline and post it in other places.  Anyway it's good to know he's focused on making the DCU stand strong before trying to rush anything with it. The DCU has to be able to crossover within itself before doing anything with the MCU is even considered.
If they could create a dc universe consistent and not recast and redo their films again and again, the crossover would be good i think?
Please. God. No.   Keep DC and Marvel seperate on the big screen.  Those crossover stories are not good
Why don’t we focus on making good marvel and dc films individually before we start putting them together
LOL.  Why would Marvel want this? Maybe if WB can get its shit together, but I doubt even Gunn can save WB from itself.   And even then, there's too many Marvel characters I still want to see on screen before I watch a marketing gimmick crossover.
There is almost no way this ever happens, and I’m perfectly ok with that honestly. As much as I love DC (in addition to marvel) they’re just not on the same level, not until DC start to put out quality movies with a logical connecting story between them.
Gunn is just being a promoter and trying to create hype. He’s basically the Dana White of DC now.
Just bring in Cavill for a multiverse movie, and have him pick up Mjolnir, and the shield somewhere along the line.
Too early. Let's even discuss the possibility when both universe can stand on its own.
It would be cool to see these franchises crossover, and they could do it to where it’s not essential to the main stories for Marvel or DC, yet still remains within the timeline. I think people are too harsh on this idea.
I've been on this bandwagon for a while in terms of James Gunn being the head of DC Studios.
The DCU needs to get on its feet and establish itself as it’s own successful universe before anyone could even think about crossing it over with the MCU. And I know I may be in the minority here, but with the exception of maybe a couple films Gunn’s slate for the DCU doesn’t look too exciting to me
Love how people immediately dismiss this as a bad idea. So unimaginative. Also, if you read the article you wouldn't have to comment "it's too soon" because he clearly says both have to be properly established before it happens.
Honestly I never ever want a live action crossover. I don’t have strong feelings but I just cannot imagine it being done in any way that didn’t feel goofy as shit. Hard pass.
it was one thing having to watch the sony spider man and venom films to understand no way home but if I have to watch the dc films to understand the next marvel movie then that’d be too much  remember when the marvel shows used to be supplementary, as in you could understand the mcu without watching them, but the shows that came out since 2021 are mandatory to watch  there’s hundreds of hours of marvel tv shows from 2013 to before 2021 that are supplementary, imagine if all the sudden they made it so you had to watch every single one to understand the mcu going forward, it’d be too much  heck even just making one show mandatory to understand the mcu, would be too much  making the sony spider-man and venom films mandatory to understand the mcu is one thing because it’s 7 movies  but a multi-season tv show is longer than 7 movies  i don’t care how good daredevil is, I hope it stays supplementary, I don’t want to be forced to watch it to understand the mcu, I want to watch it for my own enjoyment, not cause I have to  daredevil and kingpin so far in the mcu movies haven’t been used in a way that necessitates watching the netflix show, I haven’t seen she-hulk, but as long as his characterization is done in such a way as to keep the netflix show supplementary rather than mandatory, I am good
Once Gunn's DC Universe is all fleshed out and more well established, I would love to see this happen.
LMFAOOOOC I am sorry but he doesn’t have the range
I think the best thing they could do is bring in a live action version of “Access” who can make slight cameos in some multiverse movies. I’m thinking he could show up in the flash movie, and in Avenger: the king dynasty or secret wars
When this does finally happen we will know this wave of superhero movies is on the way out and something else is really on the rise. The studios will be looking for the last big paydays.
Yeah, most of you are probably right…  EXCEPT  I remember a Spider-man/Batman team-up where Ra’s Al Ghul blackmailed Kingpin into helping him and then Kingpin outsmarted Ra’s, Bats and Spider-man.  So hear me out; what if they did a crazy Jonathon (I don’t know, spelling) Gordon-Levitt as Batman, Andrew Garfield as Spider-man with like someone cool as Ra’s and maybe not Kingpin per se, but Tombstone.  Marvel might not be into it, but maybe Sony would.    Make it different enough that it doesn’t go into the new DCEU/MCU, but write it as an old style Ra’s story where Spidey fights ninjas.
Put one Marvel cameo in Peacemaker.  Just for a moment. Maybe a portal opens up showing a clip from MCU and Peacemaker and Vigilante have a bit of banter over it.  That show was weird enough to do it.
Unpopular opinion: this is the logical next step. Endgame was such a massive moment that nothing could be bigger…unless Superman showed up
Best way to make a DCU movie is inside an MCU movie.
Click bait
Please.......just no
Disney/Marvel wouldn't go along with this unless they had 100% creative control, which they wouldn't have over the DC characters. So will never happen regardless of the creative heads involved.
Fuckkkkkk nooooooo
The time Marvel and DC will do a crossover is the time time you’ll know superhero movies are in big trouble.
Hell to the no no no.
Please, fucking no
Of course, media casually rephrases something Gunn said
Needed a good laugh today. Love gunn movies but haha
No. NO! NOOOOOOOOO!!!
Ya’ll have no imagination ffs
No thank you
I dont even wanna think about this till both studios get back on track lol.
No real fan of Marvel or DC wants this!!!
I’ll take things that won’t happen unless Disney buys DC for $400, Alex.
Please dont
No, I'm good. I don't need DCEU in MCU.
Even if both were at their absolute best quality, I would give it a **MASSIVE NO**. It’s honestly the dumbest thing ever and would only really work in animated form.
I really hope James is as/better than Kevin with DC, but not this. No.
I jokingly said "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" a few years ago but Gunn apparently has the same idea.  https://screenrant.com/groot-rocket-weasel-king-shark-james-gunn-crossover/
No, please, no
Yea in 20 years
Animated probably. If  live action, what will it be? X-Men × future new Justice League? DC doesn't even have any superhero teams left now. They've cancelled everything that's not standalone. And by then current MCU heroes will be out.
Lol he thinks he is getting something that he’s not. Methinks he overestimates his power
Disney should just buy DC and call it a day.
I don’t like it. I think that breaches what’s special about Marvel and the finiteness of that world. Even having these multiverse crossovers with FOX and Sony era renditions of characters is pushing it a little bit.   Keep it separate.
Dear James  Please don’t taint the MCU with the ~~DC Cineverse~~ clogged toilet*  Thank you
Please….please do not. This multiverse shit is messy and damaging enough to the MCU.
No, keep the garbage over there.
Ok but who is even Superman or Batman for that matter
I can see this happening Spiderverse style. Live.. nah thanks.
The absolute endgame of both CU's is Marvel vs. DC. Will take a long long time though, then we'd get a universe reset.
Considering by the time DC has a roster capable of doing this we'll probably have next to none of the current MCU actors still active nobody here has a clue if this could be done well or not.
Nah I'll pass
Please don’t tarnish MARvel with Batman and Batman
Ew ….
Meh. Marvel is using their C tier characters on their main roster now. Missed that boat by a few years.
He is going to try everything to have a good ex film. Even if it means for marvel to produce it.
I mean….I guess
Annnnnnd …  it’s officially over for marvel studios
After the travesty that was Thor: Love and Thunder, I do not like this possibility even one little bit.
lol that’s bad if they’re already looking at a crossover
I think before he shoots, for that, he should ask to play with one of Disney’s other toys, like the aliens and predators  Given the history of the comic crossovers, I think that would be a very good fit
no thanks : )
Only crossover i want is green lantern with deadpool!
Uhhh nope!
Sounds awful. Please don’t.
Because the number of characters is the problem.
I don’t want this at all lol
Yeah, that’s not gonna happen. Who is he kidding.
Batman VS Predator (owned by Disney)
[Amalgam universe or gtfo](https://www.cbr.com/most-powerful-marvel-dc-mash-ups/)
🤯
Thor vs Superman. lol and no Black Adam in sight. Give Henry Cavil one good send off.
Just make a What if season based on Amalgam, that would be cool  Cal Dodd as Dark Claw vs Mark Hamil' as The Hyena, imagine that
My first thought was "Oh hell no!" but then I thought...Okay, I would gag if Cavil did a Superman cameo in Deadpool 3.
just keep the rock out of it
You wanted more?!?!?
The only way I could see this working is with animation or videogame crossover injustice style with a great story
Quit playing James with my heart…..
Everybody gangsta until Tony Stark and Bruce Wayne enter the same room.
I’d like an animated project
I want to see Dark Claw (Wolverine/Batman fusion) on the big screen!
A movie focusing in the Amalgam comics would be amazing. Imagine watching frickin Dark Claw in the big screen.
I love Marvel and DC stuff (admittedly the former a bit more than the latter, even recently) but I can't say a crossover would have me hyped. I'd love to see what James Gunn does with the DCEU and I know that from what he said he doesn't want it happening too soon which is good, as right now the DCEU is in a sorry state and Marvel's quality has been steadily declining since the Infinite Saga ended and it'd be nice to see both studios up the quality a bit more before a collab
Just yesterday I thought about this 😮
But, TBH i wouldnt want to be straight Marvel vs DC. Id rather see Team up (Bats, Sups, WW, Hulk, Wanda, Strange, Thor) against an Enemy treathening both Multiverse (DC and Marvel)
I don’t know about everyone else but I don’t want it. No other reason beyond a gimmick and fan service. Let the two universes exist separately.  I know its a very talked about topic, I just hope Gunn isn’t saying this just to get on the good graces of DC fans who dislike his takeover.
Only way this would really work is if they released a "What if" style animation about the amalgam universe and split the shows 50/50 between D+ & HBO Max to keep everyone happy. Maybe even do it like "Star Wars Visions" and have all the episodes be different styles, so like the "Iron Lantern" episode would be in the style of the Iron Man 90s show, and "Dark Claw" episode would be in the BTAS style, and so on and so forth.
Loved man of steel and the dark knight trilogy… but DC now other than maybe the new Batman films is just a total mess.
NO
If I get a Hugh Jackman Batman movie-like "Darkclaw" solo film before I die... I'd die happy.
Yawn
Love how henry cavill is still the face of DC even if he was fired
There’s no way Disney clears it but otoh I feel like DC is desperate enough to try anything to save the DCEU rn (I got into the MCU in 2013 -  DC was always my fave company since childhood so I very much want to see the DCEU succeed too)
Please no, crossovers are so fucking lame.
Please don’t.
Maybe he should think about putting out a movie during his slate rather than hyping people up for shit that we all know is very unlikely to happen.
Idc if I’m in the minority or not but I truly hope there isn’t a massive crossover event like the old Marvel X DC books. If they’re gonna crossover at all, it better be fucking tasteful, intentional, and truly unique. Also obvs VERY small scale. I don’t wanna deal with Spider-Man and Superman and Blue Devil and Frog Man and Flash and Blade all on the same fucking screen. I’ll just vomit in my lap.  I’m just already like preemptively getting overwhelmed and annoyed at the idea of constant crossovers just for the sake of stacking IPs into one product.
Perhaps a What If? Crossover
Someone should ask Hugh Jackman if he has ever heard of Dark Claw...
It reads like he was asked a question about the possibility of crossovers and he straight batted a reply rather than refusing to answer at all and then they didn’t include the question.
This would stop the fatigue that people are having with super hero movies, would get that flame going again for many.
Honestly with all this super hero fatigue, this idea of a crossover is the only thing that would make me excited to go to the cinemas. However, once we get to this point where a crossover between Marvel and DC is made is when the genre is dead and lost all meaning
They can barely keep a coherent story in the MCU lately, adding some random DC stuff would be madness.
I've said it before and I'll say it again, MAKE IT A LEGO MOVIE. Just pure jokes. LEGO Batman movie-style. Everyone would immediately know it's not canon so the writers and director can just let loose with all the toys they can play with.
Dude, this actually happened in the comics, why do people hate the idea and don't even think it's possible? I think that a hypothetical Marvel vs. DC would be like Infinity War and Endgame, having a first and second part, but being a trillion times more crazy
Sure, when Gunn is able to put DC on a better position negociations-wise, Disney will be open to discuss money.
Idc about a big event but Spider-Man/Batman would make me cum
Hm no thanks.
Marvel: No, it's not.
Lol. Id rather they both focus on bettering their recent content than doing relatively empty fan service stuff like this
This really would be the last superhero movie; sort of a hands-up moment of running out of ideas.
While I'm beyond confident that James can turn DC around, I've never been too into the idea of DC and Marvel crossing over. I can buy into a lot of the fantastical ideas that both franchises offer, but the only way to explain a crossover is through the multiverse, and right now, their multiverses work too differently. It just wouldn't make sense and would come off as forced fan service.  I'm fine with fan service, Endgame is basically just Fan Service: The Movie... but it all served a purpose. DC vs Marvel wouldn't.
DC Universe is an absolute mess without any unison in direction for the Universe.  Marvel Universe over-bloated little shallow depth and no sense of progression like they had with Infinity War / End Game.  Maybe two wrongs make a right? hah. yr
Awww yeah…  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Uncanny_X-Men_and_The_New_Teen_Titans
Luckily Feige won’t do it until both universes are in a place where it would make sense, and when both universes have the same draw in terms of audiences. They aren’t gonna share profits with WB if it’s just gonna be the same turnout of Marvel fans that they get for all of their releases.   As much as Gunn is doing some good work with the DC properties, it’s gonna be a long time before it can even hope to be at the same level of cultural significance that the MCU is at.   At this point a crossover would be a huge boon for DC, but ultimately kind of pointless for Marvel.
Nice! Live action Dark Claw here we come!
If they couldn't even get the Lego Marvel vs DC off the ground they definitely aren't going to get anything live action going.
Don’t even get our hopes up
Too late. The only characters that would be cool in a crossover for marvel are gone except Spider-Man. Hopefully good characters from the X-men are here in time for something like that.
Disney doesn’t need this. WarnerBros does.
Please don’t do this.. just don’t
Nooooo please dont
The main problem with this crossover idea is that historically these things just aren’t any good.
in 15 years maybe yeah
I think that's a good "in case of emergency break glass". If ever superhero movies start to tank just make a Spiderman vs Batman and you'll make millions.
Is WB-Discovery financially healthy right now?
yeah no thanks
A few years ago, sure, but Disney is coming under a lot of heat these days over the outcome of their aggressive M&A strategy in the 2010s.  Sure Marvel and Lucasfilm worked out well financially, as did Pixar, but Fox was a HUGE blunder that seems to have materially impaired their balance sheet and had they succeeded with Sky, the situation would be even worse.  I think there would be serious pushback from shareholders regarding the potential for cannibalization and the incremental value added by acquiring another tangential massive catalogue of superheroes.
Absolutely no chance that ever happens. Those are the 2 biggest and arguably the only relevant (to the majority of the worlds population) names in the comic game right now. Not a chance monopoly laws allow them to be owned but the same company.  Edit: when I said “comics” I didn’t just mean the books. I meant the media that comes along with its, including most importantly the films.
Great another IP they can ruin
Disney buys DC then Apple buys Disney.
When Disney buys everything
Sounds like a prudent strategy
Yeah, it doesn’t matter that Gunn is now Feige’s equivalent at DC. Disney doesn’t need a crossover event film.  Maybe they could do something animated. Hell, I’d be up for them revisiting the Amalgam Universe, tapping various live-action actors to reprise their roles (Hugh Jackman as Dark Claw, etc).
Exactly. Sounds like DC stands to benefit most from this and is more of a risk for Marvel.   No shade at DC but they should focus on their own brand and create some solid storylines first.
I feel like they would have to go the Spider-Man route like they did with Sony and tell WB/DC to let them handle everything and just shut the fuck up and enjoy the money.
See, Marvel & DC fans CAN agree on something!
Guardians of the DCEU
This. But I have to say I do not want the mcu anywhere near the Snyder/dceu at all and never will. Now james gunn dcu however well that all depends on how good this new dcu universe is. From casting to direction then and only then it would be a possibility.
C’mon, you know a movie that has Spider-Man and Batman is gonna be the highest grossing ever
I mean is that because that’s the longest pole available? Was the thousand foot pole sold out?
WB DC is really a mess. Hopefully James Gunn can sort it out. That being said, i did really like The Batman. Best thing i have seen from DC in ages.
With marvel having less quality and a dc rebrand, we may see them be on much more equal footing in a few years. Not that i want marvel to decline im hoping for an upswing in the new phase but it could be a much more realistic idea for marvel if this new dc does well.
There’s for sure a lot of work to be done on DC cinematic’s brand if there’s ever going to be the possibility of a crossover.   But hey, maybe Gunn is the guy to make that possible.
marvel studios already did that with sony, and now sony seems to be doing much better in movie direction than they used to (not counting morbius)
This comment is exactly correct. Even the rings of power show isn’t to the level of mismanagement that DCEU is. No one is. DCEU needs to release whatever they have and wait 2 years to start over. Biggest mess I’ve seen in my lifetime.
It doesn't have to be a direct crossover. The Amalgam Universe would get me in a theater quicker than anything on the slab right now.
James Gunn proceeds to grab his 101ft pole
Not like WB has done anything significant with the IP, the best DCEU movie doesn’t beat the worst Marvel movie and it’s not even close. And before the DCEU and MCU, I thoroughly preferred DC.
Lmao
I would agree, but if James Gunn turns DC around like he’s claiming he can, that would be a very different story.
This. They’re already stuck worrying about Sony as is
Both stinkers right now.
Or give it the Sony treatment. Let Marvel make the movie and pay licensing fees to WB/DC
Shit I wouldn’t like being in the same universe in the multiverse with them
Well maybe Batman, but not any of the crossover bs.
*Is that a 100 foot pole in your pocket or are you happy to see me?*
Disney would have to reboot everything after Warner Bros dropped the ball like a dozen times. But frankly, who wants to see it all get rebooted again?
Not until the new universe is WELL established
At least not right now, just wait until they see what Gunn does over there.
Except Universal has the Lego movie license now, so unless they can get three studios to agree on it… I doubt it will happen.
Oh god that’d be great actually, I’d be onboard for that.
That's more or less what he actually said. The full quote:  "I think there's always the possibility of that. I think that would be a fun thing for fans to see. But I do think it's just about grounding the Marvel and DC universes right now and trying to make them each as strong as possible."
It’s too soon for him to say it’s a possibility? That’s like saying it’s too soon to talk about the x-men entering the MCU. Even though nothings been confirmed yet, but it’s still a possibility in the *future*
Well absolutely but it should definitely be a possibility
Yep, DCU is a mess. A crossover right now would feel really cheap and too much like a cash grab. If the DCU had a longterm, consistent ark in place then fine but…c’mon, there’s been like 4 Batmans (I’m counting Keaton in this), 3 Jokers, 2 Supermans, 2 Flashes etc in the last 15 years.
It’s 2023 and people still don’t understand the Snyder situation at all lmao. WB is the one who rushed it, not Snyder.
Too soon? It’s been like 20 years! Do a Marvel/DC else-worlds story and make a billion dollars! It would be so easy to do like a Batman vs wolverine or Superman vs the avengers and have a cool mindless crossover.
He didn’t rush jack, he never tried copying marvel. He had a multi-film epic that was supposed to be 5-6 films IIRC. WB had other films added to this universe like Suicide Squad and Wonder Woman, but his core story was to be told in less than 10 films. It wouldve been a short saga and that’s it. Everyone has always said DC was trying to copy Marvel and they never were. They only tried copying it’s tone when everyone started whining like babies about how the movies didn’t have constant comedy every 5 minutes; and now it’s ironic and hilarious how constant comedy is the main criticism of the MCU nowadays.
You mistyped "Fucked it"
I would love a separate animated dc marvel crossover movie.
DC’s animated movies are so much better than their live action. Would be fun to see a crossover on that front.
Disney is headed in the same direction.
Maybe in 10-15 years, if they have a better universe, I'd be down for some multiverse magic.
I know these are shows and not movies but I’ve been really enjoying Peacemaker and Doom Patrol. I want more like that
Name one DC film that is actually good
When DCU is fully humming an established, I wouldn't mind a one off movie or tv limited series that isn't canon to either universe for the fun of it.   JL/avengers versus a thanos darkseid team up with an assortment of other villians
Ah yes, Family.
"We didn't even give Vin or Dwayne a script, we just put them in the same room and started filming when they began throwing down" - it got them a few Fast & Furious movies, don't see why it wouldn't work for Marvel & DC
Oh ok found the Rock's reddit account.
In real life.
As James Gunn said too. The full quote:  "I think there's always the possibility of that. I think that would be a fun thing for fans to see. But I do think it's just about grounding the Marvel and DC universes right now and trying to make them each as strong as possible."

The whole MCU is a frickin marketing gimmick crossover.
The DC Universe is rebooting under Gunn, so it’s definitely a possibility in the next 10 years. Hopefully the DC movies get good so theres more competition for Marvel to make better quality films.
All the Netflix shows and agents of shield/agent carter are in the MCU lol.
No, bad writing is what has been damaging to the MCU lately. MOM and L&T are living proof of that.
The Suicide Squad was highly successful critically the reason it flopped was because it was August 2021, it was part of WBs stupid hybrid experiment, and Suicide Squad is a damaged brand they should have called it Task Force X
The market share of DC and Marvel is around 50% of the comic industry, as such it would not be deemed a monopoly. However the only way Disney would get DC is by buying WarnerDiscovery, that might be a monopoly.
You're downvoted but you're 100% correct. Even if US regulators allowed it, I honestly can't see the European regs allowing it.
Lol monopoly laws, you sweet summer child.
Lol heavily downvoted for a reasonable opinion. Even in the comic industry, DC and Marvel have collaborated only a couple of times within the past decades.
Idk, image is getting up there with their shares of the market /indie comics are doing very well in general. Big 2 combined is max like 60% of the market. Plus I see indie publishers just going up and up. Also depends on if regulators count Manga as part of the comics market (very different readers, but I can see regulators putting them together) Plus, being a monopoly is not illegal. It's using power to maintain that monopoly through anticompetitive practices that's illegal. Not saying I agree, but that is just how us commerce law works
Lol yeah ok.
Nope. Wouldn't even be close. All Disney would need to do is show other competitors exist. And they do. In large numbers. I'm behind because I'm old, but as of last year, the #1 comic in the country wasn't Marvel or DC.
Bruh you’d be surprised how many companies own the entire market in a field and get around these monopoly laws with shell company’s fake owning them
You say ruin, but they bought Marvel in 2009 and took them about 12 years  before the quality went downhill. Tell me, how long did it take for DC films to suck after the DCEU began ? Immediately, that's how long. WB fucked up the moment they started. I'd much rather trust Disney with DC than WB with DC.
Can't do any worse than Warner Bros. have
I'd rather it remain with WB. We won't get shit like Batman, Constantine, Dark Knight ever with Disney in control. I would rather choose good movies over some cinematic universe made up of mostly similar mid movies.
I look at it as a possible Assistant Football Coach going off and getting his own Head Coach position.  You wait and see how they handle it first and then if they haven't replaced them in 3 years, you're good to go.  Unless you're the Browns.
As a 10 year old Amalgam was the coolest thing I had ever seen.
I've been obsessed over the fact they don't do a Marvel/Disney crossover. When are going to see Loki and Thor get sing Elsa and Anna sings at each other? Why hasn't Peter Parker had a "Be a Man!" montage yet?? Why hasn't Rocket Raccoon sang the street rat song from Aladdin yet just because that would be awesome??? They're just sitting on all this.
Its crazy. I would be excited for DC Animation to do a Marvel/DC project and I would be equally fearful as I would be for WB to do anything with Marvel in live action
Thats what I was thinking they could do an else worlds crossover story that doesn't affect the main universe or animation  Also do a crossover video with a story which gamers have been wanting for years
What if it’s a slick long term strategy. MCU/DC crossover -> WB relying on Disney for $$ -> Disney gobbles up WB
Amalgam Universe - please!!!
See LIV golf wanting a PGA tour match up.
Ehhh I think that's unfair judgment, the hypothetical cross over would be happening in the future   James Guns DC hasn't started yet and the first unofficial film (Blue Beatle) looks to be better than most of Marvel's recent stuff.   I'm pretty confident he's going to Kick his DC off with a bang with one hell of a compelling super man story!    Meanwhile marvel has been struggling to tread water since End Game.   Ant man 3 might be the worst marvel movie I've ever seen.
No way WB would trust Disney to handle their DC IP.   Sony has film rights to Spider-Man. WB actually owns DC Comics and has a stake in every profitable enterprise involving the property.
It helps that the Snyderverse is over with.
I remember people saying this about Batman V Superman and Justice League
“Hey Batman, meet Spider-Woman.  But you can call her Martha…”
Yes, and I figured I could just get ten of the 100' model and stick them together end-to-end, but how am I going to get them to stick?
They haven't made a truly shitty Batman since 1997 and some people even like that if only ironically.   I have problems with Rises, but it isn't terrible.   Taking it further, I not only love Begins, The Dark Knight, and The Batman as Batman movies; they're great movies period. The MCU had a fair consistent brand of superhero movies up to Endgame, but not much of their product stands alone as a great film.  So I'm baffled as to why DC struggles so much with the rest of their deep roster or why establishing a connected cinematic universe was so hard for them when Bruce Timm handed them a blueprint with the Timmverse shows leading up to Justice League Unlimited.  My wife is a lifelong Marvel fan and she's been disappointed with the post-Endgame MCU. I'm like... how do you think I feel? Half the DCEU output is garbage and the other half is a mix of mediocre and a couple of great ones.
let's see how Kraven turns out lol
Theyve only done Spiderverse, Venom and Morbius.   &#x200B;  Spiderverse is from their animated team, which has always been an independent entity, and it fucking rocks. But again, the animated departments are a completely different entity within the studio.   &#x200B;  Venom is dogwater, and Morbius is Microwaved Dogwater. What is this "better" direction
Umm....Morbius came out after NWH. They're shit and they'll continue to put out shit because.....reasons.
Couldn't agree more.  The best thing they could do is end it in dramatic fashion and leave it alone for like five years. Come up with an actual, coherent ten-year plan with release schedule establishing the trinity first, then the other four of "the seven," make a Justice League the ties it all together, and then start to release movies of the 2nd stringers and introduce legacies so when the originals move on you have the next in line.   Done competently they could easily have a 20-year or even quarter century franchise worth billions.  It's actually more impressive to fuck it up than to succeed.
Same. During the mid/late 2000s I was completely team DC. I liked Iron Man, but for me Batman Begins and The Dark Knight were completely on another level. I was hoping Man of Steel would somehow expand Nolan’s universe even though they don’t fit. WB tried to make it work aesthetically after Nolan said no, and then promptly gave up. 10 years later and the DCEU is majority misses with the occasional mediocre hit.   There’s no reason why Marvel/Disney would want to be a part of the DC universe… which has already been established as a fictional universe within the MCU.
The best DCEU movie does beat the worst MCU movie. And if you're gonna argue the opposite, it's definitely close.  MCU beats the DCEU overall, but you're just over exaggerating how bad the DCEU was.
Eh, I’ll say the worst Marvel movie is still better than DCs best
I'd be willing to be every dollar of my net worth it'll never happen.  Only way it'd ever happen is if Disney bought WB and got DC in the deal.
Damn, I didn't know that. Universal hates sharing so that's butt. But I feel like the potential money would make the bigger studios consider it. But even better, let's have it as a videogame!
The thing is we should have gotten a sequel Lego movie but it’s stuck in like licesning hell
See man/ma'am, here's the thing: we don't do news by actually telling what's written  We carefully place certain words in a certain way that will generate the most people talking, no one actually cares what's being said.  /HJ
Yeah this post is stupid and misleading
u/lezboyd you need to see this, because what you're saying is more-or-less what Gunn is saying. He just didn't rule it out in the future, but right now he wants to focus on DC.
Maybe Vin Diesel should come out and talk about the *possibility* of having a Fast & Furious / Marvel crossover too lmao
True. Once the DC characters and the world building are firmly rooted like the MCU's , which I suppose will take another 10-15 years at least, a crossover wouldn't be a bad idea.
Snyder just fucked it. There could have easily been a good Justice league film. Look at the pilot of the JLA tv series. No Snyder just was a poor pick for director and WB didn’t understand what they were doing.
Lol this is 100% historical fact yet it's heavily downvoted. Snyder wanted to do a Superman trilogy only.
I never said 'copy Marvel'. I said 'catch up' with Marvel. It's different.  Also, I don't think the tone of Marvel movies are it's main criticism these days. It's that they generally feel rushed, and there's too much of it to keep up.
DCAU and EMH continuities, please. Those are classic, timeless incarnations of their universes and best fit for something as sprawling and epic as a DC/Marvel crossover
i want to see a japanese anime take on some of these super heroes. not like samurai batman tho, wasn't a huge fan of the way that looked.
Seriously?
The Suicide Squad.  The Batman.
Wonder Woman  Shazam 1  Birds of Prey  Aquaman   The Batman  The Suicide Squad
Fair. I just think he’s gonna essentially marvelise DC, when the marvel formula is currently failing and falling out of popular opinion. By the time he gets this universe off the ground it’ll be too late.  Gunns one of my fav directors I love this man, but I much preferred the current DC status. It’s interesting seeing this loosely stitched together universe with completely different creators. And I’d happily suffer through films like Black Adam, Shazam 2 and WW84 if it meant we got more movies like Joker and The Batman. Alas, that time has passed.
See the part where they said you don’t have to watch them to understand the main MCU.  Also, they are no longer considered canon sadly. Even if they were incredible.
Agents of shield is at best only partially canon,  so much of that has been tossed  &#x200B;  The daredevil series has been adopted wholesale though, which brings the defenders arc with it
Europe wouldn't care as American comic books represent basically nothing in the market.  (It was all Franco Belgian graphic novels, and then all mangas)
Yea 40 idiots downvoted me and not a single one said why. I can’t tell if they are really that dumb or just mad because they know I’m right.  And if it’s the second I don’t know why they have any stake in Disney owning DC anyways, just a weird reaction all around to something I thought wouldn’t be controversial at all.
Nope. #1 comic in the world last year wasn't Marvel or DC. Comic scene outside of Marvel/DC is very healthy.
Even then, Marvels quality has worsened but not to the extent of the DCEU
The introduction of D+ definitely dropped the quality down. Bob Chapek forced Marvel and LucasFilm to produce rapid amounts of content so they can fill up the streaming service. So yes, Disney did kinda "ruin" the IP but not for long, since Chapek is gone and D+ has its content
Let's hope Gunn is no Nate the Great...
Laughs in Cleveland
I'll be honest, I'm game JUST because of Hyena.
They’ll do it in a kingdom hearts game first
I mean you had Ultron singing "I once had strings but now I'm free..."
Rocket, obviously, gets to sing the opening number from Oliver and Company.
I wouldn't be surprised if Deadpool went on a crazy journey through the other Disney IPs.
This sounds awful.
Not necessarily the same audience I imagine, I love Disney films but I watch them for different reasons to MCU films, if these scenes made their way into the MCU I'd just take that as sign for pee/snack break tbh
Actually, you're onto something with DC/Marvel animated. If they took the original comics, updated them so the continuity is current to today and fixed some of the shittier parts and added some modern characters that weren't there for round 1, that would be dope as fuck.
Blue beetle hasn't come out. Stop making an opinion based off trailers.
Holy Hyperbole batman lol
My guess is part of the problem is everyone likes Batman and likes making Batman movies, so they try to make the other heroes into Batman.  Batman works as Batman, so you get good Batman movies. Superman does not work as Batman.
Also El Muerto.
Venom is super fun
I thought venom 1 is decent imo, obviously I was referring to itsv but if that wasn't the case then guess I’m wrong lol
well it's not about morbime or morbiyou, it's about morbius
I was thinking 5 too but i doubt they would sit on an IP that long without tapping into it. As of now i personally find it toxic. Sure Joker was incredible, but it technically shouldn’t even exist.
> There’s no reason why Marvel/Disney would want to be a part of the DC universe… which has already been established as a fictional universe within the MCU.  They do that in the comics too and that didn't stop past crossovers, but it's been a long time.
The best DCEU movie is THE Suicide Squad and I would much rather watch that than the worst MCU movie, which is probably either The Dark World or Love & Thunder.  Hell, I'd rather watch THE Suicide Squad (2021), SHAZAM! (2019), Aquaman (2018), or Wonder Woman (2017) over the worst MCU movies.
Definitely the best DC movie, but definitely not the best DCEU movie. All that shit is garbage that isn’t worth watching
The suicide squad cough cough
I really don’t think so. DCEU, sure. DC? No. The Dark Knight, The Batman, Aquaman, Joker, etc.
Factually untrue.  But if you ignore The Dark Knight then you're onto something.
You think The Dark World or Love & Thunder beats The Batman, Joker, The Dark Knight, The Suicide Squad, Wonder Woman, and Aquaman?
I'm pretty sure Universal is why Lego Batman 2 got cancelled
I've more faith in Gunn than I ever did in Snyder. I just hope the executives don't get ahead of themselves and start interfering with him and rushing him like they did with Snyderverse.
You got a whole lot of subjectivity in there bud.
Exactly! Back in 2011 when promoting Sucker Punch, Snyder literally said his Superman was it’s own thing akin to The Dark Knight Trilogy, while WB was developing a separate Justice League franchise.   And yet….I get downvoted lmao
It’s been a very common criticism that the comedy is getting old. People said that with Thor 4 a lot and same with Antman 3’s corny jokes; namely MODOK’s
I feel like the DCAU should crossover with the 90s Marvel stuff (X-Men 97') and EMH should crossover with Young Justice or something
I’ve tried a few and it didn’t live up to my standards. So I stopped going to them. I’m gonna check out some that y’all recommended :)
They have always been canon. And they will continue being canon unless stated otherwise. The person I replied to said that they are not mandatory to understand the MCU. But his comment doesn't make any sense because these shows are also MCU.  Even inhumans, Runaways and Cloak and Dagger are MCU. I agree that they are not necessary (at least not yet) to understand the movies/Disney plus shows just like the movies are not necessary to understand the non Disney plus shows. So it goes both ways. You can't say one is the main MCU and the other is the not-so-main MCU.
I am just tired of people having the same argument again and again. Agent Carter, Agents of shield, The Netflix shows, Inhumans (sadly), Runaways and Cloak and Dagger are canon in the MCU. And they will continue being so unless stated otherwise.
by wholesale do you mean like it’s necessary to watch the daredevil and defenders series to understand the mcu in the same way it’s mandatory to watch the sony spider-man and venom films to understand no way home, or is it still supplementary
They absolutely would care, look how aggressive they have been against the xbox Activision merger, which would put xbox at 3rd, no where near a monopoly
? Marvel and DC movies/comics are massive over here
Maybe because it was a joke, and you came along to "well, ackshually" it?
This sub is braindead like that sometimes
It has, but that doesn't necessarily mean they're ruined. When people say something has been ruined, that implies there's no chance of a comeback and I'm saying that's bullshit in the MCU's case. They hit one rough patch after a 13 year streak of killer movies and moments and everyone wants their head on a pike.
But I wouldn't say Marvel Studios is ruined though.  Atleast not compared to DC. I just find it infuriating that people are so quick to jump on the MCU for producing a few bad projects and not giving them the benefit of the doubt when we all shit on the competition for much less. And then they act like there's no good stuff when we've been given WandaVision, Loki, What If, Shang Chi, No Way Home, Hawkeye, Moon Knight, She-Hulk, Werewolf by Night, The GOTG Holliday Special and Wakanda Forever all range between good and fucking awesome. This franchise is perhaps the most iconic of the modern era and should be given some leeway considering how long it took the franchise to hit a somewhat rough patch.
I mean Gunn and Nate do both have grey hair…
Amalgamating Batman and Wolverine was an odd choice, but amalgamating Sabretooth and Joker to create Hyena was sheer genius.  Super Solider was cool too.   Others were bafflingly stupid.   But hey, at least we got Lobo the Duck...
A twisted version of that on how he's going to end the world would be a sight to behold.
*Once upon a time, in New York City (on Counter-Earth)...*
If they just have him reference the Patton Oswald monologue I'll be happy.
If trailers were any indication of how good a movie would be, Aquaman would've been a helluva lot better.
fuuuuck I forgot about that ☠️
Upgrade>Venom
The Venom movies are pretty much exactly what I would expect the kind of person who's favourite character is Venom would like. For good and bad.
You're just as bad as Sony and I'd Morbiyou.
Wonder Woman fkin clears The Dark World imo
Nah the DCEU isn't all garbage.  and the best DC movie is the best superhero movie that's came out from any company, not just better than the worst MCU movie  I think you've got a Marvel bias
Or if you narrowed it down to something like the DCEU.
The monsters!!!
No, he's right, you're wrong. Snyder fundamentally doesn't understand what makes these characters appealing and even makes shit up and gaslights the audience to try and make himself look smarter (ie; Saying Batman killed a goon in Dark Knight Returns to justify Batman killing in BvS when he clearly didn't). This is the man who played Watchmen straight. HE PLAYED IT STRAIGHT. The biggest superhero deconstruction comic ever and the whole point of it was completely lost on him because he's apparently a 13 yr old edgelord at heart and was too wowed by the sex and violence. He should've stuck to making music videos, not tanking blockbusters with his shitty "subversions".
Lol I did too, it's really pathetic how much people will twist the truth to hate on the guy
As a Marvel fan who subscribes to a lot of MCU related content, I've not come across a single source that says what you're saying. Of course, I'm not giving any credence to toxic sources like Twitter & Facebook.
Lol
…you are kidding yourself if you think they’re still canon considering the new daredevil is going to be a complete reboot.
you dont need to watch venom to understand no way home, dude shows up for 2 seconds post credits and leaves behind a symbiote mcguffin that may never get used.  &#x200B;  Seriously, what plotline in NWH requires you to have watched literally any of venom? Much less \*mandatory\* viewing to understand the movie?
They absolutely would care in the case of Disney Warner merger yes. I was talking about the comic book divisions.
The IPs are massive, but the comic books themselves don't sell at all. Before the MCU, the comic book shelves were devoted at 90+% to mangas and BDs. Now it's a bit more widely distributed, but still pales in comparison to mangas. So no chance of monopoly at all.  I'm talking strictly about comic books, because that's what the original monopoly post was about. Of course Disney and Warner are something else entirely.
If that’s what passes for a joke nowadays then I guess I don’t really understand humor
Exactly, I think the MCU will 100% build its way back up
Yeah, thats why I put ruin in quotes. Even if you gave them the same list of projects that you said now, they would tell themselves that they hated it. I bet most of them were laughing throughout the entirety of Love and Thunder and She-Hulk, then pretend they didnt in online discussions
I think Hyena is why we got Darkclaw. They just couldn't not use him, but to stay in theme, they had to combine Batman and Wolverine.
Phineas and Ferb had a marvel AND Star Wars Special….
Aquaman made over a billion dollars...
I feel like this 2 movies get compared because the general premise is kinda similar, but in practice they are going for completely different tones   You could do a cool Venom movie similar to Upgrade, but the Venom we got embraces the campy 90s Venom stuff and I like it because of that
When I was an edgy 90s teen, Venom was my dude.  So was Punisher, Wolverine, Lobo...  So... yeah.
The original WW is a mostly good movie. They whiffed big time on the ending, but it's pretty solidly excellent until the third act.
Just because Snyder does a different take on characters doesn’t mean he doesn’t understand them lmao. His whole trilogy (and planned saga) was an Elseworlds story. Again, just because you decide to do something different doesn’t mean you don’t understand the mainline.
Yea agreed, it sucks to see.
https://screenrant.com/thor-4-shows-marvel-comedy-limits/  https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/thor-must-abandon-comedy-after-love-and-thunder/  https://movieweb.com/thor-love-and-thunder-director-defends-movie-humor-luke-cage-comic-panel/  The criticism of the comedy was VERY prevalent and was the main criticism aside from the poor writing and misuse of Christian Bale. To say you’ve never seen ANYONE say that Thor 4 was too comedic is a bit biased. The fact that Taika felt the need to defend himself and the film’s tone says something about the nature of the criticism that it was getting.
No, it's no where said that it's going to be a reboot. They may start with a different storyline but they won't do anything which will contradict the Netflix seasons. And no contradictions mean they are still canon.
then why is the sony venom there and not some new mcu venom
Sure ok, can I see some sources though?
They really just took the two top-selling comics from both companies and mashed 'em together. That's the real reason we got Dark Claw.  Batman would more logically be amalgamated with Moon Knight.  Imagine a truly off the rails Batman where they take the "Bruce Wayne is a mask" concept to true split personality-ville.  And you still could've had Hyena by combining Werewolf by Midnight--Moon Knight's first adversary--with Joker. Just make him a werehyena instead of a werewolf but the transformation also makes him batshit insane.
TIL only good movies make money
A take that involves killing the new Superman in the 2nd film and shoehorning Doomsday, the Justice League, and The Dark Knight Returns all in one is a shit take.
You seem to be taking Thor 4 and extrapolating it to all of Phase 4. Also, the issue with Thor 4 with respect to comedy was not the quality of the comedy but the timing of it. Which means I do not stand corrected.
>Seriously, what plotline in NWH requires you to have watched literally any of venom? Much less \*mandatory\* viewing to understand the movie?
Or you know Google how big marvel and DC over seas sales are
*cries in Star Wars sequel trilogy*
I’m sorry that you’ve been brainwashed by the MCU into thinking that every story needs 23 films to tell it lmao.   Snyder was doing a 5 film saga. An Elseworlds story. There was going to be a beginning and an ending, and fully developed character arcs throughout (including Superman’s birth, death, and revival, which was a big part of it). Everything was planned. Nothing was “rushed,” you’re only saying that because you’re using your “me want franchise, me want 50 films of content to consume” brain.
fair enough, but even without that there’s still the sony spider-man films
Couldn’t find any data on Europe sales, even asked bing AI and they couldn’t either, so where did you get your numbers?
If you think character arcs weren't rushed in BvS, then I don't know what you're smoking but keep it away because you clearly have some sort of brain rot. Batman's entire arc was done in a minute and was laughed at by literally everybody except for Snyder stans. Dude spends 80 percent of the film trying to kill Superman and then goes to his funeral saying "I failed him". What the actual fuck ? Human beings don't act that way. But I see I won't convince you so I'm done.
You said even asked Bing AI lmao
If you don’t actually understand the arc, then you have no right to criticize it. If you don’t understand Bruce’s confrontation with Clark, Superman’s sacrifice for the world, and the implications it has on the characters, then you have no right to criticize it. Clearly you’re in no position to listen given you’ve been nothing but aggressive and insulting since the moment you replied to me. You’re the kind of viewer who needs nothing but exposition and to be spoon-fed in order to understand story and characters. And then you accuse others of having “brain rot.” Ironic. Conversing with you is a waste of time.
"that didnt get too far"
You do realize that as a writer, you throw a zillion ideas at the wall and see which ones stick. I’m sure if you heard some of Markus and McFeely’s unused ideas you’d feel the same. It’s silly to pass judgement on Jeff Loveness because he’s sharing some ideas in the development process that never held water.
This why you have checks and balances. Writers have MILLIONS of ideas so the producers and other writers are there to sift through bad ones and build off good ones.   What’s the issue again?
MCU discourse is so far gone that people are complaining about things that AREN’T EVEN IN THE MOVIE.
wait, are you angry that the writing ideas they \*didnt\* use... were ones you didnt like?
That's just turning him into Hive... except for the nazi part...
Every writer is always gonna have some crazy ideas, especially in the world of comic book movies where some bizarre ideas will always been thrown, i am sure he's not the only MCU writer that may had came up with some crazy ideas that may make us go "Wut?"
There's a link in the article to the video. Feel free to watch if you're confused about context.  I even found the timecode for you:  https://youtu.be/9n__gEMyj8c?t=2159
He isn't a good writer, so I want him to be moved along, but it has nothing to do with this idea. The "good" ideas that made it into the movie were more than enough.
Out of all the reasons to not want someone to write  film. Them coming up with an idea and not using it is the dumbest reason possible. Writers have thousands of ideas that don't get used. Coming up with a lot of ideas and seeing what works and what doesn't is basically a writers entire job.
I don’t understand why there is a new interview with Loveness almost every day. Or feels like there is.
I don't like Markus Mcfeely comparison here for second chances.  Mainly coz both of them had actually done movies outside Marvel before  with the Narnia trilogy, 2 out of 3 were good, and their first film was CA The first avenger, which is still one of the best mcu origin stories.  Also, they were brought on in a very late stage to do the scripts.  Jeff Loveness has done jackshit in films, he used to be a Jimmy Kimmel writer, then did Rick and Morty, now he's writing Marvel's biggest showpiece, god knows how.  If KD sucks, then it won't be his fault but Marvel and Kevin Feige's fault for bringing an amateur to write that film.
Markus and Mcfeely aren't great wroters, touch some grass and watch non superhero stuff.
Him and waldron need fired ASAP otherwise I think the end of the mcu will be with the next avengers movies after they flop
That was the real "wtaf?" moment.  Perhaps it's missing a tongue in cheek tone, but written on the page, it's presented without that.
This! For real, the guy is being candid with some things that were thrown around and not actually used. Pitchforks not required.
Especially in a room of people. Most likely there was a point where they needed to consider killing Hank, youve got to toss out ideas to do that.
Yeah this sounds like something he thought was cool for like a day lmao.
You can feel that way.  I can feel this way, and it's not ridiculous.  If there's a tone of mirth here and he's joking around, fair.  But presenting that idea on page here without tone, it adds additional ridiculousness to an already panned MCU film.  Coming from Rick & Morty, where excess to the point of self-referencing its own absurdity is on brand, I could see some tangential connections.  Especially with the other idea as well.  "There was a psychological sequence in that probability storm, or that quantum nexus, there was more of a dream sequence element to it. I had like a big, like man-sized ant that was going to be almost like a ninja turtle, the way they looked in that 90s movie, not CGI, make it almost like a Cronenberg ‘The Fly’-like Ant. And it was like in his head. I wanted it to be voiced by Werner Herzog and give it some sort of Holy Mountain kind of advice, some Vision Quest thing"  Since Peyton Reed is very much on record as having wanted to be less of the "little palate cleanser film" and more of the "serious event starter", it makes these ideas feel less viable inside of the film we got.  It was already a fair bit of ridiculous, and not just in the style of humor.  So, while none of these ideas may make it beyond scripting, it still fills me with less confidence.  Loveness has also commented that he thought the negative reviews were "wrong", and doesn't think the Hank Pym hivemind was "too far?". Again, tone could be missing there, but it's not presented that way in the article.  These are my reasons.  If you disagree, cool. But calling my reasons silly is just presenting your opinion as fact and based on nothing but a preposition of what bad stuff other people might have written.
Fair.  Although some of the MCU's best touted work like Ragnarok, Black Panther, or the Guardians films comes with a massive amount of writer/directorial control.    I think Quantumania suffered from potentially too much meddling, based upon the reports of last minute reshoots.  Perhaps in a fully psychedelic and weird movie, all of these ideas would have worked beautifully on screen.  But since they were pushing more serious and the Kang heavy plot, it feels very out of place to me. None of this made it in, but the concepts didn't sit well to me.  Would those have made the film better in your opinion?  Quantumania has been discussed, I guess the question is do you feel confident in this writer for Kang Dynasty?  Some already swore him off after Quantumania, I was fine until I read the article.  Also, the one where he said the critics were wrong and the film was great.  It's just my opinion, but I think they should bring in new people for an Avengers tentpole film.  Is that not reasonably articulated?
Yeah seems like a stupid thing to obsess over. None of these people understand how writers rooms work lol.
People did this a ton with Love and Thunder too. There were deleted scenes that people didn't like and said "Taika is awful!! I can't believe he's done this!!!"... it's a deleted scene
It's a discussion about how you'd feel about this writer, with these concepts, writing an Avengers tentpole film.  Mind you this isn't "too far" and Loveness has said the critics were wrong and Quantumania was "great".  I'm saying I've lost confidence.  If you haven't, great!  But attacking me is just working around the question to tear down the discussion.
It's a general insight into the mindset of the writer.  And if this was what he thought wasn't too far, then it struck me as odd. I presented it as "what do you think?" And the sub, predictably, recoils against anything not resembling praise.  I wasn't too concerned before, but with such a tentpole movie like a future Avengers film, I'm not very confident with Loveness at the moment.  Recall his stance is that the critics were wrong and the film is great.  Just my opinion.
I read it differently on the page and hashed that out with someone.  Thank you for providing the video though.  It does add that verbal context as well where he's laughing it out, on top of the clearer usage of the verb 'go'.
Google algorithm is a bitch.
I think it’s just one or two interviews, but sites like this like making a whole article out of each part of the interview like every other day
I only used it because it's a common defense tactic for current day defense of anything in the MCU.  Like "even Markus and McFeely wrote Dark World.". They didn't.  They worked on a draft punch up.  It also comes with the benefit of hindsight, after they did excellent work through later films.  Right now, all we have is Quantumania's final result, and that was given some pass for late stage rewrites, maybe too much editorial tweaking.  But this article just kinda put me into a space of questioning if maybe they should get some more script options for an Avengers film.  It's too big a tentpole of the MCU's respectability.
Agree with u Rick and Morty writers are cancer for marvels These little dumb kids down voting u for giving an opinion  On marvel spoilers subreddit every one was asking for their release
Im not certain you understand how writing works if youre this bothered by something that didnt get far.
Glad to see the parasocial hate circlejerk for the guy has cooled down from a few weeks ago.
>it adds additional ridiculousness to an already panned MCU film.  it wasnt in the film.  &#x200B;  your reasons are silly.
> d doesn't think the Hank Pym hivemind was "too far?".   I figured it out. Youre confusing "didnt get too far" and "didnt GO too far". Didnt get too far means they threw the idea out quickly.
What films first draft do you consider perfect?
Lol. It just sounds like you have an axe to grind with the movie or Loveness or both. Judge the movie or the writer off the ideas that made it into the movie, not the ones that didn't.
Entertainment is subjective, so hey you're allowed to have your opinion and express it. I'm not trying to change your mind if you think he should be replaced for Kang Dynasty. I was just pointing out that his one story bit you didn't like that was ultimately shot down happens OFTEN in plenty of MCU movies so he shouldn't be deem unqualified for having a "bad idea".   IMO, the film's blessing and its curse was Kang. Majors played Kang so well and I loved watching him on screen. However, his huge focus took away from what we love about the Ant-Man movies. I still enjoyed it as a whole, and I don't think much could of been done to fix it unless they went with another villian.   Am I worried about Loveness for Kang Dynasty? Not really? I mean he didn't really "impress" me with Quantumania but I'm sure Feige hired him for a reason. My position is to just be patient and not judge every single morsel of detail before the movie comes out.
>And if this was what he thought wasn't too far  &#x200B;  he didnt include it in the movie  &#x200B;  It didn't happen  &#x200B;  because he chose not to include it  &#x200B;  I do not know how to make this any simpler for you. If he thought it wasnt too far he would have used it for the movie. He didnt. it didnt happen. it does not exist.
Perhaps I'm reading that statement differently.  Contextually is the idea "something that didn't go too far", as in "that's too far man, we can't do that".  And am I correct that you read that as "that didn't go too far" as in "that didn't go too far" in the process of writing.
Love people who call writers hacks yet don't quite have it in them to comprehend phrasal verbs.
I just want to thank you for being the one person who didn't turn immediately to insults and personal attacks.  As it turns out, I have culpability in interpreting the phrasing wrong.  Since the quote was .."that didn't go too far", I thought the subject was conveying that the premise itself wasn't "too far out there".  Instead of the indirect "that idea didn't go too far".  So I'm eating some brigading shit, which I know isn't responding to your points.  But they are well articulated and on the point of the issue, so I'd give you an award if they still gave the freebies.  Have a good day.
That's funny, because other people are insisting that it didn't get in because of checks and balances and it gets struck down.  There's a lot of experts here with ad hominem methodology.  Because this sub isn't toxic.  Ok.  Have a nice day.
the words "go" and "Get" are different, thats the issue here.
> And am I correct that you read that as "that didn't go too far" as in "that didn't go too far" in the process of writing.  This is how basically everyone is reading it except you.
1) never called the writer a hack.  That's all you projecting  2) the verb GO is different from "get".  The article uses "GO" in the quote.  As in "does this go too far"?  Which was an original interpretation.  That might be my mistake, but it's not an unimpeachable one.  You're just being an asshole.
Yes, and the word "Go" is the quote from the film. You used the word "Get".  That's not to get into a squabble of "well YOU said".  It's clarifying the exact word used.    As in "this doesn't go too far".  I saw you reply as well about this on another conversation thread.  I read that in the former sense (of my previous comments).  He didn't say "that didn't GET too far".   In the case of "Go", I could see both meanings, and read it the original way.  I take your point.  Now I just get to flip through about another dozen ad hominem attacks instead.  Thanks for at least trying to discuss.
After playing the GOTG game I'm intrigued about how they'll portray Warlock, I know it won't be anything like the game as this version is younger but I wonder if they'll be similar in ways.
I have a feeling StarLord genetic material when he still had ‘Ego celestial Energy’ was used along side hers to create Warlock..
Glad to see Debicki’s character again, it would be a shame to waste it
I like Gooooooold
Good to see Debicki back, she’s always fun to watch in anything. I feel she doesn’t get the roles her talent deserves because she’s so freakishly tall (while so many leading men in Hollywood are surprisingly short)
Will Poulter always looks like he has testicular torsion
Im so confused on Adam Warlocks role in the universe. Especially since his character was connected with the soul stone. I feel like he is a real wild card right now. Looking forward to this movie :)
***My little baby, off to destroy people.***
I forget Elizabeth Debicki is in the MCU..she’s one hell of an actress! We won yet again!
I'm really looking forward to the movie and I love the way Adam looks under the yellow light but I don't love the way he looks under more normal light, the makeup looks...well, like makeup. This isn't really the case with Nebula or Gamora, so I'm not sure what's going on.
Will Ben Browder be back?
I’m still not in love with the Poulter casting. He’s brilliant though so I’m sure I’ll change my mind once I actually see the movie
Adam Goldfinger Warlock
I'm down with the movie, but the more I look at this costume, the less I like it.  I'm not sure what they were going for. Most of Adam's costumes are some combo of red and black. His OG costume was just briefs, then briefs with a top, bracers and boots, but this...it's not doing it for me.
This version of Warlock looks like a massive chode; difference from the comics being now it looks on purpose; I’m legitimately excited
Will looks creepy, goofy, and amazing all at the same time.
Adam Warlock is one of Marvel's coolest characters. I am very worried about his portrayal.
The character design and costume for Warlock is looking really generic and bad IMO. I wanted something that leans more toward [this](https://imgur.com/a/Yt13XCT) comic look. What he's wearing in the movie looks baggy and not what somebody called "Warlock" would wear. Hopefully I'm wrong.
I have all kinds of mixed feelings about him in this role. Never in a million years would’ve picked him, and the character is going way younger. Makes sense for longevity of film appearances though. I’m sure this was inspired casting though and he’ll surprise us. Loving the look, with head gem and skull. I’m wondering if they’ll say he has the soul stone. Those are still in play out there and she could’ve gotten it and placed it on him.
He’s never *not* going to look like the annoying kid who got bit in the balls by a spider, is he?
"How was school?"  "Fine 😡"
I really like his look and armor.
Could Adam warlock be an avenger down the road?   Sort of how carol is but spends most of her time in space?  I’m not a comic book reader but I read that warlock was part of the cosmic avengers ( so technically an avenger).   Can’t see them doing cosmic avengers(at least not in the near future)
Oh no.
Is it only me who thinks Poulter looks more ridiculous than normal in this role? Those eyebrows are practically a seperate actor
Yay, Ayesha's back! She's one of my favorite parts of Vol. 2. Every scene she was in was delicious!
Am I the only one who wants star lord to get with ayesha?
MY BOYYYYYY
They for sure smashed, right?
https://i.imgur.com/BrInY3G.jpg
I'm not conviced on Warlocks casting at all but I'm sure I'll be proven wrong
Poulter looks like a little kid who's about to start crying.
Poulter is pouting
*"I am a golden god!"*
I can't appreciate Will as warlock as the closest i get is "Do you guys get mental sanity?"
Damn. I forgot about Elizabeth Debicki. Is this the longest between appearances for an MCU character? GOTG2 was out in 2017… six years and a lot has changed.
Looks awesome!
Honestly really liking Poulter’s look in this; I had my doubts.
These costumes look like cosplay quality instead of million dollar budget quality. Wtf   Stoked for the castings at least
I still think Poulter is miscast.
Pretty much all of my hype for Warlock died once it was confirmed that he would be a big baby. There were rumours about it for a while and then Gunn basically confirmed it.  I feel like the people who hate the MCU's reliance on comedy are going to be bummed by some of the choices in this film.
If Adam is supposed to be the perfect life form, why did they cast will poulter? Gottem
That Warlock costume looks pretty bad and so does the makeup. I like Will Poulter but that truly just looks like… well, Will Poulter.
Don't know why, and I I'm not even that crazy about her, but Gina from Brooklyn 99 would be great as Ayesha.
Doesn’t look like a space wizard.
Meh,too late for Adam Warlock and what's with the FoX-Men plasticy looking costumes
I always thought Poulter would look cooler than this
Just my opinion, but Adam Warlock is, or at least was, supposed to be an angry, tragic character, a reluctant hero/champion, who could be compared to Michael Moorcock’s Elric. I’m not seeing that, here.  Edit - lol! I love it that there are, apparently, some people who are butthurt that others aren't crazy about this casting.
Looks pretty underwhelming tbh
He looks like he’s a holding in a shit.
Not my warlock.
I'm not convinced Poulter will fully sell me as Warlock.  I was also not convinced Charlie Day would sell me as Luigi and thus far he hasn't.
I feel bad for Will, the Adam Warlock design is so bloody poor.
She looks amazing but he does not.
Didn’t realize she was in this. But it makes sense
Yeah, still not feeling this casting.
I wonder if he’s going to be a bumbling idiot and if she’s going to be the competent one!  Would be a big surprise
It looks like a garbage Halloween costume for some generic gold person.
The outfit is weird and looks over designed, but at least he still has the skull pendant thing. No cape though?
This is  such an L
Too much gold..like their skin is already gold. Why would they make everything else gold…
Wait, the kid from that Jason Sudekis movie is Adam warlock?! How does that remotely fit? Isn’t Adam supposed to be like an Adonis literal “golden god”?!
Look forward to it, but I still don’t think it’s the right casting. Just my initial thought
Nice suit eyebrows.
Nice suit eyebrows.
I hate it
Not enough lines on this costume. Needs to be busier
It’s going to suck
Nice.
Pouty face space man takes revenge. News at 11.
Eyebrows
That costume looks very...V.
Is she like his mother now or like his girlfriend or what?
Goldfinger, he's the man, the man with the Midas touch...
Wait you guys are getting paid?
Why does it look like Warlock is gonna kill her right here 😅
Wait... you guys are getting paid?
Is that the Mind Stone?
All else aside, is this what the kids call a "glow-up"? If that's the same dude from "we're the millers"
I love to see elizabeth debicki and her tallness
He's eyebrowin hard. I got a feeling he's going to get minimal screen time of consequence. My guess is he'll be used much like Darth Maul in ep1.  I suspect he'll come into play more once the MCU gets to Galactus and some of the other omega level powers. Poulter is young so he can sit on the shelf for awhile if need be.
These stills look so good
Dude needs some Metamucil.
Ayesha - Do you want a juice box, honey...honey, wanna juice box?  Adam - I told you I don't want a juice box. I want a STRING CHEESE!
Nice that the ship has theater seating!
What’s the gem in his forehead?
I'm still not sure what kind of presence he'll be in this. In my head it feels like he will be quickly introduced and disappear. Nothing more than a cameo. Mostly since he was someone that was introduced to take on Thanos. And James Gunn provided that before the Infinity War, but Marvel didn't utilize that in any way.
So is peter the dad or what?
He looks so confused
"Mum, can we stop at Macca's"
Very weird casting choice
Goldest shot in movie history
Why mark it as a spoiler if you're just going to say what the picture is in the title?
I'm so hype for the MCU to squander Adam Warlock as a character like they did MODOK
I really root for Will Poulter in whatever he's in, because I remember him in "School of Comedy". https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tME_9vmwguE&ab_channel=astreamortwo
I'm gonna laugh if they're still holding a grudge over stolen batteries.
My mom giving me a pep talk in the car on my first day of school
Can Elizabeth Debicki just be in everything, please? I love her.
Will Porter? You mean the generic bully bad guy in **every movie**?
Omg what happened to Princess Diana
I can’t believe they casted eyebrows as Adam Warlock. Seriously, why?
I’d love if he only spoke in alliteration.
That game was low key fantastic, I thought. Feels like it didn’t get much hype
Is Peter his dad?
She did offer him the chance to do it the "old fashioned" way.
Oh Christ. This Is absurd enough to be true. And it would be a great arc coming from the first two for Starlord to have a son, and be able to save him from a fate he suffered.
Did he give her genetic material?  If I remember correctly, didn't she just had a feeling, albeit correct feeling, that he's not fully terran.
StarDad
And my goodness is she beautiful. I watched The Night Manager and couldn't get over how stunning she is. Fabulous actress on top of it all!
Including my son
I am Dutch yesh! Isnt that weird?!

You're not going to put that in your mouth are you?
Now she gets to be a demigod like being who genderbent herself to make babies with her brother.
>she’s so ~~freakishly~~ delightfully tall
I thought she was great in Tenet, they used her the perfect amount imo.
Like the Night Manager was so good, and was only one season!
Yep she is super tall  6'3" towering over those little Hollywood dudes.
She was great in The Kettering Incident. Bittersweet run for that show.
> freakishly tall  6'3 ... ?
I loved her in Tenet!
After what he had to go through in We're the Millers, can you blame him? You know what I'm sayin'?

Bruhhhh
Like he’s got banders in his snatch, innit
🥇 take my worthless “free” award that made me laugh
This is so oddly specific LMAO
If I had a job to stay in character as a demi-God while sitting next to a real life goddess, I would look like I am experiencing testicular torsion as well.
Yeah so what is in his forehead in this pic?
Adam has had stories beyond the soul stone and Thanos. It also helps that James Gunn is mostly taking from Adam's early Counter Earth stories which predates all of that.
Gold skin is probably much harder to pull off in any other lighting compared to green or blue skin. It helps Gamora's and Nebula's case that the actors also have prosthetics on their face along with the colored skin, so it doesn't look as weird. Adam Warlock just has gold skin and a soul stone on his forehead.
I thought he looked really damn weird in the brief glimpse of him in the trailer.
Along with his new sidekick played by Claudia Black
Doesn't help that they put him in the most overly designed but still generic costume.
Same. He's a great actor but definitely not who I'd picture as the most perfect being in the universe. Come to think of it, I haven't been feeling most of the casting in phase 4-5.
Kid named Finger
I don't know, I've never liked that design. He looks like a WWE wrestler with a cape. I agree that all the costumes look generic though. I'm a fan of more skin tight suits, so maybe something like [this](https://preview.redd.it/ihjj20b3jis71.jpg?width=496&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=51c352f50079333b1bff0e5b0a55247903aa7109). And it's dumb that he's wearing armor, he's Adam Warlock, why would he need armor?
I mean, it's basically inevitable that he breaks away from the sovereign at some point right? Maybe he'll get a better outfit then.
Everybody can be an Avenger, even Kevin Bacon
I would like to see him in a roll like the Infinity Watch. A group with Gamora, Drax, Moondragon and Pip the Troll.  I haven’t read any spoilers but I know the comics. I’m assuming the High Evolutionary gives him the title Warlock (oath breaker) and that he’s crucified on counter earth in some way.
I’m hoping he’s the leader of a new Guardians team either modeled off of Infinity Watch or comprised of heavy hitters including Silver Surfer and Nova.   A guy can dream, right?
I’m thinking he’ll be on the new Guardian team. It would make the most sense
Why not? I'd argue we have quite a bit of solid ground to build a cosmic avengers story....
Yeah, I don't think they're going to do the cosmic avengers, at least not like in that particular comic story because it was a horrible mess.
He was only a Guardian and part of Infinity Watch. He occasionally teamed up with the Avengers but to my knowledge he was never an Avenger, I guess because they tended to be at odds because Adam is a complicated guy and he tended to pal around with Thanos. I guess in the MCU he could but it depends what they do with him.  Moondragon and Mantis were Avengers in the comics, even before they were Guardians.
She’s his mother basically 💀💀
Liz Tyler will take that when she appears in New World Order
I could be wrong but I don't recall him wording it as 'big baby'. I just got the impression that he was brand new, like a baby. Not necessarily that he'll act like one.
these movies are first and foremost.... made for kids.
Something like mother, based on the last movie
In the comics he had the Soul stone, not sure what it’ll be in the movie though
Potentially problematic, but possibly pleasant.
i really hope marvel have the balls to pull that off but make it a joke only part of the time or else it gets old fast
I'd love MCU Drax to be like Eidos' Drax
Blame that trash avengers game for that.
One of the most beautiful looking games I've ever played. And the character interactions were fantastic. Great writing, fun gameplay, good voice acting, stunning visuals.
Didnt it win a few awards for best story?
Worth playing? I have it on Gamepass  Edit: Crap never mind it left March 15th. Annoying
Phenomenal game that deserves so much better. Every characterization was actually greater than what the MCU has done, which is not an insult towards the films by any means. I just mean that it is THAT good in the game.
I loved the story in the game, was better than any of the movies (which are pretty great too).  Gameplay wise it turns into a bit of a slog in the late game, and there are some sections where performance just fucking tanks. Like the section on the cultist ship? I was bumping like 5-10 frames per second for a solid hour of gameplay lmao. I’m on a Series X as well, so my system is definitely decently strong, it’s just the games optimization was super poor during certain segments.  However, I’d still consider it worth of at least one play through, it was a great time and a great story.
It was great except the lack of replay value besides hunting alternate costumes. But it was a really well-done game, overall.
The game was genuinely one of my favorite games of the past few years.   There’s a background joke in one level where you’re looking at people’s criminal files, and quill finds the file on drax and says something like, “Wow drax, you’re file is pretty big”, and you hear him in the background in the most deadpan, humorless way say “that is what your mother said”  Dumb joke but I laughed my ass off
The game was nutz. Thoroughly enjoyed every single moment of it. All the little bits of drama the team has because they're still getting to trust each other and all the little bits of story that isn't told to your face but you have to work for it. The entire game deserves an award for just being fresh.
There’s nothing low key about it!! I agree though, it didn’t get the attention and hype it deserved
No
> for Starlord to have a son  This would play into what I imagine the theme of the film is: Quill having to grow up. It ties in with all the 90s style and music—the first two films are based in 60s/70s culture because Quill's arc is built around his mother, but now that his parent issues are behind him, the only thing left to do is grow up, and 90s culture should have been to Quill what 60s/70s culture was to his mother.
She could have just collected some from the walls of his ship while they were fighting the Abilisk. It’s like a Jackson Pollock painting in there.
Agreed. I just can’t stop looking at her when she’s on screen.
Everything she is in, she draws the eye. I loved her as Princess Diana too. She is mega talented!
How about Nnoooo! You crazy dutch bastard.
There’s two types of people I can’t stand in this world. Those who are intolerant of other peoples cultures, and the Dutch.  Edit: spelling
Dat’s de vey, uh-huh uh-huh, I like it, uh-huh uh-huh
Bong and a blitz?
Princess Diana did that? 😮
Sorry, what?
Marika?
bingo
I ordered my hot sauce an hour ago
She was great in that, and in Tenet and The Man from UNCLE, but unfortunately she does seem to have been typecast as the unobtainable femme fatale. I guess you could put Di in that category as well. Does she ever play a nice, happy character who isn’t being completely fucked over by some scumbag man?
Well, they did the whole book.
Karen Gillian is also very tall
Tfw your 18 year old nephew with Marfan syndrome is already very tall and is *still* shorter than Elizabeth Debicki.
Knowing that Rosalina and Cynthia still have a chance of appearing in a movie in the near future, I can’t imagine anyone else but her as those roles
ah, you mean kissing Jennifer Aniston and Emma Roberts? i feel for him, i really do. I would switch places if i could, just to take that burden from him.   edit: Roberts not Stone
I love Jason Sudeikis' reaction to that, he just tries not to look at it and keep a straight face.
You're an aggressive woman. You know what I'm sayin?
No ragrets.
What you looking at, eyebrows?
TIME OUT!
Always upvote the Venture Bros!
The Poul stone
gold raisin, yum yum
Well, given that White Vision also has a stone which definitely isn't the Mind Stone...   It's probably decorative.
Except the High Evolutionary used the infinity stones to make counter earth…
honestly with all that, im glad they kept him 1)  gold and 2)practically gold.
That would unironically be really awesome. Lol
Genuinely curious - who makes you most unhappy? First casts that come to my mind seem to be really great - see Oscar Isaac, Iman Vellani, Tenoch Huerta.
I used to think that way but then I saw what he [looks](https://media.wusa9.com/assets/ETONLINE/images/0b37c842-12c0-4da5-b59a-2461132bedb3/0b37c842-12c0-4da5-b59a-2461132bedb3_1140x641.jpg) like recently. I was only really familiar with him from 'We Are The Millers' so I expected [this](https://images-prod.dazeddigital.com/1000/azure/dazed-prod/1040/4/1044038.jpg) guy to be Adam Warlock. I think he's gonna be great though. It's more the characterisation that I'm worried about.
I mean the ‘perfect being in the universe’ can be subjective when you take into account the massive vast playground GOTG is playing in (deep space other galaxies)..part of me likes that it’s this unexpected. He might not be ‘perfect’ to our standards and that might just be the idea.
Fair enough, I like the one you linked also!   The armor point is my biggest gripe now that you’ve pointed it out, lol. He shouldn’t need it!
The trend of characters needing to “earn” their outfits is so dumb and worn out
We can hope.
It would be so cool to have a Kevin Bacon cameo in GOTG 3
Speaking of, I wonder if they’re hiding Moondragon and she’ll be introduced in this movie
James Gunn *did* say this is the last movie of this iteration of GOTG
Danny Devito pip the troll confirmed
What are you doing, Step Son Adam?
>"What we're seeing is the infant form of Warlock, newly out of the cocoon, and he does not understand life very well. He's basically a baby."   >   >\- James Gunn
So? Just because it's family friendly doesn't mean it should be dumbed down for everyone
No, they're made for families. Still, that doesn't mean that they should be relying on comedy so much to the point where they're ruining great characters in order to make an audience laugh.
Potentially problematic? When’s the last time *you* held your breath underwater for an hour?
Braised beef is brilliant
> Potentially problematic, but possibly pleasant.  Potentially problematic plus possibly pleasant ... perhaps?  *FTFY
Practically, it's quite possible to pursue that proposal.
I'm a father of small children, and that mostly just sounds like Cap'n Turbot.
You could also blame the repetitive gameplay.
Yeah I played it on PC with ray-tracing and some levels I just had to stop and admire my surroundings. Knowhere was particularly impressive.
It isn't on there anymore, was on it for about a year and left on March 15th.
It's on sale a lot too. But it's totally worth it. The gameplay is a touch repetitive but the story, the characters, the voices, the music, the scenery, all of it is amazing. I don't think it exactly has replay value besides maybe choosing some different plot options here and there but damn it's a great ride at least once.
Yes definitely worth playing.
If you have PS+ extra it's on there.
It looks like you can get it $14-20 on eBay. If you like the guardians and a bit more of a story based game I think you will very much enjoy it.
Agreed, that was my favorite part. And I love the MCU versions as well, but their game counterparts were superior
Exactly, I LOVE the MCU Guardians, but holy shit, the characterization of the game ones was......amazing.  Seriously, character's like Drax and Mantis beat the MCU counterparts in a ridicolous fashion, and even those that are pretty great in MCU,like Star Lord and Gamora are just as amazing(Like seriously, nothing against Zoe Saldana, but game's Gamora talking about Nebula blows her out of the water)
I didn't really have any performance issues on PC. I definitely recommend playing it though. It was soooo much better than I expected!
Didn't ayesha take Peters dna in guardians in the galaxy 2 ?
I feel like the theme is more learning to let go. I don’t really see “growing up” as a major lesson he needs based on the Christmas Special.
Rocky Horror vibes
New track for the movie confirmed: [I guess this is growing up](https://youtu.be/sT0g16_LQaQ)
You got issues, Quill
I quote that almost weekly to this day. Austin Powers might be kind of goofy but it hit so many great points like quotability
*mutters* “KC and the Sunshine Band”
Cigar and a crepe?
Least incestuous member of the British monarchy.
Ayesha in the comics was born as Adam's brother, but they went back into the cocoon and reformed into a women form who had a she boner for trying get pregnant by Adam to create a super race.
She played Jordan Baker in The Great Gatsby, arguably the only character in that story who doesn't get fucked over or fuck anyone else over at some point.  And she's terrific in the role!  She delivers one of my favorite lines perfectly:    "I like large parties.  They're so intimate.  At small parties there isn't any privacy."
Yeah she seems to get cast a lot as the damaged woman like the abused wife in Widows. She was great in it though.
Yeah she's pretty tall but Elizabeth Debicki is taller-than-The-Rock tall. She's **9**\-**inches** taller than Tom Holland lol
She's 5'9.
Wasn't he bitten in his crown jewels at one point and then passed out?
Emma Roberts* but yeah
Not even one letter?
Take your filthy upvote.
Which I get but, Vision didn’t have a stone in the comics. It was just a laser. You can’t have Adam Warlock without the Infinity Stones, especially the soul stone.   They better have worked out some way to retcon his connection to them or this is going to be real annoying.   So much so that honestly, when Gunn very first learned he would be unable to introduce Adam Warlock *before* Infinity War and that he would not play a role is the saga, he should have simply chosen not to use the character at all - it’s that simple.
Is that a retcon? Because I just read that issue and he maybe used the soul stone. It didn't say he did but he did have it on hand to give to Adam. But no other mentions of infinity stones.
Even better if she was just going around and annoying the hell out of him the entire time.
Hailee was great as Kate Bishop
Were you saying those three as castings you did or didn't like?
The whole holiday special involved him
I don't think quill wanted his sister to kidnapped him again, especially after she basically drug his mind the last time he met him.
Pip is already in the MCU and is voiced by Patton Oswalt.
I think the implication here is that hes like Vision in Age of Ultron where hes brand new to the universe. Does not necessarily mean hes going to be whiny or something
I had gillyweed last time I tried.
I understood that reference.
Susan Sarandon makes a great shrimp scampi
Amazing reference haha. The good ol days.
Perfect!
I was going to say, story and character wise it is really cool but the combat got old so quick and the overall traversal and stuff was fairly formulaic. I feel like a sequel could really push it to "great" territory if they addressed those parts.
I loved the story but that gameplay was pretty trash. Also missed opportunity for not being able to play as all the guardians at different parts.
Boo this man! BOO!
You mean a video game has a gameplay loop like other games?! I'm shocked!
I imagine it will be back on streaming at some point, ill wait for that, or if it goes on a good steam sale
Sorry I thought you were talking about the game.  Honestly I can't remember, it's been a while since I saw Vol 2
Part of growing up is learning to let go. Some of the most formative moments in life can be loss, and being able to internalize that we don't have "forever".
The movies knew they were bordering cringe level comedy and embraced it.   But at its base, Austin powers movies were perfect slapstick, parody style antics with great Individual lines.
Wait, Ayesha is supposed to be Her?
Wait wait wait, go over that one more time a bit slower.
Fair enough. If I had a chance to disappear into a pod and come back out in Elizabeth Debicki’s body, I’d take it in a heartbeat
omg ayesha trans queen
I now want to see a Rom-Com about Tom Holland trying to date a giant woman, thank you for this
She is 5’10.75”. She used to have her height in her instagram bio, probably for modeling where they are super strict about height.
>Wasn't he bitten in his crown jewels at one point and then passed out?  By Emma Roberts and Jennifer Aniston, yeah.
Fixed. 'ppreciate ya
>You can't have Adam Warlock without the Infinity Stones  I don't really see why you can't. A lot of things have changed in the films, hell, things change constantly even just in the comics. If it's well written and his character is more than just a one dimensional plot device then I'm not sure it matters if he's connected to the stones. If they have a good alternative, it can work.
I agree.  When Gunn learned that he couldn't use Adam Warlock before IW, I was hoping he'd pivot to bringing in Nova (Richard Rider) or Quasar.  Both would easily fit into the GotG  and the more galactic themes of the MCU.  Adam Warlock without the Soul Stone just feels...off.
You don't like her as Kate?          Edit: misread the comment. My bad.
Could not disagree more, I thought he was the best part of the movie
Audiences are loving Tenoch, and I totally understand why. But yeah I'm with you, he's nothing like comics Namor. They needed somebody more androgynous and alien, like a male version of Anya Taylor Joy but with slicked-back hair and flawless skin.      I'm cool with beefcake Namor, though. It makes more sense from a marketing perspective.
Oh, so you just have terrible taste. Got it.
Oof- missed out on the holiday special. My bad
RemindMe! 27 days
I'm looking forward to the scene of Ayesha struggling to change his nappy while Adam flails his legs around.
> he is going to be crying and pooping his pants the whole movie  I know I will be. In a good way, of course.
>Hence you will see him as not infant form later?  I don't care what they do with him later, I care about what they do with him in *this* movie. If they don't handle him well in his first appearance, it'll be pretty difficult to make me give a shit about subsequent appearances.  >You are making it seem like he is going to be crying and pooping his pants the whole movie  I never said he would be shitting in his diaper lmao. I'm just saying that there were rumours ages ago that Warlock would behave like a big baby and then James Gunn came out and literally used the word "baby" to describe him.
*Oh my god! I’ve killed Harry Potter!*
Better option than self-transfiguration, if you ask me
I love and hate that I heard that just like him in the show lol
Wordlessly watching, he waits by the window and wonders
But ftfy doesn't start with "P"....
IMO the level design was phenomenal too.
The characterization was so, so good.
I thought the team up/huddle up part was a pretty stupid waste of time tbh
No, it’s okay to have an opinion
Having a gameplay loop doesn’t inherently mean it becomes repetitive.
Maybe. I see growing up as more learning to be an adult but I feel he’s kinda already there. Especially given how he’s bought Knowhere and is basically building a refuge for the Galaxy as they help them recover from the blip.
What about [Bartholomew](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/marveldatabase/images/8/80/Earth-82814_from_What_If%3F_Vol_1_34_001.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20220628071931)?  [Context](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Earth-82814).
Demigod who came out of their birthing cocoon as a male went back in and was reborn as a female so they could make babies with their brother.
Fair enough - I converted from 1.8m listed on Google. Taller than average for sure, but not sure I'd qualify that as "very tall."
This is after Thanos' modifications though.  We talking about pre-cyborg legs.
That's tall, but that's not 6'3" tall.
But when has Gunn had “a good alternative.”
Huh? I've been reading since the 90s and Namor has always been a hyper-masculine 'Mr. Steal yo girl' type. I mean just look at the Phoenix Five, his constant chasing of Sue Storm, etc.
The point was to be nothing like the comics.  They wanted to differentiate from aquaman and Atlantis and they did it well.
Nothing abt Comic Namor is androgynous, so why is that even a consideration?   I have an idea why, but I'd def like to know your idea of why.
That's so strange because I'm going back and thinking about Namor in the comics, I never saw this take. I went back through my collection in my head, and every appearance I can think of is hyper-masculine. I don't know where the idea of an androgynous Namor stems from. Is this a more recent portrayal? He's often lithe but outside of some younger portrayals in the early 00's, he's always a man's man.
Androgynous?   namor is very macho, super arrogant, full of himself, borderline toxic masculinity, so much so that if it's up to me I will cast the Tate brothers.  The cool thing about Black Panther vs Namor rivalry in the comics is how both kings represent 2 opposing forms of masculinity. (Also, Chadwick  was great in showing it on screen.. like, if you are a dad watching BP with your son, you will point out "now that is how to be a man, son" )

r/unexpectedharrypotter
😂 this thread has made my day
Rowling, having a brief moment of clarity on seeing the 74% drop in the brand
Phixt That Phor You
Neither does Pfizer or Pfister, and yet here we are..
There are way too many long hallways with nothing in them. It was great for the banter, I'd even purposely slow down or stop so I don't miss the dialog, but you realize how bland it is on a second playthrough.
Especially a correct opinion.
Agree that Quill is grown up by the time Volume 3 rolls around— he’s grown up as soon as the end of Vol. 1 when Denarian Dey asks him if he’s sure he’s the one to look after the Guardians and he says, “Yeah… me.” Definitely think Volume 3 will see Peter learn to let go of Gamora and come into a more fully-furnished identity for himself, symbolized by a heavily-90s soundtrack that goes beyond the bounds of his mother’s library.
Could you say that again?  ...exactly the way you said it.
Could you explain that again, but this time in a cockney accent drippiping in erotic undertones?
Btw, 1.83 m is 6 feet tall. I think 1.8 m = 5.9 feet since Google just gives you the decimal, which isn't the same at 5'9".
I was just being exact. I remember it because I found the .75 thing odd till I remembered she models. She qualifies as very tall for a woman. She’s like two standard deviations away from the average female height.
Well cutting out the Master of the Sun was probably a good call
Well what didn't you like about his performance? I feel like Angela Basset and him literally carried the movie.
~~Which is ironic given Namor was ALWAYS designed to be a copy of Aquaman and Atlantis.~~  So apparently Namor is first, while less famous than his Atlantean brethren Aquaman.   Roman backwards, underwater advanced civilization, etc. It was literally his design.   HOWEVER, what the MCU did by finding an alternative Atlantis in South America/Central American myth. Someone did very well there.
As someone who knows fuck-all about the comics, I would like to know what you suspect (and their reasoning, if different).
It's either a sterotype connected to the call for an Asian actor for Namor, or they don't know the definition of Androgynous.
Maybe Mr. Nimbus?  (He controls the police)
> ...Namor in ... every appearance I can think of is hyper-masculine.  Namor is the original Vegeta.
>here's this guy with a dad bod  How is [THIS](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FigPJAYXkAEh4gi.jpg) a "dad bod"?!
I’d like to see what you look like if you thought that was a dad bod
Tenoch does not have a dad bod, what is wrong with ya'll?
Man, Tenoch Huerta was built as shit in that movie. It makes sense that a race of people adapted to live underwater are going to be more sleek than musclebound, but he’s still pretty damned huge.
He has a classic swimmer's physique, which I thought makes sense given his character spends most of his time in the water.
Yeah, i was saying it in jest, but only kind of kidding. I loved the casting because it was perfect for the way they changed his character and background which I thought was absolutely brilliant.   But I know some didn’t like it and you can’t please everyone.
What
Yeah, the hallways were almost stupid, but I liked the cyberpunk design of some of the cities/bases, the sense of depth or layers over layers surrounding your team. I also liked the levels were not entirely predictable at least the first 2/3 of the game.
1.8 is on the taller side of 5’10”
The Master of the Sun storyline wasn’t until 2020, well after both Guardians movies came out…
Namor predates Aquaman by more than two years.
Oh wow that's how namor got its name? Pretty genius that in the movie, they spun it to be from no amor / without love
I mentioned to another commentor it feels like it may be a stereotype thats influenced by the running idea of wanting an Asian actor cast as Namor.  Other wise op is just using words bc, its just thats way to specific of a word to fuck up like that.  Namor is hyper masculine (and tbh quite honest, hyper sexualized) in the comics, so it was an odd idea to throw out there in relation to Namor, imho.
You look at him then go look at Chris Hemsworth as Thor and tell us how that's not a dad bod? Thor is quite the hard target to reach though. Look at anybody else in the MCU. Chris Evans, Chadwick Boseman, hell even Paul rudd and Pratt in their respective movies. Namor was great, but did not have a physically threatening appearance.
Not roided up = dad bod, apparently.
[dumb joke about the rumours Rowling’s public behaviour in the last few years is responsible for this](https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/jk-rowling-company-announces-drop-profits/?amp)
5’10.75” even
Wait, what was wrong with Angela?
That is a new fact....1939 shit, that's insane.   *That being said, it doesn't fully change the point in that Aquaman and Namor were tied directly to and lifted from teh same source material and have roughly the same motivations.   BUT Namor did win.
Better name origin retcon than Han Solo's last name being Space Spanish for "party of one? lol"
> (and tbh quite honest, hyper sexualized)  Yeah people forget just how many of his early stories revolved around him being an irrepressible horndog for Sue Storm.
Maybe it's better if standards relax a tiny bit. It's not good for kids to grow up thinking the Thor body is realistically attainable.
namor is supposed to be the most ripped hero in marvel AND dc? wat? i'm not super into the comics  but i've never heard of that.
And yet he got paid, made a full movie, and is overwhelmingly accepted with nobreal complaint abt his looks/weight out side of a select few.
The "roided" actors can barely maintain their bodies during filming and have spoken on this.  Theres no way Tenoch would have been able to maintain a body like that, as legit the ONLY character in the MCU current that is shirtless 95% of their screen time.  The story presented allows for body fat for Namor. Feige and co told hin not tonworry abt losing too much oe putting on so much muscle. So ppl need to chill.
Verily.   I hope its toned down in the MCU. I don't think its a terrible idea to make Namor a flirt, but making him similar to conics Namor in that regard just wouldn't feel right.
Counterpoint: I think it sells superstrength as a power better if the person *isn't* ripped; they can just DO it.
[Truly hideous, and disrespectful to the character Namor.](https://i.imgur.com/P9l9RQc.jpg)
Not really.  The MCU seems to have completely ignored Wanda’s 50 years as a hero, in favour of adapting her as a a damaged, borderline nutter tip toeing between sane and insane due to 2 dogshit comic stories that character assassinated her but gain notoriety by a bunch of casuals that read about her ‘No more mutants’ moment and thought it was epic.   To put it in perspective nobody would have accepted Captain America: Civil War turning iron man into a borderline pyscho dictator that sends super villains after his friends would they? They didn’t adapt any of his dick headedness from his extremis arcs in the comics did they?   So why do we accept the MCU adapting Wanda’s shitty stories?   The only time we ever actually see Wanda as an actual hero in the MCU is in Civil War, Infinity War and Endgame, which combined probably equals about 30 minutes of screen-time. 30 minutes of Wanda being anything close to her normal comic self before Avengers Disassembled and House of M trashed the character.    Age of Ultron she was a villain to begin with, that’s trying to right her wrongs when she joins the Avengers.  WandaVision she’s having a mental break, and accidentally tortured a town in the process. In isolation the story is fine, as op mentioned it explored Wanda’s dodgy storyline’s from the comics without A) character assassinating her, B) didn’t make her irredeemable and C) she had actual agency and the story was completely about her and her trauma.  She was still very easily redeemable as her actions were no worse than that of other Avengers.   Unfortunately for WandaVision however, MoM came along and absolutely wiped its ass with everything WandaVision tried to explore with the character by making Wanda into a 1-dimensional pyscho nutter, who was one cackle away from a stereotypical bad guy witch.   WandaVision serves no purpose other than a glorified origin story for the Darkhold now, her entire journey absolutely means fuck all thanks to MoM, and it was trashed for what? MoM doesn’t build on Wanda’s character in anyway at all, there’s no development there that WandaVision hadn’t already covered, and it set the character up for nothing.   Seriously all anyone has to do is look at the interviews for the WandaVision writers and show-runners and see that MoM shits all over their intentions.  At this point I legit barely give a shit about Wanda’s character in the MCU, I’m adding her to the same wasted and missed potential pile as Bucky got shafted on.   I would very much rather they actually kill main Wanda off with those rocks and replace her with 838 Wanda, at least she has none of the baggage.   At least the comics have made Wanda into a certified good guy again with her current series, for now at least.
No, but they seem to feel a need to skip all of the great stories of every character to get to the ones made in the last 15 years that wanted to focus a lot on trauma. Then they repeat that storyline...a lot. Wanda was redeeming for several movies and a show, Thor was trying to be worthy, Tony kept having to see the price of his arrogance...they desperately need someone doing QC on the scripts (completed ones) before they ever start filming.
Only thing I hate about her was her arc in multiverse of madness
I was fine with it up until MoM. Took a hard turn into some problematic tropes and was kinda whiplash with the way they presented it coming off of WandaVision.
How is Wanda an amateur in MoM? She's been a witch for like 3 years longer than Strange has been a sorcerer, she made a whole town and wiped all their memories, as well as almost soloing Thanos and destroying those saw things in IW.   Strange failed a memory wipe spell, didn't even phase Thanos and has never actually defeated anyone apart from that guy he blasted in his celestial form that one time (Think about it, his Cape stranged some people for him, he had to bargain with Dormammu, had to be saved by Spiderman in IW, was stuck holding a body of water for 20 minutes in Endgame, lost to Spiderman in his own dimension, and got a teenager to beat Wanda for him)  I'd say Wanda has the rights to bully him  Also, Elizabeth Olsen still has a few more projects in her contract so I don't think her arc is done just yet.
> The only time we ever actually see Wanda as an actual hero in the MCU is in Civil War, Infinity War and Endgame, which combined probably equals about 30 minutes of screen-time.  ...not even that, it's closer to 20 minutes ([35m35s for the infinity saga as a whole](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/fob7lx/the_infinity_saga_screen_time_breakdown/) minus [age of ultron's 12m10s](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/d8bwqd/avengers_age_of_ultron_screen_time_breakdown/) = 23m25s for cw/iw/eg).  for comparison she has more screen time than that in multiverse of madness alone ([~30 minutes](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/vl9ber/doctor_strange_in_the_multiverse_of_madness/))... so yeah... she spends 95% of her comics appearances as an all out hero, yet the majority of her mcu screen time as a bad guy :\
She only has the darkhold for a year at most timeline wise and any magic before that was an accident.  And it’s a problem how weak they’ve made strange Wanda bullying him just solidifies that
Speaking of just popularity and not quality, then yes, I think it peaked with Endgame.
I think it's pretty simple.  If Marvel stop making mediocre movies, the huge audiences will return.
It’s gonna outlast both the DCEU and the Arrowverse, so no.   It’s still popular, there’s just less people talking about it now when there’s been a new societal issue to think about pretty much every week for the last three years (I.e Covid, inflation, Ukraine war, Roe getting overturned, police shootings, Trump getting indicted etc.)  It’s not less popular, people just have bigger stuff to prioritize right now.
I think it's likely that the worldwide good feeling towards and awareness of the MCU peaked with IW/Endgame and that won't be surpassed unless Marvel puts out another string of unexpectedly good titles.  You can't be the biggest thing in the world forever. That said, many things that get as big as the MCU did don't disappear and they eventually find a sustainable plateau of interest.
A little off topic, but does anyone think that Avengers: Secret Wars will be a huge success like Infinity War and Endgame?   Even though they aren’t directing the film, the Russos claimed that Secret Wars could be the biggest movie of all time if it was written well.   However, with the recent box office and critical track record of Phase 4 and 5, I’m a little worried about how the film will be handled.
I think that after peaking with Endgame they went a little overboard in terms of content. There was a lot of tv shows and films, people either doesn’t have the time or the money to consume it all so it became too much.   It’s a difficult balance because you can assure people that there’s no need to watch everything or that is not going to get super complicated, but at the same time, the franchise became famous for having everything connected… but it’s hard to make it work for general audiences.  At the end, it all comes down to making good movies. They have the brand recognition but they cannot rely on that all the time.
Kinda. The infinity saga and the movies before it had absolute powerhouses in both casting and characters. I can see them reaching that potential again if they pull off, say, X-Men with perfect casting. But the movies they have coming out now are characters that people don't really care about.
A little
A novel can never be only the last 50 pages. You can't just release *Endgame* every couple of years because without the build-up, no one knows or cares about the characters. And the story won't be as good because they'd have to throw a ton of set-up exposition in it or make it 4 hours long. A strong ending must be built-up to. Not every chapter that comes before it will be as dynamic. But that doesn't mean it doesn't play its part
Yeah it’s losing popularity. It can get it back easily though.
The quality has been poor since Endgame. There’s no disputing that
Lmao
If they get things back on track, it will be popular again but i dont think to the same length as during the infinity saga.
I think this Reddit community is getting tired of everyone asking the same question 20 different ways….
Not really. People are just impatient and are having a hard time adjusting to every new thing not being another "Endgame".
Nah, I think it's a combination of people being impatient, waiting for the next big event (as the other person said), as well as people hating on it for being popular.
It's going to keep on being quite popular (unless they fuck it up really bad) but I believe it has peaked. Phase 3 was lightning in a bottle. The whole world was expecting those movies.  If they keep on not knowing how to move forwards, it will become another Star Wars. Not dead but the equivalent of a dancing monkey that has been worked to death for profit.
I don't think so, I think it's just too many ppl that are taking all this media for granted.  It's almost impossible for all movies to be like infinity war and end game and we need to appreciate that we have all this.  Maybe it's because I'm older and I wish I had all this when I was younger but now I finally get what I wanted I appreciate it a lot more whether or not it's perfect or not
I’ve noticed that people are less excited for marvel stuff lately so I think it’s losing popularity. Unless it’s Spider Man since he is still popular.
One third of my family claims 'super-hero fatigue'.  The other two-thirds can't wait for the next ANYTHING Marvel.  The third that claims they're tired of it is headed by a loveable know-it-all curmudgeon who basically hates everything, his wife who doesn't care, and his son who is the sweetest kid in the world who worships his dad.  IMHO - a little.  I don't think its come anywhere close to the end of its life.  Although if I don't get a Sub-Mariner movie, I may boycott it myself.
A lot of my friends/family who are just average movie goers were put off by the need short and long term to have to watch Disney + shows to stay in the loop. Especially when some of the shows were mediocre at best in their eyes.
Fans are less likely to see a move in the theater multiple times since they know it will be on Disney+ soon.  That cuts down on repeat business.
No they are more popular now then they have been since at least Loki. People just don’t need a new project every 2 months. But Avengers is still very much in the lexicon of Pop Culture
I think they are doing some internal diagnostic checks before the dilithium crystals start breakin’ up.
Yea
Yes. Doesn't mean I want them to stop making them. Idgaf about popularity.   If I'm the only one watching Captain America 4 then so be it.
It's certainly not losing its popularity if people are still actively talking about the franchise, whether it's in a positive or negative light. Especially in a negative light.
Given the GOTG3 pre-sales yeah there is fatigue but if they go back to making a streak of good projects they are gonna be back.It's hapenned before during phase 2 and they were able to recover but not having Avengers movies at end of phases is really hurting them and Feige for some reason doesn't wanna pump the brakes on new character introductions and we are not done yet
Phase 4 was divisive. Some liked everything, others liked none of it,  and some found it to be an extremely mixed bag. The MCU will dip in popularity, but it can get back if they just make good content as opposed to so much of it. Quality over Quantity. Can they do it? We'll see.  I thought ant man 3 was just okay. I loved black panther 2. We'll see what happens with Guardians 3.
They need a good character like the sentry to spice it up lol
I feel like the magic/clout of Marvel is getting too watered down with the sheer amount of content they’re producing now. It was great and easy to follow when there were only a handful of core characters we were following and watching them interact with each other
From my own circle of people. Everyone was super on board for the endgame train. None of us have cared about anything that follows really. Idk when or why I stopped either. I think watching Loki.
marvel quality has decreased quite a bit too
It really is this simple.
honestly didnt even think about it that way, thanks!
I think Disney has a real good opportunity to make big bucks here. They could actually show the status quo being shifted. Andor is a great example of that. A pro-revolution show that supports worker rights, prison reform, anti-colonialism and anti-racism. It's literally a how-to guide on starting a revolution. I don't know how that got produced by a studio so big and monolithic. No wonder the show was a surprise success.   Disney could embrace this and show similar things in Marvel. People need catharsis after so much shit that happened since 2020. Marvel could fill that gap.   They've tried to hit the themes too but quite often miss the mark. Two glaring examples are Karli Morgenthau and Killmonger. They both were fighting for real causes that actually made the heroes question things about the system. They also reflected a lot of our real world problems in a very direct manner. But they just happened to be bad guys so the plot will make them kill innocent people. They only touch issues but cower away from giving real solutions. Falcon and Winter Soldier's resolution was literally "do better". That's not a real solution to anything.  Andor delivered us an answer. It mirrors the state of our lives irl and then does something about it.
It will be full of cameos so  it could even make more more money than endgame and infinity war.Nwh is proof that audience will fall for nostalgia even if the plot is nothing special.Rdj,X-Men ,Chris evans all will be in secret wars I am sure
very well put, thank you!
i didnt think about people not caring about the current characters. casual fans arent going to know who Ms marvel is or whoever... im excited to see what they do with X-Men and the Fantastic Four for sure though. i think that will be the true test of the MCU strength
Not all those films were great. But they get remembered in the warm afterglow of *Infinity War* and *Endgame,* and people think of them in a better light. But the MCU wasn't anything in Phase 1. It wasn't a big cultural thing.   I told people at the time it's what they should be watching because it's of its time, current. Not something hauled up from the ages like Star Wars and Star Trek whose foundational figures all left years ago, and now they're run by business executives who only worry about returns on the IP they bought. And I say that as a fan of both  Most current fans weren't around for the start of the Infinity Saga before anyone knew what it was going to be. It was like now. A lot of standalone feeling films. Some were better than others
It’s not impatience, it’s a severe lack of writing talent being hired
oh i fully agree! not everything needs to have endgame style writing by any means, that defeats the purpose of foreshadowing, etc. . i like how phase 1-3 actually built up to something ... whereas now it does feel slower, but i do think they are (were) releasing things too quickly (MoM, Love and Thunder) without quality checking if you will
Well, that does mean that it's technically losing it's popularity.
Phase 4 taken as a whole, I can agree with that. However I happen to like No Way Home, Loki, WandaVision  and Wakanda Forever better than many other projects from the Infinity Saga. Hell, I liked Wakanda Forever better than Black Panther 1.
Thats kinda what I’m afraid of: just tons of cameos with a weak story.
To be fair though... The same was true back in the beginning when they originally pulled Ironman and Thor and Hawkeye.  Those weren't the front line heroes. They weren't Spiderman and the X-Men.
True
But let’s see if things get better. After all, Marvel is slowing down the output of their projects.
But the story could be good! You never know.
 Jeez, if a 2 minute featurette makes me emotional, I’m going to be a mess in the actual movie. Guardians is my favourite aspect that remains of the MCU, I want so badly for them to have a worthy send off.
This is going to be brutal... in the best possible way.  I love these characters so much.
I love just about the entire MCU, but these characters, this director, and these actors are basically perfect.  I have always felt that the Guardians - despite being full of aliens - is the most human saga in the MCU.
My heart is genuinely not ready for this one. I’m not ready to say goodbye.
what really baffles me is with Rocket leading this storyline, we have hardly seen Bradley Cooper in any promotions!
I can’t wait until May! GOTG 3 is probably my most anticipated movie of the whole year!
I don't want to say goodbye :(
I’m not crying you’re crying.
Crying in the club rn
That MF gonna make me cry 😭
Gonna miss this family
Yeah James does a great job of humanizing his stories, despite how non-human the character are/look.
Pain
Him and Vin Diesel have it in their contract that they don’t have to do press. Actors hate press and would definitely not do it for free or unless their contract stated so.
I prefer not seeing Bradley Cooper promoting, it preserves Rocket as an independent entity. Seeing an actor awkwardly answer the same questions over and over doesn't enhance the suspension of disbelief required to appreciate the character.
have you ever seen Bradley Cooper and rocket in the same place at the same time?
It’s crazy that I don’t even really associate rocket with Bradley cooper lol
Wait what about \*Barbie\* and/or \*Across the Spider-Verse?\*?
🍞 Here ya go
While I'm sure many actors hate press, I think it's a bit more than just that lol  Vin Diesel has done press in the past for Marvel movies, although maybe he has it in his contract now.   Bradley Cooper OTOH has never done press for Marvel and what I've heard is it's because Zoe Saldana and Bradley Cooper used to date and then had a bad breakup... not long before GotG 1. So when they were both signed, that was a stipulation in Bradley's contract, so that the two of them wouldn't have to be in a room together at any point.   That's why BC also doesn't go to Marvel premieres- which is something most Actors seem to love.
Yes. In my dreams
Oh yeah Spider-verse 2 is also really high on my list.
Uh, thanks?
Interesting
So many actors shit where they eat and then are shocked when there is a crappy taste in their mouths.
Pardon my french 😤
Pain is bread in french
I thought I heard this game was gonna be discontinued and online game play was going to stop too
The online gameplay server is still online, their just not updating the game anymore. They made all the cosmetics free now tho which is kinda cool
I’d heard that there was a date of terminus coming soon. Total shutdown.
Nah it's what I said. Just no more updates.  I mean the servers will be shut down eventually like any online game, but they haven't been yet
There isn't anything inherently wrong with it, but there is still a significant portion of movie watchers who have little to no interest in these or any other "franchise films", and their options are dwindling. Especially with theaters slowly getting overtaken by streaming, they're going to only want to put the most profitable movies on the bid screen, which is going to be these "theme park pictures".  The criticism is that movies are becoming too "safe", more and more they're following a formula that has become so ingrained in each movie that an AI could soon write one. People growing up with Good Will Hunting, Almost Famous, Gladiator, Memento, Casino, and other movies like that are just getting bored with the same thing with a new coat of paint.   You could just call them snobs, but I personally think that that's a bit childish and that they do have a point. Even as someone who loves Marvel movies, you always know what to expect, and they always deliver, albeit with differing levels of success. Roller coasters are fun, but when everything is a roller coaster, it makes sense that a lot of people will eventually just get bored.  "The Daily" podcast did an episode on this that describes it better than I could: "Our Film Critic on why He's Done with Movies".  Edit: this is probably not the best place to ask this question. r/movies would give you more unbiased answers
Haven't there always been big screen action or sci- fi movies. You can't say James Bond wasn't great cinema,  or Jaws, Close Encounters, True Lies, Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark. Great action movies from the sixties like Zulu, Naked Prey with Cornel Wilde was a classic I saw with  my Dad.
It's just buzzwords to whine about Marvel because it's popular
Every piece of work has an ambition behind it, and then an execution of how it actually ends up. Some films aim high and achieve success; others aim high and don’t succeed.  The “theme park” criticism is that the ambition behind a certain film is low; so it can either succeed on its own humble merits, or it can fail to even reach that.  I think some things the MCU has done is actually extremely ambitious with a high risk of failure. Endgame was a huge huge gamble. Other (most?) MCU films don’t aim as high but do what they set out to do. Not everything can be high art, but the “theme park ride” criticism is essentially saying that some art doesn’t aim high enough.
Anyone can put in a cameo or a reference in a movie to get a reaction from the audience. It doesn't require any skill or creativity. There's no art in it. It's shallow, cheap and facile, the cinematic equivalent of studio "applause" lights telling the audience to clap.
Yeah I always thought calling the MCU theme park movies should be seen as more of a statement than an insult? Like maybe going to an art museum for a day is a more cultured activity than going to a theme park, but it’s just a different way to spend your time at the end of the day. Does it need to matter if I’m going to an MCU movie to have a fun time?
Dude, LET IT GO. Scorcese made those comments in 2019, and people still bring this shit up. It is so sad that you cannot drop it. The only reason he even said anything is because of the question he was asked by a reporter he didn’t just go on a rant.  Marvel movies are fucking huge. They make up a huge chunk of yearly box office percentage. You already won. Please cut out this stupid, “every makes fun of us” shit, you are not the underdog here. Scorcese is not bullying a multi billionaire dollar series.   It’s also funny to me that one of your examples to defend the MCU was jump scares, which is a famously over used trope that is very often used  in an cheap and uninspired way.
Nothing, but it just sucks when it becomes the default method of filmmaking for an entire generation of filmmakers and audiences.
The notion of "theme park movies" seems to imply they have little substance and are only meant to be entertain the audience without anything more to them. I think there is some truth to that mindset but I don't think that's all there is to them personally
I’ve been involved in film academia and work in the PR side of the industry. Cinema is full of snobs. Whether it’s horror films, superhero films, or animation etc. Heck, I had one teacher who turned his nose up at *all* narrative films. This happens with all art forms - literature is infamous for it, for example. Art is subjective and everyone has their own view of what “art” even is.  However, even if someone considers an action blockbuster to be cinema’s equivalent to a Big Mac… what’s wrong with smashing a Maccie’s every once in a while?  I’m open to everything. Superhero movies, animation, deep cut character dramas, musicals, avant garde, whatever. Just make it *good*.
This is what I don't understand:  The past handful of years have been absolutely wonderful for the film nerd/snob in me. Some of my favorite movies have come out the last handful of years: First Cow, The Lighthouse, Hereditary, The Square, Burning, Parasite, The Sound of Metal, Another Round, Uncut Gems, Lady Bird, High Life, You Were Never Really Here, Annihilation, Pig, EO, Get Out, A Ghost Story, The Green Knight, Drive My Car, TAR, Titane, The Power of the Dog, Banshees of Inisherin, Everything/Everywhere.  I'm literally only going back 5 years. And not even listing everything I like. If I went back 10 years (when Avengers 1 released), I could rattle off double what is above. There are good films out there for the serious film-goer. Sure, they're harder to see, I get that. And I wish that were different (trying to see Showing Up this weekend is a chore). But this idea that cinema has just disappeared in the face of comic book movies and major IP/franchise shit is just not true.  And honestly, I'll take what David Lowry or Kelly Reichardt or Ari Aster is making in the 2020s easily before a mid-budget "adult" movie that came out 20 years ago like Crash, Shakespeare In Love, Shawshank, etc. I actually think serious, non "theme-park" film has gotten more sophisticated during the comic-book/IP boom.  But hey, what the fuck do I know.  EDIT: weird spacing.
The "theme park movies" thing never bugged me. The "it's not cinema" thing bugged me.
I mean, do people go to these kinds of movies to avoid being entertained? Or taken on a viewing thrill ride? I'm confused what people expect when they go to see an MCU film? Because after 30+ films, my expectations are: 1) entertainment, 2) cool action, 3) neat story that will tie into something else, 4) interesting characters, etc.
Because... Hollywood elitists.
I think the criticism is that they lack substance according to "real" cinema. They don't understand what the stories mean and just see a bunch of idiots in costumes and snazzy special effects. Superhero stories are more subversive than people give them credit for, and it's exactly that "theme park" quality that lets them get away with it. It doesn't take much reflection to see the parallels of superheroes with traumas and broken families, learning about and enhancing their powers as metaphors of mental health work, and forming super found-family teams.  Even if you're too young or just not paying attention to get it, your subconscious is still remembering those big moments. They'll still be there on D+ or HBOMax if you ever need them. Guardians of the Galaxy is obviously a very personal story from James Gunn. If you outgrow the Disney superhero stuff, check out Peacemaker or Invincible then. Return to D+ years later and re-connect with your inner child if you want. What a gift!  Let the critics have their opinions, respectfully. But also like what you like!
There is little other reason to spend hours of your day overpaying for screen-based entertainment if it's not for an experience you cant get at home. Cheering together with a group of people, at a sports game, on a theme park ride, or at a Marvel movie is such an experience.   "Cinema" as Scorsese knows it died 20+ years ago when U.S. theater attendance peaked. The days where movies were something special because television was much lower quality, social media didnt exist and video games couldnt fit into your pocket are gone and never coming back.   Movies that are not experiences have a future much like Broadway shows or opera today, not extinct but a fairly niche market.
Movies are catching up to where theatre is.   Broadway musicals are often spectacles because the bring in the big money.   But a lot of people got into (movies/theatres) because they are artists, creatives, and passionate about holding a lens to the world.   Is anyone gonna claim the latest Marvel movie had a lot of artistic value, was really creative, or said something. No.   Generally these people don't actually like franchise films because it's their speciality so they tend to like more niche that is creative or expressive or classic stuff that's well made.   Honestly, movie literacy should be taught because I hate to say this some people's diets of movies is like if you only read children's books your whole life.
For some of us, it's just cringey af, and actually pretty disgusting. Cinema is art, and art is supposed to be (the actual definition of what art even is is an endless debate and I am not trying to go that deep here, I don't think it's necessary) provoking in SOME way. Ideally, art should move you, it should make you feel and/or think something; it should be, or aim to be, fresh, original, new, brave, daring. There's a WIDE range of ways a film can be all, or some, of those things (it's not like every film has to be "artsy" to accomplish this).  For people that don't care about theme parks at all, or that just don't look for THAT when they go watch a movie, but still enjoy "nerdy stuff", and still see value in pop culture, and can still appreciate, for example, a Spider-Man movie (when it's actually good), its alienating to see a character make a pause so a bunch of easily excitable people can applaude and scream their lungs out, while you are trying to immerse yourself in the world of the movie and trying to get into the characters, the story, etc (nothing kicks you out of the film and into the theater sit stronger than the story ACTUALLY STOPPING for people to lose their shit for 5 seconds).  I'm a filmmaker and a cinephile, but I'm also a Marvel fan since waaaaaay before the MCU. I went to every MCU premiere for more than a decade, and I had to stop doing that after Endgame, just so I can actually watch and listen to the movie. And, even after that, I find myself watching a more-rollercoaster-than-movie because, nowadays, almost EVERY MCU movie is made like that, with those pauses, meta-jokes, and the like. There are some exceptions, but lately it feels like the MCU has lost every ounce of sincerity and its all just a bunch of formulaic fanservice that feels like it was written by an algorithm instead of a creative artist. Long gone are the days of Iron Man, The Avengers, or Captain America: The Winter Soldier.
Movies are designed to entertain. There’s nothing wrong with it
God forbid movies be fun. It’s just Scorsese being salty that people aren’t enamored with Gangster movies anymore.
Because you aren’t allowed to have fun at the movies. Don’t you know that
Obviously there is nothing wrong with it.  In fact, one could criticize Scorsese that he is obsessed with criminals.  Is it wrong to make movies about criminals and criminality? No.  But you could criticize it.  Scorsese's complaint against Marvel was self-serving and self-congratulating. The only "good" movies happened to be the kind of movies he himself made.
People just mad something is popular 😆 As if they can’t just go out and support thier mid-budget “Real Cinema” films.
It doesn't have to be a bad thing, theme parks are fun and you can make the argument that there is a degree of art in making a good one. But he is also right like pretty much every movies is at least 80% similar to the other one and they've all become super formulaic to the point that people are starting to really notice their faults. Saying they are theme parks doesn't mean you can't like them. But as someone who does like them but also enjoys studying film I agree with his statement. They aren't really "films" just good stuff to watch if you can shut off ur brain
Scorcese is just an old fart envy of Marvel sucess
I think the studio builds up the story the premise and the roles.And if the add cameos of their character and reference something from the past it's not bad it's connected. Like the new Into the spiderverse trailer references the events of NWH that's something that was built up. That shows the story shares a lore.
I think it boils down to subtext and universality. Obviously there's a ton of subtext in "serious cinema". But if you think about it, there's just as much in a "theme park movie". Pick almost any scene at random from Endgame, for instance. It's "saying" a ton emotionally, and that's real, just in a different way.
Nothing. If we are being realistic, they are mostly what's keeping some of these movie theaters chains alive.
Fun Fact: Scorcese called Hitchcock movies the theme-park movies of his generation.
Just like the movie industry took a chunk out of theater, these kind of movies are taking a chunk out of the other genres of movies. However, theater is not dead. I don't believe the other genres will die either. There will be a place for them at the bigger cineplexes, and smaller, more traditional screens.  People want an experience, and if "theme park movies" are an experience, they will keep going. No reason not to cater to the viewers who like those kind of movies.
It's rooted in this armchair critic idea that There is a set list of parameters that movies have to follow in order to be objectively "good", and things like character development, nuance and complexity are somehow the be-all end all of good storytelling.  What martin said is basically the high brow version of saying "this movie Objectivley sucks because *Subjective criteria*"
There's nothing wrong per se. Like there's nothing in sitcoms for having audience/recorded laughs telling you went to laugh. It's a format. Sometimes is done well, some not.  A good product is a product. No Way Home is a good product, it doesn't depend on the fan factor. It's core is the character journey. The first suicide squad, not. Eternals, not.  Sometimes people tear apart a format because they don't fell included in it, or just doesn't represent them anymore. Like Disco music or hair metal fell from people's favor.
There is nothing wrong with them as long as that is what you are looking for. Some movies are theme parks while some are art museums. Some people like theme parks, some people like art museums, and a lot of people like both (although sometimes it depends on their day).  The problem is if a theme park is marketed as an art museum or an art museum as a theme park(either by the company itself or by fans). A lot of MCU movies are amazing theme parks (as one should expect from the company behind Disney World) but if you try to argue they are so good at being theme parks that they are an art museum then there are problems.   Scorsese is great at art museums so his opinions about them are valid, but why would the opinion of an art museum critic matter for a theme park?
Nothing wrong with it, I’d just like to see more variety, that’s all.
What's interesting is that it wasn't the first time Charlie Cox said that but for some reason this time it's getting traction.  I think that there's a right and wrong way to do everything. Some people say the moments that are held for the crowd reaction in No Way Home takes away from their rewatch experience at home, I personally haven't experienced that but I can't fault someone who does. Some movies are made and meant to be seen in theaters with crowds and some are more intimate experiences to watch in private, it's really a preference.  But there is a difference in doing things for the audience to react and pacing them for the audience reaction to be dwindling or over before things continue. I remember in earlier MCU movies people actually did come to comments online and ask what lines were said in certain parts that they couldn't hear because the crowd was so loud. The main one that comes to mind is Hulk calling Loki "Puny God." after smashing him in Avengers. Lots of people's theaters were still making too much noise and didn't hear this line at all.
These ‘legacy’ directors get upset because their boring shitty movies don’t make money and the blockbusters make hundreds of millions. Don’t read anymore into it.
The issue isn't that they put stuff in the movie that makes the audience react. The issue is that they take time out of the movie for the audience to react to it, like a laugh track in a sitcom. A good comedy director is not putting laugh tracks in their movies, or giving the audience a break to laugh, because they have other jokes that they want to tell. I've seen plenty of comedy movies where I didn't notice a joke until my 2nd or 3rd viewing because I was too busy laughing at a different one that came right before it. That's what gives those kinds of movies rewatch value.  Imo stopping the movie like that encourages people to act like idiots in the theater. When I saw NWH on opening night, people were throwing popcorn in the air when Andrew Garfield showed up. I don't think that kind of shit would happen if the movie just kept running.  On the other hand, if the audience isn't really into it, it can feel just as awkward as watching the movie at home by yourself. Thor L&T had a lot of pauses after its jokes, but the jokes weren't funny in the first place, so there were these short bursts of total silence where people were supposed to be laughing and nobody did.  Having Daredevil show up in NWH isn't what makes it feel weird to watch at home. It's the pauses
They are just being high class dicks looking down on low culture.
people are just not going to movie theaters like they used to anymore. and the old school film makers don't understand why their movies are not making the kind of money it used to.
Scorsese making The Irishman for Netflix is a bigger threat to “cinema” than Superhero movies that keeps the doors open.
There is no value judgement implied in “theme park movies.” I think it is most apt in the “on rails” experience of watching the average superhero movies in which the second unit directors give you a few setpieces, the writers’ room gives you the latest update on the characters’ lives, and you’re served up a few cameos with nicely timed applause breaks. You can describe a lot of types of movies as theme park rides. You can certainly say that jumpscares are an example of this, or cute references to other movies, even. I think for Scorsese, and also for myself, this means you engage with it for the experience of doing it and then you don’t really think about it afterward. I don’t think this is what Scorsese is interested in when it comes to film as a medium for conveying feeling, thought, and images.
oh my god are we still on this? there’s nothing wrong with it, i’m sure scorsese even said as much.
Martin Scorsese comes from the 1970s New Hollywood era, where film studios essentially let directors have free reign to do what they want and experiment. This was a movement in response to the studio filmmaking of the previous decades, which they saw as generic and formulaic, with studios making creative decisions and the director essentially a hired gun.  Scorsese, in his very essence, cannot abide the Marvel Studios model because it goes against the movement he helped to popularize. Directors are not the main creative visionaries of Marvel films. The studio is. And in his mind that means that the filmmakers are just employees churning out a product for a studio. And since the films are not a product of a singular creative vision, it’s not - in his mind - art. Or cinema, or whatever he calls it. It’s still a movie, and it’s still entertainment, but it’s just not anything that he is personally interested in.
Nothing at all. The part to me is the elitist talk about “turning your brain off” and other nonsense like that. These movies for the most part speak to a lot of people and have a lot of heart.   Some of my favorite movie moments are from the mcu, the audience reactions and pure fun and engagement you get from the story. People can’t stand other people loving something and try to discount it, that’s why I hate that saying.
Martin Scorsese is a 🤬
Nothing and everything. Its up to you decide, what you like or dont and what are the reason for it.   Martin does not like it, said his reasons. That is it.
There's absolutely nothing wrong with them. Hell, I don't even think Marty meant anything bad about it or that he was demeaning them.   I was honestly surprised at how much and how many Film Twitter people jumped at Marty's quote when what Coppola said was much, much worse.
That’s what’s I’ve been saying. We need all types of movies, he’s not making some profound point
That's coming from the guy who made The Irishman, shit was nightmare fuel. They looked so bizarre in that movie
I would say theater releases should include these moments like you described. Give the audience a second to react. But then when the movies go to streaming/dvd releases, have a second scene filmed where the “pause” is removed.
You know, to me, marvel movies broke and reinvented the action movie formula. I’m so grateful for it.   Fun but unpredictable comic book movies families can watch together. Heroes don’t always need love interests, plots don’t always need romantic subplots. Huge scope. No more sequel 2, sequel 3, sequel 4 - and an enormous universe linked together with small and large references.   Winter soldier deftly threaded that needle between camp and believability and excitement. It’s one of the most rewatchable movies out there.   And it broke out of so many safe standards for action movies, but still leveraged the best aspects of them.
While I agree with the sentiment and overall perspective I kind of think the ball has been in Hollywood’s court for a while. They couldn’t seem to do anything other than remake or reboot various popular movies from back in the day until indies kind of took over in the last decade.   I understand trends and that getting overwhelming, but it’s up to Hollywood to make things interesting (like Marvel did over a decade ago with the MCU. Still averages well and is in the top 10 most successful franchises of all time) instead of lobbying for a few films to get Oscar’s.
Glad this is the most popular comment. A "Scorsese bad" post with a positive number of upvotes had me worried. People are making these statements and criticisms for a reason and it isn't just because they hate the billion-dollar underdog Marvel Studios. People need to stop being so defensive and accept that these movies have room for improvement.
I completely get why they don’t like the marvel movies, even if I disagree. I just think it’s comical that they think comic book movies going away will lead to a magical renaissance of “true cinema.”  If comic book movies went away tomorrow, something else trendy and crowd pleasing will take its place and the same people will complain about the same things but with a different target of their anger
I grew up on the films you listed, and I love marvel films. I leave the cinema thoroughly entertained, and know full well to wait for the little clip during the credits. I love a cameo! What’s wrong with giving people what they like?    When I want a high brow film, I watch one. I even watch foreign language films in their original language! When I want to relax and enjoy myself, I watch Marvel, or something similar. Haters gonna hate 🤷‍♀️
One could argue that before movies had creativity because low budget movies can get a return on VHS sales.   I think those days may come back as long as people start going to the movie theaters again.  There’s also mini-major studios like Lionsgate that can focus on other things.  Miramax used to do different projects as well  Disney still creates new IP while also capitalizing on the old. It’s business but it helps hedge risk. They can profit on some to take risks on others.  ——-  Universal Studios - Fast / Jurassic Park / DreamWorks / Illumination  Warner Bros. - Harry Potter / DC / Looney Tunes  Disney - Star Wars / Marvel / Pixar / Disney / Avatar / Pirates  Paramount - Transformers / Top Gun / Nickelodeon  Sony Columbia - Spider-Man / Ghostbusters / Men In Black / Jumanji   It’s more than a movie. It’s a media franchise. It’s IP.  Toys. Merchandising. Theme Parks. Partnerships. Shows. Video Games. Books.   Movies are more than box office revenue  ————  Then you also have:   Bad Robot - Mission Impossible   Eon - James Bond  MGM - Rocky
They weren’t all the same as each other though, taking place in the same universe.    I’ve loved Superhero films since I saw Christopher Reeve as Superman when I was about 7, but even I am sad to see that there is so little choice and variety in cinemas these days.  I’m disproportionately excited when I get to see a good non-Marvel non-superhero move on a big screen.
I think you're right. The fact that people don't whine this much about other movies having big moments designed specifically for the theatrical experience is evidence that they're only complaining *because* it's Marvel.  I didn't hear a single person complain about "guns...lots of guns", yet people on Twitter are currently losing their minds over "I'm something of a scientist myself."
Yep. That's all. That's the only engagement that anyone here should have with the topic, they just hate popular things. Literally the _only_ reason. Let's not think about it any further. They just hate fun. That's the only reason for any of the common criticisms that _many_ people have of the MCU.
>extremely ambitious with a high risk of failure. Endgame was a huge huge gamble  Lol how?  >some art doesn’t aim high enough.  I refuse to believe Michael bay's transformers movie had any aim to begin with. Throwing what ever gets into your hand and looking for what sticks isn't aiming high. Some movies simply lack a creative vision of any sorts and that's simply the truth
>	Endgame was a huge huge gamble.   Uh, what?   It was the second part of a movie that ended on a cliffhanger. Infinity War grossed $2 billion worldwide. I don’t see how there is any way Endgame was a “gamble”  Robert Downey Jr being cast as Iron Man, THAT was a gamble. The Avengers movie working as a concept at all, that was a gamble.   The sequel to one of the biggest movies of all time, I wouldn’t call that a gamble…
And we all know, only Marvel movies have cameos.
It’s not an insult but it is what it is. I rather have more Dark Knight Trilogy or Raimi Spider-Man than cookie cutter mcu.
>Marvel movies are fucking huge. They make up a huge chunk of yearly box office percentage. You already won. Please cut out this stupid, “every makes fun of us” shit, you are not the underdog here. Scorcese is not bullying a multi billionaire dollar series.  Seriously, this is looking like a fetish at this point. How the heck are you part of a fandom of one of the richiest companies in existence, the biggest movie machine ever and somehow you're dragging year old comments trying to play the underdog
It hasn't though, and I don't think it ever will.
Not really. At most it's a popular style for a particular type of movie intended for cinema viewing.
I mean, when you have films like The Whale being nominated at the Academy Awards, I very much doubt "theme park films" have become the default or the only popular stuff.
People have to understand that most people in the film industry have spent years deconstructing and analyzing classics, film theory, etc. and come to a consensus on what makes a movie ‘good’. When things stray from that, they’ll feel a sort of defensiveness or take it personally almost. What Marvel is doing is very consumerist, which is relatively modern. And film buffs don’t like that because they feel like it detracts from the ‘art’, which is ironic because as you said art is very subjective
A24 is doing amazing and even before they were huge, we had something like Blumhouse that made good, artistic, and  consumerist movies.
The window to see non-superhero movies in cinemas is getting really small though, some are only on for a week, and on small screens at inconvenient times to make room for the blockbusters that guarantee sales.
Scorsese's definition of cinema seems to be movies which pushes the boundaries of art and strive to do things beyond the imagination of the audience. It's something which unravels the complexity and paradoxical nature of the characters and the world  Do you agree that Marvel movies fit this bill?  Rather you probably have a different definition of cinema which correlates more with the term theme park
Some are and some aren't.  Some movies are specifically made without the explicit purpose of being entertainment, but to make commentary on society or to be philosophical.  Various movies are made for different reasons.  Art vs leisure.  Going into a movie, expecting art, when it was never intended that way, OR vise versa is a sure way to disappoint yourself.  "I just wanted to be entertained, but all the characters did was drink wine for 2 hours.  It was so boring."  Marvel movies will never be Gone With The Wind, and it's absurd to expect they will.
>Scorsese being salty that people aren’t enamored with Gangster movies anymore.  I beg of you - watch more movies.
>In fact, one could criticize Scorsese that he is obsessed with criminals.  >Is it wrong to make movies about criminals and criminality? No.  >But you could criticize it.  What's with that strawman bruh. What point were you aiming to prove with that
You don't watch many movies, do you?
No he isn’t. He answered a reporters question in 2019 and you people just won’t drop it
Happy Cakeday!
Do you think the MCU will improve in the future? I mean, Marvel Studios is planning on slowing down the output of their projects going forward.
Most of them I don't think would want these movies to go away. They just want something else to watch.
So I just checked my local theaters and 1 is showing John Wick, Shazam 2, DnD, Mario Brothers, Scream 6, Air, and Creed 3.  Another is showing all those and also Ant Man, One Good Person, and A Thousand and one.  So the issue is if you aren't into the franchise-y, roller coaster-y movies, your options are super limited. I think it's reached a point where the haters are kinda right to hate. Non-fans are getting a really short straw
Its the same thing with superhero fatigue. You never hear about Sports fatigue. Singing competition fatigue. True crimes/serial killer fatigue. Cartel/drug runner fatigue. Cowboy/rancher fatigue. Fantasy fatigue. Desperate Housewife fatigue. Gameshow fatigue. Slasher fatigue. Highschool drama fatigue. Gangster fatigue. All these genres are way over saturated as well but no one ever complains about those like they do with superheroes.  But when it comes to Marvel specifically, whether you asked or not, they will bitch non stop, as if it’s become part of their personality to hate on it.
Guns..lots of guns.. bruh there's nothing to tease about that since John Wick is an action movie and they actually use those set pieces and 'guns' very creatively to make fantastic action scenes. Tell me what creativity is involved in repeating a line from an older beloved movie? It's just another thing to point and cheer at.   The point is these movies could be a lot more. Sure the odd moment of having cameos and references is cool but are they being creative? Do they have soul and heart? Are they doing something new? Phase 4 was said to be experimental but most of their projects end up revolving into generic and mediocre content.
Not a commercial gamble by any stretch of the imagination, but arguably a creative gamble.
Did I say that?
This sub's /r/DC_Cinematic arc has been painful to watch
It has. There’s no shame in admitting that.
Winning Oscar has nothing to do with popularity tho....  >theme park films" have become the default or the only popular stuff.  They have in the sense that a non "theme park" movie has no way of hitting big in the boxoffice
Unless people feel like they'll be missing something by not watching it on the big screen, most people will just wait for it to be available on streaming.
My definition is more in line with RDJ's: ["It plays in theaters."](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkxjeoo66i2uIcnV6Iflp3ii8MpkLygB_FC), & ["It's like saying Howard Stern isn't radio; it makes no sense to say it."](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkx8I1EFumMBLjWGf4qaO6taLP-thNFcnfP)   It's a *medium*. You don't get to say something isn't part of the *medium* just because you don't like the stories or themes or execution. If Scorcese had said the MCU was "*bad* cinema", I'd still disagree but it wouldn't have upset me the way the gatekeeping, no-true-scotsman-ish claim of "*not* cinema" does.  And the director of Casino (or as I like to call it, Goodfellas Again But Not As Good) doesn't really get to say films *must* push boundaries every time to qualify as films.
Gone with the Wind is…not what I would consider a philosophical or complex film - in fact it essentially was the Avengers of its era: the American South was a bigoted, authoritarian region with a large moviegoing audience, not unlike modern China
I watch plenty, it’s just easy to not be pretentious about it.
Ah, you must be one of those people who tell people "read another book" when they mention they like Harry Potter. You know, people can actually like a thing, dislike another thing, and still like or dislike a lot of other things! However, since this conversation is about the MCU and Scorcese's comments on it, the person you replied to might not feel it relevant to bring up whatever other films they enjoy; only those related to the topic at hand.
That Scorsese only makes movie about criminals, which isn’t true a quick google search would figure that much out
I think the bigger issue is that "non-franchise-y roller coaster-y" fans as you put it are sometimes lazy and complain.  Scorsese has made some great films, but I'm sure in a few years he will come out with yet another crime/mob/gangster film with Dicarpio or De niro. (it's not bad since both actors are amazing talents, but come on lol).  There's TONS of festival films or independent movies that don't get wide distribution, but can still be accessed.  They'd just rather travel to the nearest AMC and then complain.  I just checked the theater I go to and there are more films I haven't even heard of being shown than what you listed as well
Theatres are going to show what makes them money. It’s a business, not a right. We can all watch whatever we want whenever we want these days - it seems such a petty thing to criticise a particular type of film just because its popular but not to your own taste.
Options are limited because people don't go see those other movies.  I live in one of the biggest cities in America and non-franchisey, non roller coastery  movies are empty.  I just left Paint and the only people in the theater were me and the person I saw it with.  It's like that every time,  unless it's a huge IP.
You don’t hear about singing competition fatigue?
At some point, people have to recognise that fun popcorn movies can be a lot better than we're getting. Top Gun 2 was a Best Picture nominee for a reason!  And yeah, experimental just meant "Iron Man isn't in this one" most of the time.
I’ll have to disagree on that entirely too.   Endgame was gonna be a sure fire hit. Whether or not it was gonna be “good” from a creative standpoint, that’s what every movie ever made wonders before it’s released. Point being, Endgame wasn’t a huge gamble creatively or financially. Theres a reason they ended Infinity War on a cliffhanger. It all but guaranteed the financial success of Endgame  I struggle to think what the creative gamble they took for Endgame was. What about that movie was the gamble?
No it hasn’t. Maybe for big tentpole action movies it has, and of course those are the ones that usually make the most money. But there are many films being made that don’t fit into that category.
It's always been that way.  I don't know why people are complaining about it now.  There is **not** a 1:1 relationship between the Top100 of all time chosen by critics and filmmakers, and the Top100 grossing of all time.  There just isn't.  Yes, there is some overlap, but, for example, adjusted for inflation, Gone With The Wind is the highest-grossing film ever, and in the T10 of "Best" movies, but Avatar is #2 for grossing, and not even in the T100, same with the Ten Commandments...high gross, but not critically acclaimed.  Dr. Zhivago is #9 in the adjusted for inflation growing list, but #48 in the Top100 list.   There is the objectiveness of what film critics call good, and the subjectiveness of things people enjoy and those will never be 100% the same thing.  There are, and will always be, (objectively) great movies that don't make money, and "lesser" (subjective) quality movies that make a ton of cash.  **This isn't a new phenomenon, and I don't understand why people are pretending it is.**  Personally, when I go to see or turn on a movie, I am fully aware if I'm going to be expecting objective good, or subjective good content.  I don't go to Marvel, or John Wick for that matter, movies expecting the quality of story of Shawshank or The Godfather, just the same as I don't open a random X-Men monthly expecting to read something like Ulysses or A Tale of Two Cities.  It's absurd and foolish, in my opinion, to expect otherwise.  They're made for different reasons.
But that’s the point, lots of us really value the big screen experience!
>films *must* push boundaries every time to qualify as films.  Is that what he said? Because it seems like a misinterpreted or misquoted bit from you there when what he actually said was that they're movies but not *cinema*, a higher and more specific subset of films.
Gone With The Wind is considered by the American Film Institute to be the #4 greatest movie of all time.  **(EDIT:) Their list is not based on revenue, but on the art of the film.**  That's not my judgment.  It's the judgment of film experts.  Nothing from the MCU is even in the T100, which is exactly the point I'm making that you are completely ignoring.  I repeat: Marvel movies will never be Gone With The Wind, and it's absurd to expect they will.
Oh yeah, but have you seen the original Nosferatu? No? Are you even a REAL movie watcher? /s
You haven’t watched enough to know that Scorcese makes more than gangster flicks.  Motherfuckers can’t be satisfied with comic book movies having taken over the whole medium, you also have to get butthurt about not everyone also being in love with this plastic bullshit, all while making a spectacle out of your own goddamned ignorance.
Access to those independent movie theaters varies widely, and not everyone has the ability to drive a half hour (not including the time it takes to find parking) to watch something else. It's not lazy to want to be able to easily access a movie that you're interested in while it's in theaters.  Honestly yall are just coming off as sore winners. Congrats, theaters are now catering exclusively to you, let's not spit on the people who don't benefit from this
> Scorsese has made some great films, but I'm sure in a few years he will come out with yet another crime/mob/gangster film with Dicarpio or De niro. (it's not bad since both actors are amazing talents, but come on lol).  Do you know what films he makes? People love to say he "just makes gangster films" when he's only made two in the past twenty years. Insane.   I'm sorry, but we have absolutely no leg to stand on if we want to criticise his movies for being same-y. There's a reason Scorsese flicks are more appreciated than the MCU by basically every metric other than box office.  Frankly, if people are annoyed that their local theatres don't show most of the critically acclaimed movies on their radar, that's fair enough!
Scorcese has Killers of the Moon Flower coming out in October, it’s true crime and it stars DiCaprio.  It’s runtime is also as long as Engame, reportedly.
I mean people criticize things they don't like all the time, just start a thread about any phase 4 film in this sub, it's not really petty. I think the reason critics are so vocal is because of the increasing lack of alternatives
Don't you think the relentless pursuit of profit is a shame?
I think OP is a teen or something. In the early 2000s, there were like 3-4 singing comp TV shows because of American Idol.
>But there are many films being made that don’t fit into that category.  They are being made and they are suffering in the boxoffice. Look at Babylon, a movie from an Oscar winning director which received mostly positive reception but still ended up bombing.   Creative movies are more prone to failure regardless of how good they might be. Which is killing the market more and more. Movies are certainly being made at the same time an environment is being created which discourages creators from making those kind of movies  There is a reason why most movies like this are made with small budget because no one expects them to do well in the box office. For example everything everywhere all at once was made with 25 million budget and the whale with 3 million budget. Producers would rather blow up their 200 million budgets on cheap factory produced "theme park" movies like quantumania and transformers
But the thing is, John Wick still offers top of the world choreography and stunts. I would say that most movies offer much more than "fun".  Marvel movies rarely offer more than a couple hours to watch a comprehensible, decently structured and paced story with ever worsening special effects that pay lip service to much deeper issues while being safe enough to be inoffensive to everyone but the most bigoted idiots.
>There is not a 1:1 relationship between the Top100  This feels like an absolute straw man, there's no way that is something realistically possible and has no reason why that makes a difference   My points correlates more with the fact that creative movies were more likely to achieve a success in boxoffice in the past as compared to now. (Not the 1:1 bullshit). Movies like godfather and Schindler's list would bomb hard at box office if they were released now. The current market isn't welcoming to those kind of movies at all  >Ten Commandments  Idk which critic top 100 list you are using for your criteria but ten commandments is generally favoured by the critics for it's story telling. It never garnered any criticism from critic excluding concerning some inaccuracies to biblical texts
My phrasing intentionally sacrificed precision there for a cheeky jab ("films [...] to qualify as films"), but the point stands: Casino isn't "cinema" by No_Wrangler312's definition (which *wasn't* actually Scorcese's implied definition when the original interview happened, but I didn't want to argue that point since I didn't agree with that either).  I don't believe in "higher/lower" forms of art.      I have seen probably *every* style or genre of film/music/writing/comedy/etc described as the "lowest form" at some point or another. There's people in this very comment section implying Scorcese's gangster films are the "lowest form" of cinema; granted, those people have no freaking clue what they're talking about, but that's part of my point.      The concept has lost all meaning to me except as a means of looking down one's nose at others.
Considering that the AFI only includes 2 animated films on that same list; I don’t really care much for their judgement. I have family who are AFI members - and for brevity’s sake I’ll just say that I dislike their metrics for judging cinema, especially their process for giving a Lifetime Achievement Award.
Okay, but Nosferatu is great.  If you *haven't* seen it, you ought to.
Man, you seem to be really angry just because the other person said they don't like Scorcese's movies.
The closest theater to me is a half hour away, and if I wanted to see anything obscure it’s more like driving 2 hours away! Most theaters are closer to an hour away!
There is absolutely no lack of alternatives, there are a ton of movies released all the time on streaming services; many, many more overall than in the past. And in the “good old days” of making movies of substance, which in your example is around the year 2000, people were complaining because things like Star Wars prequels, Jurassic Park sequels, rehashed TV show movies like Mission Impossible, and disaster movies like Armageddon were all that were being made instead of like when they were growing up and you had The Godfather, Apocalypse Now, Taxi Driver, The Sting, Rocky, etc. Nothing about this ever changes, and in 25 more years people will complain about how movies aren’t like how they used to be when EEAAO, Get Out, Parasite, and Nomadland came out.
These are companies trying to make money. If they don’t make money, they cut jobs. Such is the way of the world we live in. The film industry, including cinemas, are part of the entertainment industry. It’s not a state funded necessity. Some countries can’t even find necessities such as ambulances and medical care!    There will always be non mainstream films made, and they will always be available. You just need to know where to look for them if you want to see them in an actual cinema. I live in the UK and I know where to go to see ‘alternative’ films and foreign language films. If you care so much about it then you need to do the same, and support them with your patronage. It’s the exact same principle as buying your meat in a supermarket versus a local butcher’s shop.
Babylon absolutely did not have "mostly positive reception"  Agree with you about the rest.
You know, I made that comment to add to what you said, not to refute it, and yes, nobody has made the argument that there's a 1:1 relationship there, but some of the comments I see, I can't help but think that's actually what they're arguing that they expect.   I said that as a premise to the rest of my rant, but it wasn't the point itself. My main point is that S-tier filmmaking and the MCU will never be the same thing, despite what some people seem to expect from the MCU. If a person's expectations are that high, yeah, they're going to be disappointed a lot.  Edit: and I used the imdb greatest of all time list which was based on awards and critics, not imdb ratings. I double checked and 10 commandments isn't on that specific 100 list.
Yeah, I prefer it over the Bela Lugosi version. Not really scary but it is excellently creepy.
Scorcese and DeNiro were amazing in Shark Tale.
The movies released on streaming services are still catching up in quality to theatrical releases. A lot of them still seem to have this sterile generic genre flick feel to them, but aside from that, [people want to go out to see movies.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/12cp5uw/most_moviegoers_will_still_go_to_theaters_even_if/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) It's petty to say, "don't like these franchise films? Stay home then, fuck your date night"  There were people who complained that everything being released was either a sequel or reboot, but they were right then too. On that front it's only getting worse, it's not like people nowadays are saying, "thank God for all these sequels, live action remakes, and reboots", but now on top of that they have these theme park films taking up the most space where other, more risky movies would have gone.
You’re right, people aren’t saying “thank god”, which was my point. No matter what, people are going to bitch, even though nothing has really changed. They bitched then, they bitch now, they’ll bitch in the future. Movies of all kinds will still get made, people will still go on dates to see them, and popular but bad movies will be forgotten, leaving a rose-colored view of the entertainment of the past for a new generation of young people to carry as their burden.
I would say that people continue to bitch **because** nothing has changed. It's cynical to say that people are going to bitch no matter what so who cares?  If Marvel movies just completely stopped getting made or stopped releasing in theaters and were solely D+ exclusives, people here would absolutely bitch, it's selfish to discount their opinions because their taste is different than yours.
The only opinion I’ve expressed is that people have always and will always complain because “dumb” movies take up too much of the cinematic landscape. The people who are the most invested in anything, by definition, are not the majority of people who care about that thing. Put another way, the 10% of people who care the most about whether movies have a high level of substance in them CANNOT BE the middle 50% of moviegoers, many of whom just want to watch something funny or entertaining. It’s a bell curve of participation, as with any hobby or interest. People usually think they represent the average person regarding the things they are passionate about, but they price themselves out of being average the minute they start going beyond what the average person would.
Those DnA era outfits are great, I'm glad I got to see them in the big screen.
Cosmo missing?   We have barely seen Adam in these promos.
Rocket is so dead...
I love these suits so much.
Something tells me Adam is either barely in it, or they're just trying not to reveal too much of him and keeping most of his story a surprise.
Wow what an awesome plot! I love the idea of the first movie in this second trilogy to be totally action packed and have spidey start off as way more cynical after having lost so much. Great idea 👏🏻
Thank you very much buddy, and yes I really wanted to make a story totally different from everyone else. Almost everyone were saying how the first movie would be really nuanced and would have kraven and venom, and hence I was keen on writing something different, if something like this is made it would be as big as NWH.
Totally agree it would be a huge hit especially because if it’s lack of ties to the MCU. When the MCU is making every movie tie together, the lay people want an action packed movie they can follow with a good plot and great action scenes. Getting back to the basics. This is it.
exactly my thoughts. but I don't know why but it seems like some people really didn't like my story, they are just downvoting it without giving a proper explaination![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)
Yeah I don’t know - it’s a great plot idea and clearly took a while to think/write up. Keep up the good work and don’t let the haters stop you 😤
Man, I love how you made it look worn and weathered. Like Daredevil has really “seen” some shit.
Looks cool
I wonder how often a movie star gets handed something like this and they flip it over and see if it looks more comfortable to wear than the version they use.  Also wondering if a prop master is handed back a helmet by an actor who says “I signed three helmets last week with more cushioning and one with an air conditioned vent. Get to work”
I'm not sure if Mr. Cox knows what the word "Charlie" looks like
Holy cow. That is mental. Love it.
1st place
Thats dope dude
I love the how old and used it looks, tells a story by itself
Can you actually see through the lenses?
but how did he see the helmet to sign it????
What printer do you have?
Amazing!
Freakin great! So well done
The paintwork is just lit🔥
This looks amazing. Do you sell any of them?
Careful I might rob you 😂 so cool
Sick. Are there stl files?
Awesome design. Sweet! Congratulations!!  Charlie is a very cool gent 😎
Sick!! How did you go about weathering it?
That’s very sick! Wow
that's rad
Charlie cocks
This looks so cool! What did you use for the eye lenses?
this is soo cooool 🤩
I think I need a 3D printer...
Now this is how you get females
Now this is quality content.
Lol nice, and I had to! Looked too enticing not to.
That’s really on the nose there lol
Thanks!
Lmfao. Not sure how often it happens but I always make my props wearable with padding and breathability. And not to toot my own horn, but I take a ton of time in my finishing process to make this as accurate and perfectly finished as possible, I’d be curious to compare mine to IronHead Studios or any other movie prop maker. He definitely loved the finish on this though, I plan on making a custom one for him when I see him again at GalaxyCon Raleigh.
It’s “C T Cox”. Charlie Thomas.
...I mean he's blind...
😂😂
You try writing the same word a thousand times in an hour and tell me what it looks like lol
Thanks!
Lol, thanks!
This thing’s been in a lot of competitions.
Thanks!
Thanks so much! I love it as well, adds a con of character without having to say a word.
Yup! They’re super easy to see through, just makes everything red.
Looks like they're transluscent in pic #4
He came to GalaxyCon Richmond and I waited in line for 3.5 hours lol.
Creality Ender 3 Pro, Creality CR10S Pro, and Sovol SV03
Thanks!
Thanks!
Thanks so much!
Thanks! I don’t currently but I’d definitely be down to in the future.
Until you see me pop out of the shadows wearing it 😂😂
Yup! You can get it [here](https://www.do3d.com/product-page/daredevil-she-hulk-helmet-she-hulk-version-3d-printable-model-stl-file-sh38)
Thanks so much! He’s very cool 😎
Thanks! Silver rub n buff, followed by acrylic black wash to darken it up a bit!
Thanks!
Thanks!
Yes 🗿
Thanks! Just basic red plastic sheets that I cut to shape and installed with hot glue. I got mine [here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073XJMS39?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share)
Thanks!
Indeed you do…
Exactly 🗿
Thanks!
Yep, it’s worn and weathered on the nose too.
What was he like?
His name is almost a "ligma" joke.
Considering that it’s a pretty damn good signature
Lol
I always wanted to see a stop frame animation of every single autograph signed in order over the course of a convention. Set to Philip Glass, probably.
>!it was a blind joke lol!<
You're welcome 😊
Good to know!!
I didn’t realize it was signed. Holy crap. That’s fuckin awesome
Sweet! I'm planning on making a similar one for a Daredevil Elektra cosplay I'm going to start on soonish.
He was super friendly and really down to earth. Spent his time talking with people and seemed genuinely interested, but didn’t take too much time. My girlfriend and other friend went to take a pic with him (I didn’t go cuz I was Green Arrow and they were DD and Punisher), and when they got to him, he asked where I was, asked what my name was, and told them to “Tell Jared I say hi and I hope he has a great weekend.” He’s just awesome.
My brain is officially fried from work, well played sir/ma’am 🙌
And Charlie is even cooler!!
Good luck!
so cool
A fourth wall break inside a fourth wall break? That's like, sixteen walls!
I love how excited and enthusiastic Karen Gillan is. She just seems to want to enjoy every moment and it's so nice to see. She is one of the many things I love about Scotland.
Did you repost a photo that the actual owner of it posted yesterday,  just to karma farm? Lololol.
I buddy of mine did something similar. One year he got a picture of himself with Kevin Smith, the following year He had Kevin Sign it, and he gave him a copy that HE signed for Kevin.   They both had a good laugh, and Kevin said jokingly "I'll cherish this forever."
Nebula looking thick
I love Karen, honestly I think she's such a funny actress and she seems always down to earth
She is amazing
Lucky Bastards, they not only meet Nebula once, but TWICE!
Gillanception
Who’s on the left?
wow Karen looks so much healthier and happier now.  Its digusting how hollywood forces so many women to unrealistic body standards.
Anytime I see Karen Gillan I remember [this interaction](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/12ej35f/the_new_nebula_looks_more_of_a_human_than_her/jfbnxjk?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3)
She is so attractive.
It’s been like 7 years and I still haven’t figured out how that math checks out
Wouldn’t be more like 2/4? Since 1/4 + 1/4 would be 2/4?
I'm hoping I get to meet her one day.
After a 2 minute look at their profile the answer is yes that is all They do is repost pictures to Karma farm
I believe she is pregnant.
Thick not meaning bad . I didn't say fat 😭
This is so unnecessary. Nobody should be commenting on someone else’s body.
Working out often, being fit and being a healthy weight are pretty important. Hollywood pushes it too far, no doubt, but striving for a better level of fitness isn’t a bad thing. Also, she’s most likely pregnant
> So if we were to break the 4th wall, we are essentially talking about the defect of the scene to the audience, thus breaking the 16th wall is talking about the defects of the talking about defects of the scene, implying that the first narration was in fact lacking and “breakage” wasn't entirely broken.
It's a deadpool reference bud
Also if you didn't know, the "fourth" in fourth wall isn't a fraction, it's the "wall" between the audience and movie/show/play etc
There's entire subs dedicated to people competitively karma farming. It's so bizarre.
She's not made any official confirmation on her Instagram of that if so, but it's of course generally the norm not to make it public until the 12-week scan.
Don’t worry. I perfectly understand you
Its crazy and a sign of how skewed perceptions of women's bodies are that a slim woman with a thigh gap can be called 'thick'.
You are commenting on people commenting on someone else's body.
Hollywood doesn't care if its women are fit or healthy, just that they are thin.  Many film actresses are actually unhealthily thin and at risk of long term damage to their bones and fertility.
healthy weight doesnt require working out, healthy weight is peoples normal weight.  People can do fitness if they want to, but it has nothing to do with weight and body types.
Ah I see, I did not know
Yes I was making a lame joke lol
Ooo. I’ll repost this tomorrow.
She's way past that if it's a pregnancy and not good old fat.
I was like 5 down votes and I didn't even say anything worth worth it 😂
People use thicc as a compliment though
To be faiiiiiirrrrr, there are a lot of levels on the body mass scale 😂
She looks fat on this photo though.
Exercise is 100% essential to being healthy in both body and mind
Working out is crucially important for vascular and respiratory health among many other things. What are you talking about?
What is a persons normal weight? Human beings are designed to exercise, be active and not eat processed food and sugar.
lol WHAT
https://youtu.be/fU3Vn3xI-kA
Uh, you ever been around a pregnant woman for the duration? 12 weeks is generally not that big, and probably not "oh she's pregnant" looking yet, just a bit rounder all over and bigger boobs.
It’s cause you spelled thick wrong, it’s thicc when used in this context
Its still crazy that its being used about a thin woman.
Oh get lost with that.
She absolutely does not
Yeah, twice, up close. Got two dumb teenagers out of it too.  It was a long time ago but  I remember by the time you tell people it doesn't show at all.  Anyway who cares.
Its possible to be thick and thicc though, some guys like that type
34 yr old white guy here lol
I mean she does look a bit wider in this photo
in the spiderverse movie thats coming out, Tom can make an appearance there and we can have our own multi/spiderverse movie coincide with Kang dynasty or secret wars.
I like a lot of the ideas here but you kinda introduced 9 villains in the first two paragraphs, I'd stick with 1 or 2, maybe with a minor third for the next movie
well sony is already giving us an amazing and fun experience with the spiderverse but I want the live action ones to be more serious and grounded
you know something buddy, these were my exact thoughts after I read the story again, "Damn I just have 10 villains in my story'. Maybe you are right,it does feel early for an S6.The story would work fine with just scorpion, chameleon and cat. Maybe rhino as a side villain.
Yeah that would work fine
I think the reason we’ll never see Carnage is because it requires you doing Venom well first.  We’ve had two attempts at Venom (Spider-man 3, and the Venom movie series) and both have been awful. Obviously there’s the post credits scene for NWH which suggests Marvel might be giving Venom a shot of their own, but we’ll see how/if that happens.  So, assuming they do Venom and it isn’t terrible like the other two attempts, you’ve got Carnage next. Now, the general audience can’t tell the difference. So if you do a Spider-man movie with Venom as the villain, and then later do a Spider-man movie with Carnage as the villain, most people are going to see the trailers and think it’s just Venom again. So it’s probably not going to excite the audience to see them just redoing the same villain again (I know that’s the whole basis of NWH, but that was bolstered by nostalgia).   Then of course there are loads of different Spider-man villains to use. I doubt Marvel wants to use a symbiote villain twice.   So you have to do Venom well first, then you have to get past the fact that the general audience can’t differentiate between Venom and Carnage, and then you have to avoid two movies about symbiote villains in the same movie series becoming stale.  Carnage is just a very tricky villain to do. He’s easy in a comic book or an animated series, because those are so numerous. But we’ve yet to have a Spider-man film series that has extended beyond three films, so you have to be very careful about which villain you choose.
If Carnage is going to be introduced in the mcu then we could have Jackie Earle Haley portray as Cletus Kassidy / Carnage
\**The photo in the post was a fun little edit made by me in Photoshop*  Soo, we've just recently seen a version of Carnage in live-action and despite not being in the MCU, the concept multiverse saga has made it possible for different versions of characters to seamlessly crossover. Though, considering the overall lackluster reception to that version of Carnage, it makes me think that him returning in a movie like Secret Wars or Kang Dynasty wouldn't really have any long lasting impact.  I also don't really see where he could fit in what people are already predicting to be a huuge multiverse crossover movie filled with various characters from different cinematic universes. Having Woody Harrelson's Carnage cameo just as one of Kang's goons and briefly fighting Spider-Man before Spidey takes him down wouldn't really be the proper "faceoff" that many of us wanted. I'd rather they spend more time properly serving and honoring the legacy characters that people better resonate with and are very much beloved in the history of "Marvel Cinema".  Which leaves the option of introducing a new version of Carnage that originates in the MCU. Even though we've had the symbiote tease at the end of No Way Home, I can't really see them wrapping up that story with a Carnage arc. We'll probably get Peter in the symbiote suit and maybe even Venom, but there's also many different directions they can go with that story that hasn't already been done in the movies; the origins of how the symbiote arrived to peter's earth has already been shown to be different and there's so many different popular venom hosts that they can go with (Mac Gargan, Flash, Harry like from what we've seen from the games). To tell a Carnage story that revolves around Peter and isn't already derivative of what was done in the Venom movies with Carnage’s origins or even just the entire novelty/concept of having multiple symbiotes, is a rather tough task.. especially since we're not sure if we’ll even get venom and if we did, would there be any room in Tom Holland’s next Spider-Man trilogy to retell an entire Carnage story on top of that (who knows if that third trilogy will happen as rumored), since they may be doing Fisk first, maybe Michael Mando's Scorpion, as well as having a whole list of villains from Spider-Man's rogues gallery that haven't even gotten a single peak at getting a live-action rendition and that would fit perfectly with the street-level tales that they're aspiring to tell.. that is until Sony inevitably turns them into a hero and gives them a solo movie.  I do really hope I'm wrong though, as Carnage is one of the most popular Spider-Man Villains to really stand on their own and I've wanted to see Spidey fight Carnage in live-action since the peak of Raimi trilogy. I would love to see Tom Holland's Peter Parker getting broken down and reaching his limits from having to deal with the viciousness, chaotic nature and murderous tendencies of Carnage/Cletus Kassidy... maybe even reluctantly have to team up with whoever becomes Venom in the MCU. If that isn't possible, maybe I'd settle with a Tobey Maguire Spider-Man movie where he fights an offspring of Venom that secretly spawned many years after his encounter with Brock.
Yeah carnage is too R-rated for disney to make it right, I mean we all saw PG-13 carnage and somehoe he turns in crash bandicoot.  Also there is legal problem out there with sony still have his rights.  Carnage is my favorite character in marvel universe and this condition really make me sad, I'm just glad he at least got some screen time in venom franchise even though the movie itself is bad.  Beggars can't be choosers I guess.
Do like the end of the 90s cartoon. Holland's Spidey, Maguire, Garfield, Tom Hardy's Venom, and maybe the Shameik Moore Miles have to stop Spider-Carnage.
Are you Avi Arad?
 I don’t want to see venom at all. One of the major problems with a lot of MCU movies is their use of a villain that is basically just the bad version of the hero. It’s old and boring.
I think the venom/carnage saga (and Spider-Man stories in general) would be a million times better as a Disney plus series.  This gives us more of an opportunity to develop his rogues gallery and supporting cast.  It also lets us flesh out his world much more without relying on shitty Sony movies ruining his corner of the MCU.  One season of venom, with various side villains like tombstone and scorpion etc. the second season focusing on maximum carnage and him creating his own villain team.  This allows him us to see his relationship with black cat and forming an alliance with venom.  And it wouldn’t be rushed and crammed into one movie.
If it ever happens, it will be a Venom/Spidey team up against him
For Venom we still haven’t seen who the main universe’s Eddie Brock is yet, there’s potential for the college trilogy  Carnage idk yet, I really wanna see Venom work lol
I honestly hope they do Mac Gargan Venom. Have him be Scorpion in SM4 and then make him Venom in either 5 or 6.
Yeah, a lot of it relies on what they choose to do with Venom or if they choose to do Venom at all. I think Sony making the Venom movies and having other symbiotes as the villains there, sours the opportunity of adapting any of that for the MCU Spider-Man movies, their most successful film franchise right now. The novelty of having multiple symbiotes might ware off by the time we get to the third Venom movie, especially since exploring the whole symbiote saga as a Spider-Man led story requires more than just a single movie as you mentioned and there’s other new and safer options for them to take in regards to other villains and storylines. Had the Venom movies not been made, a symbiote saga for Spider-Man would’ve been such an easy moneymaking direction for them to take, especially after having No Way Home.   Best option for Carnage right now is for them to just take advantage of the Venom story that was already told in Raimi’s trilogy, bounce right off of where that left off and tell a better symbiote story with carnage through a potential Raimi Spider-Man revival starring Tobey.. but what are the odds of that happening.
A possible solution could be to use the symbiote for more than just a bad guy and more than just Eddie or Peter. Agent Venom would be awesome to adapt but the Flash that we have is just.... Let's say he doesn't look the part yet. (Edit: or played it, flash redeeming himself from bully to hero doesn't work when Flash hasn't reeeeeally bullied this Peter. So keeping that relationship vanilla to avoid seeing actual bullying backfired a bit when it comes to Agent Venom)   Maybe even separate him from Spider-Man to give room for a Carnage to take on the role of a symbiote threat. I remember reading the Venom symbiote meeting the Guardians and him jumping from Guardian to Guardian, we had Venom groot, rocket, and drax I believe. Venom deattached from Spidey doing these things in other movies while Spidey deals with Carnage could be a path.   Shit you're right, this is hard.
I actually like those Venom movies but they did Carnage so dirty. Weird portrayal of the character, really wasn't in line with the Carnage from the comics or previous iterations. Not nearly violent enough.   If you ever see the deleted scenes from that movie there is some half baked idea about world domination (?) Or a race of super humans or something. I don't really remember. I just remember it being painfully stupid.
Stress and exertion can make your voice sound different. Given Sam was often flying, Anthony would have been harnessed up and pulled around in wires. Trying to say your lines while being flung around would change your voice
The dialogue may have been recorded later on and added to the scene, which could account for why Mackie's line delivery at that point sounds different from his other lines in the movie. Also, the character would have been straining to speak above the noise of battle and while multitasking between flying and shooting, so that would also affect his speech in-universe.
Yeah, but there are several times in the MCU in which Sam is flying around, so no doubt Anthony was harnessed at those times too, but only in the scene I mentioned does his voice change. Like, according to what ye said, he should sound different every time he's seen flying around, but that ain't the case.
Yeah, perhaps
Depends on how hard he is being yanked on the wires, the position of the microphones and a bunch of other factors
Yeah, that sounds legit.  So maybe ye theory is, in fact, correct regarding this subject.
omg i love her! :'( nice pic!
Nice picture
What was the occasion? Was this a Con?
W
I looove Pom. She's so sweet. Worked with her once when she wasn't popular yet
Oh god, she's so horrifying to look at.
She made me like Mantis... Brilliant actress.  I still can't get over the scene in Guardians 2 when she touches Drax and uncontrollably sobs.
read this as.. nevermind.  nice shot
Adorable!  Pom looks pretty good, too ;)
I thought that was your girlfriend before reading the title.   She is hard to recognize without the VFX
Pom just looks like such a fun person to hang out with.  She always seems like the light of the party   Great picture
She is hideous!
Great pic!
Met her at a con years ago. She was incredibly sweet.
I hope you were able to hold back any gagging
Lucky!
I read the 3rd word completely wrong 😂😂😂😂
aw man,  lucky! I missed her back in 2017 when I went to a con :(
Holy fuck did you go to Fulton middle school or fountain valley high school? I swear I’ve seen you
Aww great picture.
so damn cool
Damn awesome!
I’m jealous
Nice picture! Hope you had a great time!
So cool!
Smoke
Great pic 👍🏽
U guys look 🔥🔥
Looking great!
Careful, she might put you to sleep
It always throws me how different she looks like out of costume. Was she nice?
That is wholesome and sweet.
That’s awesome  Damn, she’s pretty. Wtf is wrong with Drax
Nice. I love her so much. I hope they give Mantis more burn shes so interesting as a character.
Weird to see alien actors out of costume and they look like people you’d run into on a street.
thanks
yup
nah. more like a Ruse
so your an actor to i enjoy it but its been hard especially in my case ive been trying to find filmmakers to collab with but i haven't had much luck in finding sigh....
That's awesome. I always pegged her as a genuinely warm and wonderful person.
im also with an agent to
Downvoters clearly didnt get the Drax reference. Must be r/prettygirls stans.
I bet she's beautiful on the inside tho
You're not alone
Lucky
yes i did
im guessing you did to
Based solely on the interviews and press junkets I've seen she seems nice. I'm interested to see her in things other than GotG. Can't help but expect to see her with Mantis' big eyes. Cool.
Nice! What did you get her to do?
No, I'm not an actor :) it's good that you have an agent. Keep on good work and practicing new skills and also try to audition as much as you can because if the director see something in you, even though you're not suit for the role you audition to, they may have something else for you. Don't give up!!
Yes I did I was a year older than your little bro and we wrestled together in highschool. Such a small world
She was in an episode of Black Mirror
Definitely listen to this. I have friends in the industry, no actors, but set people, wardrobe / costumes. Directors and the creatives are always looking for the "it" factor. Not just looks, but presence and energy. A big one is also work ethic. On time, prompt, dependable. Look at am HBO production. Once you start working with them, if you're any good, they will continually try to bring you on to projects. They communicate with people producing the shows to say "this person is great."  Everything in every industry I've been a part of, the vast majority are hiring based on relationships. A known quantity that is reliable.   When I am hiring talent is a close second to everything I mentioned unless I'm specifically hiring for a top position, but even then. If personality and professionalism is close to the skills of the top contender I will select person that is humble and easy to work with.   TL;DR work hard and be a great person that is drama free and it really does eventually open up a lot of doors.
yeah and acting is still my striving thing been trying to find filmmakers to work with but haven't had much luck
Man. I can’t count the number of times I hear some star was on Black Mirror that I didn’t know about because they weren’t famous when it first came out.  That show’s casting was on point. I need to do a rewatch.
Ah, the episode where Falcon cosplayed as Mantis to have sex with Mantra cosplaying as variant Shang-Chi.    (Ludi Lin, the actor who played the male video game character, actually was shortlisted for the role of Shang-Chi)
i see
yeah its been a struggle for me
They’ve basically had everyone of any note in the UK on. There’s not that many actors there. Hayley Atwell shows off her, er, personalities, in her episode.
She was in the first episode of the last season in 2019 with Anthony Mackie so after GotG 2
Ohh right. My best friend saw that first and said to me “dude. You have to see this episode of Black Mirror. It reminded me of you.”   I still might not have recognized her at that point without her black eyes and antennae.
Cox has also told a story of how he went to see NWH (without anyone knowing he was there) and his appearance got no reaction from the audience at all, which makes this even funnier 😂
I guess Thor didn’t get the memo in Endgame. Avengers! Assem- YAARGHH
Yeah you also notice those pauses in some of the reveal scenes like Andrew/Tobeys Spider-Man. I get why they did that, but now that the film has been out for as long as it’s been, those scenes are a lil awkward now. Still one of the best movies of that year tho
I’m actually glad those pauses were in the movie. Certain scenes would’ve been inaudible with how loud the audience was when I first saw it. Probably should’ve been a theatrical cut exclusive though
No way home was spectacular
Had to see Avengers 3 times before I caught “puny god”.  So … ya …
Would have needed more than just a short pause for my theatre on opening night. I didn't hear his lines properly until around the 2nd week of NWH's release.
Ik people are going to turn this into a full blown discourse about the state of cinema today but all I'm going to say is that Charlie Cox deserves all the claps and applause
My initial viewing people were a bit loud when he was revealed...but people CHEERED when he grabbed the brick and said "I'm a REALLY good lawyer"
ADMITS?   More like casually said at a comic-con panel.  These clickbait headlines can't help being so dramatic.
I don’t necessarily have a problem with built in applause breaks, in a movie that’s earned it like NWH or EG. I just think they should have a theatrical cut with pauses, and then the home release should cut the pauses out. It’s weird watching NWH now because there are absoluteyl moments that you can feel have been left open for an applause, but I’m just sitting alone on my couch
In my theatre they needed longer pauses, we were going wild!!! It was just an awesome experience to be a part of.
… and that’s literally what happened when I saw NWH during opening night. One of the dopest movie experiences I ever had, ngl..
It definitely felt like a sitcom, watching that in theatres, with the pauses for Cox, Garfield and Maguire.   I was like "please don't talk yet, I can't hear over the insane monkey sounds".  (The insane monkey sounds I was making, along with the rest of the packed theatre. 😂)  What a ride that was.
I wish I watched a single screening of anything with people emoting at all. All I get if anything anymore is banter.  But after Covid cinemas are no longer filling up. Every time I go it’s maybe 2% of attendance. Despite renovations and all.
People on Twitter are tearing NWH apart because of this, but is anyone actually surprised by it?! When directors make horror movies, they put in jumpscares with the assumption that it'll cause a specific reaction in the audience. How is this any different?!  All it does is show that Marvel knows how loved this character is.
I saw No Way Home in our local theater right before Christmas, it was packed. The audience absolutely hooted and cheered a bit during that pause, that moment was one of the many stand-outs in the film.
My theater was like a 50/50 split of people losing their shit, and then the people not knowing who the fuck that is. And then the people not knowing who the fuck that was but could tell it was someone one important so they haphazardly clapped anyway
My theater had audible gasps when he slams the cane down, and then applause when we see his face. It was awesome to be a part of!
The pause should have been theatrical version exclusive
There was a big cheer in my theater.
When I first saw NWH on opening night, my theatre went absolutely wild when he appeared on screen. When I saw it again two days later, the theatre was quiet. It all depends on the audience.
Honestly it works fine in a diegetic sense, he was on the phone!
As soon as the cane came down I was so giddy and freaking out but when I saw it a second time no one cared. I was pretty upset
I kinda wish they would edit these for streaming releases, I get the need for it in the theatre but I do agree with people who say it makes it really awkward on subsequent viewings
Unfortunately hen you watch the film outside of that special occasion, the applause breaks are super distracting.
Hey I was there! How nice seeing a panel from my home convention get posted!
They 0ep for all this stuff. Same with a different effect when Thanos stabs Tony. The music stops in that precise moment. I remember the entire cinema gasping and a lots of "FUCK!"  I adore watching marvel movies with invested fans at a movie theater.
AND THIS IS EXACTLY WHY I STREAM MY MOVIES NOW
And cheer we did, I’ll never forget the excitement of opening week of NWH
I didn't cheer or clap out loud, but I did do many short, violent fist-pumps in total silence.
Bro got the Big Bang Theory treatment
They hated Scorsese because he told them the truth...
Charlie Cox is so hot!!!
We've noticed, the Toby and Andrew appearances felt like a cameo in an SNL skit even when I watched it for the first time
I'm from the UK and I think I heard someone near me go 'yay!' When he turned up but one of those sort low ones that you heard in Parliment. I'd hate to go to a cinema with full on whooing and clapping, I go to the cinema to get away from people doing that.
Movie was great on theatres for reasons like this. Saw the movie twice on opening weekend and thought it was Great then good. Saw it a week later and realized it was made to capitalize on a full theater and is actually a pretty awful plot that is only held together by the Nostalgia the guest roles brought.  Really enjoyed that theater experience though. Only time that energy has been caught since endgame.
No wonder these movies feel focus-group tested lmao. Scorcese was right..these are theme parks.
This is embarrassing. Watching it after the hype dies down is just awkward
Cheering in a movie theatre - so glad to not be watching these films in the US
My stupid audience was dead silent and it was packed! I was the only one and I gave this strangled sort of giggle. I still sincerely hope no one noticed. Worst audience ever!
Before he said one of the dumbest lines in that whole movie. “I’m a really good lawyer”. How the fuck does that explain your ability to catch a brick flying at the back of your head as a blind man?!? I understand that it’s Murdock being funny, but it’s not enough I’m sorry. The MCU exists in a *somewhat* grounded reality. Meaning if a blind man caught a brick without so much as flinching, a joke about how you’re a good lawyer would simply NOT SUFFICE. I’M SORRY. I know I’m being a stickler here but it made no fucking sense and just felt like a line they came up with on the day.
Thank you for proving me that this movie is basically directed by the studio and the community instead of the director 90 percent of it.
My theatre was dead. It’s probably for the best he didn’t. There would’ve just been this uncomfortable silence
….I don’t like Jon Watts
Even more proof Jon Watts is a bad director
It's so cheesy. If it naturally elicits a cheer more power to it, but it's cringy as hell when pushed. They are literally going "dance monkey dance"
If I remember correctly in “honest trailers” address this… a lot pauses for cinema, that doesn’t work at home.
I’m such a doorknob that I still do a double take “huh?” at the idea that Charlie can actually *see*
If he went in England, then that would be expected. They don't do the same whooping and hollering that one sees in the American reaction videos.    No judgement, either way.
He should have been in our theater. Whoops aplenty for Matt.
My audience lost their collective shit at least
When Matt came on screen, I turned to my wife and smiled excitedly. That’s about as rowdy as I get in theatres.
That's funny  My theater in the middle of nowhere exploded with cheers
There was also no reaction in my theater. I gasped and that was about it. Yet Tobey and Andrew got tons of screams
Same thing when I saw it opening night.
I saw it a second time like a month after release and the only 30ish people there were losing their minds, ain't no way nobody in a packed theater didn't say a thing
My theater had a muted response and my sister asked who’s that because she’d never seen his show before and then got hooked on it after
He got a cheer when I saw it on opening night
Those scenes in Infinity War and Endgame that got wild crowd reactions is probably why he was asked to pause.
They clearly planned for cheers in Endgame. Cap gets the hammer, all that is said is “I knew it” for like 30 seconds, allowing room to cheer. Same with Avengers Assemble moment
My first watch of Endgame, I basically missed the Cap with hammer fight because my vision was blurry from the adrenaline rush.
I’ve been waiting on confirmation of this because the cinema was absolutely electric when I first saw it and I don’t think I’ve ever been in a movie screening before or since where there has been even any audience reaction. Every time I watch since the way Andrew pulls that expression and does the gesture of ‘don’t freak out’, perfect for both the audience and the context of the scene with MJ and Ned. I always think back fondly when I rewatch that exact moment
Reminds me of those “sitcoms without laugh tracks” videos.   [If you want the most awkward 30 seconds of your life](https://youtu.be/Z9yRKnLR6V4)
This movie was built for theatres and is actually a poor story held together by the Nostalgia of the guest roles.
I went briefly deaf when Cap finally said "_Assemble._"
It wasn't even that egregious. Literally only a second of pause after Matt sits down.
I hated watching that movie with the amount of yelling there was. I thought I was in a fucking zoo. I'm a nerd, but these guys were fucking annoying ass nerds.
That's the most American thing ever to me. I have never seen anyone clap or cheer in a cinema.
And Amazing.
Are you saying people were clapping in your ear for 2 weeks?
>Ik people are going to turn this into a full blown discourse about the state of cinema  They already are. People on Twitter are losing their fucking minds over this. So many tweets tearing NWH apart are blowing up.
I heard some gasps & soft "wow" or "yes" or "oh my gosh" type responses when he was revealed, but yeah the brick catch was a much bigger reaction.
I hate TikTok. The captioning is all off too.
Or maybe we should just make one version of the movie and make it the one that flows better for a normal watching, not a room full of people high on their own fandom.
You need to go on an opening night for a big film. I saw Wakanda Forever and John Wick 4 on opening night and it was packed af.
Even pre-covid I only ever saw reactions like this opening night. If I saw a movie multiple times, it would usually be dead silent the weeks after release. Most people who go opening night are bigger fans of whatever it is you're watching so you're more likely to get a reaction opening night versus other nights.
What's your bet on any of these people ripping it apart now being the same people who went "got chills seing Andrew and Tobey back" or anything along those lines when the movie first released? I really would have much more respect for these people's opinions if they weren't coming from spineless panderers who change their opinions to appeal to the popular sentiment now.
Exactly. I've said this in a few other comments, but the very fact that these people were clapping at a character just because he showed up in the movie shows you how much the character is loved and for a character to be loved, the audience has to spend time with them, see them go through emotional arcs, see them in their ups and downs and feel emotionally connected to them and only movies and shows that have substance create that much of an emotional connection with a fictional character.
I think Scorsese couldn't be more wrong actually.  Crowd-pleasing movies can still have nuance, promote deeper themes and leave you with a big impact after you walk out of the theater and NWH did all that while also being a perfect crowd-pleasing theme park-like movie.  It's just that when you build such a big franchise and create so many beloved characters and stories, you are bound to resort to some more fan-servicy movies that will tie up many years of storytelling and will fire all those unfired Chekhov's guns which will make people cheer because they've been waiting years for this and their hype and excitement was building up to this moment.  The very fact that these people were clapping at a character just because he showed up in the movie shows you how much the character is loved and for a character to be loved, the audience has to spend time with them, see them go through emotional arcs, see them in their ups and downs and feel emotionally connected to them and only movies and shows that have substance create that much of an emotional connection with a fictional character.  So I think Scorsese and everybody else who is saying the same thing have not seen many of these movies and don't actually understand or realise the reason they are so popular.  As James Gunn said a few days ago, super-hero fatigue will never kick in as long as the super-hero movies have substance, good characters with good development and arcs, grounded stakes that the audience can connect to and passion and heart from the filmmaker which adds a dimension of sincerity to all the crazy stunts and green screens and action pieces and quirky visuals.  Again, crowd-pleasing movies are crowd-pleasing because they actually please the crowd. And as we saw with Quantumania, a crowd isn't just pleased by action scenes, CGI, connections to the bigger universe and fan service.  Offering just a theme park ride is not enough to make an impact on the crowd and make them come back for more.
Yes, the old man who called these movies "invaders" and said the theater owners need to "take a stand" against them was totally right.  Stay stupid. It suits you.
You mean the same Scorsese who put out all those repetitive ultra-violent mafia films? The ones that are almost interchangeable in their use/abuse of stereotypes? Hmmm... nope - other than After Hours I have little appreciation for his oeuvre...
Just because a few of their movies are like that, I wouldn't say all of them are.  Besides, crowd-pleasing movies can still have nuance, promote deeper themes and leave you with a big impact after you walk out of the theater and NWH did all that while also being a perfect crowd-pleasing theme park-like movie.  It's just that when you build such a big franchise and create so many beloved characters and stories, you are bound to resort to some more fan-servicy movies that will tie up many years of storytelling and will fire all those unfired Chekhov's guns which will make people cheer because they've been waiting years for this and their hype and excitement was building up to this moment.

Yet you're always in this subreddit talking about these movies 💀
But are well-made theme parks not also art?
He’s ignoring the brick catch like it never happened. He’s just continuing  the conversation with Happy. ”I’m a really good lawyer” is the next thing he intended to say in that conversation all along. That’s what makes it funny - that he doesn’t even blink in his client conversation and everyone is left wondering WTF? Even more, it reinforces that he really is such a good lawyer that he doesn’t let flying bricks make him lose focus with his client.
you mean a choice the director made was fully forced by the community and studio?  where are your sources?
Yeah the 3 times that this happened is 90% of the movie lol
Knowing how your audience will act is like… one of the marks of a **good** director
Oh yeah, because knowing what the audience wants and would do is a negative thing
Quite the opposite actually.  He knew how the audience would react and made sure to factor that in so that they could actually hear the dialogue when he starts speaking.  He did the same when Andrew and Tobey came on screen and for good reason. I wouldn't have been able to hear anything with the insane cheering when those 2 stepped out of their portals.  But that's a very small point that doesn't really prove him as a good or bad director.  What proves him as a good director is the energy and tension he can create and how well he directs villains and emotional scenes.  Here are some examples:  # Spider-Man: Homecoming   1. Peter standing up to Tony  2. The scene where Peter goes to Liz's house and sees Toomes. The tension in that scene was palpable  3. The scene when Toomes connects the dots and realizes that Peter is Spider-Man during the car ride. Getting goosebumps just thinking about it. And it's not just the acting of the 2, it's also the way it's filmed and edited. The red light turning green just as Toomes realizes. The framing of the 2 characters. It's all perfect.  4. Peter lifting the rubble. That was a scene carried by emotional tension. Peter just had one line that he kept repeating and he did a great job, but once again how the scene was filmed was impeccable. You could feel being under that rubble with Peter. You could feel the literal and metaphorical weight on his shoulders. Watching that whole movie in the theater was a wild ride   # Spider-Man: Far From Home  1. The scene at the bar in Far From Home with all the subtle dialogue and body language that Mysterio acts out to make Peter give him the glasses. If you notice the finer details, there are also some subliminal messages on the wall behind Mysterio meant to make Peter more susceptible to his insecurities. Such a well-directed scene.  2. That illusion trip that Mysterio sent Peter and all the symbolism it held. Jon absolutely cooked in that scene.  3. The scene between Peter and Happy on the plane. Peter just breaking down was so intense and a good culmination of his arc.   4. The whole identity reveal had an insanely palpable energy and was probably one of the best MCU cliffhangers.  # Spider-Man: No Way Home  1. The scene after Peter arrives at his home and the paparazzi are outside, May has just broken up with Happy, they catch Peter naked in his room with MJ, then May tries to talk about protection in sex and then they start playing the live-stream from Peter's house in the TV. The chaotic energy of that one-shot was just through the roof. It really made the audience feel how absolutely stressful it was for Peter at that moment. This scene absolutely needs more love and appreciation, because without it, the rest of the movie would feel more flat. The way it put us in Peter's shoes so well from the beginning allowed us to have a deeper connection and empathy with him throughout the rest of the movie.  2. The scene where Peter realizes the Goblin is back and the whole fight sequence afterwards. Just getting goosebumps thinking about it. Another one-shot utilized really well in a very intense scene.  3. May's death. The whole thing was deeply emotional from beginning to end and Jon's direction was a big reason why.  4. The scene at the roof with Peter watching JJJ on that huge screen and the 2 other Spider-Men coming afterwards. Need I say more? The atmosphere of that whole scene made it so rough and real.   I think some people dank on Jon because he doesn't have a quirky, unique style like Raimi, but he doesn't need that to make good movies.
He can. Though he said that even though he struggled with it during the first season, he got way better with echolocation while training for the second one and uses it extensively in his everyday life ever since.
Most of the time I’d agree with you, but I went to NWH in a cinema in the UK on opening night, and there was so much audience reaction - more so for the appearances of Toby and Andrew, both of which got a big cheer (after Andrew was revealed and Ned and MJ said they’d try again, there was a rumble of anticipation because people knew what was going to happen) but even with Matt there was an audible gasp when he appeared.
Most theaters in America are like this too but if you generally go opening night here when all the excited fans go, you'll get reactions like this here.
That's not accurate. Infinity War and Endgame were manic, and I found myself almost in tears at one point. I and others literally screamed when Matt Murdock appeared on screen. And this is in London.
Depends. People cheered when he was on screen at the cinema I went to. Same with Andrew and Toby's appearances.  Granted they were only small cheers, and it was new years eve
I don't always like it, but at times it is great.  The best (for me) was the last scene of Split.  Half the crowd jumped out of their seats and cheered, and half were confused.
Generally one solitary bloke going weyyyyy! Then getting stern looks. Definitely wasn't me...
No please judge, I wish American cinema experiences weren't full of loud reactions and clapping. Contain yourselves and watch the damn movie so I can hear it.
Same, I wish he would have been at the showing I went too, he got a big reaction.  I wonder if he made the mistake of waiting too long?  If you want those big reactions, you really want to go opening night.  And if you don't even make it by the end of opening weekend, forget it.  The audience a week later is still going to have *some* highly enthusiastic fans, but not enough to make a theater erupt.  It's a much more casual crowd at that point.
Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
I think you might've picked the only one of those clips where it's actually still funny, because the pause *was* the joke in the first place.
reminds me of [the wonder years with out narration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9GuNQc-ujI)..
When he held major nelner the crowd erupted in my theater
No, that wasn't you; he actually said it really softly.
Like it's the perfect gap for me to piece things together so when it clicks he speaks at the same time. A good pause can do a lot of good without farming for applause
In the UK we had claps and cheers during Endgame's opening day. It died down after that, but the midnight release and all the showings throughout the day proper were noisy
It's rare. Usually opening night for things like Infinity War, Endgame, No Way Home. Star Wars episode 7 had some
Not really exclusive to Americans at all lol...at least in my experience, here in my country the Philippines people cheer in the cinema. Even the Illuminati scene in MoM, especially Professor X got great cheers.
While it’s generally not the case in the Netherlands, it was happening for NWH. When I went to see it, the whole cinema was screaming/applauding in those moments.
Go look up infinity wars and endgame reaction in India lmaooo
More common with the big Marvel movies now. My theatre was pretty loud for No Way Home, and it was honestly a lot of fun
My theater clapped for the first Shazam movie bro haha
Sorry we’re not boring I guess
Yep. And anyone who does would get pretty filthy looks from people around them.   Rightfully so. I didn’t come here to miss half the movie due to your hooting and hollering like a Chimp in the forest. I don’t get people who can’t deal with these feelings internally
Cap getting Thors Hammer was the most epic thing experienced in a theater.
And Superior.
You.  Are.  Amazing.
I saw the movie 3 times in the first week. Twice on opening weekend it got a huge reception. The 3rd time there was clapping and gasps. I saw it for a 4th time in the 2nd week, where it had died down to a few murmers.
And why shouldn't they? Film was made with the cinema hype in mind, let them rip it to shreds now that it doesn't work as well
oh no. oh no no no nono
> The very fact that these people were clapping at a character just because he showed up in the movie shows you how much the character is loved and for a character to be loved, the audience has to spend time with them, see them go through emotional arcs, see them in their ups and downs and feel emotionally connected to them and only movies and shows that have substance create that much of an emotional connection with a fictional character.   These same people clapped twice as hard when Willem Dafoe said a meme.
[Right...](https://preview.redd.it/b49855lwvqx81.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=04dbe1b5d289d2ce7a6eb42bcc463e1240eeaf91)
If you just handwave off one of the finest American filmmakers of the 20th century like that, I can’t lie, I don’t give a shit about your opinion, dude.
To add to this, generations will know who Iron Man is. Not all would recall the name of the main character in a Best Picture film.  If the main artistic aim of a movie is to move audiences that it leaves an impact on the viewer, I daresay the MCU has done that for a greater audience through many of its characters.
Yeah because i love MCU and i want it to do better. Not fully tired of it there's still stuff I love but a lot of it bothers me. Besides phase 4 hasn't been the best so excuse me if I don't seem all that happy rn
The first part is an interesting perspective. That’s he’s simply ignoring what he just did as an attempt to keep things focused on his legal duties. The second part I just have to reject. The idea that he would be joking about how he just stopped a brick from hurting one of his clients while sitting there claiming to be a fully blind man is just too disjointed. A blind man catching anything with that much precision is a HUGE deal. You really cant just explain that away with a little joke
Fr... Charlie literally said it was Jon Watts' decision. But anything for these people to push a narrative lol
3 times way too many.
Incorporating that into the filmmaking itself is not good filmmaking. The decision is made for Day 1 audience to cheer, but what happens beyond that? You just have a character with an awkward pause before they say their dialogue.
So, having an unnecessary pause so the audience could clap and cheer is considered good. If that the case, they might as insert a laugh track or a cheer track from a sitcom which the movie might as while is instead of a movie.
It is when you literally go and film to fit their reactions lmao. Beyond a Day 1 audience cheering on opening night, you just have a character with an awkward unnatural pause before saying their dialogue. Bad filmmaking.
Didn't he do an audition for something or other after Daredevil that he didn't get because he was so used to acting like he was blind that it carried over into his performance?
My theatre genuinely cheered when Osborne said “I’m something of a scientist myself” lol
I went the day after opening, and there was definitely an "ooooh" though the audience when Matt was revealed
Yeah I am totally chill with that, but if you see some of the reaction videos on YouTube, some of the American crowds get out of hand.
Dead silence in the cinema when I watched all three of those movies. I think there were some light murmers of approval during endgame at one point, but other than that nothing.
I do prefer the quieter theatre myself, with obvious exceptions for laughing and gasping etc.   But I do get a vicarious buzz from watching the reaction videos after the fact.
I don't mind it on an opening week showing. People are excited. And it's easy to wait a week or so to see the movie, I love going on a weekday matinee where there are like 3 people in the theatre.   Now, people that stand up and clap at the END of a movie, I don't know what to do with y'all.
Normally I’d more or less agree with you, but for Endgame and Infinity War and NWH, I totally understood everyone going absolutely apeshit after 10 years or build up, the fan service and the nostalgia. It honestly made my experience watching those movies even better.
Oh man, I totally disagree with that. Some of my fondest memories are losing my shit with people in the theater. Seeing an entire theater erupt when the word “Queens” appeared in Civil War is a memory that I really do treasure and I hope I never forget it.
Yeah I’m not American, but god I would hate that. But then, I kind of hate the cinema experience generally and only go to see the movie earlier/avoid spoilers.
I think this one was still not funny.
\*Jonathan
I must have missed Steve's romantic embrace with Major Nelner
Was quiet when I went, as it should be imo
Maybe you should watch a nature documentary instead.
And Web of.
It works fine wdym
It’s not even that long of a pause
I guess your theater experience was different than mine then. People cheered at the first appearance of the villains, Charlie, Tobey and Andrew. They did laugh at that line but did not cheer.
If you don't think certain directors are fair game for valid criticisms then your opinion literally does not matter. Scorsese has made some great films, I'm a fan, but the dude has problems portraying women and minorities, and generally just doesn't bother. It's fine if he doesn't like Marvel movies but to publicly argue that they aren't cinema and don't belong in theatres is way problematic no matter his intentions.   White dudes love putting him on the same pedestal they put Alan Moore on and as a fellow white dude, it's fucking exhausting. And Moore is actually worse ("what should this woman do in the story? Idk get raped I guess..."). No one belongs on a pedestal, everyone has room to improve.
Oh for sure.  Again, crowd-pleasing movies are crowd-pleasing because they actually please the crowd. And as we saw with Quantumania, a crowd isn't just pleased by action scenes, CGI, connections to the bigger universe and fan service.  Offering just a theme park ride is not enough to make an impact on the crowd and make them come back for more.
I didn’t mean that he was joking. I meant that’s what makes it funny to the audience.
Then he's a mid director because his spiderman movies literally lack style and bland looking most of the time.
Still not 90% of the movie
Nope. Even after many rewatches, it doesn't seem unnatural. Just because you don't cheer anymore doesn't mean no one else cheers.
Yep. He auditioned for young Han Solo in the Solo movie.
I honestly can’t stand it. It’s cool if someone enjoys it but I get to the theaters so rarely I’d rather have silence.
In the UK I’ve found it depends on when you go. Were you at midnight/opening night showings? I didn’t have shouting for any but there was definitely more noise than a regular showing
Especially a Marvel movie!  I'm like, "sit down and shut up, the movie's not over yet!"
I understood that reference!
Mew mew
There is a place and time for everything. In general I would agree that I prefer it to be quiet.   But watching Endgame at opening night and having the cheering at certain important moments did make the experience more epic. It was one of the most awesome cinema experiences for me at least.
Or I could watch the movie I paid to see 🤷🏻‍♂️ luckily people actually have some control of themselves over here anyways 👌🏻 I’d just hate to be American and have to pay for the same movie twice or three times to actually hear it all.
Spies.
It's awkward and detracts from the rest of the film, though there isn't much to detract from tbh
Agreed. The Andrew one was worse. I think Charlie’s works decently enough.
You're missing the point. The problem is not that people clapped. Audiences react, that's what they do. The problem is that this is a perfect example of filmmaking taking a back seat to fanservice. When you do things like this, when fanservice becomes not a fun, sparse seasoning to occasionally sprinkle on top of your product but a main, active ingredient in the process, then you're not creating cinema by any stretch of the imagination.
Nah, I read that comment as extremely surface level and wildly reductive comment on the dude’s oeuvre as well as his place in cinema history. And to get into the can of worms that is representation in a once-predominantly straight, white, and male dominated industry historically, like, before tides shifted and larger conversations about this shit permeated everything is like… man, where do we stop, then? You could argue the overwhelming majority of content from the dawn of time until like, five or six years ago is by and large problematic in those regards, but does that mean it’s entirely devoid of merit and not worthwhile to be understood in its context? It’s a reductive and surface level take, using like, modern day Tumblr standards to look at history.   Also, for what it’s worth, here’s what Scorsese went on to say to clarify his stance on Marvel films: “The fact that the films themselves don’t interest me is a matter of personal taste and temperament. I know that if I were younger, if I’d come of age at a later time, I might have been excited by these pictures and maybe even wanted to make one myself.” Seems pretty nuanced to me.
Also, Scorsese’s made 4 mafia pictures- out of his 25 total- over the course of 50 years, each with bursts of graphic violence, sure, but but overall focusing on the different ends of that lifestyle, from low level street dudes, to the highest echelons, to, in his most recent, how a life like that leaves you broken, empty and alone. Just saying they’re nothing but interchangeable bits of violence and sexism/racism with nothing else going for them… come on, that’s a valid criticism to you?
> but the dude has problems portraying women and minorities  So does the MCU.
Right, but something that’s said to be “funny to the audience” would make very little sense to the characters in the scene. And that goes twice as far when it’s something said offhandedly as a completely irreverent response to an extraordinary showing of human ability
Never said you weren't free to feel whatever about his directing, just that your first statement is categorically wrong because you didn't bother fact checking 🤷 could not give less of a shit what you think about Watts
You think everytime someone watches the movie, they cheer whenever he appears on screen? Get out of here lmao   A good director doesn’t pander to the Day 1 nerdgasm audience jacked up on opening night. A good director cares for the quality and longevity a film, and creates in a way that serves both. An unnatural pause before saying dialogue just to give your audience a laugh is literally a sitcom move while removing the laughtrack.
Would have been perfect if the movie was set primarily right after he was freed from the Carbonite. Blind han is Canon after all lol
That’s *why* I go to theaters for big movies like this. I enjoy that crowd reaction.  Star Wars Episode 1 and 7, Infinity War, Endgame, Get Out, Everything Everywhere All at Once. All had very memorable communal experiences with strangers.
Same. I go for the big screen and surround sound, dark room etc.   People yelling and whooping takes me out of the movie, making it unenjoyable. I'm *fine* with a few moments here and there but when I saw NWH it was by far the worst movie experience of my life. I didn't enjoy it at all.   The guy two seats from me was the worst but the whole theater was bad. The guy though was hacking up the entire time and not even remotly trying to keep it contained. He was laughing like a heyena at parts that weren't even jokes and would go for a solid 30 seconds or more each time. And I mean max volume guffaw laughter. Screaming at moments like Toby coming up, literal "WHAT! NO WAY! OH MY GOD! HOLY SHIT!". Those movie moments were nice and cool and I loved them but really? They don't deserve that kind of reaction.  I've walked out of one movie, when i was like 8 because I felt sick. I wanted to walk out of NWH because of that inconsiderate piece of shit but my wife wanted to stay.   Enjoy movies how you want, within limit. If you don't want people yelling at you to shut up or throwing food or whatever stupid shit, what makes you think other people wanna listen to your dumbass yelling and whooping? I paid to view the movie, not listen to you.
Nah regular showings like a week or so in
People clapping is awkward to you?
Oh ya Andrew was definitely longer but my theater was pretty appreciative of him. Watching it again home I didn’t really notice it because in my head I still hear the cheers.
As I said, there will be some movies like Endgame and NWH which will have more fan service than others. That doesn't mean that these movies don't have substance at the same time and that doesn't mean that it's the norm.
Listen man I don't disagree entirely and I'm not trying to discredit his films or cancel him. I'm just saying, it's a bit of a failure on his part. It's a bit of a character flaw. If you don't know how to write and portray characters that are outside of a certain scope of your own experience, for my money that's a blemish on your reputation as a creative. But like I said, I think he's made some good movies, I just feel like his well is a bit dry at this point.
Tbf a lot of the ones that aren't explicitly mafia films are basically tonally indistinguishable from mafia films.
I agree, actually. I wanted to see how he actually got out of the situation but they cut away. That’s where headcanon comes in. He’s almost gaslighting them in that situation - his lack of response could make them question whether they saw it at all. I don’t think he got away with it though - I’m sure they’re highly suspicious but we just didn’t get to see it. That’s supported by the deleted scene. Happy questions, “How do you do that?”
Oh sorry, how about this opinion. Then it is an awful choice since I want to watch a movie, not a high budget sitcom without the laugh and cheer track.
You think they don't? You do realize all viewers are different right? Even to this day, people can't wrap their head around Tobey Maguire as Spiderman showing up, so they would most likely be distracted from the movie for the first few secs after he appears which is what the pause is for anyways. This applies to Matt Murdock as well.  Besides, a film's quality can be seen through the box office results and NWH has made some racks. Whether you like it or not, the movie is successful and high quality, therefore Jon Watt's is successful and produces high quality content.
I totally get it. I love that people can have that experience if that’s what they seek. For boring people like me, I can just avoid the midnight shows, etc. If for some reason I find myself at one of those with people who want to go, then at least I know what to expect.
Pausing your film to make room for cheering, which will only ever happen on release anyway, is awkward yes
Dawg, have you seen Hugo? It’s straight delightful.
Lmao quality doesn’t equal box office. In that case, independent films can’t be good quality. And I guess that makes Love and Thunder top quality as well.   And no, in 10 years, people who’ve seen No Way Home more than once aren’t going to be still cheering when Matt shows up. All they’ll have is an unnatural pause from a character that plays like a sitcom missing a laugh track. Bad filmmaking.
Sounds like you have severe social anxiety if a couple second pause in a movie is awkward for you
Yeah that one's good, I agree
If it was bad quality, it wouldn't have made money. Independent films can be good quality. Love and Thunder is top quality for the most part. Most if not everything thats bad about it boils down to subjectivity. Sure there are some scenes here and there with poor CGI, but they are minimal.
Why are you being so purposely obtuse?  Social anxiety? I'm talking about watching the film outside of the cinema, there's no social aspect to even be anxious of when I'm watching the film at home
I don’t have any social anxiety, and wasn’t particularly upset at people clapping in the middle of the movie, although I do think it’s super cringe.   Now? Yeah, it makes for a weird scene in the movie when Andrew Garfield just kinda grunts and looks around for a couple seconds while everyone just kinda stares at him. It takes you out of the movie. That’s a valid criticism.
Funny, because the quality of Love and Thunder is what appears to be almost universally criticized. What you have is bias. When success works in your favor it’s objectively “good quality,” but when it works against you, it’s “subjective” and “minimal.”
the reverse ratio is the craziest thing I’ve seen today it gave me whiplash
Because it literally is subjective. No matter how many people agree on it.

It’s about the implication…

I don’t like this idea. I love him as an actor but not for this role
Flaccid...Erect.
Did anyone hear rumors about him being really difficult to work with and not a great person? Is that just me? Maybe I’m thinking of someone else.
He looks like the same guy I saw in a photoshop for Plastic Man. Lol
Now do devito as the thing.
That would be Adam Warlock

Mac should be Mr.Fantastic, Dee is ~~bird~~ invisible woman, Charlie's human torch, Frank is the thing and Dennis is Dr.Doom
Banging your sister is perverted, Reed!
I do like this more honestly
If I recall correctly they were originally going to have her be a love interest for Steve, as he’s the one that saves her as the diner gets blown up or something (been awhile since I’ve seen the first Avengers movie). But obviously they went a different way with that, with the whole Sharon Carter stuff.
And she does this little show called Critical Role. With her Nerdy Voice Actor friends.
I feel so old, she’s Chrissy from Growing Pains.
Also the daughter in What Women Want
Don't forget Gretchen from Recess!
She was also Patterson on Blindspot with Lady Sif's Jaimie Alexander.
Ashley Johnson Appreciation Post!!!!  &#x200B;  [That's a Big Boi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4ci1payLpc&ab_channel=AJIrrelevancy)
She’s Gwen in Alien Force/UA/OV too
And she was Tulip in the first season of Infinity Train, as well as Lake, formerly Tulips reflection in the mirror, in season 2.  I was watching IT as I was playing the first game, and it was wild hearing her as two characters roughly the same age, but with *very* different experiences.
And she was Terra in Teen Titans!
She was Chrissy Seaver first.
Every single time I see her on tv, I just have to say in a creaky voice.   “Captain America saved my life”
She’s also Pike in Critical Role the Legend of Vox Machina!
I remember after Avengers came out being 'Oh, I guess they're setting the waitress and Steve up for something in the future' and then literally nothing happened lol, kinda a shame, tbh.
You damn kids. Some of us can't see that name or face without hearing a certain theme song.  #*Show me that smile again...*
No, that is Chrissy Seaver.
Is this IMDB?  Edit: ok, that was meant more as a fun observation about this post, but the comments I get in reply take it a little to aggressive. Not my intent.
She was also the star of the show on 90 hit show *You've Got Gail*.  She played Gail of course. I heard one of the other actors who she beat to get the part was heard telling one of their friends to "gag her with a spoon" after she saw how much better ashley did.
The little girl from JCVD’s Lionheart! I knew I recognized her from somewhere besides her movies as an adult!
Also Gwen from Ben 10
She’s literally a child actor. Been in the business for a while.
She was also in Joss Whedon's adaptation of *Much Ado About Nothing* that came out the same year as *The Avengers*, and Joss liked working with a lot of the same actors (maybe so he could torture them again but I don't know what her experience was)
Can you imagine if she had been as foul mouthed as Ellie?  Waitress: Fucking Captain America fucking saved me! How fucking cool is that!  Steve, popping out of nowhere: Language!
Fuck, that’s where I knew her from
She was also Annie in the 1995 flim (Annie).
This is inconsequential when compared to Pike, Yasha, and Fearne
Who’s gonna tell em about Growing Pains?
She's also Terra from Teen Titans, which is where I know her from.
She also had a small reoccurring role in Roseanne as DJ's girlfriend, and in one of my favorite scenes.  https://youtu.be/WSWy2jo2M9A
I'm more fascinated that someone paid real Reddit money via gold to learn this fact.
They made an avengers movie?
Yea and shes also the little girl from growing pains. We knooooooow
She’s also in critical role, and the legend of mochina
Ghost Rider and Dr. Radcliffe from AoS were also in The Last of Us show.
She also was Annie
She will always be the daughter of Mel Gibson
I still remember her from Growing Pains. Man, I'm old.
I thought everyone knew this lol
This is very common knowledge
She doesn't get nearly enough work.
For older Redditors, she's Chrissie from Growing Pains      How amazing is it that Growing Pains gave us both Leo DiCaprio and Ashley Johnson?
She was baby Chrissy on Growing Pains
TIL actors have played multiple characters in their career.
In other news, actors act in things for money.
Man she deserves some raise to her performance. She really did nailed it and fun fact her character was supposed to be Steve's new girlfriend but the idea was scrapped and put into Sharon Carter. What a shame Marvel.
Her name is canonically Beth.
She was also the "add-a-kid" tacked onto the _Growing Pains_ cast in its latter seasons. That's right: she was stuck working with Kirk Cameron in the late 1980s. (But also got to work with Alan Thicke!)
She's also Elle's birth mom in the show
Actors are actors, big suprise
That one Ashton Kutcher movie as hot college friend
Don’t know if anyone has mentioned this yet but she also portrayed Petra in the entirety of ‘Minecraft: Story Mode’.
She's also one of the audio log narrators in The Witness.
She was also the little girl in Lionheart
Also, Pike Trickfoot.
Ok
if you look closely too, the guy who plays Captain America also plays the Human Torch, but it's a different one since those came way before So I don't think they exist in the same universe. I believe his name is Chris Evans.  He also plays the douchey actor in Scott Pilgrim
no shit
That’s why she’s so fucking familiar! I swear like 3 nights ago I was trying to remember where I recognized her from.
Seriously?
HOLY SHIT I never realized
Lamest TIL ever.
No, she’s Mel Gibson’a daughter
That explains why she looked so familiar.
She was the youngest sister in Growing Pains
You just noticed that now
Based on these comments it’s safe to assume you’ve seen her in other stuff.
She's also the voice of Ellie in The Last of Us games
OH MY GOSH. I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT SCENE AGAIN AND I ALREADY KNEW WHAT THIS ARTICLE WAS TALKING ABOUT.
Oh took you long enough to notice
Watch critical role
You didn’t just learn that, I’m sure
SPOILER In title. Lame
Nepotism runs deep
Time for her to have her own Special Presentation on D+
She played a housekeeper on an episode of *Monk*.
She was Annie in "Annie: A Royal Adventure!"  Leapin Lizards!
And teenage Gwen from Ben 10 Alien force onwards, and Pike from Vox Machina, and etc  Very talented actress
I mean she was a pretty popular child star so I always took it as a movie star cameo at the time.
If you’re even mildly aware of nerd culture, you know who Ashley Johnson is. Still, I always forget that it’s her in Avengers. She’s awesome!
She is also Pike in the Legend of Vox Machina.
 I know her form Growing Pains and What Women Want.
You mean Pike Trickfoot
Came to find the obligatory Critical Role commenters.
Beth
To me she’s Mel Gibsons kid in What woman want.
Gretchen Grundler!
That's... how I know her in the first place
Most importantly a member of critical role and the president of the critical role foundation
Im sorry am I the only idiot who read this as "Ashley Johnson is Bella Ramsay's mom"?
Did she have a… critical role? [rimshot]
And the baby from Growing Pains.
She’s also an avid D&D player and voice of Pike in Legend of Vox Machina (her own character)
OH that’s where I know her from
Am I the only one that only recognized her from Dollhouse? Dang.
She's the little girl that plays Jean Claude Van Damme niece in the film 'Lionheart'   God I feel old...
And if they ever adapt The Dresden Files for movies (or for TV again) she's the dream casting for Karrin Murphy.
Also.... Growing Pains
Ummm. We call her Gretchen Grundler.
She's also Pike, Yasha and Ferne in the 3 Critical Role campaigns and Tulip and Lake in the show Infinity Train. That scene was super distracting because I was watching, saw her and went 'Oh my god, it's Yasha LOL'.
She's even a playable character in one of the Marvel Lego games haha. "Beth the waitress"
She was also in Blindspot with Jamie Alexander and Michelle Hurd.
TIL Ellie is *not* based on Elliot Page.  I always assumed since Ellie looks just like them in early movie roles.
When I saw her in The Avengers I looked her up because she looked familiar. She was in Growing Pains too which I watched as a kid.
Duh?   This has been known since 2014
I'm old i guess. I've known her since Growing Pains
She is also on the D&D podcast critical role and is just great.
Yea he interacts with Captain America when he’s at a diner or something.
You put some respek on Growning Pains!
Yeah. Was real weird seeing her after watching Critical Role lol
I went to school with her. Happy for her continued success!
And Lionheart with JCVD
I only played TLoU for the first time a few months ago.  I was looking up the voice actors and saw this in her IMDB.  I remember how prominent she was in the ads. Like every trailer had her character in it looking out the window. But then she barely had any scenes.
I loved her in "What Women Want".
So glad this little to unknown actor is finally getting real artistic work
I thought April Fools was last week?
She was also Patterson in blind spot as well
No shit lol.
She was the daughter in What Women Want with Mel Gibson.
Strange, and she popped up in an unrelated reel on my Instagram feed today from a clip from Roseanne.
Wasn't she also in a sitcom as a kid?
Wow, what's even more surprising to me is she's also Mel Gibson's daughter in What Women Want.
She has done voice work for so many things at this point it would be more impressive if you don’t know at least three of her roles
She’s also huge into DnD and is apart of the online campaign Critical Role
Oh my god I've been watching critical role for months and knew there was somewhere I recognized her face from. I figured it was just some random interview about one of her voice acting roles
Welcome to the party pal
I loved her in Avengers! She was so memorable. They should bring her back. I want to see more “ordinary” people. It’s a window in to the fantasy of it for audience members like me who struggle with suspension of disbelief.
Man I know her best from Critical Role, I always forget she does other voice acting - and live action stuff - too!
She also is on critical role which is some awesome dnd play.
Wasn't she the kid in What Woman Want with Mel Gibson? lol.   God, I'm old if her child is an actress.
She is also def in some news footage in Avengers I believe and scattered throughout the MCU
This is just extremely common knowledge I see it posted all the time
And DJ’s first girlfriend on Roseanne, which Joss Whedon was a writer on for one or two seasons, which is where they met and why she was cast as the waitress I believe.
She was the annoying little sister in growing pains late stage years
Is anyone else here old enough to recognize her first as Chrissy Seaver from the 1980s TV sitcom Growing Pains?
And the [annoying little sister with a red afro in Growing Pains](https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/2016/12/15/NTTN/ghows-DA-42edbec8-88fe-667e-e053-0100007fb348-9df55395.jpeg)
She had a cameo in the avengers and Captain America 2 I think.
Well I didn’t know that. I thought she was another actress that whedon had a hard on for so he put her in the movie. Always made me wonder why she was in 2-3 scenes.
She’s also Chrissy Seaver from the Growing Pains. She’s been acting pretty much since birth.
Almost as if she's a professional actor...
Thats Chrissy Seaver and no one else
She’s also part of a weekly streamed D&D game https://youtube.com/@criticalrole
She's also the voice of Gretchen Grundler on Recess.
Bene vaffanculo.
BUDDIES!
She also played Chrissy on Growing Pains
She was also the youngest daughter on an older show called Growing Pains. The theme song still lives in my head rent free
She was on a ton of stuff when she was younger
She even looks like LOU Ellie
Ashley had one scene in TLOU and she pulled it off completely. She acted so well. It would be a waste if she didn’t get a starring role in another movie/series. She’s proven that she can do a lot more.
Literally just finished watching it on TBS, saw her scene giving an interview to a reporter in the movie, open up Reddit and BAM! First post on my feed is this.
Me: Honey, did you know that the voice of Ellie in the game was the waitress in the Avengers?"      Wife: Yea, actors act...
I knew she looked familiar, I didn't know from where. Thanks OP
Gwen Tennyson and Captain America would've made an interesting ship.
Wasn't she also in the series Growing Pains with Allen Thicke?
My mind just exploded. I never realized that until now.
Thanks for the spoiler in the title.
She also played the young girl Nicole in the film AWOL/Lionheart/Wrong Bet.
She was also in Recess
She has extended scenes.
Wow. Actresses have other roles?
Yeah that was mentioned in the behind the scenes and extras on the blu-ray for the movie
The more people discover how great a career Ashley Johnson has had, the better. She's fantastic in everything!  This feels like when Loki was coming out and everyone was figuring out how awesome Tara Strong is.
She had a nice moment with Cap in a deleted scene from 'The Avengers'.  https://youtu.be/Pov4qMSfg9w
Yeah, there was [a deleted scene](https://youtu.be/G53HrME3lms) where he gets coffee and she's his waitress. Her stuff that actually made it into the movie takes on a very different connotation when you know that it was supposed to have more context and probably more follow-up too.
Put some respect on the 2nd greatest MCU lovestory behind Tony Stark and Himself.
I have always felt her role seemed a little weird in the movie, because you've feel like they had some kind of interaction before but they never did... When I saw her deleted cut it made total sense
I think early fan theories even predicted her to be Sharon Carter.  Edit: I should note that this was also something people thought with the random Shield agent at the end of The First Avenger.
IT'S BEEN A WHIILE!
I remember when I saw avengers the first time thinking that waitress character got a weird amount of emphasis for a character that was basically an extra.
I always wondered about her. I recognized the actress from her previous work and thought it was weird both that she was playing an extra and that she had so much screen time/interaction with main characters. It seemed like they were setting her up to have a more important role, but then she disappeared.
After seeing that scene for the first time, I always thought that they were going to lead into something like that. However, looking at it now I think she worked very well as just a minor character that supports what the Avengers represent
I thought the fact she was dressed like a waitress from 80 years ago was a little weird…
When in doubt Wincest.
My first thought on seeing her was that she was going to Mary Jane Watson. But once I got the blu-ray and her name was different, I gave up that hope.
Yeah that definitely seemed like something that could come up again …. But didn’t . She’s probably the most obvious civilian stand - out of the film ; other than perhaps the security guard with Bruce .
There was going to be a scene where the waitress and others are marched into a room. She sees piles of clothes and watches and realizes they're disintegrating people. Then Cap comes in and saves them and they share a look or something.  Guess the whole deal was cut.
Tbh, I'd honestly prefered it if Steve x Waitress happened. It really felt weird to me that Steve was basically accidentaly going after a relative of his first love, but I honestly can't really point my finger on the reason...
Also the titular Gale of "You've got Gale!"
I'm just getting into DnD myself, so I've been watching a decent amount of Critical Role. She threw in this funny little [reference ](https://youtu.be/U_6vFzaR33s) once.
*In chaotic chachophony* We play Dungeons and Dragons!!
That's so cool, apparently she plays Pike the gnome cleric? I haven't seen Critical Role, but I love her rendition of the character in Legend of Vox Machina.
She is definitely the busiest of the CR cast.
Nerdy role in Blindspot too.
Also has a small show based off critical role in Amazon, The Legend of Vox Machina
I thought I recognised her!
Came here looking for this. Happy we’re repped.💜
Yeah she voices the paladin gnome in the prime series too it’s really good.
https://youtu.be/8u49UHYuIrY
I would like to rage.
That's why she looked familiar!
You're only old if you refer to Leonardo DiCaprio as "Luke from Growing Pains"
Show me that smile…!
I know, right? When I saw Avengers in the theater, I said that's the girl from Growing Pains, she's going to have a bigger role. And now she's known as "the waitress from Avengers"
I am even older. I know that her older sister was on Kids Incorporated.
For whatever reasons, ever since seeing her in Avengers, I remembered her as the daughter in What women want.    Why, I have no idea.  I’ve seen that movie like once or twice and it was shortly after it came out.
When she was so little and had the tiny curly little girl 'fro. And she was the sassiest little thing.
That’s what I saw when I saw her. So happy that she turned out dorky.
That's always where I remember her from
Yeah, it made me sad that I had to scroll this far to see Growing Pains mentioned.
Also D.J.'s girlfriend in one episode of "Roseanne"
I was getting ready to say it but I wasn’t sure I wanted to age myself that much!
So glad someone else recognized her. And yeah, that was a long time ago.
Yep!
SERIOUSLY. I thought I was getting Mandela’d cause no one was mentioning it.
Yep. Always.
That's what I always think of her as too
Yes!
Scrolled waaaaay too far to find this comment.
You’re shitting me. The little sister?
This is where I knew her from.
Whaaaaaa
This was my introduction to her too haha
Wait WHAT!?!?!??!?
Hell YEAH finally someone else recognises her from that!
And Gwen Tennyson from Ben 10 AF/UA/OV
So this is how I discovered she was in Avengers.  I was watching Recess (cause why wouldn't I?) And it got me wondering if they'd ever bring it back. So I was looking up the cast to see if everyone was still around and I then discovered Gretchen is voiced by the same person who voices Ellie in TLOU and was the waitress in Avengers.
I didn't put this together until today? That womps.
I can't believe I had to scroll down to find this lol...
"How could I forget, I never knew!"
.....whaaaaaaaaaaa?🤯
WHAT
FINALLY SOMEONE POINTS THIS OUT!
I miss that show
Patterson, her father and her name. That character is as nerdy as she is.   She always gets casted into roles she is fit for. Very lucky or very choosey. 👏🏼
She was really good in that role.  She was one of the best parts of the program.
I liked how it became a running joke that they never actually said her first name. They even acknowledged it one time when the main guy gets a text from her and goes "she's in trouble?" "How can you tell?" "she used her first name"
Not gonna lie, until this moment I thought Ashley Johnson and Rumer Willis were the same person
I see your Big Boi and raise you [2 Big Bois](https://youtu.be/tDY_32wOMwA)
You're telling me I thought she was hot as a kid watching Ben 10, then as a kid watching avengers, and then as a teen watching critical role, and the whole time without realising they were the same person.
And Terra in Teen Titans.
First 2 seasons of Infinity Train were amazing.  Crazy that HBO Max took it down and it's now only available on the high seas.
Had to scroll too far for this
Best Teen Titan. There, I said it.
Had to ctrl-F for this.  Growing Pains!! She was one of the early prime examples of when a show would jump the shark by adding in a new baby.  And Chrissy was literally a baby when the character first appeared and then suddenly aged up to like 7 the following season and was played by Ashley lol.
“Captain America…*saved my life.”* Was Joss Whedon off camera yelling “be more overwhelmed, damn you!”
She's got three charecters now
Would've been funny if they kept the deleted scene considering the running gag of Nat trying to set Steve up with someone in The Winter Soldier. Though I wonder, if they did follow through with Cap having a civilian partner who holds his hand through this new world, that would've affected a lot down the line. Civil War and Infinity War would be different since he'd be going on the run and would have to leave her, only to reunite (or not) during Endgame pre-Hulk-snap. And then that would've factored into whether Cap stayed in the past or not. Idk, could've been interesting since we did get to see Scott and Clint's respective civilian lives with their families, but they were dads. So seeing Cap get used to just being there for someone in the 21st century (and *maybe* becoming a dad himself) could've been cool.
Unearthed another easter egg, turns out this 'Chris Evans' guy has been in some other movies, TIL.  Edit: ok, this was meant more to poke fun of TIL being applied to an actor being in multiple movies rather than being aggressive, apparently that wasn't clear.
I feel like I'm going crazy... what waitress in Avengers?  When was there a waitress?!
More like IMDUMB
This really is a stupid post. Every comment is just another film/show she has been in. This is just a really inefficient IMDB page.
Yea. But, we all know when we see that face that we recognize, we hit IMDB and think "That's where I know her from!".   This thread is just a bunch of people recognizing her from somewhere else. I knew her from some other stuff, but loved her in Avengers. Even for that small part.   She was also in Last of Us series on HBO (Not going to spoil it with who she plays, etc... But, if you don't know - go watch the show. It's excellent. Even if you have to skip certain parts/episodes for whatever reason... it's still a great show. And those certain parts/episodes are extremely good, IMO. Just gonna leave it at that.).
I understand (now much more after this post) that people already know this, just not expecting some to be this aggressive.
Jesus Christ,  Video Director?
And additionally she was in a couple episodes of Dollhouse a few years prior to the other Whedon projects you mentioned. I certainly hope she had better experiences working with Joss than others.
Them learning is part of the process.... Some would say it's their.....
How is her voice deeper here than it is now haha
I didn’t know. Thanks OOP for the post!
I fucking hate this comments with the deepest part of my soul
I didn’t know :)
What’s interesting is there is a decent resemblance. When she first appeared on screen I was like “um, is this a time skip and Elle has grown up/is for some reason pregnant!?”  (I assumed the actress was picked because of the resemblance.)
You're referring to "the mother of Ellie in the TV series"?  The show finished airing a month ago, so that's a reasonable amount of time for people to catch it. Also this casting tidbit is low stakes on its own since it doesn't reveal how the story plays out.
Huh
Pretty cool to see Cap ride the subway.  They are in NYC, but it never feels like it.   Except for spider-man.
I get that it’s because of the Acura ad, but I love that this was posted by Honda of Ukraine
I really wish they kept stuff like this in the movie. It really grounds the film. For how much I loved the Avengers they did a lot wrong. Like Hawkeye being brainwashed nearly 3/4s of the movie. Come on.
"Ask for her number, you moron!" 😂   That was a funny moment right there..
I honestly thought the “directors cut” was a better movie.
I was like why the hell was this uploaded by Honda?  Then i realized lol...
I thought this was “The Gif” lmfao
That scene is great!  Thank you!
It also had a different Stan lee cameo. He tells Steve to get her number
Wow. Never saw that.
Idk, at the time I just felt they used her as an figurehead for all the New York residents who had no idea what was happening and were just running in fear. For me her role made sense just as a method to set up that end line on TV about cap saving her life.
interection? Intersection, or interaction… oh, nevermind.
Yeah a lot of people thought she was Sharon or a new version of her. Because blonde. Interest in Steve
I 100% thought the girl(Amanda Rigetti) at the end of First Avenger would end up being Sharon. Then they decided to be sneaky and did the neighbor thing. Really wish they had worked with ABC to have Emily more in the movie than what we saw.
The random SHIELD Agent made more sense because when he escaped she gives out a "code 13" and 13 is Sharon's SHIELD Agent number.
Making my way
That God it wasn't. Pairing MJ with Steve would've been a really bizarre choice
Not to mention the spin-off; Gale force 5: A Gale in your coffin!
Gag me with a spoon!
Do you see me scarfing milkduds while doodling ding dongs in the sky mall catalogue???
Check out Dimension 20 as well. They’re really fun.
They reference pop cutlure all the time, but this was such a well place joke. She's genuinely hilarious, and her role with Fearne is some chaotic humor we all need.
Dunduns and Draguuuuuns!
THAT’S what they’re saying?! TIL
Weplaygungnsngrzzzzzzzz
May everyone have a hype man like Travis Willingham.
Yes. They all play the characters they . . . well, played.
Campaign 1 she's a Gnome Cleric. That gets referenced a couple times by her character on Blindspot too. Which is why she's absent a lot in the first two campaigns.  Campaign 2, she's an Aasimmar Barbarian. Campaign 3 (the current one), she's a Satyr Druid.
Vox Machina is sooooooooo good.
It’s between her and Laura Bailey. But only because Bailey is in everything.
I remember an episode where they said something to the tune of “Pike is not with the party today, since she’s been called away on a mission to the kingdom of Bafta”
Is she though?  Sam works as a casting director for The Legend of Vox Machina, and he's co-written a few of the episodes.  And idk if he does it currently, but he's also done behind the camera work for other shows before, so he might have that also going on.    Plus god knows how much Matt has to do with DMing critical role, and he's also going to start DMing Dimension 20 as well, and I imagine he's got a fair amount of work to do with any books they print for 5e.  And then Marisha and Travis are both working as execs for critical role, dealing with the now two shows happening at Amazon Prime, the first-look deal they got for a movie with Prime, and Travis also co-wrote episodes for TLoVM.
Depends on how you define busy. They are all very busy people.
The tiniest of shows!
She's a Cleric, not a paladin btw
Yeah, they voiced their own characters they did on the show in the animated series.
His episodes were the best
More like the new kid on growing pains, Leo was later in the series if I remember correctly.
Ohhhhh show me that smile
She’s really not, she’s definitely Ellie, or Ashley from Critical Role  Don’t think many people even remember the waitress in Avengers lol  Edit - or Patterson from Blindspot ig
And Talisan Jaffe (on Critical Role) was the little blonde kid with the "wubby" in Mr Mom.
She’s definitely more known for critical role now than for being the waitress in avengers
Kids Inc. was great. Jennifer Love Hewitt and Fergie were on there.
SAME! I remember instantly recognizing her from that both in Avengers and when they announced her as Ellie in The Last of Us game. It's funny how things like that happen
She was like Shirley Temple, and she stole every scene she was in imo.
Yup.
Thank you! It’s all I can hear when I hear her. We were watching the last of us, and my BF searched to find out who she was. He had me guess who she was based of the clue “she’s a voice actor” (meaning the original Ellie) and I said GRETCHEN FROM RECESS and he laughed at me for about 20 minutes before telling me who she was.  I searched her and told him actually, I was right hahah
....whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat
They should get on that while we still have Dabney Coleman.  That was a fun show to watch with the kids, which was more of a formality for me to watch.
As a critical role fan, I don't! She missed so many episodes filming Blindspot 😂
One time I was trying to remember which episode I'd left off at, so I read the description of one and it was something like: "The team is in a race against the clock to stop a terrorist, but Jane's tattoo reveals a new mystery."  [MRW](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/032/874/cover4.jpg)
Blindspot was a blast but MAN it went completely off the rails in the last couple seasons.
Maybe they are
Seems you know your type xD
season 3 was even better, honestly a masterpiece
Don’t forget the third season. The best imo
She was a net add. She was adorable, quirky, and funny.   She was much better than when they did the same thing on Family Ties with Andy.
Yeah, I’m in C2 myself.
He looks a lot like that one guy that does the "flame on" stuff in the first Fantastic Four movie. I always get the two of them confused.
Jean-Claude Van Damme
Even then the second SM MCU film took that away lol
Speaking of subway I feel like all that damage that was done from battle of NY people definitely died in subways.
I also wish they showed the outer boroughs more. Between the Netflix shows, Avengers, Spider-Man trilogy and Dr Strange, so much of NYC is based in Manhattan especially midtown and lower. The only modern Brooklyn scene I can distinctly remember is the Coney Island fight scene
MCU Spider-Man movies does not feel like NYC. Not truly. They look like Insurance Commercials
I think a day-in-the-life story set around Cap adjusting to living in the 21st century would have been fun, though it definitely would not have fit in with the MCU lineup at the time.
It’s worth remembering the context at the time. It was considered incredible they managed to have SIX WHOLE HEROES where they all had their own bits and arcs and relevance in the story and for it to be a good film. They didn’t have the scope to be like “these 40 people just show up, we won’t focus on them though because they’ve got their own films for that”. I remember a lot of talk before it came out that it would be too busy and full and not work because of it, just with those 6. I don’t think they had the room to fit in grounded stuff then. Avengers was the film that made the MCU, they had the scope to do what they wanted after they proved it worked.
I think this was originally the thinking behind making the Disney+ series shows: you could tell the same stories, but stretch out character moments and add little things that would get cut out of 120-minute runtime movies.   Except fans look at the "fixing the boat" and "applying for a loan" scenes in FatWS and complain about how it drags and adds little to the story 🤷‍♂️
It fits with his origin as an Iron Man villain.
> Like Hawkeye being brainwashed nearly 3/4s of the movie.  This was unquestionably a reference to the fact that Hawkeye was actually a villain when he was first introduced.
Yeah Jeremy Renner didn't like that either. To the point he requested they just kill him off
I wish they would have kept it just for that at least!
Does this really exist?
I'm not sure it makes sense that a code she calls would refer to her agent number beyond an easter egg, but I do remember people wanted her to be Sharon just because she did resemble Peggy.
I thought it'd be a creative way to introduce Spiderman to the MCU.
Oooooh Gail! *In Taliesin dad voice*
I will never not support people getting into Dropout as a whole with D20 as the gateway dru- er, I mean, gateway show. Best subscription service I have, and cheap as hell for all the great content they have. And D20 is Definitely an easier intro to D&D campaigns for new people because of their short-form seasons vs CR long-form seasons (I love both btw).
Or Rollplay, though their D&D stuff is second to their other stuff. Like Nebula Jazz, Swan Song, and Mirrorshades
Nobody says that better than Brian Posehn.
[Behold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlvXRXkdEa8), the slow evolution from Travis copying Matt to the current-day chaotic cacophony.
They are usually say “We play dungeons and dragons” to mock and annoy Matt. It is tradition
Same! I thought they were just making loud random noises at Matt.
To make this joke I whent to the episode from two weeks ago and that's what the subtitles claim they are saying! I was just as surprised, I've onky ever picked up on the dungeons and Dragons muffle, lol!
She’s really been nailing it as Fearne inC3 too. So funny
Matt also has quite a lot of voice work, despite all the stuff he has to prepare as DM. He's even voicing Ganon in the upcoming Zelda
And Laura plays Ellie’s enemy, Abby in the  Last of Us Part 2 game! You play half the game as Ashley and half as Laura!
Literally the very first episode. I just started rewatching C1 and Matt said Ashley can’t join because she’s receiving a BAFTA.
Sam voice directs a ton of shows. He even got an Emmy for it.
The whole main cast is wildly busy. Sam does a ton of work off camera and though he gives off a slacker vibe, he has a tremendous work ethic. Travis is the company CEO and also a writer on LoVM and Marisha is the creative director. Liam and Tal do the comics and fiction books and Matt is obviously DMing but also contributes heavily to the sourcebooks. Laura does merch. Everyone contributes and it shows. The company is killing it.
I just mean she's the one most frequently absent due to other gigs.
Matt is gonna start doing some D20 as well?! Man my Dropout subscription just got even better
> Is she though? Sam works as a casting director for The Legend of Vox Machina, and he's co-written a few of the episodes. And idk if he does it currently, but he's also done behind the camera work for other shows before, so he might have that also going on.   Also co-composes most of the music for the show.  You could probably call Ash the busiest member in terms of projects outside of the immediate CritRole sphere, but the others definitely give her a run in absolute terms.
>Sam works as a casting director for The Legend of Vox Machina, and he's co-written a few of the episodes.  I'm fairly certain that is not why Sam is busy.  At least not to the point that he can't make CR episodes.
I mean honestly I don't know how they got a second season no one like critical role
Oh ok thx great character and great show.
“I poured it all down the drain!”
Yeah I remember thinking “who’s this new kid and why are they trying to shoehorn him into the show?”
Don’t waste another minute on your cryin’.
I recognized her from Avengers the second she appeared in TLOU. It's a tiny little moment but it's right there where you know the Stan Lee cameo is so every time you watch, you're paying closer attention when she has that one line.
Tara from the original Teen Titans and Gretchen from recess.
The dude writing the descriptions: Guys, watch this, one sentence will do the work of one hundred
....maybe. The female cast was pretty attractive though.
Yeah it was more an attempt at revitalization than actually "jumping the shark" but the show ended not long after this, so I think it still fits the general pattern
*She* was great. That lame slow acappella version of the theme song they also added in the later seasons was baaaaaad, though.
Started with C3 since I can't find C1 in podcast form, and C2 on Spotify only goes back to episode 16 or so
Well I don't personally think it's a spoiler. It's casting, not a story spoiler.
You know it’s funny but I enjoyed that. It seems like Spidey is always so centered in the city it was enjoyable to see him in another venue.
For some reason it was weird to see SM as a way of shortening Spider-Man. It took me a minute to figure out what SM meant.
Facts!
I mean yeah. Probably in the 5 figures range across the city.
For whatever reason Evans was so incredible at selling the man out of time thing with just a good speculative brooding look. The subway moment is incredible and I want more.
That's the kind of thing that would be perfect for Disney plus, instead of downgraded special effects for action-y mini series
Superhero Blast From The Past. I’m in!
It could've been a One-Shot.
Those were some of the most memorable scenes from that show 😢
No, but the cut scenes bring character moments that really add to the story in a positive way. I get why they were cut for the theater, but the 15 minute-longer version I think would’ve been a little bit better of a movie.
This. Game Changer is also such a gem. Their other gateway dru-…
Sure, it’s just that it’s never been in time enough for me to make the words out (probably because I listen at 2x speed)
To be fair, it's basically devolved to random noises at this point.
Fearne is easily her best character. In C1 and C2 Ashley was absent for long stretches of time and it led to her characters not being as fleshed out and Ashley herself not being as familiar with D&D. By C3 she’s much more comfortable and she plays her character perfectly
Yea Matt does a lot of voice stuff people don't realize. He was Falco in Cyberpunk Edgerunners and he is the new voice of Minsc in the upcoming Baldur's Gate 3 as well.
Was that confirmed?  I thought it was only speculated because it sounded like him in the trailer but im even more hyped for it now if he’s in it.
To tie things back to Marvel, both Matt and Laura do voices in the Midnight Suns video game last year. Matt voices the male version of The Hunter, the player character, while Laura voices Magik, who’s sounds an awful lot like Jester at times.
Emmy award winning Sam Riegel.
And yet he still finds time to aerate his wine…
Ashley also runs the Critical Role Foundation and they all have day jobs doing VO in other projects!  They're so busy, maybe they should schedule a few hours a week to all get together. Maybe some sort of game night or something, idk.
Ah gotcha.  I think that was mostly just Blindspot filming on the east coast.  Not like several different gigs.
That's because her main gig was in NYC for a while.  The rest of them worked in LA.
That was mainly during the first campaign and start of the second due to her being part of the main cast of Blindspot. Once that show wrapped up and she didn't have to stay in New York anymore she hasn't been absent.  That was just unfortunate timing due to not knowing just how much CR was going to explode and she was already committed.
> not to the point that he can't make CR episodes.  Neither my comment, nor the original comment I replied to, mentioned anything about missing episodes due to work.    But if you're alluding to the fact that Ashley has missed episodes due to work, that's because she worked on 1 show that was on the east coast.  Not because she was getting a lot more work than the other cast members.
I heard it's mostly for Goobers
And where did Boner go!?
I think the parents were too old to try to shoehorn another baby in so that was how to spice up the show.
We're nowhere near the end...
I don’t know if I agree with that. The show was built around Mike Seaver at that point. They did a baby and didn’t want to deal with having to write stories about having a toddler. So they aged the character up for easier plots for the writers.  Your jump the shark move was adding Leonardo DiCaprio. Kirk Cameron was getting older, Jeremy Miller didn’t have that teen idol factor, and they wanted to attract the tween girls again that thought Kirk was old.
I had erased that from my memory!!!  I remember when they did that crazy meta episode where Ben dreamed he lived on a TV show and everybody played themselves except Jeremy Miller. It was a surreal TV viewing experience.
I have all of 1-3 on Spotify
It’s actually my favorite SM movie of all time
I mean for me at least the friendly neighborhood part of Spidey is one of my favorites. His relationship to his city is such a great and unique part of the character it’s a bit lame to take it away.
r/respectthehyphen
Fun fact: BDSM stands for Bondage Discipline Spider-Man.
I'd even take a D+ Special Presentation
#I CANNOT WIN
It actually started as them just repeating Matt in early Campaign 2, but over time devolved into the chaos that it is today.
He's basically in every Fire Emblem game too. The best part being in Fire Emblem: Warriors where Ryoma from Fates and Chrom from Awakening share a support conversation, both voiced by Matt talking to Matt
I'm pretty sure it's him, but I'm not convinced he's playing Ganon.  That could just as easily be an Agahnim style general.
My favourite Sam Riegel story is that apparently one Christmas they all met up to exchange gifts and he just walked in, dumped a sack of wine aerators on the floor, said "and I walk away", and left the room.   No idea whether it's true or not (they said it on Talks) but it is very on brand.
He joined the Marine Corps and died in combat  I remember the very special episode of Growing Pains.  Edit:  I could have sworn he died, but the Growing Pains Wiki says he’s alive. Maybe it was a fever dream.
The best is ready to begin...
Look at the Professor of Growing Pains Studies over here ;)  I totally forgot about Leo!
When they wrote Julie off was when the show started going to shit.  I liked her a lot better than Kate.
I gotta look again but I can only go back to c2 ep16 or so which is weird
Far From Home is my second.  I was 13-17 for Tom's trilogy so he is "my" Spider-Man, so I'm preferential to him, but I enjoy all the Spidey movies to some extent. If I had to rank them:  1. No Way Home 2. Far From Home 3. Spider-Man 2 4. Spider-Man 5. Into The Spider-Verse 6. Homecoming 7. TASM 8. TASM2 9. Spider-Man 3
See this bullshit is why Peter didn’t want to pack his spider suit when he left.
S-M  better?
That's the weirdest part. I knew I was on a Marvel sub and reading a comment thread about Spider-Man and it still didn't register immediately. It's entirely a me thing, I just don't understand why it's a thing that happened.
I am willing to believe this without any further research.
Travis started it very early in c2. He was doing it solo for a few weeks before everyone else joined in. Matt's reaction the first time he did it was amazing and fair play to Travis for sticking with it after everyone made fun of him the first two times.
Travis just randomly repeated Matt one day and then he started doing it every week and then everyone joined in
Definitely a Sam Riegel thing.
The actual actor died. Many years after the show, but that might be what you’re thinking of.
*As long as we got each other...*
*Show me that smile again.*
That is so nefarious and ironic considering what happened happened with Kirk Cameron and Chelsea Noble.  Julie McCullough was great in her role, but she was written off the show because Kirk Cameron didn’t think that fact she had done work with Playboy made her appropriate for the show since Kirk was a born again Christian and didn’t think Mike Seaver should be with her.   Maybe Kirk was looking for a wife.
[here you go!](https://open.spotify.com/show/17hv7QBlDgyil26UTIHHs6?si=HOSkZ9E3RaS7Vo2fgDUy3w)
Best part is he repeated it in the most enthusiastic way while also being nearly unintelligible.
We got the world spinning right in our hands
*Don't waste another*  *miiinute on your cryin*
Shit thanks!
BTW; it was easy to forget about Leo. ABC did some weird things with the scheduling of the show that last season. GP and Who’s the Boss were moved to Saturday.
Don't mind the mask 😭 it was a desperate attempt to hide a failed sharpie free draw
This is awesome! Well done
Benign*  “Not ready to comply just yet.”
no thank you
I have nothing to add but:   "lmao"
I see this as an absolute win.
You can't quit me, I'm fired!
Yeah. They were saying that to be nice.
Oh no.  Anyway…
Even better.
Whatever man, your Toy Biz cronies are all gone. Arad gone, you gone.
I might be stupid, but what’s the difference
I guess when you spend years trying to get rid of Feige (aka the guy who came up with this entire master plan that’s brought in billions and billions and billions of dollars) and don’t do much yourself, it shows up on your performance reviews?
They should have fired him after inhumans.
That’s what happens when you try to stage a coup and take control of the board of shareholders. He should’ve been fired when he started harassing black employees at Disney and referring to them as “The Help.” Perlmutter led to Chapek’s rise through the company, and I wonder if he thought Chapek would be easier to deal with than Iger. His push to get Peltz on the board was clever and his only way to possibly regain control over Marvel Studios. But in the end Peltz backed down and Iger finally decided to deal with a long overdue lose end.
Replace him with Don Cheadle - Nobody will notice the difference.
Maybe if you piss off your bosses for years until they strip you of all power, align yourself with groups trying to destroy the company, then start campaigning with other members of the board to try to get one of your buddies made CEO, you're gonna get thrown out on your ass.
Yeah... Uh... No shit.   I don't think anyone actually thought he was laid off. That's just the polite business speak for when an executive is fired or forced out of a company.
**Hah.**  We all had figured that out, you miserable prick.
Anyone wanna tl;dr? I don't wanna pay for WSJ
I mean yea, he's right.    Disney finally got rid of the trash.   🤷‍♂️   They were being polite pretending they just laid him off, but if he wants to admit that they shitcanned his dumb ass, that's fine with everyone.
Oh no the billionaire was fired! How is he going to survive now? Won't you all think about rent, in this economy?   Cry me a river.
Good bro, your 80. Retire already 😭
Ladies and gentlemen, we got him.
>OK, but that's worse. I mean you–you do get how that's worse?  Chidi, Good Place
No one cares , Ike
Yes, they fired you for trying to stage a coup inside of Disney. I think you know that very well my friend.
we know.
Should have happened years ago…but better late then never
You mean the racist [Ike Perlmutter](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/cobnyk/til_that_when_don_cheadle_replaced_terrence/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1)
About time
Should have fired him 10 fucking years ago.
Good.
Either way he’s gone and good riddance
It’s cool Ike, you can collect a fat $350 (before taxes) a week from unemployment
Either way LMFAO bye douche canoe
Ok….and?
Even better
Good, that rascist sexist should have got axed years ago
Oh, honey.....we knew that.
Good fucking riddance
Must be the only time this guy has given us good news.
Yeah good. You’re a fucking monster, Ike.
You know everyone is trying to make you look nicer right, Ike? Why did you out yourself?  Not that anyone is surprised or anything.
The guy who said all black people look alike when talking about people not caring about Don Cheadle replacing Terrence Howard.
Hey Ike; man to man, everyone knows you weren’t laid off.
That's not the brag you think it is, my guy
Fuck you Ike
I get the impression he was not well liked, and so there are probably a lot of very happy people….
Finally
“So that’s it after all these years, goodbye and good luck?” “I don’t recall saying good luck.”
Good riddance
Good... Did he expect sympathy?
Lol severance doesn't equal being on the payroll ikkke
Are we supposed to be sad for him or something? Lmao. Finally they fired him.
We know Ike that's why we like it
Fucking good. He’s a racist piece of shit.
This does put a smile on my face.
Perlmutter sucks, I’m so glad he is gone. An incompetent stooge who was a whiny fuckface to boot.
Surely this will mean all Marvel products will now instantly be super good! *huffs copium*
Good.
Boo f’n hoo. Now go away.
Good.
Nothing of value was lost.
Fool, he could be cleaning up with unemployment benefits at his salary.
Even better
Cool.
Ok, and?
Hallelujah
Even better then
Put a W in Disney's column, then
Oh no!  Anyways…
Good. Fuck Ike
We know. And we celebrated.
Bew hoo
Good.
Good
Someone cue the small violin
Good. Fuck Ike.
Good
Well, good.
buddy - we all knew.
Oh no. Does this mean I should feel bad for this asshole getting fired and not being properly laid-off like the innocent he is?  Anyway…
Bye Ike
Good
Even better.
Man, he would spin a whole drama out of this.
He’s lucky they let him stick around for as long as they did.
Good . Bye!
Even better
Eat it!! Attempted a hostile takeover with cheapskate chapek and that’s what ya get! Slime! I hear DC is hiring
It's just business Ike. You understand.
Good.
He sounds upset, maybe the door hit him on the ass on his way out?
Byeeeeeeee!
Yeah no shit sucka
Good
Well, bye.
That just makes it all the more wonderful!
Good riddance
But of course that this dipshit went crying over to the Wall Street Journal...
Yes, very sad... Anyway.
Rad.
No one will miss you Ike.
Me: “Good.”
Oh no! Anyway...
Tragic Ike's Last Dance.
Go away, fuck, nobody cares.
How Ike Perlmutter made Disney a hero with one sentence.
Nobody cares, cunt.
 Good.
Thanks for the good news!
You are out Ike!
Ok bro cool story
"I was fired, I wasn't sacked - why do you people keep saying I was sacked?"
You (Ike) are all about the bottom line but you wanted to fire the most successful producer of all time in Kevin Feige? What? 😂
who cares...the important thing is that he's gone ..either way though good fucking riddance
“Good Riddance” - Symbiote Spider-Man
Sympathy level: zero.
We know and we couldn't care less!
Good riddance
Good. Ike is a dick.
K.
Oh go on , cry me a river.
Good riddance.  I see nothing negative about his firing. Bigoted POS.
DJ Khaled hot wings interview vibes from this  "Let me tell you something Just because I stop doesn't mean I quit!"  That's exactly what it means
Greedy hoarder. These guys remind me of fat dragons sitting on all the gold whilst the townsfolk worry whether they’re gonna fly overhead and shit all over them.
Even better
Everyone: We know.  Also everyone: 🎉🎉🎉
That’s hot
Music to my ear holes
You deserved it Ike.
If companies truly wanted to save money, they would cut all executives.  _Truthfully, does anyone think they really add the value commensurate with their compensation?!?_
Ok, boomer
He ruined the MCU with that godawful Inhumans show. Glad he's gone, but the show's stigma still haunts the Royal Family. The damage is already done. As long as the show remains official mainline canon, the MCU will never heal in my eyes.  Fuck this guy!
“I wasn’t laid off!! I was fired!”  Eitri - “but, that’s what laid off means”
Kiss my entire black ass, Ike. Butt-horn.
I could have sworn I read he was fired the entire time. I don't remember it being said that he was laid off.
For the kind of guy he is, it's not a badge of honor.
He’s trying to get unemployment.
Good
He’s just trying to get the story straight so he can pick up that unemployment check.
Who is this man?
That what laid off means.
I dunno man, when Ike was a part of it, you got the Infinity Saga. When he got sidelined, you got phase four.
Cool, cool, cool.
….. isn’t that the same thing?
Anyone have text past paywall?
Ok boomer
Oh no he’ll certainly be poor now
If you play it in slow motion you can see the exact moment his heart breaks
Whatever. Regardless, no one‘s sorry to see you go out the door, not to be returning. At least this way, you don’t have to put “fired” on your resumé.
It’s the same picture
No shit
Every time I see a picture of this dude, I wonder if it’s Danny Huston doing method acting as Perlmutter.
"I didn't want salmon! I said it four times!"
So anyway, what did you guys have for dinner?
What's the difference?
Well tough shit and good riddance
whatever will that rich man do
Surprised he lasted that long when he was literally part of Trump’s cornball cronies, heading the Department of Veteran Affairs.
Waaahhhh
Good.
When I jumped into the pool, I wasn't wet, I was dryn't...
>“All they talk about is box office, box office,” Mr. Perlmutter said. “I care about the bottom line. I don’t care how big the box office is. Only people in Hollywood talk about box office.” “I learned one thing about creative people my whole life: You cannot give them an open credit card.…They’re doing this for 30 years, why would they change?”
Potato, potăto  Not shedding any tears either way.
He was like 100 years old. Definitely didn’t need to be in charge.
Well, he’s not wrong in that the Marvel movies are too expensive. The recent ones, especially, have probably lost some money.
Consumers: "We don't care; you were a pair of cement shoes weighing down the brand and actively sabotaging its success. Laid off? Fired? Who cares? Gone is gone, thankfully."  Now Ike can go suckle on the teat of DeSantis and his radical peers. Ike has a track record of financial support given to radical right wing US political interests. Let them dry his tears.
Good riddance
Oh look, it's a call for sympathy from Ike "black people all look the same" Perlmutter.
Fun fact ike perlmutters favourite food is a Costco hotdog and a yoghurt.
Probably long overdue tbh.
I really don’t feel sorry for high ups getting laid off. I’m sure he made millions and probably got a severance that would set me up for life.
So a racist, misogynist and homophobic man who thought healthcare doesn’t deserve privacy got fired.  Good.
Peons are “laid off”. Not sure why perlmutter would think he was laid off.
he should have been fired much earlier.
Even better
Good, you should have been fired years ago you useless turd.
He’s basically Duck from Mad Men.
Good riddance
Glad he got to experience that before he withered away for good. POS troglodyte.
*Gives him an old paperclip on the way out*
Oh...no?
Yes Ike, we know. Fired for cause and good reason. Buh-bye.
I'm not a corporate person. Is there actually a difference?
That’s the guy who made Inhumans wasn’t it?
Good good !
Good, stay the fuck away.
I love good news. I just love good news.
Look Ike, even if you weren’t a gigantic piece of shit, the fact that an octogenarian senior citizen was in charge of an entertainment franchise directly aimed at young people is the dumbest thing ever. That would be like if Abe Vigoda ran TikTok. Retire already, step aside and make room for the new line of leaders. This applies to literally every old person in power. Thank you for your years of service, but it’s time to step down and let the younger generation run things. Still be there if they need help or advice, but you’ve had your turn. The new guard will either keep up your old good way of running things, or cut back the dumb bullshit you insisted on. Young people need to run more things, because the world isn’t just for senior citizens with ideologies from the 60s and 70s.
“Oh no!   The consequences of my actions……….”
We know, Ike. They were being nice to your miserable ass because you’re old. Thanks for proving why that’s silly, I guess.
Tomato, tomahto.
What's the difference?
We know Ike.  We know…. We just don’t care…
That's sad.  Oh well. Who's excited for GotG3 tickets?
… what did this go do? Like some people seem to have a strong opinion on him
After everything he did, good riddance
Good
cya
Bro’s too dumb to realize they were throwing him a bone. We all realized it was a euphemism, except for him apparently.
hehe <3
We know man. The “layed off” fib was to your benefit, not Disneys lmao.
Good.
Ding Dong, the Ike is gone. Good riddance!
Immaculate W
👍
Whats the difference? Politics?
Good to hear. Now Ike, go away and hate women in solutiude, you corpulant jackass.
I can’t believe WSJ published such a puff piece on Perlmutter without reporting his racist/sexist behavior in blocking movies with people of color and women.  Shame on them.
# YOU GET WHAT YOU FUCKING DISERVE
Yah, Ike we all knew that. We were just being polite.
"Disney fired me because I'm a bigoted asshole" there I fixed it
>“All they talk about is box office, box office,” Mr. Perlmutter said. “I care about the bottom line. I don’t care how big the box office is. Only people in Hollywood talk about box office.”  Well isn't that just completely backwards, a Hollywood movie studio cares about their ticket sales? Who'd have thought?
And nothing of value was lost.
In other news, water is wet and fire is hot.  Why does he think anyone doesn't know this?
There’s a scene in the movie “PCU” where the dreadful dean criticizes something awful happening in the Pit, and Droz looks over his newspaper, shrugs, and then goes back to reading.  If you’ve seen the movie you might be able to picture it  I’m a gif of Droz in that scene.
Me: Why is anyone even talking to this assclown?  <Looks at URL - [WSJ.com](https://WSJ.com)\>  Me: Ahhhh. Moving on.
Cool you deserve it your racist dick head
It's really hard for me to dislike the guy cause he and his wife are supporters and contributors to, something I very, strongly believe in, the Innocence Project.  There are very few things more hellish than going to prison for something you didn't do.   I'm pretty sure all of us would support that cause.
Lol yeah we know Ike
Good riddance ~Tobey voice~
Should've happened sooner, you magnificent piece of shit. Go fuck a light socket.
Bye
We really need a "No Sh\*t!" award to give to him.
My response:  B😭😭 H😩😩  Fuck off and go extinct, you bigoted old piece of crap. Nobody wants your input in Marvel.
Good riddance and goodbye.
Nice.
Sounds good to me.
Who cares?
"Disney Fired Me From Marvel, I Wasn’t Laid Off"  Good on Disney, then.
A podcast I was listening to the other day laid out the brutal reality of billionaires: ‘the only comeuppance they’ll get is something slightly doesn’t go their way and they’re embarrassed in front of their billionaire mates’  (This quote was directly aimed at Perlmutter)
He still owns stock, right? What's his complaint? Sheesh he needs to retire.
Oh no! Anyways..
Oh no, anyway......
zdx
Good.
Common Bob Iger W.
"creatives now have control of the company" he said, like that was a bad thing.  <facepalm>. He is the largest shareholder tho
Good
I wasn’t fired I was laid off, you wouldn’t know the difference, I asked for Salmon, four times. This wedding is horse shit.
And we should care about that "technical difference," why?
Just on the terminology, what is the difference?
Good.
Are we supposed to sympathise??
Dude, you're a thousand years old, time for you to move on and let someone else get a job.
Good. You’re a twat.
And??
Good Riddance, hopefully Disney steps in to the issues in the comics publishing.
"Israeli commando" - that means nothing at all to me.  He hated to promote black people and women, thought they were bad business.  Fuck the hell off, you're old, means you'll die soon along with that old-ass way of thinking, bye.
Good riddance to that racist MAGA trash.
Perlmutter had nothing to add either. That's why they fired him.
Thanks for the good news!
I got something!  "lol"
Lmao
If it’s all the same to you, I think I’ll have that drink now 🍻
Think goes for everyone. Glad the guy's gone.
Lmaooooo
You can’t frog me you’re my wife!
He doesn't know the meaning of the word.
It’s such a hilarious self-own
Most excellent reaction.
Yes that's sad. Anyway...
When I learned this guy was behind Toy Biz it made sooo much sense to me.  Growing up in the 90's, I always thought of the Toy Biz Marvel stuff as ugly and cheap looking.  It was clear that they were re-using molds which wasn't altogether bad or uncommon of in those days, except a lot of times when Toy Biz did it it felt so shameless and often resulted in figures not looking like they went together with others in the same line or just looking bad (see [Spider-Woman](https://www.figurerealm.com/galleries/ironman/SpiderWoman-Loose.jpg) and [Invisible Woman](https://i.etsystatic.com/16492194/r/il/8b7cc9/1898758482/il_fullxfull.1898758482_bgjg.jpg)).
Explain plz?
Laid off basically means *your role* is unneeded and they have no plans to replace you, fired means they do not want *you* anymore
Laid off is.... Well the company has changed and doesn't need your services anymore but thank you for all you've done. We appreciate it...we wish you well.   &#x200B;  Being fired is... You fucked up and we don't want you here anymore before you fuck up anything else.  Get out before we throw you out..   &#x200B;  but when it comes from the person fired it's usually them saying something about it being unfair and without just cause usually just before they try and sue for wrongful termination. It's easier to argue you didn't fuck up and sue for that than it is to argue the company didn't restructure and eliminate the need for you...   of course everything I said is a gross oversimplification
A helpful way I’ve always thought of it is:  Laid off: it’s not you, it’s me  Fired: it’s not me, it’s you
Laid off: "The company is downsizing due to budget cuts and unfortunately that means your position is terminated as we are forced to restructure.  We've greatly enjoyed the work you've provided to our company and wish you all the best in your future endeavors.  Please let us know if we can help you in any way."  Fired: "We're sorry but it's just not working out.  Please give HR your company credit card and ID.  Here's a box to empty your desk, a member of security staff will help you and see you to your car."
In reality it means very little, you have been deemed to not be of benefit to the company in either case. Laidoff is typically not solely because you are a poor perforer or you did something that warranted being fired, but your role is no longer necessary or the company can no longer afford to employ you.   The most tangible difference tends to be that being laid off can come with a reasonable severance package, where being fired very often does not. Many bigger companies will also provide some severance if you are fired for performance vs cause, which typically would result in nothing, but a layoff can be something like 6 months of pay/benefits.   It's effectively a technicality in this case. Disney probably wanted to get rid of him and they used their layoffs as the avenue.
Nobody else mentioned this, but depending on the industry layoffs are often temporary. It happened a lot during covid when many businesses weren't able to operate as usual.
You can sometimes qualify for a severance package too, if you are laid off. If you are fired, very unlikely you'll receive anything other than a last paycheck.
They should've fired him when he veto'd Black Panther, when he got that crazy dude Terry fired, when he veto'd a Samuel L Jackson solo film. This man is full-on vigilant anti-black racist. He's scum and has terrible, terrible business sense.
They should've fired him long before he ruined Inhumans.
We'll notice it, but we'll just deal with it
This is like that time I had cheese pizza dinner at Don Cheadle’s house
This should be higher up.
This should be gilded
Im a WSJ subscriber, I assumed they had the same sort of setup as NYT where you could share a limited number of articles. It is unfortunately very pro-Ike, although anyone who is familiar with the issue knows he deserved it:   >	Isaac “Ike” Perl­mut­ter says Walt Dis­ney Co. fired him as chair­man of Mar­vel En­ter­tain­ment be­cause he pushed Dis­ney too ag­gres­sively to cut costs and ran afoul of the cre­ative ex­ec­u­tives whom newly re­turned Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Robert Iger wants to em­power.  >	In a rare in­ter­view, the 80-year-old Mr. Perl­mut­ter spoke to The Wall Street Jour­nal about his dis­missal from Dis­ney last week, his re­la­tion­ship with Mr. Iger, and mis­steps he feels Dis­ney has made in re­cent years.   >	Dis­ney is leg­endary for the loy­alty it en­gen­ders in most typ­i­cal em­ploy­ees. But Mr. Perl­mut­ter was no typ­i­cal cor­po­rate em­ployee, nor did he act like one. If he didn’t like what he saw from lead­er­ship, he picked up the phone and aired his con­cerns to pow­er­ful al­lies like for­mer CEO Bob Chapek and ac­tivist in­vestor Nel­son Peltz.  >	When Dis­ney was bat­tling with Flor­ida Gov. Ron De­San­tis, Mr. Perl­mut­ter said he called him, too. “Ron, you’re right. Dis­ney doesn’t have the right to get in­volved with pol­i­tics.” > Mr. Perl­mut­ter, who is also one of Dis­ney’s largest in­di­vid­ual share­hold­ers—he owns ap­prox­i­mately 30 mil­lion shares of Dis­ney, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple close to him, worth about $3 bil­lion—said he has tried for years to con­vince Dis­ney to spend less on its Mar­vel Stu­dios su­per­hero movies, which he be­lieves are too long and too ex­pen­sive to pro­duce.   >	“I have no doubt that my ter­mi­na­tion was based on fun­da­men­tal dif­fer­ences in busi­ness be­tween my think­ing and Dis­ney lead­er­ship, be­cause I care about re­turn on in­vest­ment,” Mr. Perl­mut­ter said.

Seriously. FFS I wish all the Boomers and Silents would finally goddamn retire, stop making policy and product, and kindly leave space for Gen X, Millennials, and Zoomers to have a little.
Because he dared to put money into making said product great. Even if the movies RoI want the greatest they were making 10x that in licensing, merch, and toys. It was waaaaay more important the movies did everything it could to keep the audience impressed then to reign in the costs (also most of the post Disney purchased costs use inter-company cross-charging of third party costs, to inflate production cost numbers anyways).   But Like was waaaaay too single minded to understand it. He could have let Kevin do his thing, ride out his career with people looking fondly (or at least not giving a damn). But no he had to take as many swipes at the golden goose for making eggs a different way then he would and will go out as the angry old racist and sexist guy who failed up until someone finally said they had enough.
not even a boomer
Oooh tell me more? What role did he have in inhumans?
Actually, when Ike was sidelined from the movies was when we got phase 3. Black Panther and Captain Marvel would never have happened under Ike’s watch, and he in fact worked vigorously to keep them from happening, the racist sexist fucker.
Laid off: we don't need you anymore.   Fired: we don't want you anymore.
Laid off only happens to peasants.... he probably thinks.  Or he's just a weirdo.
"laid off" = let go (removed from their position of employment) as part of an impersonal headcount reduction  "fired" = let go 'for cause', meaning because of something that they personally did wrong
Laid off means they'd like to still employ you but have no work for you to do and/or no budget to pay you for it.  Firing means they no longer wish to employ you.
I really, really hope the words "Take a hike, Ike" were employed at some point.
Yeah pretty much  confirms it was a cost cutting measure - sure he was waiting up tons of payroll
IDK keeping the MCU a playground for mostly white males is a contribution. A shitty one, but it counts.

Laid off
That man's playing Galaga!
I haven't used the actual reddit app in a while so it's been a minute since I've seen snoos or whatever they're called, but I just have to say yours is the coolest ive ever seen. They all typically look the same and boring to me. Yours is cool.
I would have loved to have had toys when I was a kid in the 90s, but they all looked so ugly. I mean, wtf is [this Toy Biz](https://i.imgur.com/PgMPaad.jpg)? And why did she come out half way through the series only to be one of the hardest characters to find? She was popular!
"girls don't play with toys" probably not an actual quote but it was his motto. Iirc it's the same reason videogames never ever tried to appeal to girls/women until the sims came out and all the execs went wait whaaaaaa... GIRLS bought a VIDEOGAME?!?!?!
But they did give us [Missile-Dick Punisher](https://ibb.co/wdBTsj9).
Lol. At first I was like, that Spider-Woman figure doesn’t look so bad. Then I saw the invisible woman 🤣🤣😅
Perlmutter and Avi Arad rose to the top of Marvel because their toy division was so strong. They have very little knowledge and love for the product, but they were in charge for a large part of the 90s.      Basically the premise is that people who were just lucky because saturday morniing cartoons easily pushed cheap toys, but they were continually made more powerful.
Thank you! I really always thought they were the same just “laid off” seemed better to say
They are actively paying you to stay the hell away
So basically whether if someone takes his place or not?
Outcome is still the same. Dude’s out of a job.
That’s not really true.  In some situations it’s the same thing.  In certain lines of work, even with a union, you can be laid off and replaced by an outsourced company.  The role is still needed but You specifically are not, or your work title is not.  Therefore, you are replaced for cheaper labor.  They don’t want you, but your role is needed.
Oh so laid off is a redundancy
What was this dudes role even at the point he was fired though? Like, he lost pretty much every bit of control he had over anything in 2018. Is there even a meaningful distinction here?
>The most tangible difference tends to be that being laid off can come with a reasonable severance package, where being fired very often does not. Many bigger companies will also provide some severance if you are fired for performance vs cause, which typically would result in nothing, but a layoff can be something like 6 months of pay/benefits.  An executive at Perlmutter's level has a contract that was negotiated and likely has very specific clauses around termination. The typical layoff v. terminated structure is much different with his type of contract, and I'm guessing the arguments he's making has something to do with trying to get them to fully pay whatever was left of his contract. Almost surely there will be a settlement negotiation and Disney won't want this dragging out in the press so there will be a swift end to it so they can move on.
Do you mean Terence Howard? Cos I don't think that was Perlmutter, that was Terrance asking for more money for IM2 than the star was getting.  Like, generally if Ike made a decision the decision doesn't make any goddamn sense, but in the case of Terrance Howard getting the boot, it kinda made sense and got us Don Cheadle
Not just racist. He is a large part of the reason we never got Black Widow or Captain Marvel movie earlier. He didnt believe in a hero movie with a female lead. Guy just goes all in on all the prejudices.
I’m sorry but how stupid is he to not see how popular Samuel L “Motherfucking” Jackson is

Putting aside his friendship with the fascist governor of my state, there's no reason that any 80-year-old should be running an entertainment division of a multi-billion dollar company aimed primarily at people who are young enough to be his grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
I'm talking about Ike
He pushed inhumans as an X-Men and Mutants replacements, while inhumans has never been popular or liked by marvel fans, no surprise he failed and inhumans got even more disliked by majority of people
Thank you very much for clarifying.
I think might not have unemployed, just like Ike
Feige walking around wearing a pin that says “I don’t like Ike”
But think of how much he was saving the company on paper clips!
What? That’s literally the opposite of what happened here. “Lay-offs” are cost-cutting, he’s saying that he wasn’t just laid off as part of cost cutting, he was fired because he “clashed wit creative executives” (aka he was shitty at his job).  How does your comment have 30 upvotes? The headline literally says the opposite. Click on the article, you don’t need to read past the sub-head: “Disney says chairman’s dismissal was part of cost-cutting plan; he says it was over a clash with creative executives”   Edit: Lol ok guess he figured it out. Didn’t need to delete your whole ass account though homie. I wasn’t going to attack you
Technically correct
Were the hires he was responsible for at marvel racially biased?
Not a contribution if it takes away.
He thought we wouldn’t notice, but we did.
I understood that reference
Yeah, I can certainly see that too.
>And why did she come out half way through the series only to be one of the hardest characters to find? She was popular!  Because Ike has always been convinced that nobody wanted action figures of female characters. In his mind, a toy of a female character is a 'doll', and boys don't want to play with dolls and girls don't like superheroes. It's the exact same reason he refused to greenlight the *Black Widow* and *Captain Marvel* movies.
It’s like Reba after a week of only eating meth crystals and cat food.
Ah!  That Rogue had fallen deep into the darkest recesses of my memory and frankly I wish it had stayed there.  To their credits, they *did* seem to improve into the later 90's, which, as coincidence would have it, [is around the time Perlmutter became more focused on Marvel as a whole and less-so just Toy Biz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Perlmutter#Marvel).
I can't hate because they gave me this: [https://64.media.tumblr.com/93a6e086d003676006dff098f6a57bfd/e4ba3708812024c6-8a/s1280x1920/60e09f59ae42674b3d13b1aae9f25974107ab2b3.jpg](https://64.media.tumblr.com/93a6e086d003676006dff098f6a57bfd/e4ba3708812024c6-8a/s1280x1920/60e09f59ae42674b3d13b1aae9f25974107ab2b3.jpg)
Girls are too busy washing dishes and darning socks right Ike?
They made many business decisions that haunt the brand today. Spiderman film rights to Sony in perpetuity... Universal east coast theme park rights in perpetuity...
Avi didn't want sony to share spider man with marvel studios https://gamerant.com/spiderman-sony-disney-marvel-studios-deal-avi-arad-reaction/
I think Arad was at least passionate about the idea of comic book movies, and he helped drive the genre into the mainstream, even if he’s been fundamentally wrong about a lot of things.  Perlmutter, on the other hand, was always just a power-mad businessman with highly questionable political and social beliefs, who liked making money (but not spending it, as he’s a notorious skinflint).
Which is a shame because Toybiz’s original marvel legends were, at least in my opinion, the best action figure on the market! The amazing amount of detail put into each sculpt, with beautiful shiny, weighty clamshell packaging, and each figure had an astonishing 32 points of articulation when the standard figure at the time had 5! Truly a technical feat! Not to mention the inclusion of a free comic book all for the very reasonable price of 9 bucks!
Arad has knowledge and love for it, I think. He was part of the development of the Spider-Verse concept in the 90s. He founded Marvel Studios too.   Except his meddling has also ruined many many projects. So. Two sides.
All things being equal... if you got fired, it is because you fucked up. If the economy tanks or your upper management mismanaged the company into the ground and the company has yo now lay you/others off. Thats.. well a lay off and 99% most likely not your fault.
Firing is you lose your job based in something you did, ie workplace violations     Laid off is you lose your job based in something the company did, ie downsizing, closing locations, ect
They just had different work philosophies. Disney cared about making money, Ike cared about saving money.
Laid off means "nothing against you".   Fired means "it's specifically against you".
He specifically said that Cheadle could replace Howard because 'Black people look the same.'
You read the propaganda that was pushed out. As /u/rosalui said, it was entirely the fact that he was black that they replaced him. Think about how nuts Paltrow is and they brought her back again.
Im pretty sure terrence was just asking for what he was supposed to get in his contract with marvel for sequel appearances. Perlmutter didnt want to pay it out, so terrence was fired.
Old men are usually not the most current on interpreting pop culture.   You can predictably plant a tree around that seed of truth and watch it take root whenever you go see the new Super Mario movie this weekend, created by senior-aged persons Shigeru Miyamoto and Chris Melandri.

Well if they were really good at their job and well liked by their peers then that’d be fine.  This guy sounds he’s been an asshole his whole life though, not just when he turned 80.
Yeah he isn't. He's too old
Ty!
Your comprehension is bit off - did you read his words / comments   - guess you can't read between the lines   . what  do you think ike is going to say - his huge Salary for a ceremonial position is in fact a cost cutting measure despite what ike says or is trying to spin it . He's just trying to make himself look better
He spent years killing off approval of making movies like Black Panther and Capt Marvel because he didn't think they'd make money. He wasn't just wrong, he was fucking wrong.
You shouldn't have killed my mother and destroyed my Walkman!
Also why he had Shane Black change Dr. Maya Hansen from being one of the main villains who makes it to the end of the movie to a secondary villain who just dies halfway through.  >["We had finished the script, and we were given a no-holds-barred memo saying that cannot stand and we've changed our minds because, after consulting, we've decided that toy won't sell as well if it's a female," Black explained. "So, we had to change the entire script because of toy-making."](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a808010/iron-man-3-dropped-female-villain-marvel-worried-about-toy-sales/)
>	alleged comments and actions by Perlmutter, such as replacing Terrence Howard – who wanted more money to continue playing James Rhodes – with Don Cheadle, arguing that black people "look the same."  Barf on *that* comment.
Problematically, I guarantee they assumed that was what girls liked about Sims if you look at games marketed to women and girls around the time.
And when that came back and bite them in the ass, good guy Ike decided it's time to promote the IPs Marvel still fully control, leading to X-Men and F4 being pushed back.  And I sincerely thought he might have had a hand in making sure One More Day is a thing as soon as he realized Iron Man had a chance to blow up and put Marvel Studios on the map.
Marvel wouldn’t exist if they didn’t sell Spiderman rights
Correct me if I’m wrong, but didn’t that save them from bankruptcy?
Wow, dumbasses!
Arad was passionate. He’s just also a complete hack when it comes to stories.
They had some real toy fans working for them, but really anyone running a corporation that large is basically just a suit working for the investors. The toys themselves are really just a byproduct of making money to them.
Why does this comment sound like an ad?
Yeah that wasn’t the point. I’m pointing out the difference between firing and laying off. Firing means we are going to pay you a severance because we don’t want you here for whatever reason. Even if it means paying you x years worth of salary today.   Why he was fired is kind of irrelevant. Yes it’s because he had a different philosophy. But laying him off means they wanted to save money or whatever. Firing is a distinct, we don’t want you and we have someone else who can do better
Ike cared about hating women and minorities
So kinda like the nice way to break up vs. the mean way. “It’s not you it’s me” vs “yeah it’s totally you”.
Better way of putting it.
Makes me think of the tech company laidoffs a few months ago and how some people treated it like those people were fired
That’s the reason he figured they could get away with the recast, not the reason for the recast itself. He got shafted for the same reason as Norton. Perlmutter being a huge racist is a separate issue to him being a pennypincher
Cheadle and Howard literally couldn’t look more different as well like they don’t look remotely similar yeeesh
Yeah but she didn't demand more money that RDJ, while he may have made a racist remark it was definitely fueled by his demands for more money.

Oh dang, you're right he's 80! I guess I should say Ok, dinosaur
Yeah it goes farther. House of M (getting rid of 90% of mutants), death of Xavier and Wolverine, the rise of Inhumans, is specifically Ike after the berth of Marvel studios, attempting to devalue characters that they sold the rights to and attempt to replace them with bevy of new similar but legally distinct and separate to.   Putting Inhumans on the Movie lineup was his doing even though Kevin had no desire or real way to use them in the MCU. It was forced into AoS to setup the movie. And the second Kevin won the power struggle it was moved over to TV because Ike still controlled that till D+ was announced.
He was also the one trying to force the Inhumans to be the New Mutants *rimshot*.  But yeah, he tried to make the Inhumans something they aren’t. Hopefully with him gone and that Black Bolt cameo we’ll get something proper with them now.
Jesus. I had started to scroll down and read the comments and then also read the article.  What a fucking a colossal scum bag.
Christ, Perlmutter is trash. I'd be curious how well one-off villain toys even sold to begin with. Seems like just a stupid hill to die on, even for a misogynist.
Oh my god, Perlmutter's shit opinion of toy sales is the reason that we got such a crappy Extremis adaptation with a villain that had no clear reason to be a villain? Extraordinary.
Imagine wasting a Black/RDJ team-up that had previously made something as incredible as *Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang* by setting such stupid restrictions.
And then they didnt even make any toys based on killian, at least I dont think they did.
Yes and I'd argue that it the rights spread out is a blessing in disguise.     Look at WB and DC that had lots of opportunity to biuild IP but didn't.     Marvel licensing their properties all over the place indirectly help build them up. Fox saturday cartoons compared to DC's Super friends.     Merchandising. Video Games. Marvel vs Capcom series
I mean, that’s a pretty extreme outcome isn’t it?
What? Come on. Marvel is an IP. It wouldn’t have just ceased to exist. Unless you’re referring to Marvel Studios. That’s more likely. But making absolute statements about alternate futures is a losing proposition. You can’t possibly know what would or wouldn’t exist today in an alternate universe.
Its also worth noting that perlmutters original offer to sony was the film rights to the entire marvel comics library for 25 million. Sony said no, because they didnt think the other characters rights were worth anything and agreed to a deal for the film rights to spider man for 10 million instead.
Well, it had already went bankrupt. That’s how Perlmutter was able to seize control. Selling the Spider-Man rights alone didn’t turn it around. The big comeback was from taking out a huge high risk loan to start the MCU.   https://slate.com/business/2021/03/marvel-comics-history-bankruptcy-cinematic-universe.html
Its doesn't sound like an ad at all!  Now, while I'm here let me talk to you about Bend-Lok©!  Bend-Lok© is a space age compound in a can that will lock anything you spray on it, making it waterproof and airtight!  Look, I've replaced the bottom of this boat with a SCREEN DOOR!  But after coating it with Bend-Lok©, I can safely row it across this lake!  Did you know you can get not 1, not 2 but 3 cans of Bend-Lok© for only $19.95?!  Call now at 1-800-BEND-LOK
He’s on to us, Ike! Run!
Oh yeah, I wasn't disagreeing with you or anything, I was just being facetious about Perlmutter.  Obviously the company's (any company) bottom line is maximizing profit, not reusing friggin' post-it notes and paperclips to save a few bucks. It doesn't really align with what I'd imagine a Chairman's top priorities would be, so they showed him the door.
Yep.
These are overlapping Venn Diagrams.
I thought Norton was trying to take more creative control, and thats why they parted ways. Howard just wanted more money.
You're clearly not getting the point that if he was a white man it would've simply been negotiated away, something for the lawyers to scrap over, like what happened with Marvel and Paltrow when they had their dispute. It was eventually resolved, water under the bridge. They didn't have a problem with firing Terrence because of his race. The fact he was viewed as *replacable* was because of his race, the point being that audiences and producers are much more ready to dehumanise a black man than a white woman. As a beautiful white woman, they didn't feel she could be replaced, so instead they wrote her out of scripts for the next few films that had Tony until things cooled down.
Hard right, hard racist yet ahead of his time trans ally? Did the dude have a trans kid or something? Trans support is so far removed from his normal social and political leanings and he was a big supporter far before it started getting super mainstream.  At least the dude had one good quality to him.
The pegs at Target indicate that these were shelf warmers regardless
Saw that movie before the MCU started, so when I heard IM3 was being directed by Shane fuckin' Christmas Black? I was damn excited. After watching it it was *okay* but not what I expected from that duo. I couldn't figure out how Shane could lose his touch; the answer is he didn't, he got handcuffed by a blind, racist, woman hating, old piece of shit.   Shane can't really work with RDJ again in the MCU unless time-fuckery, but that man deserves another shot at a movie that doesn't have Ike forcing shitty choices.
Pretty known truth. W/o selling off large chunks (rights) of main Marvel characters, Marvel Comics would have been toast.
You're right. The IP would have landed somewhere. Hell if there was a fire sale, DC may have ended up buying it
Should have put a sunset clause in it like 50 years into the future even instead of just the just make one film every 5.75 years clause.
Bend-Loki   We are in a marvel sub
in both cases it was "thought they were more important to the series than they actually were"
Two words: Edward Norton
Bro Terrance threatened to walk if he didn't get paid what he demanded so they let him walk. Stop trying to turn it into some race rage bait bullshit, turns out some people can be racist and still make a decent decision here and there.
Edward Norton.
> At least the dude had one good quality to him.  He has at least two.  He is also a contributor to the Innocent Project.
It does stand out for sure. I also noticed the article assigns him credit for buying Marvel when it was in bankruptcy.    If that's true, I think it goes to show you that people can be pretty nuanced if you let yourself see it. I certainly don't align with Ike politically, but its hard to deny he is one of the few responsible for helping to start the MCU. Glad he's gone though!
Do not quote me. I may entirely be speaking ignorance. But I have read before that in some eastern countries they are more okay being Trans than people being gay. Like some countries push for gay people to transition and then it's no longer homosexual in their religion or ideals, etc etc  Again just something I read on here a while back. Please correct me if I'm wrong someone!
I am aware. To say that if Spider-Man wasn’t sold to Sony, that Marvel would cease to exist is still an extreme statement.  Edit: there were competing offers on the table, critical thinking time
Exactly. The idea that Marvel would just cease to exist is just nonsense. It would exist in some form.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deathlok  Note my flair and I'm on a re-watch of AoS.  Plus it worked better for the 800 number
no im pretty sure that's a fic on Ao3 you'd get in trouble if your family caught you reading
One of the most powerful producers in Marvel made it about race. Jfc bro.
Marvel tried to reduce the previously negotiated price. He was being given a paycut
This is certainly the case in countries like Iran and Syria, but Perlmutter is Israeli, and Israel is the most progressive country in the Middle East for gay rights (so much so it's led to criticism of "pinkwashing" the state's ongoing behaviour towards Palestinians.)
As a company they would have probably gone under, we wouldn’t have the MCU as rights to characters would have most likely been sold off piecemeal during bankruptcy proceedings.
Jfc bro, was it racist when they did the same thing to Edward Norton?? They let him walk away too and didn renegotiate…
Because he was the highest paid actor in the first one. Why would the side kick get more pay than the lead once RDJ proved himself? He absolutely deserved a paycut.
Interesting thanks for the info!
Nah, they could've worked out other deals, but they prioritized comics over anything else. There was nothing stopping them from partnering for movies, but they decided selling it was faster and gave immediate gains.  Then the MCU happened and dwarfs anything the comics have done in the past decade.
I can't imagine how California is ever a cost efficient choice for filming at this point, but good luck to him.
Live Free or Josh Harder.
'k.
Love the enthusiasm. But that’s maybe an abuse of his power.
If, for instance, its in space/other universe mostly, isn't it cheaper to shoot in the UK for the tax breaks?
I personally don’t view it as such. Public officials often make attempts to woo private businesses through legal incentives in order to stimulate their district’s economy. Jobs and economic growth are what their constituents want.  [Stan Lee made a deal with the city in the 80s to declare Stockton the birthplace of the Fantastic Four.](https://www.visitstockton.org/blog/how-stockton-california-joined-the-marvel-universe/) Harder is just pushing for a potentially lucrative project through a petition that could help the city, as Stan Lee’s announcement did.
If it’s in space then depending on what the scene calls for it might just be cheaper to shoot it on a sound stage with green screen in L.A., most of the go-to destinations have been in [Georgia for its tax-incentive programs](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/16/why-marvel-studios-films-in-georgia.html) and Canada because the Canadian Federal Government provides foreign producers with a subsidy called the Film Production Services Tax Credit with a [20 percent break on digital effects, if they are done in Canada.](https://slate.com/culture/2006/02/why-are-so-many-movies-shot-in-canada.html)
I understood they shot Ant-man Q, MOM, and all the star wars stuff in the UK because the breaks were more cost effective combined with the many huge stages here.  I guess they must just spread it out as TLOT filmed in Australia.
The one scene when Yelena puts her stick into the Red Room's propeller and flys away. It looks like that someone just photoshopped Florence Pugh on a explosion and called it a day. I will never get over that  scene
Quantumania. The quantum realm in some scenes looks very bad and you can see that the actors don't know where to focus and see.  Such a shame, because I've always loved Ant-Man movies...
Worst for me is the [waterfall cliff](https://youtu.be/hrtg01p7bu4?t=30) in Black Panther. I can't suspend disbelief enough, every ledge is too convenient and it makes no sense how anyone got there. How do they get down and go home after the fight? It looks like an action figure display. Plus the whole fight scene felt off with the obvious CG African Savannah screensaver background.  The best was Eternals. [Just look at it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGUDih8E4Xg).
Mirror dimension in NWH was so fake whereas the battle of Wakanda in Infinity War was the most well lit/real one for me
I will never get over the fact that they finished that scene and then let it sit around for a year.
It made me disappointed with the battle in Endgame being so dimly-lit in comparsion.
That artwork looks amazing!
God, please be good. The commentary online is going to be absolutely insufferable if this tanks.
I cannot wait to see a powered up Monica in action.
Ah hell yeah an actual cool poster and not a head shot of every actor on payroll crammed into a huge montage.
Am I the only one who thinks this is one of if not the best poster in the MCU? The logos behind them in their colours just make it.  I am one more floating head poster from a meltdown 😂
I’m honestly really excited for this, especially because of Ms. Marvel, which is one of my favorite new characters and MCU shows
I want one
Because we all know she’s here.. watching us… hi Iman!! What secrets are you dying to tell us?
I’m so pumped for this movie
This poster has just everything: it's simple, it has a nice color flow, it's symmetric and has nice details. Just love it.
Yay. Hopefully that means we’ll get a trailer soon.
Question is do I have to watch Ms. Marvel for this to make sense bc I still haven't seen it
This is gonna be so hype
It might be challenging to compete with Dune 2 which will be released one week before
 I think this will be much better than the first Captain Marvel movie. The first one taking place earlier than the rest of the MCU (besides First Avenger ofc) made it feel very disconnected. Excited to see how Monica and Kamala tie into the story.
I'm so excited for this. I loved Ms Marvel and I want to see more of her.  Plus the vague premise I've read, seems interesting
I’m kind of excited for this one. I know Brie Larson gets a lot of heat, but I enjoyed Iman in Ms Marvel
Wow! November 😯 I thought this movie was coming out this summer.....
Despite using the same color scheme that every movie poster seems to use nowadays, I really like this and how they incorporated their respective logos
Also saw it in PA during Shazam 2 opening weekend
It's a beautiful poster
I'm a little surprised to see positivity towards this movie in this sub, coz I remember not long ago whenever the subject of Captain Marvel was brought there was always negativity, even when referring to the success of the first film, people would say it was only successful because of Endgame hype. So to see people actually excited about the sequel makes me happy, maybe people's attitudes are changing about Captain Marvel? Or maybe ya'll just don't wanna see another flop and don't actually care about The Marvels? Lol either way, I'm a fan of all 3 ladies so I'm excited to see this movie and I genuinely hope it does well.
Well now I’m going to have “Harder Better Faster Stronger” stuck in my head all day.      …I’m not complaining
It’s cool how they gave them all really unique spots. Kamala’s is really cool.
Excited to see Ms. Marvel again, thought that was one of the better Disney plus shows tbh. Could care less for Monica but hopefully they do something cool with her character
I’m excited for this just to see ms.marvel and captain marvel interact.
THIS LOOKS SOOOO GOOD OMG 🥰
Awesome.  Can’t wait to see KK on the big screen.
I hope we get the trailer soon.
That moment when people get downvoted even for simply stating they don't like the formatting of the poster 💀  Come on guys, that's not what the button is for. Let's use it responsibly for actual problems please?
I hope dune changes its release date
My girls are gonna slay in this movie (hopefully literally too)
I hope it's good, because Marvel needs to turn things around, but being delayed multiple times does worry me.
I hope it makes a billion again just to piss off the skeptics😆 the hate Brie gets for just standing there is insane. Kamala is adorable and I can’t wait to see their reactions to each other on the big Screen. Also I heard it’s a very action heavy movie, and I hope Marvel delivers cuz thier action lately hasn’t been high octane and Blockbuster level in a while. I hope they use that Disney Budget to make it a True cinematic experience. I’m actually hyped to see all the new powers and suits. Wandavision Stan’s are gonna show up for Monica❤️
Gosh intelllegncia from she hulk making their way into this post.Anyways who cares its gonna be Marvel's biggest movie of this year.Lets hope the quality is great till now everything seems positive except for the singing planet part
Yeah no
Didn’t know that marvel became a cult until I read these comments…
I get what they were going for with their symbols, but that just looks like bad green screen.  Kamala looks good.  Maybe if there had been a ship or planet behind the others with their symbols on it, but them being superimposed on blank whit area just doesn't work.
This poster is so funny if you draw one line in a specific way
I hope to God they keep the posters this creative and don’t give us one of those terribly overused floating heads poster with the whole damn cast on it.
I liked phase 4 and ant man 3 so I’m really hopeful  for this film
I like Captain marvel and I am excited for Monica. I hope that Monica's actor doesn't leave like captain marvel's actor... for some reason she got a lot of hate.
Higher, further, harder, better, faster, stronger, together
My expectations are so low for this movie. I hope I'm wrong. I kind of liked Captain Marvel, but something about adding Ms Marvel to the group and giving Monica powers doesn't quite seem like it'll work. I'll be very happy to be wrong.
This is gonna be bad
[removed]
Wasn't planning on watching this one, but since I got a movie pass... well, let's see if it's any good.
Well, this poster is actually one I like. Unusual as most mcu movie posters fill all the space with all their actors. I like getting to like one of their posters for a change!
Possibly the worst Phase 5 movie.
Gonna be a tough sell. They need to start promoting it now.  Also whats her face should apologize to the fans she offended
Pass
Disney sure did fuck that all up. Whatever that company is doing at this point I have no earthly idea. Pity.
I still don’t understand how this movie was green lit.   Beyond killing a beloved character in the TRAILER like Starlord - there is nothing they can advertise that’ll cause hype.   Cap Marvel is one dimensional.  Photon is unknown.  Ms Marvel is probably the only interesting character and bigots are going to rain shit on that.   It just seems doomed before arrival. Like Shazam 2.   I wouldn’t be surprised if they don’t release it and take the tax credit.  —  Downvote all you want but at least give me some hope for this movie when you do. Tell me why you think this movie will do to be successful because Marvel branding isn’t working right now.
Gotta say, none of these Marvels are my fav Marvels, but Ms Marvel is the best, and then ...  Hmmmm  Capt Marvel in gold/black suit-- but not Brie Larson, who comes across as mousy and uncharismatic.
I couldn’t thumbs down this any faster
Truly only excited to see Monica in action
Look, I'm not going to open the pandoras box on the quality of this movie or it's characters.  &#x200B;  But I think we can all agree that this poster is really bad and looks like Marvel isn't even trying anymore
Goofy aah legs
So lazy
Looks like some chick laying spread eagle, LMAO.  I can't unsee it.
No way people think this poster is good(imo I don't like it, but if you do it's all good)  It’s pretty bland, and doesn’t really say much other than "look at my IP!"
No la voy a ver
This movie regardless of how good it is will bomb so incredibly bad.
Poster looks like it was made by an AI that was into vaginas and buttholes
Already dead, hope guardians can save this
Sort by: controversial
Insufferable regardless, let’s be real.
It was insufferable when the first one made a billion dollars.  People pretended the studio was buying out empty theaters, spending money to *pretend* to make money, even though that makes no sense.  The commentary online will be toxic no matter what.
It’s a Captain Marvel film in the toxic Post Endgame “fandom”. It can make the slightest mistake and people will say it’s the worst movie in Marvel history
"what are all these GIRLS doing in mah supah hero movies?!"
The first Captain Marvel movie made over a billion, and the commentary online was still insufferable. It's inevitable.
You sound like Marvel is your hometown sports team that you owe allegiance to as opposed to a filmmaking apparatus that should be held to certain standards of art/entertainment quality.
I mean, obviously I hope they succeed, but if it's shit then it's shit
Let’s be honest it will most likely tank.
I think it’s already doomed regardless
even if it's really bad it'll have a better than average audience score and make loads of money so either way marvel wins.
Its still very weird how Monica got her powers.
Oh, that'll be released closer to when the movie comes out as the "official" poster.
The teaser and pre-release posters have usually been good lately. It's just the final one, usually released a week or two before release that ends up becoming the default that is the problem.
It’s coming unfortunately. have to get every Actor on the poster
She's a mutant which makes it even cooler somehow
Hell yeah! Here show is my favourite and I'm part way through a rewatch right now.
It's my phone background. I love it.
[removed]
I bought it online and now have it framed on my wall!
Did they really need to have Monica emerging from a 10 foot tall mystical space vagina of light, though?
It's coming out in November. It'll be a while before we get a trailer.
Probably by the end of this month if I had to guess so it could play in front of Guardians.
Probably not "have to". It's a cute story but not essential viewing, I definitely recommend it. Short of it is that Captain Marvel is her idol and her powers were unlocked by her bangle which may or may not be important to The Lore. It's just a quick origin story, nothing that can't be explained when Carol and Kamala first meet.
And Wanda Vision too
Watch literally the last 25 seconds.  EDIT: [it’s 40 seconds](https://youtu.be/DZ4N83065AQ)
The ending of the show directly leads into the movie
The end scene of ms marvel sets up this new movie. So would be a good idea. It’s a really good series too
I suggest you watch it, definitely would help
You never HAVE to watch anything. it will just enhance the experience
You should
Reading this made me think it has the potential to be what Winter Soldier was to the Captain America films (similar gap in setting, allies like Sam/Nat and Monica/Kamala coming to the fore). Very hopeful for this one.
Heat like "You should smile more", "Your butt is not as big as Tom Holland's.", "You're too powerful a woman for the MCU.".
It was pushed back a while ago, some shows too.
Blade has been having production troubles, and was originally meant to come out at this November date. Marvel likely pushed the Marvels to Blade's spot both to give it some extra time and the oven and to pace out their releases so they don't have too long a gap between this and Cap 4, which won't come out until May 2024.
Early reports have all been negative. Some leakers reported reshoots are scheduled. Doesn't sound good
There are a small but vocal group of incels who really hate Brie Larson, so much so that they have made 20-30 videos about how everyone on set hates her. Not surprisingly that group isn't exactly fond of non-white people or muslims either.
This button is closest thing that kids every got to power, they'll abuse it.
GOTG 3 literally exists my friend
This is such a cop out. Call it what it actually was: weak meta execution. Put down your pitchfork it was just cringe story telling
It's apparently getting cut out.
Didn’t Monica have powers in the comics? Or is she taking on a mantle of a different person from the comics?  But Ms Marvel seems weird since she will be far lower power level wise to the Captain
Why is this getting so many downvotes? The intent of the comment is so clearly open minded despite the criticisms. Y’all are fragile.
Ah yes, let’s judge a movie before it even comes out. Totally makes sense
Cannot unsee
Teaser posters are usually creative and fun to look at because they’re meant to build hype. What you’re thinking of are theatrical posters, which are meant to advertise to casual moviegoers. Theatrical posters tend to use floating heads because the cast is something that can be easily advertised on a still image and tends to be something causals care about.
It's not even out yet, but yeah let's go ahead and judge it already. smh
Lmfaooooo
Any "fan" who was offended should grow a pair.
Then why bother commenting?
Fuck what up?💀 there isn’t even a trailer to judge
> I still don’t understand how this movie was green lit.  The first movie made over a billion dollars.  Edit - Also:  >I wouldn’t be surprised if they don’t release it and take the tax credit.  Movie studios don't shelve $200M budget movies for a tax credit. What a ludicrous proposition. Zaslav at WB/Dis got in your head, but not even he did that.
I don’t care if this movie is good or bad but your take on this one is just fucking stupid lmao
People also thought GotG would fail.  Fans are idiots
I would wait until I see the trailer before talking shit about a movie. The only info we have so far is the \*POSTER\*.   In my case, I won't tell you why it's going to suck cause I don't know shit about it yet.   I know about Captain Marvel, Ms Marvel and Wandavision but nothing that I have seen in those productions tells me this movie is **DoooOoooOMED**.  You sound like you have made up your mind even before you have solid proof.
You want hope?  Go get therapy.
>!Starlord died?!<  Huh??
I couldn't thumbs down your comment any faster
even if it's mediocre af i can see it doing at least as well as antman because the first captain marvel did gross over a billion so plenty of people have seen it and are at least somewhat invested in the character. and if gog 3 is great it will reinvigorate some mcu hype.
For sure, its already been bad months in advance
Sigh… wish it wasn’t like this. But I absolutely know that no matter what, even if the movie is amazing, there will still be tons of “m-ShE-u” online I’ll be forced to look at.
If Marvels is successful, I'd say the commentary will be entertaining.
I rewatched it the other day and it’s not nearly as bad as people say and has some really enjoyable parts
Eat my ass, bud. I get annoyed with dumb commentary, which Captain Marvel spawns. If the movie sucks, the commentary from far right chuds is more annoying.
It’s not too different than how she got her powers in the comics (being exposed to extra dimensional energy).
they have always been good actually
A real one.
Maybe not, but everybody need their kind of gimmick.
I know, but I want to see one anyways. Stop with your logic and clear rational analysis.
I mean they showed an early look at SDCC last year didn't they? So they have something they could show if they really wanted to.
Doubt it’s that long. Likely get it during Guardians Vol 3 trailers. On YouTube a few days before.
It was good until you had government agents shooting up a school to kill kids and a universe ending threat no one gave a shit about.  Shit just got so silly after a solid start.
so she's gonna be on earth... i take it we will never see her patrolling the cosmos? doing the things she was constantly off-world for for 30+ years?
Yeah it’s a good show anyway
Yeah, “gets a lot of heat” from incles and children. Not worth considering at this point.
Funny, Scarlett rarely smiled and nobody gave a shit.
I do not traffic in any of that inane, childish bullshit.  I do however, think she deserved the heat she got for dragging bullshit culture war nonsense into the MCU during press events and being generally insufferable to her cast mates.
Getting pushed back is a bad sign. It means it tested poorly and needed time for redos
Marvel budgets reshoots into every movie.  That's not an indication of it's quality.
“Not surprisingly that group isn’t exactly fond of non-white people or Muslims either”  What?
Yeah that sounds about right.  Just a bit sad that basic harmless criticisms are being shit on so harshly here these days.  Personally I find that the poster has a lot of unused space, as well as that Monica and Carol look weird in the blank white backdrop of their logos, especially where their legs for some reason drop to a single point.  Though I gotta say, Kamala's section looks really cool with the bolt and the city backdrop
They didn't stutter
She did, Photon, Captain Marvel, Pulsar, and Spectrum.
I know, right?  We've never seen Ms Marvel on screen with Captain Marvel, how can we be so sure that it will work?
I don’t understand how this isn’t a thing.  It looks so obvious.
Thanks for that, I actually did not know there were different classifications of posters. Looking back over these I vastly prefer the teasers to the theatrical posters for sure. I personally don't see the appeal of the floating head use in posters are, but I also am not a person who will typically be swayed to watch a movie based on who is in it. So I guess they are more for other moviegoers.   Personal favorite I think has to be Ant-Man teaser. I remember seeing that years ago, but thought it was a fanmade thing. I love that it is an actual studio poster.
I was right when it came to Eternals being the worst Phase 4 film, so ez. F4 is also going to be the worst Phase 6 film.
Because they can? Damn, I guess people are only  allowed to praise in the comments.
Pretty poor comparison.   That movie had zero stakes to start with. This one has one known character and a strong TV attachment.
Sorry for having an opinion using what we have instead of “I haven’t seen a trailer so I won’t say anything”.
He’s very poorly saying that without killing a big name person like star lord - there’s no way it will get any hype for the movie.   I think he also somehow says Marvel will write this movie off for tax purposes similar to batgirl.. lmfao he’s high on bad drugs
You and eleven other nerds
Wow did it really!  I didn’t know it made that much.  I didn’t mind it as at all.  Wasn’t my favorite but not the worst.
Well there’s a difference between having a movie with strong female characters and a “Woo! Girl power!” movie. You’re already using 3 characters that the average viewer doesn’t really care about, so you have that against movie on top of the female cast.  You also don’t want to have the quips problem. Marvel movies are becoming more comedy with superheroes than superhero movies with comic relief.  I think Marvel is still too big to fail at the moment, so I’m sure it will do fine box office wise. It would just be nice for the film to genuinely be good and not just okay.
I personally couldn't care less if the lead is a female or a male. I don't look at it that way at all. But what i do hate, is that MCU right now are making female superheroes look flawless and making the male superheroes look like useless fuck-ups.   Like in MoM. I don't understand why Scarlet Witch was put up against such a weak Dr Strange, it just doesn't make sense. Realistically, Dr Strange puts up a very good fight against Scarlet Witch, and honestly has a pretty good chance of beating her. But in MoM he didn't even land a single decent shot.  Same with She-Hulk. Why all of a sudden does She-Hulk come along and claim she's better than the original Hulk? And claim she can control her anger infinitely better than him? When he's been learning for over 10+ years. Not to mention, MCU make Captain Marvel look like this flawless hero who never breaks a sweat.  I don't hate the fact there are more female roles in the MCU now. That's perfectly fine, but the MCU never execute them well at all. DCEU did it perfectly with WW 2017. The Boys did it perfectly in the scene with Stormfront. It was executed well in Infinity War during the Wakanda battle when Black Widow told Scarlet Witch she wasn't alone. DCEU executed WW 2017 perfectly, and MCU copied the idea and have been pushing it ever since, but they have been executed it horribly. That's my main critisicm about the MCU right now.
Honestly i think it was atleast as good as the phase one films. And better than some of the phase 2 films. It isnt some thought provoking masterpiece of cinema but i had fun with it and still do have fun watching it. And really thats what action films are about. Having fun.
it's better than thor dark world and ant man 2. honestly none of the phase 1-3 movies are 'bad'.
It was ridiculously overhyped because Captain Marvel was talked about to be THE shit in endgame. Then we saw a nerfed version only keep up with prime Thanos. Maybe her standalone movie will unleash her power. Nope another a snooze fest about how she got her powers. MCU failed the character because they hyped her to be this absolute bad ass but we kept getting “you have only seen a taste of her power! Wait till the next one!” Fool me once, shame on me. Fool me twice, shame on me. Fool me three times because I’m an MCU fan. Joke aside, the standalone movie is a decent movie but her mediocre showing left a lasting impression for me.   EDIT: my suggestion it was a timing problem was erroneous. It was simply an overhyped and under delivered character and story.
The incels have such a hate-on for Larson.
Both she and her character are just unlikeable in my opinion lol.  I don’t understand why you’re so against some opinion that you consider anyone who holds it an incel or child 🤔
Yeah but she had her boobs out throughout. Incels liked that.
"I don't traffic in bs."  Proceeds to spout bs.
I'm pretty sure that every single MCU project got pushed back recently.
Not necessarily.  When Blade got pushed back, they wanted something else at the end of the year.  Also, this movie needs to release after Secret Invasion, so maybe the problem was that they saw Secret Invasion wasn't going to make its "Early 2023" release window as originally scheduled.
As I said, early reports have been negative
Scratch a misogynist and a racist bleeds
Ah yes, the $800M-grossing and Oscar-winning Wakanda Forever. But go on.
That's called an opinion..
Idk, when I’m not interested in something, I just pass it by and go find something I *am* interested in. I don’t stop to tell everybody how uninterested I am. That seems weird to me.
Ohh you can be critical for sure, but if you are going to pass on a movie, why bother posting you are passing?   Like there will be probably a lot to criticise about the movie, so maybe wait till you have those. Instead of just disliking a movie that is only a poster currently because it has women leads
Hey now. Don't you get all offended on me now.   You asked and I answered! It's hard to give a reason why this movie will be successful (or not) if we don't have anything aside from a poster yet. Remember Thor 2 was shit and Thor: Ragnarok was great.   Remember when people were saying Heath Ledger would suck as the Joker? Then the first trailer was released and everyone's jaws dropped to the floor. The same with Michael Keaton as Batman. They gave him shit because he was a comedy actor (Beetlejuice).  You are allowed to have an opinion because of course you are allowed to have one but don't get all salty when people downvote you. I haven't downvoted you, by the way <3. I believe in a healthy exchange of ideas instead.
Yeah, I get that. But man, I also disagreed that Shazam 2 was DOA. Like, I came in watching that movie blind, and honestly, I find it ok, not great, but not awful as people made it out to movie, but I digress.
Somebody is still stuck in 2018 I see.....
Down voters are ignoring the truth in your assessment and ignorantly perceiving it as anti-woke. It’s not a “girl power” problem, it’s a “why should I care about another comic book hero” problem  Monica and Ms Marvel are obscure characters where you could only watch as D+ subscribers, and Captain Marvel was hyped as the strongest character only to be a let down in her silver screen appearances (that one on one battle with Thanos was meh at best and her origin movie had the unfortunate job of following up Infinity War).   Not only is Captain Marvel a poor anchor for overhyped under delivered reasons, how much will the movie un-do their D+ character arcs like they did to Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch? I understand she got further corrupted by the book, but the movie portrayal felt like a slap in the face for the grief we thought she had overcome. Considering how poor phase 4 was, I’ll be one of many waiting for the D+ release.
> already using 3 characters that the average viewer doesn’t really care about,  You mean like the Guardians of the Galaxy?
Nobody forced you to type this
Doctor Strange has been underpowered since Endgame, and unfortunately Wanda's power-up happened off-screen. She certainly wasn't *flawless* though.  > Why all of a sudden does She-Hulk come along and claim she's better than the original Hulk?  Because she's cocky, and it gets the best of her at the end of the show when she DOES lose her temper.  >Captain Marvel look like this flawless hero who never breaks a sweat.  I kind of agree here. Her introduction to the MCU was super weird to fit the timeline, and I really hope we can see what she brings to the table in The Marvels. As for competent male heroes, I just can't wait to see more of Shang-Chi and Bucky Barnes.
Kate Bishop? And how did MoM make Scarlet Witch look “flawless.” For that matter, it’s not like Ms Marvel andShe Hulk were constantly succeeding, same with Yelena.   There’s room for critique on all of them but “flawless” just ain’t it bud
>Why all of a sudden does She-Hulk come along and claim she's better than the original Hulk? And claim she can control her anger infinitely better than him? When he's been learning for over 10+ years.  She said that she is better at handling her anger now than Bruce was when he became a Hulk. Bruce had to learn to control his anger AFTER he became a Hulk, while Jen already knew how BEFORE she became a Hulk.
She is better than the Hulk. When was the last time Hulk held down a day job? When was he welcomed into a bar or invited to an award ceremony?  Okay, so that last one ended badly... but the point is she has control, and he doesn't. She goes on dates, and he sequestered himself. She learned to love her Hulk form and could stay in it while he was worried about what would happen when he hulled out.
Insufferable
i have a feeling the reason why the movie got delayed so much were internal disagreements about which one of the female heros was gonna get sidelined to let the other ones shine.
The movie WAS released in between Infinity War and Endgame...
....you know her movie was BEFORE endgame...right?
I’m not referring to people who just have opinions, I’m referring to people who had very loud and very negative opinions
Lol imagine getting downvotes because you think cpt marvel is a bad character. She is arrogant and lacks the charisma or self awareness to make up for it like a tony stark. The reason we care about Tony is because he tries to do better even if he fails at it.  Cpt Marvel is just arrogantly girlbossing all through the movie. Its not like she is likeable in the comics either. She was a fascist and the main reason for civil war 2, punishing people for crimes they might commit in the future.  But no you hate her so you must just hate women. Even if you like other female characters, thats irrelevant obviously.
Telling someone they should smile more, body shaming and male insecurities based on powerful women are all rightfully labeled inane and childish.  Likewise, an actor putting their personal politics before the movie they are promoting and being difficult to work with are rightfully called out as things deserving of disdain and derision.   Please tell me why you think the latter are ok if you disagree with me.
I’m so confused how disliking Brie Larson means you’re racist.    You have a blessed day.
Haha, they edited it. I’m guessing it used to say something about WF?
Nah, the majority of the Fandom pretty much agrees about Eternals. It's objectively horrendous.
Somewhere around there
When did Wanda overcome her grief? She was holding an entire town hostage, and then had to say goodbye to her “kids.” After that, she finds a remote area and gets lost the Darkhold, looking for her kids again. What about that suggested to you that she has overcome her grief? It wasn’t something she came to terms with or overcame at all. She was full of rage in Endgame, she was holding a town hostage in WandaVision, and she was still a mental case, using the Darkhold and looking for her “kids” at the end of WandaVision. I think we may have watched different shows. I thought Wanda’s fall was very consistent with the way her character has been developed. I have other issues with DS:MoM. Wanda isn’t one of them.  As for Phase 4 being “poor.” I don’t think that’s grounded in fact either. It was not as good as 1-3. It probably wasn’t good. But, it wasn’t “poor.” Which is an opinion that most fans agree with, as can be seen by the various audience scores.  I agree with your sentiment, but I don’t think you gave good examples to back it up.
This is the other part I hate around the arguments. The blind fanboys who can’t except any criticism
Phase 4 is peak lol wym
I think it’s both. The DC movie Birds of Prey came off as a huge “girl power” movie that used Harley Quinn for marketing. You can still make uninteresting characters interesting, but you have to deliver. You can’t just throw Monica in a movie because you want a black woman in the group, you need to actually do something with the character.
No because those characters weren’t already set up in previous media
And Guardians of the Galaxy 1 is one of the MCU’s best films. It’s well received *now*, but at the time before release it was skeptical. Why would you watch a movie on those characters instead of Captain America and Ironman?  Guardians 1 is a big reason you have so much comedy in the MCU movies now because it worked so well. I just don’t think Ms. Marvel is going to be that good.
I don’t think his comment was hateful. He addressed everything stacked against the movie honestly.
>Doctor Strange has been underpowered since Endgame, and unfortunately Wanda's power-up happened off-screen. She certainly wasn't flawless though.  Doctor Strange quite literally lives and breathes magic. He knows EVERYTHING there is to know. I think one of the producers actually came out and said that ever since Doctor Strange's movie, all he's done for years is study magic. That's why he's so powerful in Infinity War and gives Thanos an incredible fight. And he's also meant to come of as the "Dad" of the group or something like that.   So i don't see how it makes ANY sense that he just became totally useless and incapable. He was clearly nerfed to let Wanda shine in the limelight. And like i said to another guy, if you can find me one scene where Doctor Strange lands an actual good blow on Wanda, i'll retract everything.  >Because she's cocky, and it gets the best of her at the end of the show when she DOES lose her temper.  She's worse than cocky. She's condescending and downright disrespectful, and extremely unlikeable, hypocritical and contradicts herself. And always belittles Bruce. That far exceeds "cocky" lol.  >I kind of agree here. Her introduction to the MCU was super weird to fit the timeline, and I really hope we can see what she brings to the table in The Marvels.  I'm happy as long as Captain Marvel doesn't come off as an arrogant and cocky pain in the ass, the same way she did in the beginning of Endgame. Tony Stark was cocky and arrogant, but he was cocky and arrogant in a sort of goofy and jokey way. Captain Marvel is 100% serious and thinks she's the literal best.   However Captain Marvel and Brie Larson have literally the exact same personality. Even in an interview she did with Chris Hemsworth, Chris credits and praises his stunt doubles, but Brie Larson buts in and says "See, this is the thing. I did my own stunts because i thought that everyone did!" Which isn't even true, she literally HAS a stunt double.   She received a LOT of backlash from that interview. There was PLENTY of other things she said but this post is far too long. But basically, Brie Larson is just a self absorbed, arrogant and cocky person who wants everything to be about her, and i have a feeling her and her Captain Marvel character is going to ruin The Marvels movie. I hope i'm wrong.
That's one exception. She's actually likeable. I just don't like the route MCU is taking. Making male characters look useless and incapable and making the female heroes look flawless and superior. I don't care if there are more female leads, that's fine. I just don't like how much they are depowering and degrading the male superheroes now.  >And how did MoM make Scarlet Witch look "Flawless".  Are you trying to tell me that Dr Strange wasn't clearly depowered and dumbened down and made to look totally useless and incapable to make Wanda shine in the limelight? If you can find me one time when Dr Strange landed an actual decent shot on Wanda, i'll retract everything i just said.  >For that matter, it's not like Ms Marvel andShe Hulk were constantly succeeding  I haven't watched Ms Marvel yet, so i cannot speak on it's behalf. But She-Hulk is constantly made to look flawless wdym? Look at her when she's training with Bruce. When they are throwing the rocks, she has to throw hers just that little bit further specifically to one up him.   And what about when they are holding up their own weight off of the ground? You see Bruce wobbling and you see She-Hulk literally dancing with one hand. What about the part when they punch the ground, Hulk does it, nothing. She-Hulk does it, and rocks are collapsing from the cliff.
Yeah my mistake. Regardless, she was hyped after infinity war but didn’t deliver in her standalone movie or endgame for her hyped up powers.
Yeah my mistake. Regardless, she was hyped after infinity war but didn’t deliver in her standalone movie or endgame for her hyped up powers.
Why is she not allowed to be arrogant? Is it just a trait women can't have?
Fr. I like the other female characters. Wanda is one of my favorites- meanwhile I also don’t like Captain America.
We were talking about the “small but vocal group of incels” as mentioned above, not some random detractors of an actress.
Yep.  "I was right with Eternals and WF so ez" something like that
Probably the toxic fandom
Then do us all a favour and stay there, don't bring your negative vibes here....
The contradiction is in your first paragraph. Yeah, she had a town hostage, but in the end, she still released them. She has no real reason to since no one could stop her and if Vision kept nagging her, she could just remake him or wipe his memories. And yet she did release them because she felt remorse and was overcoming her grief. She took the Darkhold to learn more about magic and ignored Agatha's, the woman who had been lying to her and everyone from day 1, warnings. Her hearing her sons calling for help didn't even transfer over to MOM in any capacity.    MOM spat in the face of all that and not only completely undid that last development but made her worse than ever. Even at her worst in WestView, she did not go out of her way to actually kill anyone. In MOM, she's making string cheese, blowing up heads, and bisecting people. Yeah, yeah, Darkhold evil brainwashing, but the damage to her character has already been done.
People being like “woo girl power” is working against the movie?
>Even in an interview she did with Chris Hemsworth, Chris credits and praises his stunt doubles, but Brie Larson buts in and says "See, this is the thing. I did my own stunts because i thought that everyone did!" Which isn't even true, she literally HAS a stunt double.  Brie was kidding there lol  She has a more subtle sense of humour and it doesn't always come out the way she thinks it will, but she was kidding lol
>She's worse than cocky. She's condescending and downright disrespectful, and extremely unlikeable, hypocritical and contradicts herself. And always belittles Bruce. That far exceeds "cocky" lol.  TBF, my cousin is the CEO of a global company. I treat her like the little shit she always was. The fact that she makes about $1M per year, lives in a $5M home, and is respected in her field GLOBALLY in no way stands in the way of me insulting her personality, her career choices, and her lack of athletic prowess at family gatherings.   I AM the older cousin. End of story. Oh, and I'd do anything in the world to help the little shithead if she ever needed it.
he was already screwed over in no way home. first by doing and fucking up the memory wipe spell, and then by getting defeated by math.
You are acting as if Bruce went all out. Dude used only a fraction of his strength, which they actually show by him tossing a boulder into fucking orbit afterwards.
Lmao see this is the problem. No one here is saying she’s not allowed to be arrogant and no one here has even made it about her sex or gender.   Why can’t we have the opinion that a character with at least one generally unlikeable trait that you yourself suggested… is unlikeable?   I don’t have a problem with you disagreeing with my opinion, but you all seem to have a problem with others disagreeing with yours. I should instead ask you the following:  “Are people not allowed to dislike dislikable qualities”?
Did I say she cant? I said she it makes her unlikeable, its a personal opinion. Some people can be arrogant without looking like tools, in my opinion she cant. Its not that deep guy.
It's honestly crazy. You dislike Cpt Marval and boom misogynist. Maybe it just didn't work for me?  Apparently that's crazy. I like Nakia, hoped she'd be Black panther when it wasn't going to be Mbaku. I loved Wanda? I loved Agatha in Wandavision? Irrelevant apparently.  I liked Okoye and her brutal sass but hate that she's now ALSO basically discount ironman with her suit. What does that make me?
Ah yes, the toxic fandom. z0mg kyss!!! your opinion is bad!!!!!! grrrrrrrrr!!!!!!!!
Eternals is the only film that has ever genuinely put me to sleep and I’ve seen countless movies. Eternals fucking sucks.
I already showed up to party, bub. Also, it’s ok for me to think that something is trash and for you to think the opposite.
Realizing she's wrong and being remorseful for her actions don't mean she has overcome her grief at all
He’s saying a movie with empty and meaningless “girl power” moments cannot replace having well written female characters. There’s a difference between characters that feel genuine and characters that are just good at everything because “women can do no wrong, slay queen.”
This what happens when you read one sentence and ignore the rest.
It's literally the first thing you said about her. It's a common attribute that several other characters, all men, have displayed. If she's a tool to you that's cool. I was just asking for clarification, but I guess that was too much which is why you come across as aggravated for being asked. So... cool.
Lol
I watched it and it was pretty good but the characters could’ve used more screen time
You're very welcome to enjoy some things and not like some others, no two people are alike after all. But there's a difference between constructive criticism and plain hate (which is what your original comment was) and it's unfortunate that you don't seem to understand that....
Of course, that’s why I said “people” as in the audience and not the director/writer. Definitely not advocating for more stupid “she has help” endgame moments. Just didn’t appreciate how the original commenter seemed to say “girls are bad” without saying that. Original commenter didn’t say “captain marvel needs a better plot” it was basically “it’s bad bc it’s a WOMAN movie” when the movie has basically zero to do with Carol being a woman. It’s just a movie. It’s not a “female empowerment” film. If you watch that movie and your first reaction is “wow they should focus on content, not making a female empowerment film” then that’s in and of itself a sexist reaction IMO. No idea why you’d watch that movie and someone would say “Marvel should stop being woke.” The movie isn’t “feminist” or “woke” at all. But OP seems to think it is? Which it’s not. Why can’t a movie just be a movie that has women in it? Why can’t it just be a regular not-so-great movie? Why do we have to assign it to women at all? It’s just a movie… if having a female lead makes it a “women movie” then idk what we’re even doing. You’re absolutely free to not like the movie - it’s only just OK - but don’t approach it with that bullshit.
You were just asking and just happen to slide in some misogyny accusation at the end. Its all cool though, you were just asking in the end.
Either way. If I were able to downvote it again I would.
Lol. You use the term "girlbossing" but accuse me of sliding in misogyny. Hilarious.
And either way, if I were able to downvote your comment again, I 100% would 🙂....
Guarantee we see a few of them (imo, most of them) again.
No way they will pump the breaks on this money train. Hasn't James Gunn himself said something to the effect of "this version" of the Guardians is ending with this third movie. That pretty much heavily implies that the Guardians will continue in some way.   Disney won't toss a cash machine out the window.
Nobody knows technically, but I doubt this will be the very last we see of them.  Only Dave Batista has confirmed time and time again that he absolutely won't be returning as Drax (leading many to believe that he dies in the third film).  But the rest will likely show up here or there.
There definitely is, I personally think Nebula and mantis have a good chance of appearing in the future
I can see Drax dying, Rocket taking on leadership of Halfworld/Counter Earth and Quill, Gamora and Kraglin moving on, allowing them to come back in the future for a cameo.  If the actors are up for it, I think we see Nebula lead the next gen of the Guardians, with Mantis, who's still fairly new, Groot who's easy to keep around, and Cosmo who's brand new. Adam Warlock may well join too.  That's just my gut instinct
Betting odds more minor characters like Groot and Nebula and Mantis come back, but this is probably the swan song for the group and those main characters.
A new Team will be formed.
Gunn is doing DC. He’s not gonna sign up for another Marvel film anytime soon.  If any Guardians come back, it’ll be the ones where the actors can just do voice, so Groot and Rocket. Warlock will get roped into some other squad.
If you're just asking for opinions, then yes, why not.
I have no doubt we will still see the guardians in future films, just not as a team
we don't know, every response is just a guess. it's unlikely that we lose every single one, so imo yes
GotG 3 is the end for many characters, but not all.  I can't believe that Warlock (is a big character), Cosmo or even Mantis are done.  GotG 4 is a possibility, with half new members, but don't aspect it soon.  I actually think that a few of them could show up in Eternals 2: we don't know anything about it, but for the general response, I think that adding funny, good, beloved Guardians will help the tone of the film (I loved Eternals, but many criticized the tone).
i could see some members showing up in avengers and then they might do a new team of guardians in another trilogy.
I bet Gamora, groot, and Adam warlock will stick around
Drax is done. I don’t see Rocket even if he survives so Groot also likely won’t be back. Maybe Peter, Mantis, Gamora and Nebula.
Im assuming at least some of them will survive Vol 3. Rocket and Drax are pretty much good as gone, as well as probably Gamora
The ones that survive will probably show up elsewhere, like in the Avengers movies
Money wise, no I highly doubt this is the last movie for all of the characters.   Story wise, I would kinda like a Samurai Champloo style ending, where all characters in the squad eventually go their separate ways in a bittersweet ending. I doubt this will happen but would be a good change of pace for the MCU.
I think we'll see everyone but Drax again at some point.
Mantis - yes  Nebula - no  Groot - big yes  Drax - no  Starlord - yes, but later  Rocket - no  Gamora - no
I could see that but maybe instead have Quill remain a member. I feel like Chris Pratt would still be up for it and he's still young enough to continue playing the character for a couple more years. Ideally Quill, Nebula, Cosmo, Groot, Adam and someone else depending on who dies
You realise Vol 2 and 1 were both set it 2014 right? Mantis joined only a few months after the team was formed
Yeah I'm talking about real time. Pom Klementieff hasn't filmed as much, and was a secondary character in Vol. 2. She may be more inclined to stay around as one of the primary characters in a fourth installment. Similar for Karen Gillan's Nebula.  She may still have had enough, and she did get to lead the Holiday Special, but I think there's ample opportunity to expand her arc still. Rocket, Gamora and Quill have had more time focused on them, so I can see them bringing those characters to a close. I'd like to see Drax get more of an arc, but seems like Dave Batista is done for now
I mean yeah there’s room for improvement but I can definitely tell who he is
It looks more like him than it doesnt
I mean if you look just from the eyes could you tell that, that is bucky
I wish I listened to you 😭 I just tried to make it better and now it looks 5 times worse
Just because its done filming doesnt mean its ready to be released. Let them release stuff when its ready.
Out of all the shows Daredevil is the least CGI-heavy one and hugely anticipated, so could drive subscriptions up making sense not to delay the 1st batch after Echo, so I could see that being on schedule in spring 2024. Also depends if and how much of it influences NWO or Thunderbolts if there is a Fisk tie-in.   A first batch would be filmed too before the writers strike hinders it, if it goes ahead, so I was thinking they could go with Echo, the Mephisto special if its true for this year, part of DD spring 2024 after a SW show, Ironheart, possibly another special presentation and What If at some point in 2024, maybe DD remainder end 2024/early 2025 ahead of Spiderman 4. Wasn't it rumoured Agatha might be delayed being released as it might have a Fantastic 4 tie-in? If this happens on DD though, I'll be frustrated as I want to see it asap.   Also international productions are not affected by the writers strike are they? However I guess they could be if the other guilds go on strike and if others, like the writers guild in the UK, strikes to support WGA.
And that Daredevil episode count is misleading. It won’t be an 18 episode in a row series. It’ll most likely be 3 batches of 6 or a 10 and an 8 split through a year.
Best guess? They put out the stuff that tests well with their focus groups and let the less well received ideas quietly release or fade from memory with no more mentions.
There is no ideal schedule at the moment because the WGA (Writers Guild) has called to vote for a strike. If they do in fact vote to strike, which is highly likely, then production will most likely stop on May 1st, that's when the contract expires. We aren't going to be given many dates until companies have an idea of how long the strike may last.
Fans wanted a long production schedule to take the load off of CGI artists and improve the graphics. They felt good CGI is worth waiting for
Quality and quantity aren’t mutually exclusive. I thought the Disney+ shows released during phase 4 were all at least good, and some were excellent - overall they were better and more consistent than the phase 4 movies.   So I don’t really want them to slow down that much, especially as that would mean waiting ages for second seasons to shows like Ms Marvel and Moon Knight.
Most of these shows won’t be here for another year and a half to 2 years. We basically will have another several months of Marvel drought , so by the time we get these product’s people will be ready for new Marvel. I think it’s better then last year where we crammed several projects every other month
But it is still taking a spot of two shows, isn't it?  I look forward to it but if they want to stretch the content a bit, it will take some careful scheduling.
They had another meeting yesterday, didn't they?
I agree with you. I was not unhappy, I actually liked most Phase 4 stuff (shows) but I hear people complaining that it is too much, while in fact, we only got two movies stretched within months and last show in August.
There will probably be many meetings, but as of right now, an authorization vote to strike will take place next week. The vote will take place between the 11th and the 17th. If they agree to strike and a new contract can't be agreed on before May 1st, then the writers will strike. That's not even taking into consideration that the Directors Guild and Screen Actors Guild also have to complete negotiations or also perhaps go on strike as well.
[X-Men theme intensifies]
Probably X-Men.  Also, a bunch of Spiderman films.
We had Infinity War  Now we have Secret Wars  So the next big event is Judgement Day (Arishem said he will comeback for judgement, next saga foreshadowing maybe?)
A lot of X-Men. Definitely a whole slew of dark Midnight Sons-type projects.   tbh, may be a little early to tell.
I really want Doom and the fantastic 4 to be the main focus. I think us fantastic 4 fans deserve a really good fantastic 4 adaptation. Maybe where the guy who's a dictator of a country is actually a dictator of a country- I know wild idea.
Revenge of the Inhumans.
One more phoenix movie! I'm sure they'll get it right this time, lol.
Bear with me, this comment will be long.  First thing to address, I’ve seen some people suggest that the MCU should hit the “reset” button after Avengers: Secret Wars. I disagree. I would like to see the characters introduced in the Multiverse Saga (as well as those from the Infinity Saga that still have life in them) to continue into the next saga. The main reason is, we may not have Tony or Steve, but we still have plenty of big-name characters that I would like to see interact with new characters that still have yet to be introduced in the MCU.   Obviously the release schedule for the projects in the Multiverse Saga are going to shift around. I have a feeling that Avengers: The Kang Dynasty will release in May of 2026, while Avengers: Secret Wars will release a year later in May of 2027. This will allow for many of the rumored sequels for Shang-Chi, Eternals, Doctor Strange, Spider-Man, etc. to come out (at the very least) before Secret Wars. This factors in films that have been officially announced like Armor Wars as well. In addition, second seasons for Ms. Marvel and Moon Knight could premiere on Disney+. Having these sequels in the Multiverse Saga will allow for their characters’ arcs to be a bit more fleshed-out before something as big as Secret Wars.   So then, what next? As most people are saying, it’s looking like mutants will make their big-scale MCU debut *after* Secret Wars. The “Mutant Saga” name has been floating around. Now, I know everyone wants an X-Men film, and some people want that to be the opening film for the next saga. I’d like to see them take a “Phase 1 approach” to the X-Men, where the team is built up over about two years.   I’d like to see Phase 7 start with a Wolverine film. As one of Marvel’s most popular and well-known superheroes, I find it fitting to introduce him in a solo film at the very beginning of the next saga. I’d like to see the other big-name X-Men characters have Disney+ specials spread over the course of Phase 7. We don’t need to focus on *every* character, but the 3 or 4 most important (thinking of characters like Cyclops, Storm, etc). I would like these specials, along with the Wolverine film, to be as closely connected as the Phase 1 films, with Professor X taking the “Nick Fury role” of bringing together this group of mutants. Phase 7 would culminate in an X-Men film, somewhere around May of 2029.   Now let’s start to think about everything else in between. I’d like to see a couple of mutant-centric projects that don’t necessarily build up to the X-Men film. These could include a Namor-centric Disney+ series and a Scarlet Witch film. Namor is already an established mutant, while Scarlet Witch’s origins have not established that. I wouldn’t mind if they found a way to have her discover that she’s always been a mutant, and perhaps Strucker’s experiments “unlocked” the mutant powers (kind of like how the bangle “unlocked” Kamala’s powers).   I’d also like to see a Ghost Rider Disney+ special that would help to lead into a Midnight Sons film. This has been another project that’s been on many peoples’ wishlists since they started to explore the supernatural corner of the MCU. Doctor Strange, Moon Knight, Werewolf by Night, Blade, Ghost Rider, and any of their related characters (Wong, Scarlet Scarab, Elsa Bloodstone, etc) could be included (note that not *all* of these characters need to be included - I’m just listing the characters that are a part of that corner of the MCU).   Finally, there are a few other characters and teams that we will need to catch up with. One of the more immediate films could be a sequel to Fantastic Four, a team that Marvel specifically wants to be one of the major pillars of the MCU. I would like to see Thunderbolts get a sequel as well, including new members of the team (Deadpool comes to mind, as well as Abomination if he doesn’t make it into the first film). Spider-Man will probably get another solo film (his fifth or sixth, depending on if they use Spider-Man 5 as an “epilogue” to the Multiverse Saga like Far From Home was for the Infinity Saga). On Disney+, I’d like to see another season of Daredevil (something that has been hinted at by Vincent D’Onofrio), and *maybe* a series centered around the Ten Rings.   For those keeping track, that’s 6 or 7 films, 2 or 3 Disney+ series, and a handful of Disney+ specials, stretched over the course of about two years, maybe longer if they need the extra time.   I don’t have as complete of a picture in my mind of Phases 8 or 9 at the moment. Obviously there are a bunch of sequels and trilogies that can be done, especially for the X-Men and Fantastic Four franchises, which will be front-and-center for the MCU. Some Disney+ shows could get second seasons (Wonder Man, maybe Young Avengers if that ended up happening in the Multiverse Saga). I’d also like to see Hercules get a solo film if he’s gonna be a major addition to the MCU.   There are quite a few bigger events they could build up to. Avengers vs X-Men could be a cool film. There’s a newer run called A.X.E.: Judgment Day that centers on the Avengers, X-Men, and Eternals that doesn’t quite have the audience reception that they’d hoped for but could be adapted into something different and cool.
My feeling is they will find solid writing to better the next phases. One thing is that they really need to add actors who come across as leaders. Like Chris Evans did. I’d thought that Henry Cavill would really be strong as Cyclops, which would give Wolverine an anti-hero slant again like in the early comics. Just saying.
Actual quality.
If they can get their writing fixed, I'd love to see X-Men and Fantastic Four be at the forefront. Not sure I want to see most of the Midnight Sons unless they are R rated. If they can't fix their writing and studio notes, it doesn't really matter and the numbers will keep sliding.
Gonna be lucky if there is one at this point
I see a situation where, after some shake-ups to team rosters, we'll end up with different superhero teams each dealing with one aspect of the superhero world--the Avengers for major threats, the Young Avengers (perhaps with elements of the West Coast Avengers in their characterization) as a supporting team on the other seaboard, Midnight Sons/sorcerers for mystical stuff, the X-Men and Brotherhood of Mutants dealing with conflicts in the mutant community, Defenders and Spider-Man for street-level New York issues... My assumption is that with the MCU universe getting more heavily populated, we'll more clearly see different teams or characters on their own turf, dealing with their own niches of problems, which also helps with the issue of "why doesn't \[super-team\] step in regarding this issue?", since everyone will have a specialization.  This would also allow for established characters like the Avengers to take a backseat where needed, since this division of labour would make it easier to imply that they're off doing their own thing but still part of this world, while in the meantime the story would focus on characters like the newer heroes or teams we've not seen yet.
F4 and X-Men will have to play a prominent role - having some incredibly formidable villains and great storylines (Galactus, Annihilus, Doom among others) & (Magneto, Apocalypse, Onslaught) respectively.  They will likely act as the main story through line of each of those Phases.   &#x200B;  The Overall Big Bad:  After Kang and probably Doom (\* who should definitely not be killed off ) the Big Bad could  be Mr Sinister &/or Apocalypse, Celestials, Galactus, or Beyonder (if not used in Secret wars for some reason). Galactus' heralds could be like the infinity stones, popping up in various films throughout the phases.   &#x200B;  New York/ Street Level  Spiderman and other street levels will have their own minor storylines dealing with their own villains and/or crime/ corruption in NY as normal etc. but would love to see all NY based heroes regularly bumping into each other (Spidey, F4, Punisher, Daredevil, Strange, Jessica Jones etc)   Big Bad: Norman Osborn, Purple Man, Venom/ Carnage  &#x200B;  Monster/ Supernatural Level  Blade, Ghost Rider, Man-Thing all exploring their unique corners of the MCU. Maybe Dr Strange appearing a little also if still around.   Big Bad: Mephisto or one of the Hell Lords   &#x200B;  Cosmic Level  Would also like to see an Annihilators Team for the cosmic side of the MCU during this time (Cap Marvel, Hyperion, Thor if still alive if not Beta Ray Bill, Gladiator, Nova, Adam Warlock,  Silver Surfer etc) Big Bad: Galactus & his heralds, Annihilus, Celestials, Magus, Shi'ar Empire, Korvac, Beyonders   &#x200B;  Ultimately I would personally like to see Mr Sinister as a stepping stone to Apocalypse as a stepping stone to Celestials (but each given their due and time to be fleshed out and shine). This would go into a storyline similar to Avengers vs X-Men vs Eternals: Judgment Day in the comics. That or Galactus and his heralds done justice.
Mutants
Hopefully a break on universe ending stuff. Definitly mutants, hoping for the rise of Doom.
probably a series of relatively grounded arcs instead of one overarching story with universe-ending stakes. I think they were saying they would do something like this after phases 1-3 and ditch the concept of phases altogether, but I guess their plans changed   Focus mainly on mutants, along with F4 and Spider-Man in their own corner, and keep Avengers in the background
A focus on more earthly, or atleast less universeending stakes. Like with she hulk, wandavision or agents of shield. That way there is room for worldbuilding, so eventually when there is threat if the world being destroyed we care more about what we could lose, instead of just characters dying.
The Dark Phoenix Saga.  Yeah I said it. I also think we'll see a general soft reboot after Secret Wars.
X-Men. As for the saga villain, Annihilus would be cool, but it'll probably be Doom
i hope it’s X-Men and mutant related. it’d be great to have Magneto as the big bad as well with maybe House of M being the next big event
The expectations for Doom are very high and considering Gorr showcasing the MCU habit of killing off villians people tend to worry.  Doom is a complicated character and the MCU doesnt have a great deal of experience on expanding such characters. Aside a Thanos or Kang they kill every bad guy in their debut film.  The comics have an edge here  villians are developed and interact.
Just...no. Let them ruin another run for a change and leave Claremont alone.
I sort of have a different approach to Phases 7 through 9. The goal with those phases is mostly quality over quantity really and having it be more focused and self contained akin to Phases 1 through 3, with more of the focus being on expanded world building and interconnected storytelling. I think in a ideal world doing the Mutant Saga in the MCU can provide some of the best storytelling we could see in any comic book related media. You can have tons of expanded lore on the world, a selection of new, different and diverse cast of characters especially with the X-Men and more opportunities to do fun unique spins on villains that people have never typically seen. To me these three phases should be where the MCU hunkers down in the writers room and come up with something truly brilliant that even tops the Infinity Saga.      What I would do is to primarily have the Eternals, Mutants, Deviants, the US Government and the Avengers (maybe throw in the F4 in there) as your big players and what most of the saga is focused around.  Basically you have all the super powered people within the human populace begin to spring up out of the woodwork and all the drama and events that come with that like the X-Men first revealing themselves and the US government discovering the mutant state Genosha along with the Deviants revealing themselves more as a secret underground society and of course your Eternals. I am not sure if a reboot will be necessary for this but its possible to do this with some retcons. These phases definitely should have more a focus on mystery and intrigue between these multiple factions of the world, it should feel a lot more human centric than previous phases where you didn't really get a feel for the average laymen. Which gets me to the villain for this saga which should be the big dog, Apocalypse.      Apocalypse to me is the perfect choice. The whole theme of Apocalypse is he represents evolution far more so than the mutants and Eternals do. He is constantly changing, shifting and evolving himself in order to become the definition of the perfect being. To Apocalypse, he is *perfection* and the whole universe to him needs to be in his image, where the strong thrive and the weak must be killed off. The perfect villain to have your factions of humanity unite against since Apocalypse wants them both wiped out or under his control. And with Apocalypse there is an opportunity for Marvel to lean into something they haven't really experimented with, which is horror. Apocalypse to me should give off very horror movie villain vibes, just this unstoppable force of nature that every time he dies, he manages to come back stronger and better reaching and evolving to his perfect state. I would setup Apocalypse prior to him being seen as a figure for a religious cult mostly headed by Minister Sinister possibly referring to him as the second coming of Jesus Christ and the title Perfection. A lot of interesting things you could do with Apocalypse but the goal is to have him be different from Thanos and Kang but come off as way more horrifying and scary.  This is mostly me just looking at from a writers perspective, how it would look like in terms of the content being released is not something I thought far ahead about it but I hope for the best. To me the Mutant Saga should be about what does it mean to be human and what is it that makes us human. That should be like the core theme of that saga and then go from there and make something fun and cool. Anyways thanks for reading my long boring essay lol
I feel like Cavill may be a bit too old (by that time) to be Cyclops. I always saw him as a solid Corsair.
fr.
Good point. Perhaps it’s more of the gravitas the actor comes with that would benefit the next team leader(s).
Like Tony said in the beginning of Infinity War, it's nothing. It's just a housing unit for nano particles. Just in case there's a monster in the closet.
That one isn’t surgically implanted in his chest, it’s just sort of glued on. He rips it off and gives it to cap during the scene.
That arc reactor contains his nanotech armor.
Apart from it being part of his nanotech armor, I've always assumed that he just needs something to plug what would otherwise be a gaping hole in his chest, so even though in later suits his chest-mounted reactor didn't power his armor, there's presumably something in that region of his chest.  This also raises the question of whether Tony, once he removed the reactor, ever used his empty chest cavity to store, say, a phone or a packet of snacks.
Thought of that too but it never really made sense for it to be attached directly to his bare skin; Or how it would have been safely secured there in the first place (??glue or smth)
Ohh yeah i forgot about that part. kinda dumb that they decided to just stick it onto his skin tho.
Im pretty sure doctors can regrow his ribs/mend the gaping hole he had. Since he didn’t need the arc reactor after removing the shrapnel
Why doesn’t it make sense to be attached to his bare skin?
Lots of things doesn't make sense if you think about it too much. I guess nanotech? It was pretty firm when Tony ripped it off his chest when he confronted Steve at the beginning of Endgame.
His suit is in it.
It symbolized that he is iron man
While I'm not sure current medical technology could do that, he did have Extremis left over at that point in Iron Man 3, so that could be how he repaired that injury (and I think he actually detaches the arc reactor from his chest in the Endgame scene, showing skin underneath). It's simply that the movies themselves don't show how he fixed that wound (or, come to think of it, what he did with Extremis after Iron Man 3, since he managed to cure Pepper of her fire/explosive abilities, and Rhodey would probably have appreciated a serum that magically cures disabilities), and also that it's funnier to imagine Tony casually walking around with a horrifying chest orifice.
He finished the extremis formula and used it to heal his chest. You can see the circular scar in endgame.
Please be good. Please be good. Please be good. Please be good...
I know hes already onto DC, but im glad he's still putting his whole ass into the guardians movie. I think this has the potential to be really big.
They must be incredibly confident in the final product that they are showing it a month before it’s premiere. HERES HOPING!!!!
[OOGA CHAKA INTENSIFIES]
He's going to make us cry.
Now, if this movie is good, people are gonna say "this has nothing to do with Marvel and is only good because of Gunn" in order to try and keep up this "MCU is dead" discourse.
Is the premiere really tomorrow its surprising that Marvel hasn't officially announced it
Soo glad he got to finish his story in the MCU
Got my ticket for Thursday already. Going to be amazing.
Do they really do this a month from the release?
Who says that if they make a GotG Vol 4, is won’t be directed by someone new? Continuation to some degree.
Sound mix would be one of the very last things to happen; all they could really do past this point is refine CGI.
HE SAID AMONG, THE COLORED SUITS ACTUALLY WERE AN AMONGUS REFERENCE
I have a feeling this movie will disappoint Box Office wise…hope it doesn’t happen but there’s something I the air when it comes to superhero movies right now.
If this movie is as big as a disappointment as most of the after Endgame MCU has been -  I'm done
Is it actually premiering tomorrow? I haven’t seen anything outside of the average socialite website.
Guardians is the movie that gave Gunn his biggest break which later led to his new job as co-lead of DC Studios. He won’t be here today if not for the success of GOTG. I expect this third and last of his Guardians movies to not only meet expectations but exceed then
Here's hoping it's not another Thor4
Guardians has had more bake time than the other phase 4 movies. If any marvel property is going to be good again, its this one.
DC gave Gunn the driving wheel for their universe and Marvel brought him back after letting him go, it will be good dont worry. I'm more worried about whatever guardians stuff comes after this.
If this is a turd we are in trouble 😳
Potential? Unless it's somehow an absolute bomb it's gonna be fucking huge.  People, not just Marvel fans, love the Guardians. They're probably the most popular MCU characters still around  Not to mention everything the movie has going for it, like an accomplished director who has probably been working on it in one way or another since the last one came out ***6 years ago*** now  It's the culmination of the biggest movies of Gunn's career, you know he's pouring his heart into it  I'd be amazed if the movie doesn't break a billion
I CAN'T STOP THIS FEELING!!!
100% this. I AM NOT READY.
Every MCU phase has had its ups and downs. I still remember when people were saying Age of Ultron was the final nail on the MCU coffin due to it not preforming the best.   Point being that, yeah, doesnt matter how good GotG 3 is, the “MCU is dead” sayers will continue with the same exhausting rhetoric that theyve always done.
I mean, would they be wrong? Gunn is fully in charge of the script and directing. The MCU has notoriously been stupid to not allow other talented filmmakers that chance. Edgar Wright would've done a much better Ant-Man trilogy for example.
Well I mean... yah that's kind of right - it would literally further reinforce that notion... the reason Guardians would be good IS because of Gunn? Not sure what you're trying to say here bud...
…but it’s true
Before S.I comes out and everyone will love it
I think the scary scenario would be probably the whole MCU becoming a Fast and Furious type of shit
Tomorrow? What makes you say that
The screenshot is from a Day/Month/Year. I thought the same thing, too. It looks like May 4th, but it's April 5th.
pretty sure it's May 1st
You lucky bastard, I have to wait until may to see it
James Gunn says he is done with GotG after this movie. Marvel could always make a fourth film but they'd need a new director.
If it's generally a good movie, then it will do fine. People forget that Black Panther 2 did great and it was one of Marvel's latest movies released in theaters.
I feel like I should point out that this, as well as Quantumania are Phase 5 movies.
Also Gunn has never had marvel studios/Disney intervene or trim his projects down (from what we know). At least Guardians 1 and 2 feel very distinct from the rest of the MCU projects. They feel like very complete, slightly longer stand-alone movies. Not concerned about this one as long as they let Gunn do his thing like usual.
This is also, I believe, the first movie made after COVID restrictions fully lifted.
Black Widow had a whole year being pushed back because of a Pandemic and the effects still weren’t good. And at least with that movie, most stuff you could do practical effects on. Guardians movies are CGI heavy.
Did you see the holiday special? Things are not looking good. Sometimes when you leave things in the oven too long they tend to burn.
To be fair that’s bc the dude was fired and was then busy with TSS & Peacemaker, along with being appointed Co-CEO of DC Studios so yeah… makes sense 💀
Shit 6 years now!!!??? Time does fly really fast... Thanks Covid for literally suck 3 of those years fuck.   Well on concept of the story It takes place very long years since Infinity War but I mean Groot is fully grown now and he disappeared from existence also Rocket is truly the Older now not just on terms of age also mentally the same goes for Nebula, also all of the blip is a good reason to introduce Warlock as a full grown man even tho I bet Gunn is going to make him a child 🤣
DEEP INSIDE OF ME
I dont think marvel is "dead" persay. But i think their time of "everyone just shows up to a marvel movie" is moving away. Im hoping the new direction shapes everything back up, but the glut of content in phase 4 really hurt the quality.
Exactly
> The MCU has notoriously been stupid to not allow other talented filmmakers that chance.  I know right. If only Taika had full control of the latest Thor movies.
I don’t think Nicole Perlman gets enough credit for GOTG 1  https://scriptmag.com/.amp/columns/nicole-perlman-guardians-of-the-galaxy   Don’t get me wrong, I love Gunn, GOTG 1, GOTG 2, Peacemaker, and The Suicide Squad  But there’s something about GOTG 1 I like more than an unfiltered Gunn DC Project or even GOTG 2  We will never know how an Edgar Wright trilogy would work out, but Ant-Man 1 did alright.  MCU is  the most profitable film franchise and there are a lot of talented writers and directors that work on the 30+ movies
Lmao so which marvel movies were good because of marvel?
Lmao sure.  And No Way Home was good because Sony owns the spiderman movie rights. Marvel had nothing to do with anything.  Shang-Chi was good because of something something not Marvel.
https://www.averagesocialite.com/la-events/2023/4/6/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-3-premiere-la
Lol I meant the first Thursday of May.
well it comes out in May lol
That’s what I said
Yeah but for me personally wasn't a surprise because I have confidence not on Marvel. I was confident of Coogler and the same goes with Gunn
What's wrong with the holiday special remember it's a holiday special not a 'Something big and crazy is going to happen' special.
I liked the holiday special for what it was. considering they filmed it in between takes of GotG. But gunn has been working on this story for years.
unless disney wait for a longer time before putting marvel movies on D+, less hardcore fans (aka kids with parents who has D+ subscriptions) are not going to watch it at the theater.
Are you okay? I’m not sure anyone understood what you just said.
That does seem weirdly early considering the release is a month away. Can’t see it mentioned anywhere else
Oh lmao never mind then
Yeah but did you know? James Gunn is making this his final GOTG movie. They could make another one, but someone else would have to direct it.
I don't fully understand. So Thor 4 was bad because of Taika and not Marvel?
It was just very cringe, the jokes didn’t land and it was way more kid-driven than the other movies. Trying to make any criticism of marvel on this sub is pointless I don’t even know why I’m bothering to type this lol.
He’s been working on The Suicide Squad, Peacemaker and becoming the head of an entire studio. The script was finished before he was originally fired from marvel in 2019.
Post covid movie landscape is much more difficult for theaters. They trained everyone to wait for streaming, but theyve shown good quality can overcome that.
I've got a 9yo grand  - he loves going to see the movie at "our" theater... which has reserved plush reclining seats, snack trays, generous cup holders, amazing surround sound, amazing picture quality... its a far cry from the crowded tiny multiplex cubicles with overflow sound and terrible visual quality of even just a decade ago...
Yeah I know right. People finding ways to credit anything else but Marvel for the good stuff Marvel presents is baffling.
Well I think the Civil War Premiere was about a month before it was released  I would say it's weird that Marvel hasn't been announced yet when it starts in 24 hours usually they announce the Premieres a week before hand, it was posted on here during the weekend
>cringe, the jokes didn’t land and it was way more kid-driven  I feel the same about most superhero movies
Cringe and kid-oriented is a hallmark of holiday specials.
> Trying to make any criticism of marvel on this sub is pointless  try putting some thought into your criticism other than  "It's bad"
I didn’t think it was cringey or cringe inducing.  It didn’t make me cringe.
Oh fair enough. I thought they were at most a week or two before for some reason, but never paid that much attention to be fair. Guess we’ll find out tomorrow
You’ve proven my point
You haven't made one
I mean… I have, you replied to it. If you want to win arguments on Reddit you need more than sassy remarks that don’t make sense. I’m just tryna help you no offence intended
You can tell peoples age because they either see:  2001: A Space Odyssey, Pacman or Among Us
Oh — that might be what it is. I always thought it was meant to be a nod to the space suits from 2001: A Space Odyssey
That and the suits from the Gorillaz video for Strange Timez
I sense this is more of a coincidence than anything else. The image being referenced in the middle there is somewhat well-known but it’s not official PAC-Man imagery.
Someone else probably said this, but it’s been confirmed with Gunn that it’s a nod to 2001
Yeah, this definitely crossed my mind. Also, Abed from Community wore that shirt.
Amogus
Very Sus
Its a 2001 Space Oddyssey reference, but I understand that not everyone gets that. Recently, 80s nostalgia has been selling, but filmmakers are cinema nerds, and they typically reference the classics
I was thinking classic Lego Space in all honesty
What trailer is this referring to
The spacesuits also remind me of the [Intel bunny suits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paU16B-bZEA) from a while back.
Amongus
Here I thought it was a nod to the og LEGO spacemen
I see an OK GO music video and was hoping one of their songs would be played over this scene.
I never posted, but I definitely thought about it! Thanks for posting!
James Gunn already said it’s a reference to 2001: a Space odyssey
No. It is simply a tribute and reference to Stanley Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey.    Look no further, James Gunn himself confirmed it when a guy asked him if this was a reference to Among Us.    Both to the design of the astronaut suits and to the plot of the film that deals with the mysteries of human evolution is a simile used in GoTgVol3 regarding High Evolution and his obsession with the mysteries of evolving beings into superior beings.  https://twitter.com/GabiMG_News/status/1598691911484612608?t=wIdpN6yxMF5FhqX5wdI2rA&s=19
I can’t do that Drax. Looks sus! Who is in the yellow suit?
I'm genuinely amazed nobody has done an indie horror remake/tribute of Pac-Man where you run through an asylum being chased by themed ghosts.
It's not Among Us?
amogus
Honestly all I see is realistic Among Us
Among us
I’m 99% sure it’s amongus
Among us
I thought among us
I 100% thought it was an among us reference
Did you just find the $10k easter egg?
I also get among us vibes
Man, I can’t wait for Gunn’s GenX nostalgia jerk fest to be over at Marvel.   Intentionally rewriting every aspect of Peter Quill so he can turn him into a stand in for his own nerdy teenager-self has been A LOT. The first GotG is a strong film with many decisions I disagree with. It’s all been downhill from there.
I thought of that one Beastie Boys video.
Oh I was thinking among us for some reason
Among us I'm 15.
Mighty Morphin’ Power Rangers
I did not know there was PacMan lore
Nah it's Among Us
I mean its obviously meant to be an amongus reference there isnt any debate
God, I hate it. Like why on earth would it be so colorful?. You can feel the "this is for a marvel joke" scene and the movie is not even out yet.
Unfortunately the young internet hivemind thought it was an Among Us reference.
I have that shirt!
I saw a disguised (and failed) attempt to get Lego to make a classic astronaut battle pack featuring a new teal one.
Ah that was one of my favorite Threadless shirts … forgot about them
I suppose it could be Pacman, I saw something else however
James Gunn must love arcade games.
Ah, Pac-Man. It does look like that. That makes me wonder if this sequence is some sort of deem sequence of Quills. Then right colors they typically don’t have for the team and the thing they land on that looks like flesh.
What?!? It's not from the original Lost in Space??
Ooh I like that interpretation.
Among us
"Hey, who turned out the lights?"
Kubrick was first
Wait is this not the shit posting subreddit?
It’s abeds t shirt Wayy
Power Rangers
It’s modeled off of 2001 A Space Odyssey
Loving the threadless shirt there!
I thought Teletubbies.
I see Teletubbies
[I see this](https://imgur.com/a/wpYf1lf)
it's actually an amogus meme.  They wanted to keep with the video game theme, but for a more modern audience and since it's in space they chose the popular game from a few years ago amogus.
It's a coincidence.
Wait... Pacman ISN'T JUST A HEAD?!?!? They're all astronauts???
I see Abed’s shirt from community
James Gunn already said that it's based on 2001. Which makes sense for his age.  Here’s his response when asked if it was inspired by Among Us: https://twitter.com/jamesgunn/status/1598745081024245760?s=46&t=CyU7QXB9yuKbqIdLIg2ZWw
i see all of them, i am the master of time, move out of my way doctor strange
Gunn confirmed it’s an homage to 2001
i see gorillaz
i see space odyessy but not because im old.
I see Lego spacemen.
Spaceman skeleton?   I see Scooby Doo, Where Are You!
I just saw the Guardians in colored space suits until seeing the Pac Man resemblance in this post, what does that make me?
I saw the Power Rangers... which also fits your theory
I'm a Gen X-er and grew up playing Pac-Man in arcades and on the Atari 2600, and I still thought of Among Us.
How is this 2001, exactly?
I see Pacman, but I also grew up playing it
nice good thing my first thought was Among Us lol
jokes on you i see all 3
I saw all three. How old am I?
I'm glad I saw Pacman first ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grimacing)
What if I see all three at the same time?
I see a bit of a Vashta Nerada from doctor who.
Not teletubbies?
Gorillaz video for strange timez
What if I saw all of them hmmmmmm?
I saw Lego spacemen. My kids saw among us
I believe that is what James Gunn has said, anyways.
If only they swapped the green suit with a pinky one, the pacman theory would have more weight and it could've been a double reference!  But I think only the 2001: A Space Odyssey reference is intended.
It is. 2001. There's a lot of younger people who don't recognize a cultural reference that's more than 30 years old.
It is 2001. He said so directly when asked.  Here’s his response when asked if it was inspired by Among Us: https://twitter.com/jamesgunn/status/1598745081024245760?s=46&t=CyU7QXB9yuKbqIdLIg2ZWw
Both these suits and the ones from the Strange Timez video are references to the space suits from 2001: A Space Odyssey
Yeah, it was a shirt sold by Threadless around the time they were getting popular.
Definitely. Without the shirt to bridge the ideas of "Pac-man ghost" and "colorful spacemen", the two GotG images have basically nothing to do with each other.
Cool. Cool, cool, cool
I’ve had like 3 shirts Abed wore. Am I a “type”?
Secret Invasion
Guardians of the galaxy 3
Lmao what a silly commercial. "We drove a CPU to Times Square and danced next to it, so as you can see, pretty good CPU amirite?"  I guess in 1997 most people probably wouldn't have known what they were talking about if they actually went into features and why it would make a difference to a consumer.
Man, this reminds me that Adam Sandler's Pixels had so much potential.
Yeah, I thought that was the consensus on this for ages already...
Because you haven't seen 2001 A Space Odessey.
I’d appreciate that!
Cool. Cool cool cool.
Funny I have this and few other others, think they all were from woot.com
I used to have the shirt and was wearing it when that episode came on. Then I got like 4 texts from friends that said "your shirt is on TV!" I guess it was super recognizable.
I had that shirt! Blew my mind to see it on community the first time I saw it. By the end of it, Abed had at least 3 tees that I had in my wardrobe already
YEEESSSSS
Ham Girl!
Which is itself a reference to Doctor Who
Woah deep cut I was gonna say this and wasn’t expecting it to be top reply nice!
Guardians of the Galaxy 3 will be the ultimate bottle episode.
but Among Us wasn’t released in 2001…
Doctor Who?
And classic LEGO space minifigs
So do I
spaceship!

Pac-Man is literally 43 years old
I’ve seen 2001 and I didn’t pick up on the reference
I looked at it and thought of Among Us lol.
No, it's 2023  /s
The suits absolutely are, the shot of them jumping since trailer one just looks like it was exactly lifted out of the video is all, i'm not expecting Guardians to have a giant monolith with or without Robert Smith's face on it... but i'm also not against it.
As someone also who had a bunch of Abed shirts I can tell you you are a 'bought a lot of shirts from Threadless in the 2000s' if that's a type?
Oh no, how the hell did I not see that?! I always forget how good Bradley cooper's voice talent is, this movie looks like it's gonna be a lot to take in.
If your commercial had a fart sound, it was absolutely going to hit in 1997. Times were just different.
People now probably understand what a CPU does even less if anything.
Gunn has said it’s a Reference to 2001
It was a very popular joke but at no point did I think they were actually trying to reference Among Us at any point.
Spotted the teenager
Well I have and I still thought of among us first
Movie reference
It was threadless.com.  I designed it back in 2005(?!) for their ‘five color contest’ back when they still silkscreened and five colors was a big deal. I immediately thought of the four ghosts plus Pac-Man as the five colors to use and whipped it up the night of the deadline.  Maybe 5 years later, Namco caught on and issued a cease and desist on us. Even though it clearly follows the legalities of parody. If anything I reference the Atari logo. But who wants to go to court with namco/Bandai, right?   So anyway, to my own shock the shirt became a mini-phenomenon and I could no longer even print it. Bootlegger sites still do and get away with it somehow. I’d love to redesign and redraw it now that I’ve got 18 years of artistic development, but so many more people made money on the design than I did, it’s kind of a sore subject for me, and I don’t know if I’ll ever get around to it.
No, I drew it before and having never seen that episode of doctor who. It was a combination of Pac-Man and 50s sci fi pulp comics with a pinch of Scooby Doo, if anything
Remember, the library is the most dangerous weapon
I wonder what inspired Among Us.
I don’t know if you’re being sarcastic or not haha.
which Doctor
Hey!  Who turned out the lights?!  Hey!  Who turned out the lights?!
I’ll do you one better - Doctor How?
Is that from 2001? I only remember the red one.
But Pac-Man gets regular releases still. It never really left the zeitgeist.
Pac-Man ghosts being depicted as colorful space suits isn’t, though.
Even that is just a reference to the shot of Dave(? I think, can’t remember if it was the other guy) leaving the airlock in 2001
Oh yeah. That’s accurate.
LOL.  I'm 50 and have never even played the game, I just remember people calling it an Among Us reference months ago.  Apparently, that's a seriously spicey take here!
Six seasons *and* a movie reference
I'm so sorry you got a bad deal, but thank you for making what might be my favorite shirt I've ever owned!
Early 2000s threadless was the shit; loved it
If you truly are the OG, I just want to say your drawing inspired me and my buddies to write a "Pac-Man" sci-fi horror movie based on the concepts presented in that image. We never got really far with it, only maybe the first 1/4 of the movie.
I had this shirt. An ex stole it during a break up.
I wore the shit out of that and more Threadless shirts back as a teen. If you ever do a redesign I'd love to support you :)
Wait, that’s your art!? Cool!   But that’s crazy that you drew it unaware of that Who episode, because I would have bet money it was based on that. The skull in the spacesuit is such a striking image that’s the first thing I think of
This room’s the greatest arsenal we could have!
Hey!  Who turned out the lights?
Pacman
John Carpenter’s The Thing
Mafia
It's Strange
The doc with the power
Well, maybe people would recognize space odyssey if it was cool enough to get a sequel.
Hah fair enough! Yeah James Gunn doesn’t really seem like the type to reference a recent game. He’s a film-head and is more likely to reference classics like 2001.  I can see why Pac-Man would be considered though, seeing as he already included him in the last film.
Thanks! I’ve heard that from others, it’s weird and flattering- it’s just one of those things that hit at the right time and I’m glad it connected w people. It was really weird, about 8 years ago I moved to a new town and I immediately see a dude on my street wearing it while mowing his lawn. And I’m like, small world, but I guess I’m supposed to be here, haha
Straight up. I loved their creative designs and quality.   They started to suck when they used their own shirts (that sucked ass) instead of the American Apparel shirts they used prior. Obviously, fling to their own shirts worked out for a few years, but I never bought another after I grabbed three of the new ones, so not so great in the long term.   BTW, the original Threadless tees I still have I can wear and look great.
A skull in a spacesuit is incredibly iconic going back to pulp sci-fi magazines from the 60s. What Dr. Who episode are you thinking of?
Maybe, who am I to judge
right? i’ve never heard of 2001: a mrs space odyssey
You know...it did, right? I can't tell if you're being internet sarcastic or not.
Hope you’re still creating!
Probably Forest of the Dead/Silence in the Library most likely. Season 4 of the reboot.  Hey, who turned out the light!
Thats because thats not the sequel. The sequel is 2002: an electric Boogaloo odyssey. It didn't sell well cause the name was a mouth full.
What did they call it, 2002: A Space Odyssey?   Hell yeah dude
Yeah I was being sarcastic.
Plus, there's a lot of confusion for having a similar title to CharDee MacDennis 2: Electric Boogaloo.
2002: Mo' Space, Mo' Odyssey
That’s how they named the new HAL-9000  A la HAL-9001
2010: The Year We Make Contact  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010:_The_Year_We_Make_Contact

Holy fuck she's tiny
The trailers for Secret Invasion got my hyped 🔥
Wow she got very thin
Hopefully she will be the equivalent to Jessica Drew in the MCU (it's rumored she plays a spy with powers and people said she shoots blasts from her hands, just like her)
For a second there I thought she wasn’t wearing a shirt
Secret invasion is the only Disney plus show imo which has the potential to even come close to the level of Daredevil, punisher or Agents of shield.   I just request everyone to please not create your own theories about this show and then be disappointed later when it drops. Just be patient and wait for it to be aired.
Why did she, though?
Nah the crew guy in the foreground is 8' tall.
>Emilia Clarke  1.57 m / 5.15 feet, she is 10 cm /3.9 inches higer than Danny DeVito  Ps: Jason Momoa Height 1.93 m / 6 feet 3.984 inches
That's what he said
That second photo does her no help. Hopefully just a bad perspective from the photographer
Yeah, she's not exactly the biggest person out there, lol
She's Talos's daughter from what I've heard
Don't put Agents of SHIELD on the same level as Daredevil and Punisher. It's a shitty network show that went on far longer than it deserved to.
God damn. So it was like Jason Momoa had his own muppet while on GoT.
I was judging by the door.
yes but she's a superskrull it seems
One random ass guy saying this on reddit doesn't change the fact that agents of shield is a masterpiece and all the marvel fans know it.
True, daredevil was on its own level, unmatched by any as of yet
No, it ain’t.
r/StarWars comments be like
We call them little people.
Always judge by the door.
Jodor
JODOR!
He invented a way to navigate it. Hank Pym invented a way to access it.
Yeah I mean he was literally already familiar with the error that would turn Scott into a baby. So he clearly was ahead of them.
People forget things can happen off screen and these events don’t usually take place over a span of 2-3 days. It’s not like he met them on Tuesday and then was at the compound on Wednesday.
Also, people act like he fully invented time travel. The quantum realm allows you to time travel, that whole mechanism was already in place. He just found out how to navigate it.
Bruce got them most of the way there. Tony's AI helped him run simulations to figure out the missing pieces. And then he got it. He and Bruce working together are a super brain.
IN A CAVE! WITH A BOX OF SCRAPS!
Also there is no indication of how much time passed between cap meeting with him and him coming to cap. Bruce could’ve worked for weeks to try and get it to work even as much as it did.
Agree with everything except for the quote about messing with time. That’s just a cool line my brudda
>he seems to take issue with the date of his own birth when talking to his father  Yeah I never fully got this. My best guess was just that Tony was born before the expected date (or after?)  There could be a bit of “oh wow, I forgot I *would* be born soon” if he was just so focused on finding a date where the Tesseract and Hank Pym were near each other, maybe he’s surprised he didn’t realize his bday being close by sooner. But then he asks how far along she is…  Idt his bday date changed due to any time travel, if that’s what you were suggesting though. It works differently in the MCU (“changing the past can’t change your future,” changing his bday would’ve resulted in a new timeline)
The thing that always amazes me is that when Hulk does his experiment we see Scott de-ageing with no harm, able to retain all his memories and personality. Hulk has effectively invented an immortality process and no-one seems to care.
I am sure the idea of using time travel to save his parents occurred to him at some point.  He's lucky he didn't become obsessed with it.
I don’t think his conversation with Steve, Nat, and Scott implied that he’d been working on it, just that he was familiar with the concepts already because he was already one of the worlds foremost scientists.  He hadn’t been working on it, but he had enough foundational knowledge of quantum physics from the start to have an educated opinion anyway.
I always had the sense he was working on something off and on because of his guilt over losing Peter, but the linchpin was Scott because he never figured out Pym particles.
It never bothered me he figured it out overnight. His super power is that he can do things like that. It's not harder to believe that than any of the back stories for any of the other avengers. Thor is a God, strange is a wizard, Tony can invent anything.
His supercomputers did most of the work, really. They’re crazy intuitive.
Maybe it took him months to figure it out, then went back and gave it to himself so it seems like he figured it out so quick!
It’s a comic book movie, it doesn’t have realism to begin with
Thank you. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.  I always interpreted it at this.  Tony disappears because he is scared. This is finally a fight he can't win. That is why he is so upset at the beginning of Endgame. That is why he takes the suit off and gives it to Cap. That is why is disappears. Because he lost. He lost everything he was fighting to try and protect. He *knew it was coming* and he still lost.  For an ego as big as Tony's, that is a huge hit. He had never *really* lost before, the except in some ways being his parents but that is a bit of a different story.  He beat death with his knowledge, he saved Pepper, again, with his brain. So when this happened it was devastating to him.  He leaves the Avengers because for the first time in his life, *he doesn't have the answers.*  When we flash forward, and Cap, Nat and Scott shows up, he brushes it off. He say's it is impossible... but don't you think it's a bit strange he seems *awfully knowledgeable on how time travel doesn't work*. Why would this be the case if he wasn't actively working on ways to solve it? He knows these things because he has run into those very same issues while trying to work on it.  When the team shows up the reason he doesn't blurt out "JESSH! What TOOK YOU guys so long?! I've been up here in my cabin working on this stuff just WAITING for yall!" is because he didn't have the answers.   I'm sorry, but Tony Stark, for as much growing as he's done, would never, ever, *ever* admit that something with possible but *he didn't know how to do it.*  I'm 100% positive that had Scott not shown up with that information, as soon as Tony figured it out, he'd waltz right into the Avenger's compound happy as a pig in shit for figuring it out.  But Scott *did* show up, and Tony would never admit to the team he couldn't figure something out, so he plays it off like it's impossible, because surely if the great Tony Stark can't figure it out, no one else can... right?  The line that says something along the lines of "will run X config *one more time before we pack it in for the night"* 100% sounds to me like something he had been working on for a long time.
Did we ever get an explanation of the puzzled look on Tony’s face while he was with his dad in the elevator and finds out his mom is expecting? Wouldn’t he already have known this?
A lot of these comments are giving off the same vibe that Snyder bros use to justify his movie logic. I loved Endgame, but it’s obvious they made some movie magic liberties with the plot. Ant-Man is rescued from the Quantum Realm because a rat walked on a button, Iron-Man learns how to navigate the Quantum Realm. These were moments to move the plot along, they were not that deep.
Tony could’ve spent years working on it just to time travel back and act like he did it in a week.
Your argument doesn't make sense because no one should know about the quantum realm other than the ant family or the effect it has on time.  He also couldn't study shrinking because only Hank knows how to create the pym particles.  Sure he might have worked on it after they proposed it that night, but the transition makes it seem like not a whole lot of time has passed.  So yes, Tony perfected time travel within a short period of time.
It’s also not uncommon in real life for scientists/thinkers to have literal EUREKA moments that come as a solution to a problem they’re working on in a flash. So even outside of the realm of Marvel, it not that outlandish.
He never invented time travel. He invented a map. Scott was the one who technically discovered time travel. Banner technically invented the first time machine. Tony Stark made a navigational system, NOT time travel.   Reiterating my point. "Fans" NEVER watch the films thoroughly, they just stare at awe and cheer, then give whatever opinion they want.
While a lot of this can be explained, you can’t deny there was some very hand wavey science happening. Like when their plan went off the rails and Tony and Steve had to find another way to get the Tesseract. It makes no fucking sense that Tony could just make some minor adjustment to his GPS and just magically land exactly where and when they needed to be.   Don’t even get me started on how bringing everyone back five years later would have caused untold chaos and suffering. Society would have literally collapsed. Do you know how hard it would be to get your life back if you were the only person missing for five years? Now multiply that by half of all life on earth. Personally I think the blip is the biggest storytelling mistake they’ve made so far. The consequences of such an act would just be insane.
I don’t know anyone that said he figured it out in one night.
They never even implied it was one night. Bruce already had a running(not very good) prototype by then there’s no way that took them 1 night.
It’s weird to be so passionate about a scene in a movie.
What pisses me off is when Tony finally figures out time travel, he tells Pepper and she acted as if she could care less.   “I figured out time travel”  “That’s amazing, Tony. I just want to get back to my book about composting”
It would have been nice to have seen that in some way and it not happening offscreen. Instead we get 5 YEARS LATER LOL.
Tony's lines don't really imply anything other than past study someone of his intelligence would have had, not necessarily work or experience first-hand. Neil DeGrasse Tyson would be able to say all the stuff Tony did to Cap/Nat/Scott and it's not because he's "worked on" time travel. The way the lines are presented really mean to imply that Tony already knows a lot because Tony knows a lot, it's the way a bunch of Tony's knowledge and intelligence are presented in the MCU.
Love the movie but the scene was done poorly. Cmon. And marvel knows it too, thats why they quickly covered it up with the cute "shit" joke.
It's not about figuring it out in one night. It's the fact that he had simulations run on a hologram, said random shapes (inverted moebius) and was like "oh shit, I solved Time Travel!" If you're going to do and say random science stuff, at least make it *semi* believable.
He figured out time travel GPS in one night, being previously well versed in the underlying physics.
It’s because people don’t pay attention to what they are watching… furthermore they don’t comprehend what they are watching.   Tony very clearly lays this out. The context of the meeting with Tony, Scott, Cap, Natasha is that he has ran through the scenarios and did not have a solution that would work. However he did figure out a solution by seeing the picture of him and Peter upside down.   This is all in the movie but a lot of this fan base needs everything spelled out for them for it to make sense.
Now I want the Ironman prequel where it's: Tony Stark makes mistakes with time...
When he’s talking to pepper and he just flat out, says that he figured out time travel I did feel a bit disenchanted, I’ll admit. but I like the MCU and I understand that this is all coming from comic books with much wilder storylines than just time travel, so I shrugged it off and enjoyed the ride
The fact that he figured it out at all speaks a lot.
I think he had a bit more then a few scrapes in the cave.  If anything they were cuts and bruises.
I thought it was obvious he didn't figure it out in one night. He just figured out the last parts of the equation in what's shown in the movie.  Nobody can figure out something like that whole cloth. We build on previous knowledge.
*and later during the final battle he says “when you mess with time it tends to mess back”. All of this implies he had those troubles prior to the meeting.*  I always felt like they were setting something up that we never saw with this line.
This is the rocky montage scenes all over again. Man he trains for one day and all of a sudden he can beat the bad man. Montages can’t be shown fully on screen because then your there watching rocky pump iron for 35 days. In this case your watching Tony attempt to understand time travel for years. Cool to watch but thats not going to make money.
I think this post misses the point a little.  The hard part of time travel was always the Pym Particle. Tony was able to step in and finish it because Pym had done the foundational work over a course of decades. Even the machinery was built by Banner.   All Tony did was create a temporal GPS - even if that only took one night it’s still not the case that he figured out time travel in one night. He just figured out how not to get lost while time travelling.
People forget that it’s a comic book movie full of a bunch of fictional stuff get over it
"Tony Stark figured this out in a lab!  With s Mobius Strip!  Inverted!"
"Dreams are glimpses into the multiverse."     Tony was seeing things as early as infinity war and probably a lot lot lot more allowing him to figure time travel
There’s so much great Tony story taking place off screen. All this is another great example, but my favorite is the off screen arc that happens after the line, “maybe I’ll take a page out of Barton’s book, settle down, build Pepper a farm.” Next time we see him he’s not really an Avenger, he’s palling around with the Secretary of State, giving speeches at MIT. He’s much more of a politician. I’m sure he’ll “take Secretary of Defense, if you asked nicely.” (He did save the President’s life.)
yea something that bothers me with people and movies etc is they seem to think only what you see on screen is what has happened to these characters. arguebly any conceviable thing could have happened off screen, doesnt mean the audience is privy to it.
he didnt invent it at all. hank pym created a way to shrink yoursrlf and through that, one can become subatomic and in the quantum realm, time works differently. they know they could get to other realities. the issue theybhad is instead of sending scott back in time they were sending time backwards on scitt. tony figured out the bugs.
And you proved.....wat?  That wisdom has been chasing you...  But you have always proven to be faster!?!?
still mid
“It ain’t that kinda movie, kid.”
Okay so, if you ever have a prior thought to anything, then you never really were spontaneous?  Gotcha.   Nice logic, buddy.   So improv comedians and ‘free-style’ rappers aren’t thinking on their feet; they’re just using words they learned as a baby!   It’s all past knowledge, right?!
Um, it was at least just one night from when Cap, Nat and Scott visit Tony, to when he solved time travel...  Tony said they could stay to eat, to which they decline. The next scene he is washing dishes from that meal they would've all had together. He's wearing the same shirt too, that's when he saw Peter's picture and guilt crept it, so he worked on time travel AND had the conversation with Pepper that same night  But it could be implied he's worked on time travel before Cap asked him too, and it's unclear how long Cap, Nat and Bruce work on their experiment until the day Tony finally shows up to join them  So technically it's just one night from the porch scene to his dining room, but yes he could've worked on it on his own well before
I know it's not really connected anymore, but I kind of like the parallel to Agents of Shield. Tony worked on Timetravel and stopped when he had his daughter to live life. He returns to save his friends.   FitzSimmons worked on timetravel, eventually figured it out and stopped right there to just live life, start a family etc. but later returned to save their friends.
That whole scene of him being bothered when he asked his dad about the date of his birth has always bothered me. I always have this feeling that he thought “wait, that cant be right, thats not my birthday” and then they will reveal he had a dead sibling or maybe they didnt tell him his correct bday or something. For the life of me, i cannot think of any reason why he would be bothered when he realized he was about to be born.
Yeah it would be kinda weird for Tony to refuse them then show up at Avengers Compound the next morning with a functioning time machine saying "Let's do this, here's a new shield"  Plus when he told Pepper he figured it out, she seemed to know he was building a time machine, pretty sure she wouldnt have found out if Tony whacked it out in a couple of hours while she was catching up on composting
And then they never address time in the quantum realm at all in quantumania
Trying to think what he’s wearing when the water sprays because that’s when he starts working on it, I imagine by that point he’s been thinking about it since they left which could have been a day or 2 but from the look at the pictures to solving the problem that appears to be a few hours because he’s wearing that smiley face jumper
There’s nothing even wrong with him figuring it out in a day. He’s a fictional super genius.   He made a pocket sized nuclear reactor IN A CAVE, WITH A BOX OF SCRAPS!!!   When groups of scientists around the world with latest high tech equipment can’t even narrow it down to something that fits through your doorway.
I never picked up on “the picture of Peter gave him the idea to invert it” and I think that is really cool
I don’t think the plot of End Game is worth overthinking
People miss the most important detail.  Tony figured out the solution after looking at the pic with him and Peter.  Peter's award was upside down.
Yeah! He only invented a way to navigate it  and maybe he went to the Avengers compound for a "second opinion"
Endgame was bad for so many reasons beyond the time travel revelation.   Marvel should have killed the characters they were going to sunset anyway at the end of infinity war and called it the end of the phase.
I mean, more of a group effort. Pym created a means to do so, Tony found a means to navigate it, Bruce figured out how to do it incorrectly lol. But for all of Tony's accomplishments, he clearly understood quantum physics and such. And of course, when he had his daughter he wouldn't continue looking to do anything that could undo her existence. It would have made plenty of sense before that because he wouldn't lose anything
Or. When we see him having “discovered” he had actually teleported back to the day of the conversation that he had with Capt and Nat after years and years of working on it.
I thought it was obvious, but apparently not...
Also when he runs that last simulation that figures it out, he says something about wanting to run one more.    that seems pretty obvious that he's been running things for quite a while to try and see if it can be done.    he has a super addictive personality so when his mind fixates on something, he likely spends an insane amount of time and energy on it.    I always assumed he was exploring time travel even before talking to anybody simply because his brain wouldn't let him not explore it.
If anything, even using the quantum tunnel in the van, the equipment set up at the compound didn't happen overnight. Banner is a genius, but even he would have needed some time to come up with the proper setup which would have allowed for those kinds of experiments and then actually get it put together. Even if they managed to raid Pym's old lab for components it wouldn't have been idealized for their purposes and would have needed some redesign.
Well, if he can become an expert on Thermal Nuclear Astrophysics in one night, I'm sure he can figure out time travel in one night (properly motivated, of course).
He didn't solve time travel, but it was Scott's idea, this would be the first time he tries to do it with the quantum realm.  Also let's be fair most of Endgame is just cool moments they want to do and then they try to make a movie around them, sometimes is smooth, other times is not
Most people watching these movies don't actually watch these movies.
It's also an incredibly common problem solving "stereotype." You walk away from a problem for a long time and when you come back to it all of a sudden it clicks. Very common thing.
It wasnt even one night that happened on screen. Theres the implied period that Hulk took to build everything once Tony turned them down. On top of the obvious implication that what we saw was only one of the last road blocks
You know what would've prevented this confusion amongst the fanbase?  *We're gonna need a montage!*
He already figured out the theory. Pym particles was the missing element.
And Bruce was the in-between guy, in that he built the metaphorical DeLorean.
Exactly this. Feels like some people forgot about Pym’s contributions.  Well put!
Hell, before the Blip even happened Janet was warning Scott not to time travel *by accident*. Hank is firmly the inventor of time travel. Tony just put a satnav on it.
The Hank Pym part wasn’t on purpose right?
I mean it's not an error. It's an immortality device.  I hate how they glossed right over the implications of that.  Rhodey could have used it to get the use of his legs back.  Thor could have used it to get buff again instantly.
How was he familiar with it? He never seen it and they didn't pass him any of the Bruce's work.
No it was like five minutes later because thats what we saw on screen!
*5 years later*     Certain Fans: “So how did Cassie get that old that fast? She was a child now she’s a teen?”          Most of the people who argue this stuff aren’t the most observant or logical group of people.
Yep. If people don't see it happen piece by piece they get all butthurt on how sellable or believable something or consider in "cheap" that it happened off screen. It's whiney bullshit.
>People forget things can happen off screen   Hulk fans have that concept crystal clear
I've never seen any of the avengers go pee or poop.
Basically 90 percent of the hulks story line happened off screen
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday.
If I could change it, he would've gone over to his holo table thingie, glanced around to make sure he was alone, and asked to pull up some cleverly named contingency project he'd been unable to complete in the past, but with the new information he can then figure out the remaining variables. Also he wouldn't even celebrate, more horror at the realization that since he knows they can, they have to try regardless of potential devastating consequences. Then popsicles.
Yeah, all Tony invented was a "quantum GPS" as he put it, which allowed the user to navigate the quantum realm and pick their destination. But the quantum realm itself handles the time travel.
Exactly. Tony didn't actually *invent* Time Travel. He just mapped how to do it *safely*.  We literally see Hulk messing with time travel not much earlier in the film. Tony didn't create it. He perfected the tech to do it safely. That is literally the reason they went to him in the first place - they had the tech already. They just couldn't figure out how to do it in a stable way.
Well, by that logic, was the car invented? Or airplanes, or neclear fission?
I personally found it more dubious that he and Dr Strange could immediately navigate alien space tech and land on a planet they wanted to land on in some random galaxy on their first try on Thanos' ship in infinity war... including knowing about and going through jumps, given that traveling that distance would be impossible in a lifetime otherwise.   I was happy to suspend disbelief given that it's a comic book movie.
Yeah but he did do that overnight
He added the QuantumTunnel NuGet package to his TimeTravel solution and created his own QuantumNavigation class
And they were both using a method that Hank Pym stumbled upon.  3 super geniuses to invent time travel feels like enough imo (also Rocket helped iirc?)
I don't think he was working with Bruce together, was he? He rejected Steve, Nat & Scott so they went to Bruce. I thought Bruce worked separately from Tony.
Came here for this only!
This exactly. If it's only a day for Tony then that means Bruce also made that machine in a day, which is unlikely based on how he said he wasn't familiar with it at the diner.
>Bruce could’ve worked for weeks  Or Months.
I'm glad this wasn't just me. I never understood his look during that scene and why he seemed so confused. Maybe RDJ was going for a bemused look. Like, sort of "Oh wow, in all the craziness I forgot I was in a time where my mom was pregnant with me how crazy", and it came off looking confused instead.
Your second paragraph is exactly my thought process. Will someone please ask the Russos or the writers about this bit? I'm really curious.
I always thought it was to set up a secret sibling
could also be a nod to the comics where Tony is adopted, but this goes down a whole other rabbit hole where 04071970 is July 4th not April 7th
It's tremendously dangerous, and it requires a fuel that only one person in the world knows how to produce/obtain, & that person adamantly refuses to do so.
De aging Paul Rudd is in the Guiness Book as the most expensive CGI ever used
He had been working on it because that night after the visit he told Friday to run another simulation with some variables changed (that he figured out because of the convo with Scott).
Chat GPZ
What was the name of the stoned one he had after Jarvis?  "Sokovia is going for a riiiide"
What information did Scott have?
no and we won’t. I do have a theory as to why he’s so puzzled, blurring the lines between irl and the movie universe between the Russo’s and RDJ being as good as they are that scene was intentional and very much not a mistake. my thought was that Tony’s adopted as a nod to the comics BUT that would mean they traveled back to July 4th 1970 not April. which would mean Tony was born 5 weeks earlier in May. that would explain why he’s confused without changing much else to the story
It is uncommon and it literally never happened to such a big discovery like this, much like Newton didn't just discover gravity and came up with an equation after an apple fell on his head
I mean it's a GPS, assuming it works similarly to our regular gps, he definitely could just fiddle with it and set it to a new destination and off he goes.
I agree with your second point wholeheartedly. The blip is such an interesting scifi conceit and in a universe where such a thing is not only possible but actually happened, the fallout could make for some really good stories. They've touched on it but only just. It's frustrating to me that the movies aren't more like comics, wherein when a huge event like that happens you can see its effects on a worldwide/universal scale but also in little personal character vignettes. I wish marvel would diversify within the medium a bit more. Thought we might see it in the d+ content, but so far the shows have just presented us with more of the same.
Damn bro you should probably just not engage with fictional content
I think hand wavey science is a requirement when dealing with theories not yet proven. they could get into the nitty gritty of time travel but what would they say? or they could touch on it and move on for a better story telling. and i’m not sure how the adjustments to their GPS doesn’t make sense? they got to the invasion in 2012 when they wanted to, albeit probably in up state NY rather than NYC but they’re not going to show you them traveling. same with the jump to 1970, NYC is not that far from the base in Jersey
I've seen several people make that complaint.
It's weird to make up arguments to defend yourself against. Who are these "people" acting like Endgame ruined Marvel's "groundedness" lmao. This was a movie where superpeople time travel to stop a purple alien's time clone from collecting magic rocks, what "groundedness"?   This was probably one person who replied to some nothing burger conversation on Twitter and homie ran to Reddit to make it a whole PSA for no reason.
Analyzing stuff isn’t weird. Some people think it’s fun.
This comment would be correct if some guy approached you in the street, but this IS the specific place to discuss such things and be passionate about details so I have to disagree.
Right? Who cares lol
That's not what happened. The composting dialogue is before he says "I figured it out."
No- she instantly realizes what it means. Tony figured it out, which means he was working on it, which means he was thinking about it. She knows he gets fixated on things, on helping to protect and save the world. He says he figured out time travel, and she knows the pin is already pulled and can’t be put back. They have a good relationship and she understands her partner well
She just knew exactly what that meant for him. He couldn’t look away now he knew he could try to save everyone.   Pepper always just wanted Tony to settle down with her but she knew that he was meant for more. It’s like their central conflict and one of the main themes of the entire Iron Man franchise.  I think her lack of surprise is just indicative that shes never been impressed by his brilliance or the suit, she'd rather all that stop and cease to exist. She loved him for the man he was and never got to just enjoy that, he belonged to the world more than her.
She’s always been a pillar in Tony’s life. She couldn’t freak out or start thinking the worse if her husband went thru with this. Every great man needs a woman like that.
That’s Paltrow just phoning it in and being herself instead of acting 🤷🏾‍♂️
That I will not deny. I appreciated the time jump for being something unexpected, as in the avengers lost and stayed defeated for five years, which then allowed us to see what loss does to a hero, but in terms of delivery for a lot it definitely left things out. How did Hawkeye become Ronin? Did Wakanda return to being isolated? The remnants of Shield that still existed post AOU? They could have at least developed some of the ground level issues more in Falcon and Winter Soldier but I don’t think that did enough world building either.
Yeah I’m gonna go ahead and say that’s a terrible idea. You really wanted 5 years of Tony working on time travel math? What does that even look like?  I swear some people just need to know what colour each characters shit was over those 5 years. The whole point is that we drop back in right when the action starts again. The whole point  of the time jump is to show that they just lost.. and accepted defeat and it was a bland couple years. We drop back in when that ends.
Agreed.  This was exactly my line of thought.
He found a way to run time through Scott
Still not bad for a specialist on gamma radiation.
Hank intentionally created the technology. Time travel was a side effect. Essentially time travel was discovered not invented, so the point is that Tony didn’t invent time travel.  He  invented a way to use it.
It was a throwaway joke. Marvel fans need to chill. This is how we got into "Tony can't create time travel in a day!!!" Yeah he can who gives a shit??
But then they're no better than the bad guys if they use this for their own personal gain, no?
“Let me guess, turned Scott into a baby?”
Duh a montage is several seconds of reading,writing and getting frustrated before discovering something. Don’t know why people think it just highlights several moments over the course of days or weeks
This goes back to people assuming Bruce Wayne got back to Gotham in The Dark Knight Rises in just a few days because the movie didn’t hold their hands and explicitly tell them how long it took. All the while ignoring the context clues that it took months (it being  hot at the prison and in Gotham when he left and being dead of winter in gotham when he arrived)
Well we know the last 2/3rds of the movie take place 5 years later, they told us that. Then the remainder of the movie occurs over the course of 2ish hours. It’s like 24, all events occur in real time after the 5 year jump (they didn’t give us another title card to tell us any different).
And everyone in the MCU has crippling constipation because we never see them use the toilet.
Where did Steve Rogers even come from?  We never saw his childhood!
To be fair she looked like she’s 25 or something
As cool as it would be to see Tony struggle through real life experiments if time travel, we need to ask how important to the main story it is. And unfortunately it isn’t, so we didn’t see it. You can’t follow him around for a 5 hour movie, as much as I’d probably watch that though lol
They must not.
Another thing that I think gets lost in the discussion is the data Scott retrieved while stuck in the quantum realm. Tony mentions that the theory exists but there was no way to do it because they didn't know enough about the quantum realm. It was Scott's data that allowed him develop the quantum GPS.  Really, Hank Pym did most of the work. Scott retrieved the necessary data, and Tony pushed it over the finish line.
And furthermore, what makes accessing the quantum realm possible is Pym particles.  Which not only did Tony not invent, he doesn't even know how to replicate.
I think that would be a TPS reporting device
>	Tony didn’t actually invent Time Travel  I agree, but him cheekly saying “I invited time travel" probably has stuck with people that don't like this plot point.
Yeah - Tony invented time travel the way Benz invented car travel. Tony invented a system to utilize the Quantum Realm to take you somewhere else in time and space. Benz invented a system to utilize thermodynamics and mechanics to take you somewhere else in space.   Same idea - application of principles (real or fictional) still constitutes invention
This is reminding me of the time many years ago I was walking on my college campus and there were two girls in front of me and I heard this conversation take place:  Girl 1: "Which one was Ben Franklin again?"  Girl 2: "He's the one who invented electricity."  Girl 1: Nods sagely "Oh, right."
And they actually needed Scott Lang to have the original idea to try it.  And the rat to free him from the quantum realm.
Rocket is the Howard Wolowitz to the others' Sheldon, Leonard, and Raj.
She-Hulk 1st episode implies that Tony & Bruce spent time together, Tony helped set up his lab in Mexico (plus built the bar).
Pretty sure that's how I took it.
Tony was born that year (May 29, 1970) so unlikely his mom could’ve fit another pregnancy in there that same year
Or he had been working on it after they met and they just showed the part where he nailed it.
He had already been working on it for some time *after* the conversation.   Notice that Tony didn’t just walk up to the table, he had already been standing there and running different simulations.
He had the information on how they could time travel, Tony then invented a way to navigate it safely
The information regarding the quantum realm, and time vortexes, and how they can possibly lead to time travel.  It wasn't until Scott showed up that Tony had a complete scope of what would make this type of stuff possible. It wasn't that Scott *gave* him specific information or anything, Tony just knew to use the rough idea of Pym tech to further his own.
No, while that Newton story is apocryphal, it’s the idea that a problem you’ve been working on for a while and that is constantly stewing in your brain is suddenly jerked into a moment of revelation by some stimuli. It’s the same thing as when you’re trying to remember a song’s title and it comes to you suddenly later on
Analyzing actual stuff brings good debate.  People are over analyzing and arguing about stuff that can be hand waved as "because the writers say so"
Yeah some people here need a hug and a non-toxic relationship lol
those candles don't make themselves ye know.
She wishes you well
That '5 years later' was a genuine shock in the cinema on the first watch though, really impactful.
Yeah I was hoping Phase 4 would have given us that, but we received little bits here and there.  I'm hoping we'll get more in the future. Hell, I feel like an X-Men project taking place during the 5 year gap would be very interesting as well.
And I watched it
essentially the most powerful machine of all, the one that can keeps you young and with all the previous memories kept
Who is apparently now also a therapist and medical doctor.
Feel you. You answered my question at the beginning though. Hank’s tech wasn’t *for* time travel when he made it.
using a machine to fix an injury with no harm to anyone else is not really villainy
How is it bad?
The hour's approaching, to give it your best   And you've got to reach your prime.   That’s when you need to put yourself to the test   And show us a passage of time   We're going to need a montage
If there's no '80s power ballad, it's not a montage as far as I'm concerned.
Don't think a montage would work in this scene, because Tony was desperately telling himself he wasn't really involved, right up until the moment he succeeded.
So, like, an entire *planet* full of *people* was just sitting there? I don't think so. Worlds require billions of years to form, cool, develop organic life, create digital watches. We aren't even told if this stuff evolved from primitive origins, or was intelligently designed!
It was the 1940's and now it's the 2010's? It's only been 10 minutes!
She was 16-17 playing a 14 year old. Quite the stretch… I see how it took you out of the realistic world of the *post snap* problems when that 14 year old looks suspiciously 15. Smoking causes the skin to age, and losing family might make ya pick up the habit? Does that help at all? /s
This. And yeah I mean I haven't even watched the Snyder cut of Justice League because it's so long yet I gotta admit if they had kept the Snyder cut and found a good way to split it into two movies it would've been better.  I actually like all the extra shit my brother has told me about the Snyder cut.
In essence, it was a team effort. I love it.
Like in Interstellar. Where the data gained from going near the black hole would supposedly help “solve the problem of gravity”. It didn’t end up working, but the concept is the same.
We can’t even say for certain hank invented it  Pretty sure he just discovered it as opposed to deliberately using science to invent this magical thing
And the person who founded the storage unit in the first place to create affordable housing for the rat.      People always forget that part of the equation.
Scott Lang is Penny. He’s just hanging out
Yes but they didn't work together for the time machine thing. Bruce made his own which turned out flawed, and Tony also made his own.
He specifically says "I've got a mild inspiration" before he asks Friday to run the new simulation. I think it's pretty clear what the intent / meaning is there.   What's more likely - that Tony literally invented the necessary components for time travel in an afternoon between cleaning up from dinner and doing dishes or that he got the last piece of info he needed from Scott?
It wouldn’t be a super hero movie without some tragedy and trauma that inspires their life
😂
I worked on the movie and it shocked the hell out of me.
very much. I was very shocked and my date audibly gasped
Not meant to be taken too seriously, just internet arguing with a passion for fun.   I don’t understand people that complain so much about missing things during the time jump, I include you in that.
And I watched you
Credit where it's due.
If you are a scientist. You are a doctor in all fields according to comic books. Its a very broad field of science." I got my degree in all the fields"
No, but it's a slippery slope, and the motive behind it is selfish gain.
Because they'd be using it for selfish gain
A montage.....
Good guys, bad guys, and explosionssss
They even tried to retcon it by making it only half full to make it more believable
And who writes this stuff? What’s there life like? They got hobbies? They really need to build these things up better.
The Snyder cut gave the characters heart.
*AVENGERS*   …   collaborate!
It did help, that's the binary data he encodes into the watch hands.
I mean, sure.  But he invented the process for creating more Pym particles.  So he's the inventor of Pym particles because they are created in a lab and he invented the process for doing so.
Also Jack Kirby played a big part in making it all possible, he never gets credit.
If we weren't trying to find a place for Rocket, I would have had Scott as Howard. Scott is actually much closer to Howard... Magic tricks, engineer, quantum realm astronaut.
I was thinking more along the lines of exchanging ideas.
He also says “before we pack it up for the night” heavily implying that he had been at it for some time that specific night already.  To be clear, my point was never that he invented time travel in one night, it was that he didn’t work on it until after the conversation. I imagine at least a few days passed between the conversation and him showing up at the compound. He’s also wearing different clothes the night he cracks it than he was during the conversation. They took place on different days.  And Tony didn’t invent time travel, he basically just invented a time GPS.
That's what marvel needs to do now. The opposite Joker/Harley dynamic where the girls very mentally abusive to the man superhero lol
What did you do?
And I watched the sun rise
Dang what was I doin
It's not selfish gain unless Rhodey himself pushes the matter to get his legs back. If someone else comes up with the idea and gifts it to Rhodey, it is altruism.
The good they could do would be increased. The slippery slope would be closer to a time when they start using it haphazardly or where it could affect others.
Bruh tryna be a monk lmao
Even Rocky had a montage..
Push it to the limit
Different but equally good song, my friend.
That's what I heard and admittedly I did walk in for a scene toward the end and I saw Joker and watched for a little bit and I was like "Wow cannot believe they cut this shit they are morons."
And listen.  Tony's back with a brand new invention.
Oh snap you’re right. I remembered he put it in the watch hands I’d just forgotten where he got it from. Thanks.
You’re right, makes sense.
I’m in post production.
And I watched the daughter fall
"When you mess with time it tends to mess back." You cannot seriously believe the avengers would use the machine in any scenario except an absolute disaster, which they considered the snap as.  I'm not going to mess with the stability of the universe using a machine that has unknown side effects just to give a dude a 6 pack.  Need I remind you that even using the machine to undo the snap resulted in a branched timeline that unleashed Kang the Conquerer onto the multiverse. Undoing the Thanos snap is the direct cause that lead to the series of events where Kang is let loose.
The damage they could do would FAR outweigh the good.   Need I remind you that simply using it to undo the snap created a branching timeline that led to Kang being unleashed upon the multiverse, as well as incursions and supposedly the end of all time?
> I hate that people try to act like Marvel lost its grounded ness in Endgame because “Tony figured out time travel in one night”. No. He didn’t. This genius that built a mech suit in a cave with scrapes worked until Morgan was born at LEAST. He gives up on it because Morgan is born but he very much implies he had been working on it for some time when talking with Cap and Nat and Scott. They inspired him to return to it and the image with Peter gave him the idea to invert the design but he did not just magically come up with it in one night. Plus he may have worked on it for even longer because he implies that the “push time through Scott” happened to him at some point, he seems to take issue with the date of his own birth when talking to his father in the past, and later during the final battle he says “when you mess with time it tends to mess back”. All of this implies he had those troubles prior to the meeting. >  >   Rocky was the KING of montages too! IIRC Rocky IV was only 93 minutes and 1/3rd of the film was montages. I'm amazed it didn't win an Oscar for editing.
Even though that movie didn’t make much at the box office..it lives on in the best way like Dewey Cox that everyone’s seen it jow
Always fade out at the end of the montage...
That was not part of the original cut, was some dumb shit Snyder threw together when working on the Snyder cut release.
I never argued that it would be a good idea. I was only arguing from a point of linguistics. By definition, you can't say an action is selfish when the person being accused doesn't gain anything. Is it a good idea regardless? No.
That’s true. I wonder if dragging yourself to heal wounds would effect timelines since you’re not actually traveling through time. Obviously if you’re meant to be wounded it could create a dangerous branch, but as we saw in Loki, the TVA was pretty forgiving to the Avengers that we follow timeline. Which would reasonably suggest that if the War Machine that audiences are familiar with used it to get his legs working again, that would be in the timeline that is considered the correct line.
I'm not about to get into philosophy and morality here, but one could argue that saving one friend from paralysis at the potential cost of entire timelines is pretty selfish.   It all stems down to "would you save 1 friend or 5 strangers in a burning building." It's only natural to want to save the friend, it comes from a place of selfishness and love, but it's normal.  There was actually a plot of friends where they argued if there was such a good thing as a selfless good deed, because correctly wired humans are programmed to be happy when we do good and help others. The question was is it really selfless if we do it to feel good.
Any writer worth their salt would put limitations on time travel. When you have no rules, it creates examples of "why didn't they just do x."   I like to write for fun, there's a lot of focus on magic in my story, and the general rule of thumb is that the farther back something takes place, the more power it takes to go there and the less likely you are to be able to make any permanent changes.    Magic is fun, but you have to put limitations on things. A good example is the kids show Fairly odd parents. Timmy realistically could have anything he wanted, which would prevent issues from happening since anything could be solved with a wish. So the writer balanced it by adding "da rules".    Tldr: Magic and Time travel have to have rules/limitations in fiction otherwise they could solve any problem effortlessly.
Yeah I’m certainly aware of that balance. It doesn’t mean that the effect would be the damage that you’re imagining. The effect could be a sense of risk (one time we may not stop de-aging and it will be our death, like a game of Russian Roulette. Or it could be an effect on self - you’re younger now but you age faster to catch up which will tie you to the machine in a dangerous dependency or it simply shaves time off your lifespan. In this case the risks on the public would not be present even if we’re going meta to the writer’s with this discussion.
The things I'd do to have Elodie Yung back
Nice Art. Wonder if we will see as much religion on Disney+ though. There maybe a genuine reason why not though, because Matt is more comfortable in his own skin and with his life from the previous two productions we have seen him in, so may not need so much confessional or advice.
Nice art. I hope they keep some of the violence and grit from the Netflix show.
It's necessary to include his religion.It's fundamental to the character.
Oh I agree. I didn't mean not at all, I was just thinking less than S1 and S3 of the netflix shows.
I've been on this sub since at least 2014, it has definitely changed over that time as the MCU has become more popular.  Any subreddit changes (generally gets worse) as it gets more popular, and the popularity of Infinity War and Endgame brought a lot of more casual fans into both MCU fandom and this subreddit.  Whereas in 2016 a user on this sub was likely fairly interested in the MCU and likely to be inclined to want to like new MCU output, in 2023 a user may just be casually interested and more likely to be critical, particularly if the recent output doesn't match what they came to expect from Infinity War and Endgame.    Add to that that the MCU is undoubtedly going through a weaker patch than what you might have expected coming off of Civil War, Infinity War, Ragnarok, Guardians 2, Homecoming, Black Panther, and Endgame all coming out in three years.  There's likely many reasons for this:   - Losing strong leads the audience had grown attached to after years of familiarity  - Culminating a long term storyline and character arcs with big payoffs  - An apparent Disney mandate to increase output to levels that appear to stress the studio's ability to manage  - A need to introduce new characters that the audience hasn't yet grown attached to  - A willingness to take larger risks with their output   There are likely more reasons, but that's what I came up with off the top of my head.  That said, I agree that this sub is worse than it used to be.  It is more negative and is hewing closer to Reddit's general negative discourse, which would make sense if more people were getting pulled into it.  I certainly browse it much less than I used to.  Even movie release discussions are less "what are the impacts of this event in the movie" or other in depth discussions and more low effort jokes, "I loved this scene", and general basic discussion.  That said, there's likely no going back.  We've reached the Eternal September, and likely did years ago.
>now it seems that you have a higher chance of getting downvoted and attacked for saying anything positive about the MCU  On certain subjects this undeniable.   Liking Moon Knight or She-Hulk is a crime apparently.
What gets me are the comments of “it’s ok to admit it’s bad, no need to jump through hoops to try to defend it” when replying to someone praising anything in phase 4.  Super condescending. No, I’m not trying to come up with ways to defend it, I actually liked it.
I feel that Reddit is one of the most negative social media platforms around. I've been on other seemingly innocuous subreddits. Usually it's starts off overly positive and then goes negative really quick. Reddits subs + upvote/downvote attract echo chambers of negativity
The Spoiler Sub getting deleted was good for Upcoming Marvel projects tho. A lot of all the biggest scoopers who spew leaks and rumors on a daily basis have been very quiet💀😆 like nobody knows what’s happening in Secret invasion or the Marvels post Re-shoots. It’s actually working, and people I know offline have agreed that they are more open to what Marvel is cooking now that they don’t have ridiculous Rumors on a nearly daily basis. A lot of those reddit users have influx the main MCU threads so that’s probably why it’s more toxic online, but I feel like Marvel is about to be on a Upswing In Quality very soon. Think people just needed more time to not have a project every 2 months😆💀 and we needed less drama. The Majors & Alanso thing is still going on, but I truly think Iger and Fiege are addressing a lot of Marvels phase 4 criticisms. By this time next year I think Marvel will be back in the graces with critics and fans that jumped off recently
Yea, this sub used to be less toxic and less bigoted. Before EndGame, this sub had less than a million members. It's more than tripled now. Some of these are people who expect the same peak as Infinity War/EndGame. But any long time follower of the MCU knows the quality has not always been constant. And now you have the TV shows with even more varying themes and quality. Another large influx is those who are here to spew the exact same shit you see on the clickbait whiny movie commentaries you see on YouTube. That shit used to be absent from here in 6 years ago.
Star Wars has the same problem, but the sub StarWarsCantina focuses on positivity. Don't like something, okay, but let's just talk about what we like instead. I hang out there much more. Maybe Marvel needs something like that.
Honestly, I hadn't noticed. I was under the impression that the negativity is because Phase 4 has been pretty middling and the fans are being honest about it.  Now that you've alluded to this, I am gonna look out for this. If honest nuanced opinions are getting down votes just because, then that's not cool.
It's not only quality, it's also Marvel is trying to expand on the style of storytelling. It might not be for everyone, and that's ok. But there is a permeable vibe that everything needs to be 110 percent...and that's not possible when you try different things. I don't love everything, but I appreciate the attempt. It's sad that it's the norm to just attack and say that Marvel is done. Same with DC.
I say fuck em honestly. They desperately need you to digest their algorithms of why a movie is bad. They can’t simply dislike it, they’re out to argue about why it’s impossible for people to enjoy it, with cherry picked “proof” in tow.  A topic a couple of weeks ago was outright telling people to post their cosplays in a different subreddit. Because a fan subreddit is obviously for cynicism only.  Excitement just pisses them off.  So fuck em
Normal people like or dislike things and go on living their lives.  Sometimes they post about something they like to feel the social aspect of positive fandom, but then usually immediately regret it when the trolls attack.  There is a small contingent of fandoms that are toxically positive, but honestly I've never seen any actual examples of this in this subreddit, myself, and I've been on this subreddit for a LONG time.  What I mostly see is people explaining why they like something that's being maligned, and them then being attacked for disagreeing with the hate brigades.  The contingent that has been making this sub worse, and most fandoms really (again, there are SOME fandoms that get ruined by toxic positivity, gatekeeping, etc.) are the trolls and hate brigades.  These individuals have to feel like they're in the right, and they have to feel that they're both the heroes ("WE'RE the ones pushing LEGITIMATE criticisms") and the victims ("We can't criticize anything without being attacked"....which is total horseshit).  Both are always portrayed as objective fact, and if you disagree, you're an MCU shill, too "woke," or an ignorant dullite.  It takes a special kind of pathetic to find adding to this kind of toxicity to be worth your time.  Normal people absolutely dislike things, even sometimes passionately, but they just don't give that thing any more of their time.  It's not worth it.  To brigade subreddits and such things with attacks has to add some value to their lives, whether it's just a sense of belonging (even if it's to an angry mob), or it could even be monetary (we all know there's plenty of THOSE YouTube channels that feed on the same darker sides of humanity that tabloids have always profited from).  I try to speak up positively as often as I can.  I don't think just staying quiet is the answer.  It gives the brigades control of the stage and the narrative, which is what they want.  I have criticisms here and there, but I sure as hell don't wanna feed the trolls.  I just know the MCU is an amazing collection of media and storytelling, created by human beings with passion, perspectives, and flaws, and am grateful to have access to it, and I like to contribute to the community that feels similarly.  I wanna just wanna be a human being that enjoys and appreciates when other human beings do good work.  There's LOTS of great work being done these days, all over the mediasphere, and the MCU is decent-sized chunk of it that's not like anything we've seen before.  To me, toxic internet randos don't have any contribution to that.
A lot of Marvel haters used to be Marvel fans.
I think anyone can tell from spending any amount of time that hardcore MCU fans have a very toxic relationship with their fandom. It’s good to love and appreciate something like the MCU, but there are literally thousands of fans in this sub that take criticisms of the MCU as personally as they would take criticisms of themselves as people. When you can’t read a dissenting opinion about a movie franchise you like without sputtering off hateful comments and getting offended, you probably need to reevaluate your priorities. It ain’t that deep.
MCU is becoming Star Wars - fanboys vs haters and the general public generally showing up without a strong opinion one way or another while people squabble.   Fanboys are mad because the content isn't on a pedestal and haters are pissed because the content isn't as good, both have valid points but are extremely toxic about it.  Share your opinions, if people on the internet disagree, who cares, it's not the end of the world.
I got a 3 day ban for trash talking someone who was race-baiting. The racist in question did not get a ban.  The racist just deleted his comments like a coward.  I barely bother coming here anymore. The place has gone to hell.
I shared a post of a commentator being critical of Jonathan Majors and their attorney, and it got removed for being "repetitive." I hadn't seen anyone else post it, and it felt like it was removed for being critical.
Which is why I like the few film YouTubers who isn’t a chud, **Nando V. Movies**. His recent video about the positives of phase 4, should be a must -see video for those people you mention. Because sure, there a lot of legit criticisms towards phase 4, however, there are lot of good nuggets in this phase, and Nando listed *every, single, good thing* about the phase. It’s a shame the sub has delve into this toxicity, and I’m worried we’ll become the Fandom Menace, but for the MCU.
The people who are negative feel that everything else is too positive, the people who are positive feel everything else is too negative.  A big problem in general is that there is a lack of nuance and both extreme sides of this spectrum prefer to speak as though their takes are objective and their feelings get in the way of having an interesting discussion. People will think they know better than you if you don't share their opinion because they have only surrounded and validated themselves with others who do. Instead of understanding a different viewpoint, the downvote button is used to filter and curate an echo chamber.
Yup, it's getting just as toxic as the Star Wars and Pokémon subs, though it's not QUITE there yet
It's partially because the Spoiler subreddit got shut down, so the toxic people from there fled over here.
This sub is definitely weird. :) I've posted tongue in cheek things that were not at all offensive (just silly), labeled humor, and had people go off as though it were serious. I've also had things deleted for low effort and reviewed the rules about what qualifies, and then messaged the mods and had it reversed. (One was a meme I created from scratch with a humorous text analyzing the scene, for example). It's a strange little place, but I'm still here on and off :)
''(have allowed thousands of posts defending Eternals and Thor 4)''    whats up with them? or was it just the point of there's been loads of the same posts over and over?
I think it’s an ebb and flow. The most recent content hasn’t been the best. You’re gonna have negativity with that. On top of that people in general are less happy. Everything is expensive and now we’re all stuck inside again, but this time it’s because we can’t afford anything. Mid tier content juxtaposed to the economy and you’re gonna have some people taking their frustration out on minor annoyances.   I consider myself a more neutral fan or a “cheap date” fan. I’m just appreciative for the distraction.
Who actually cares how many votes their comments get?
If phase 4 wasnt bad you wouldnt experience this. People are tired of low quality but we are getting on the right path again. Marvel achieved a Star Wars level - bad movies = angry fandom  and obviously there are some peanuts who love them unconditionally. It will be fixed in next year or two. MCU needs to recover
During the Infinity Saga we had 2 or 3 movies that werent great. Sure there were debates about which was worse or better but generally we all agreed on the same things. In the multiverse Saga, we've only just finished Phase 4 and most the projects from that phase are very divisive. That means there will be more arguing about which movie is good and bad, which show is better than the other, etc.
This is one of the most astroturfed subs on Reddit. I doubt most posts are from real people
welcome to the internet, my friend
What really gets me about the direction this sub is heading is the absolute pessimism that has taken over a segment of the fanbase. Like any news about the new Daredevil is just met with negativity because a supporting character hasn’t been announced yet or that it won’t meet their violent expectation so they’ll just be negative about it. They think cause Moon Knight wasn’t some gory orgy of violence that there is no way DD would be violent either so they dismiss it already. “They lied about MK so they’re lying about DD” is the most lame, I’m-the-victim argument ever. But the lack of throat-ripping and face crunching I guess means it’s bad? Like let DD be out for a few episodes before you bash it. This fanbase went from fun speculation to outright pessimism it’s not a fun place to be anymore.
I think the sub correctly reflects the overall mood Marvel has recently, a lot of mishaps have happened and fatigue might be settling in. The happy posts around Endgame times were euphoric
My crackpot theory is it’s all because of:   The Batman. That movie dropped and became a huge reminder to comic movie fans that the movie can be a well done film too. People being critical skyrocketed after that  Same with Star Wars lately. Was your usual mixed bag but, was overall happy. Andor dropped and now all Star Wars media has been getting torn apart aside from The Bad Batch. Not even The Mandalorian is safe anymore
Take a shot every time you see the word 'toxic' in the comments.
Bro this is the internet and people will have opinions. If the volume of posts are all of a sudden more negative than positive, it should tell you something about the quality of the MCU right now.   I don’t know how you perceive excess criticism these days as simply people being mean without merit when those same people were filling seats at marvel premieres while the MCU was producing quality content pre-FFH.  Im ditching this sub for many reasons, but I find sensitive posts like these super hypocritical because they come down to whether OP has been winning or losing debates in sub-threads. When you dont like the mods, you try to make your opinion known to them and, if there is no change, you leave. Thats it. Im adding this post to my list of reasons for ✌️’ out. That said, ✌️
It’s not just the sub, it’s the fans in general. The MCU has turned into Star Wars, where the fans hate everything
I don’t even come here much anymore because it’s all spoilers for casting and behind the scenes stuff.
It’s the same thing with gaming communities. When the content is good, people happy. When the content is not good, people not happy. Phase 4 being such a mixed bags of reactions likely effected this
It's MSS invasion. They don't have anywhere else to go, so they came here. That is also the reason why there are a lot more set leaks etc... on this sub recently
I think you are conflating a lot of things. One, criticisms doesn't mean hate. You'll know hate when you see it. Two, if criticisms are backed up reasons, it's perhaps time to learn to respectfully engage in discussions. Three, blind love as a marker of coming into a shared space for fans is a weird benchmark. I'd point at One Piece and Naruto fandoms. In one, you could engage in disagreements, theories, criticisms, and on the other one has unabashed love for the series with downvotes to anyone who might like something others don't. I'd definitely pick the former.
A lot of the negativity is because people think that the MCU basically halfassed Phase Four as a money grab and fans are rightfully upset. It’s frankly amazing the lengths some people will go to defend a multi billion dollar company. Disney doesn’t care if a product is good as long as it turns a profit and they are prepared to milk an IP dry to do it.
I'm only here because the MCU spoiler sub went private.
[removed]
If people really do hate the current direction, then they should really just leave. There are better things to watch that they'll enjoy more.
It really felt like eternals started this whole thing
Ok fine I'll try to be more positive now. You're kinda right. I'll try to balance both negatives and positives.
Oh yeah this sub is corrupt. The mods especially are on a power trip. They act like they can own an entire community and decide what is and isn’t repetitive. Also ban people for stuff that’s not even listed in the rules apparently. I remember when Endgame came out and this sub was heaven. How times have changed.
The state of things: Marvel needs to go away for a while.
Just jump over to the [Stork Club](https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelStorkClub/). And invite other like minded fellows to do the same. It can use more members to start some real discussions.
Yeah, this is why I left after being a 7 year member (this post was still recommended to me in r/All)   It’s a mix of things but mainly, the “fandom” has grown so big to the point where negativity and hyper criticism has taken the reigns whenever the slightest thing goes wrong.  That and the fact that the change in direction after Endgame with the greater focus on more characters and higher movie output hasn’t been as balanced as it could’ve been. People are blowing up the biggest faults of the MCU at the moment way beyond reason. Gunn trashing the franchise is unfortunate and his claims getting upvoted so high even more so.   What Marvel needs to do is focus on more character driven arcs and slow down the output to make a more clear overall narrative. Also, probably not save Avengers movies for the end of phases anymore. They were a good way to we’ve everyone’s story in after a short while
I agree about the mods
Marvel is literally going through hell right now- covid, Chadwick Boseman's death, Stan Lee's death, Jeremy Renner's accident, Victoria Alonso's exit and Jonathan Majors' arrest
I unsubbed a few weeks back. Too much spoilery content after MCU Spoilers was shut down. I just couldn’t take it anymore. Every now and then I will check in, but for the most part I don’t miss it that much.
Why would you expect nuanced and balanced discussions, or even any semblance of coherent discourse in a Marvel reddit sub? You know it's filled of literal children, right? Children and, you guessed it, Marvel fans.
100% agree.  I've been here regularly since just after Infinity War came out, and I really feel like especially in the past year or two, there's been a lot of negativity/bitterness relative to before.  It's perfectly okay for there to be criticism of the franchise. But one thing that bummed me out recently was that for two separate replies I wrote to someone else's comments, in which I was basically agreeing with those people's praises and adding my own, I received replies that were disproportionately negative. As in, I felt like I was almost being admonished for expressing myself. In particular, I mentioned Moon Knight in both posts - the first instance in particular had a tone of almost being angry that I said I loved the show and basically told me to read the comics as a superior substitute. I do plan to explore the comics - but what about my honestly positive opinion makes someone so aggravated that there's a need to smack me down? I don't see myself doing that to someone else even if I hard disagreed with them. I didn't ever experience that prior to last year.  I just don't even know what to think anymore except that as fanbases grow, this seems to be a common path for many (not all). It's very saddening to me, but I know I have to try harder to sift through the overtly negative, be selective about what I post, and just try to enjoy what I can. But it shouldn't have to be that way.
It’s tough to enjoy this sub when there’s more time spent on angry redditors complaining about the most recent thing Jeff Loveness said in an interview vs wanting to discuss characters, arcs or anything really that’s not to do with behind the scenes drama or complaining.
I mean, the mods could pull it back, it would just require work.
I used to be a bigger marvel fan. For a while I would go on this sub in my free time and theorize, talk about fan casting and rank previous movies, but man I feel like the last few months have really made me feel bad for being a marvel fan.   I know that’s stupid, but I can’t go onto tiktok or Reddit without seeing “marvel should’ve ended after endgame” or “the mcu is woke now” or “marvel cgi looks like spy kids 3” or “Thor 4 was the worst movie of all time” and so on   Like I understand there’s things to complain about, there just seems like such a hatred towards the mcu, like people treat it as shitty quality entertainment and it’s starting to rub off on me   I’m sure there’s a lot of people who feel the same. And sure I can just skip over those posts, but after a while I’ve just tried to avoid this side of Reddit  Yeah I can just disregard other people’s opinions because of course people can disagree, but it’s kinda hard not to
So if you are a fan of movies, a fan of this genre of movies, a fan of Marvel, a fan of comic books, and a fan of reviewing and talking about movies, you can't state legitimate  negative issues? Or, there is a limited, select way to discuss movies intelligently?  Nah.
The moon knight one is so weird to me too. I have problems with moon knight and I had problems when it came out, but I still genuinely enjoy it, and I thought that’s how the general discourse was.   Come here recently and turns out that I was wrong lol. Don’t even know what I missed but I guess we don’t like MK now.
Moon Knight and She-Hulk were fantastic and I will die on that hill.
I wasn't really a fan of She-Hulk, but Moon Knight was great
I liked both of those shows better than Thor 4, strange 2 or Antman.
The She-Hulk madness is genuinely one of the craziest things I’ve seen on the internet. The hyperbole is SO strong with that one
Fr? I said once that I thought that She-Hulk was unfunny and I got downvoted all the way to the pits of hell  Edit: See what I mean?
Also not liking She-Hulk is a crime too. Not only you get massive downvoted, also got insulted, which is against the rules, but apparently mods are ok with it.
I liked She-Hulk. It was very close to the original comic book series. Just for reference, I'm one of a very few  who had the full complete run of She-Hulk comics...and bought them as they were published originally. Not a lot of people were collecting that title.  The TV show was light fun. Heads and Shoulders better than Iron Fist, Luke Cage, Daredevil, and every single DC series.  Moon Knight? Meh. I get that people liked it, but I thought it was clumsy.
I mean Moon Knight was pretty good.   She-Hulk on the other hand was just someone using Marvel's money to focus on attacking a group of people via insults and making fun of predicted (and valid) criticisms instead of focusing on a good storyline.
[removed]
I haven't seen either, but I heard Moon Knight is a kind of Jekyll and Hyde-type thing which I love the idea of.
"You can't have an opinion different than mine because I hold the absolute truth and any attempt at going against my opinion is just mental gymnastics because they're coping hard"  That's basically reddit
This happens a lot in other big franchises lately, just today with the new episode of the Mandalorian, you have people on reddit commenting "wow this is straight-up shit, stop lying to yourselves".              Quality is always going to be subjective (I guess to an extent but not really, even the most widely hated thing will be liked by someone) - if you like something that I dislike, cool. If you dislike something that I like, cool. It's all cool.
I feel the same way when discussing The Last Jedi. Like, I know that movie took the story in ways some people didn't like, but I honestly think it's a great movie.  But no, if you say you enjoyed it, you just have terrible taste and don't want to recognize it's a terrible movie.
yep.   while they weren’t my fave movies, I don’t have anything bad to say about any of them.   My favourite characters are getting adaptations that *i like* ….so what’s the problem with that? Why do I get downvoted or scolded because *I liked the version that is given to us*
Ugh...I cannot stand those comments. Internet anonymity really brings people's inner ugliness out hard-core.
I’ve gotten that often on here and Twitter lol. Just proves people are lazy and can’t come up civil disagreements/discussions. The response used to piss me off until I stopped responding entirely to it.
Reddit is a slightly, SLIGHTLY, less toxic place than Twitter. It's a slice of online fantasy that too many like to pretend is indicative of reality.
People spend way too much time on reddit that's why
I hated all the spoilers. It lead to more toxicity and ruined any kind of expectations/ build up for the movie. If only trailers could get back to that as well.
Dude the comments on the post of DP3 getting a writer from She-Hulk were EMBARRASSING, I feel bad for these people’s mothers and sisters, there’s no way in hell they have any girlfriends in their life with that energy
[removed]
It’s ridiculously easy to criticize, critique, and talk about what you don’t like. People become damn near coy when you ask them to talk about what they do enjoy.  And now it just seems like they just lean into the back and forward. Like how many times do we need to hear that Gorr and Mephisto should’ve killed She-Hulk? We heard you the first time.  And then they get upset when you don’t engage it head on, you can’t even just be ok with what they’re saying. They need an engagement and agreement.  You’re right to call it exactly what it is, a brigade. Outright trying to stifle fan conversations. There’s one in the Quantumania thread telling a person commenting their excitement to “stop now, it flopped.”
>I try to speak up positively as often as I can.  I don't think just staying quiet is the answer.  It gives the brigades control of the stage and the narrative, which is what they want.  I have criticisms here and there, but I sure as hell don't wanna feed the trolls.  There's this bizarre phenomenon occurring everywhere at the moment where you're either with us or against us. You have to be one thing or the other. You have to love something or hate it. If something isn't 100% perfect or didn't match your expectations, you must hate it. It's impossible to have a nuanced view.   For example I really enjoyed Thor 4, it was silly and fun. I also have a long list of things I would have done differently and ways the movie could be better. It was by no means perfect. But by saying that it becomes a gotcha, "So you admit the movie wasn't very good!" or "Liking something you think could be better proves you have bad taste!". It's fucking exhausting trying to find some middle ground.   It was bad enough when it was about projects that had actually been released and we had all actually watched, but now people are arguing about movies and shows that haven't even been written yet. Jeff Loveness could write the most amazing script ever and there would still be a hoard of negative naysayers shitting all over it because they've already taken a side. They've all decided already that Secret Wars and Kang Dynasty are going to be bad and these movies will have to work 20 times as hard to impress them.
Most Marvel haters were always Marvel haters.
There was significant (and majority) criticism of Jonathan Majors and his attorney. That might've been because they had one giant thread about the arrest and another about his text messages.
I am sorry if you felt that. I am not the mod that removed it, but I imagine it was removed because the opinions that the commentator had were no different than the opinions of your own users who had already shared those opinions multiple times.    We never remove something for being critical. We may remove it because it's getting that criticism out with a trollish attitude. But not because it is critical.
It’s because the mods don’t want any negative MCU talk on here. You’re not allowed to have a different opinion than them.
lol Pokemon subs are toxic? Genuinely curious.
One thing I’ve noticed on this sub, is how “Rick and Morty writers” has become like an insult now. Acting as if Rick and Morty is some dumb little show beneath the MCU or something.
This sub was generally more toxic than MSS tho.
I felt like the odd one out at the time because there was a bunch of stuff I wanted to dissect - not even outright crap on, mainly analyze and come to terms with - and such but people just wanted to be in their happy bubbles and I didn't want to burst too many of them.
Then why the fck do we even watch these movies? Or any movies. We're not suppose to buy their products because they're rich right? Is there a small indie company making Marvel movies?
>You’re complaining about low effort posts getting downvoted. Why?  No, I'm complaining about posts defending Phase 4 (or just commenting on the state of the franchise) instantly getting downvoted and attacked while other posts (that are even more repetitive) get upvoted.  >Your (anyone reading this) take on Quantumania or Love and Thunder or whatever is almost guaranteed to be an unoriginal thought. There’s millions of users here. Nobody cares about opinion posts because nobody has an opinion that hasn’t already been shared ad nauseam by the time a movie is even a few weeks old, let alone months or years after the fact. And frankly a lot of these posts aren’t well written and come off as either shill-y, troll-y or ignorant.   >   >That’s why “positive and negative” opinion posts (rightfully) get downvoted.  I'm not talking about my take on 'Quantumania' or 'Love and Thunder'. I'm talking about the state of things in general. Anytime I've tried to make a post commenting on the discourse, it's either been removed by mods or instantly downvoted and attacked by people who don't like Phase 4. I wouldn't have a problem with the mods taking down the post if they were more consistent about it. Why do they allow hundreds of "What Annoys You About The MCU?" or "What Changes From The Comics Have You Hated?" posts while deleting the positive ones for being repetitive?!  You're assuming that I'm sitting here crying because people don't support my 'Quantumania' defense posts. That's not true whatsoever. I'm talking about the people who don't like Phase 4 instantly downvoting and attacking those who do.
Cash crab as the original name for Mr. Krabs.
Ok
I literally cannot stand when subreddits for IPs become just users arguing about what the actors/actresses and execs say in interviews or press conferences.   Absolutely takes away from any meaningful discourse or good discussion. Obviously I’m new here, but that’s been the predominant post I’ve seen here.
And then there's this type of comment. It's the, "*I'm sorry, I thought this was America*" of negative comments.
I really loved some aspects of Moon Knight and really disliked some aspects. But overall I'm glad it exists. It's honestly fucking onsane that there a fucking Moon Knight TV series in the first place
I've noticed this too! When MK was airing, I saw tons of love for it here, especially in the episode discussion threads. Now here there's mostly discussion talking about it in a lukewarm or highly negative fashion...whereas if you go elsewhere on the Internet, there's a much wider range of discussion, and certainly lots of fans of the series.  I know a lot of fans of the comics were/are critical of it, and that's quite understandable. But the wild pendulum swing *here* is so strange. I got called out for expressing my praise for the MK series here twice and now I'm basically more gun-shy of talking about it here.
You won't die alone!
I don't think fans are being truthful in reviewing Marvel movies unless they admit both Black Panther movies had big parts that just did not work. I don't score either of them high.
> The show just portrays men to be such assholes.  Except for Matt, Pug, Bruce, Jen's dad, everybody at the retreat,....
just because someone likes to dance doesn't mean they like to be catcalled lol
>She also claims she is able to control her anger "Infinitely better than Bruce" because she claims she has been cat called in the street.  a character being naieve and overconfident before they face the adversity of their heroes journey?!  This is incredibly common, what is is about this character that you hate so m...  &#x200B;  >Also makes no sense how she claims that she hates being cat called in the street. But then starts twirking with Megan Thee Stallion.  &#x200B;  OH lol youre one of those that explains it, gross
Imagine thinking it’s contradictory to not want to be sexually harassed and also be allowed to dance if you feel like it
Thank God Reddit isn't the real world. There's too many stupid people online. Out in reality the stupidity can be mitigated.
Right. I said I actually enjoyed the episode and got downvoted into oblivion.
Well yeah but that movie did step on toes
I guess I must be a shill for Marvel because I am just happy to have all my favorite heroes and action figures as a kid brought to life on screen. Are some Films/shows better than others? Sure, but I have yet to seriously dislike anything Marvel Studios has made. I see it as one big epic universe Of storytelling and I am just glad we are getting any of it. I actually rather enjoy going back to some of the films I didn’t love as much and rewatching them and when I do, I always find something to make me say “I thought try at part was in one of the ones I liked better” or find plenty I do like after all. I’m not saying I am never critical, but it is okay to like a thing that isn’t flawless and perfect.
I don't have Twitter, but I'd agree.   I've posted on other subs and get down voted for an opinion. I'd at least like to have a rational discussion instead of going into the abyss. And it was asking for advice / feedback on something too....
I think the worst of Reddit is much, much worse than the worst of Twitter. It's just that reddit is much more segmented with different subreddits, so it's easier to avoid the worst of negativity (usually).
You don't have to watch the trailers
This is how I know the online consensus of She-Hulk wasn’t a true reflection of it’s quality. It’s not an MCU masterpiece or anything but people treat it like it’s the worst thing ever
I don't understand what's wrong with she hulk and Deadpool getting the writer from said show. Big deadpool fan here, I watched all of she hulk enjoyed it and even noticed many things that deadpool would do but differently of course.... on top of that Ryan Reynolds knows well on deadpool and wouldn't allow some stupid thing that's also not deadpools mo.
Phase 2 and 3 had their share of stinkers too. Has everyone forgotten fake Mandarin, Dark World, the worst Avengers movie, the Iron Bug Boy Jr., the repetitive and tiresome comedy bits in GOTG2, the bad effects in Black Panther's 3rd act, and Ragnarok just killing off Asgard without making it seem important at all? Endgame is one of my favorite movies, but it wasn't a garden of all roses on the way there. Phase 4 isn't any worse or better to me than phase 2 or 3, in terms of movies. I don't watch TV shows, so I wouldn't know about those. I separate the two, but I wouldn't doubt if people have dropped their impression of the MCU down based on the shows. Shows cannot keep up the quality of movies. It's impossible. But, then, we already saw that with SHIELD.
Yep.  And in my lifetime EVERY trend in film has been decried.  Replace "superhero movie" with "western," "sci-fi," "asteroid/end of the world," "zombie," "message movies," "holocaust," "hooker with a heart of gold," "Miramax Oscar chasers," etc., etc., gets hit by the exact same shit by the exact same people.  EXCEPT movies about men solving problems with violence.  The hordes NEVER complain about that story being told over and over, and they'll constantly start threads, write articles, and make videos about the "Greatest Actor/Scene/Movie of All Time" where some asshole acted tough and hurt people for some reason the film justifies, whether its Scorsese, Tarantino, Taylor Sheridan, or whatever.  Lots of great films in that category, but in their mind, those are the ONLY films that are worthy of unconditional praise.  Tells you a lot about who makes up these brigades.
Not true. Most Marvel haters didn't even know Marvel existed before 2008.
We have never and will never stop people from expressing their opinion unless    1. They express it in a fan-boyish or trollish way (Rule 6)   2. They make fun/degrade other people's opinions (Rule 2)   3. That opinion has been posted before/is a recurring subject of discussion (Rule 3)   4. That opinion is not elaborated on enough (Rule 4)   5. That opinion is based on misinformation, resulting in spreading that misinformation around (Reddit-wide rule)   If you see a specific opinion getting silenced that doesn't fall into these categories, you can always modmail us and we can answer our thought-process on why we might have removed said opinion and what rules it violated. Or if you make a compelling case that we're wrong, we will reinstate said opinion.
Yes. Talk crap about any gen or say you've only played up to a certain gen will get you sent into the negatives.
Very. Say you enjoyed any game after B2W2 and they say you're objectively wrong and stupid. Might be better now, but I can't be bothered to check
So we should just be happy with the slop they feed us?  That’s your take?  Next you’ll be raiving about how fantastic soylent green is.
Honestly that would make a good sub itself, one were only in-universe discussion is allowed and no discussion of actors and actresses/behind the scenes crap.
Fanboy subs only allow super fantastic neat everything is great comments. That's only been going on since 5 minutes after the first bulletin board went up.  Murica!!
And my axe!
I think the generalization of this nature is the problem.  I score both Black Panthers pretty high, and I still think they have issues. It doesn't mean I'm not being truthful, it means that the things that are problems for you aren't weighed the same as they are for me and the things that are highlights for me are weighed heavier than they are for you.  What people really fail to understand is that people like and dislike certain things to different degrees. Person A has no issue with say, the CGI in the climax. They don't even notice it until someone points it out. Person B notices, but it doesn't detract from their experience in any notable way. Person C notices and it takes away from the movie. All three of these people still have valid, truthful criticisms.
What about at a bar when She-Hulk was talking to a guy then he says "There's a hot chick, i'm gonna go and talk to IT." And another, when She-Hulk is talking to a man and he asks what she does, and she tells him how she's a lawyer, but he picks up his phone in the middle of it and completely ignores her. And then automatically tries to force her to pay. Another guy who refers to her as a "Specimen"  Yeah, Pug and Matt and Jen's dad are portrayed well, but it's so clear that the writers view men as chauvinistic narcissistic dismissive idiots. You really think i'm the only person who thinks this, and complains about this? There are quite literally millions of people, and hundreds of critics stating the exact same things about this show. Considering why they got so much backlash.
>a character being naieve and overconfident before they face theadversity of their heroes journey?!  This is incredibly common, what isis about this character that you hate so m...  This isn't her character being "naieve and overconfident" this is her simply stating that because she, as a female, has had to go through problems some females face, she is able to control her anger infinitely better than Bruce is. Acting like Bruce hasn't had his own set of problems to deal with.   She also complains about how she's not respected by her males peers in her own experties but then turns round and completely marginalize Bruce's experience as Hulk and is already convinced of her own superiority. So she is being hypocritical.  >OH lol youre one of those that explains it, gross  How am i wrong?? She complains about being cat called in the street. Then starts twirking with Megan Thee Stallion. So not only is she being hypocritical, she's also contradicting herself.
Umm… are we living in the same world? Lol. Jk.
That sucks, I wish people could just accept that some people enjoy things, some people don't.                  There's also a shift into retroactively calling stuff 'garbage' once something they prefer has been released. Has happened since Andor came out, now 'The Mandalorian was always boring trash'. We got it in the MCU too, once Loki came out, WandaVision became trash. I even saw people once Moon Knight came out saying Loki was trash.
Very true.
>Phase 2 and 3 had their share of stinkers too.  Well, yeah... Everything has they're fair share of bumps on the road. I never said they didn't. But Fizzy\_bunch said some of these people expect every movie to be at the same level of quality and detail and Infinity War and Endgame, and i'm saying i don't think that's the case, i think it's just that phase 4 was a bit of a mess. Because Phase 4 came out right after Far From Home, which was right after Endgame.  >Has everyone forgotten fake Mandarin, Dark World, the worst Avengers movie, the Iron Bug Boy Jr.  Fake Mandarin was definitely sucky. I personally thought Dark World was a little overhated but still definitely open to critisicm. Are you talking about Age Of Ultron with that worst avengers part? And also, i personally really liked Spider-Man's movies.
Yeah you guys say stuff is recurring when it’s not. It’s corrupt IMO and unfair. And I’ve seen people plead their case and y’all still don’t do anything about it. Literally anything that’s criticism is labeled as recurring lmao it’s ridiculous. Don’t ride your high horse and act like you haven’t stopped people from expressing their opinions which you clearly have. I wouldn’t be surprised if this comment is labeled as “trolling” by you guys.
Oh I can see this. My friends and I grew up with 1st gen in 99'. We're all old now and they do talk shit about younger generations lol
I got yelled at because I said despite the technical shortcomings I enjoyed the new Pokémon game the most since Gen 2.
I don't know what that is. I'm asking YOU what we should do? You're the one who said we shouldn't "defend" these billion dollar companies. I don't feel sorry for rich people, yeah, but I love Marvel and DC. So what's the solution? Should I stop liking what I like? Give up something I like because rich man makes movies?
The DCEU subreddit is a cesspool of just quotes from Gunn, Henry Cavill or the Rock 😂
How do you reconcile the huge issues with the plot quality with scoring the films "pretty high"?
> Yeah, Pug and Matt and Jen's dad are portrayed well, but it's so clear that the writers view men as chauvinistic narcissistic dismissive idiots.   ["All the men were portrayed the same way except for a whole lot that weren't."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faulty_generalization)
Dude, you are too angry about this lol. Grow up, my mans.
And now people are on here arguing that *Moon Knight* was trash.  It's exhausting.
Don't watch the movies. Only watch those you think will be good or interesting. I didn't watch Quantumania because it looked trash
>It doesn't mean I'm not being truthful, it means that the things that are problems for you aren't weighed the same as they are for me and the things that are highlights for me are weighed heavier than they are for you.  This part.  What you find to be a huge issue may not be a huge issue for someone else. When you start believing that what you think and criticize are objective is when discussion becomes redundant arguments of "It was bad/It was good" with nothing else to say.
Which is the weirdest thing because I'm not sure anything came out after Moon Knight to supplant it in terms of critical fans. For some fans, it's just all been a trash chute since Endgame, I guess.
>Only watch those you think will be good or interesting.  You can't form an opinion of a movie if you don't watch it. How will you know if something is good or not if you don't watch it? I'm not gonna base my opinion off of a trailer or word of mouth.
> objective  I firmly believe there are objective (explicitly not subjective) ways to evaluate films. Yes. I can list them.   I even use those definitions in my reviews.  And, if someone says "All of Salma Hayek's movies are brilliant and the highest rated films in cinema history because of her boobs" I can respect that. I don't agree, but I understand they are using an objective model.  But, most of the time, and maybe in your history, people rate without defining criteria.  So if I say "Both BPs were average-at-best because the plots were really bad and that leads to bad storytelling and a bad movie", it is a poor argument to just say "nah".  The BP movies looked good. Nice costumes.
It's called looking at the signs. If someone follows what you say, they'll have to see virtually everything to see if it's good or not. Most people don't have that time. I like to spend 2 hours watching a good movie, not trash like Quantumania. Trailers are made for a purpose. I saw the trailers for Shazam 2, which made it look so generic that any of the little interest I had in the character was gone. Reviews confirmed what I had sensed.  So I decided I wasn't gonna watch it. Similarly, Quantumania literally looked like spy kids in the movie. Furthermore audience reviews are a thing. Read a couple of them, you will get the idea what people are thinking about it and then make up your mind based on your taste.
>So if I say "Both BPs were average-at-best because the plots were really bad and that leads to bad storytelling and a bad movie", it is a poor argument to just say "nah".     Honestly it's a poor argument either way. The latter part is more poor, but "The plot is bad, the story is bad, the movie is bad" certainly isn't **good** argument. But ultimately what I'm saying is that the measure of these things varies from person to person in terms of how good/bad it is and how much it impacts the overall project, that's the part that **isn't** objective.
>If someone follows what you say, they'll have to see virtually everything to see if it's good or not. Most people don't have that time. Most people don't have that time. I like to spend 2 hours watching a good movie, not trash like Quantumania.  It's on them whether they see it or not. We're all adults, no one is holding a gun to people's heads and forcing them to go see a movie.  >Trailers are made for a purpose. I saw the trailers for Shazam 2, which made it look so generic that any of the little interest I had in the character was gone. Reviews confirmed what I had sensed. So I decided I wasn't gonna watch it. Similarly, Quantumania literally looked like spy kids in the movie.  Trailers aren't made by the same people who made the movie. The movie can be good and the trailers can suck. But that's up to you whether you want to watch something based on the trailer. I'm not gonna change anyone's mind on that.  >Furthermore audience reviews are a thing. Read a couple of them, you will get the idea what people are thinking about it and then make up your mind based on your taste.  Reviews also have agendas. Critics vs general audiences vs fans have different tastes and different expectations. Rarely do movies please everyone.  And to address what you said before about "don't watch movies unless you know it's good". You won't KNOW it's good until you find out lol. And it's not like people watch everything Disney. I only watch Marvel and Star Wars from Disney. And DC from WB. I don't even watch the spider-man related contents from Sony. If Marvel or DC or Star Wars can branch out on their own, I'll gladly stop consuming Disney content.
Drax looks like he just dropped his mixtape
Without the context for the fisheye perspective IN YOUR FACE style of these character posters, it was really confusing to look at the first poster. I was wondering what the hell is going on with his hand. It almost looked like he suddenly had Kamala's powers. haha  Giant Purple Hand Starlord
The poses are interesting. Nebula, Gamora, and Mantis are all sitting/laying on the ground. Everyone else is on their feet.
Looking at the trailer and the posters you can immediately see how this Gamorra is nothing like her deceased counterpart. She radiates arrogant self-absorbed a-hole and it’s incredible.
I’ve always loved these kinda retro looking posters. Nice work
Nebula though🥵
So especially for some of the younger folks here, these are clearly styled after a lot of 90s media. Lots of movie posters had that off-zoom approach, like [Dude Where's My Car](https://imgur.com/1W61s04), or even album artwork like Limp Bizkit's [Significant Other](https://imgur.com/iSaodEe). [Trainspotting's](https://imgur.com/a/VtupPaG) poster is another good example—Begbie's hand on the far left is bigger than his head! Groot isn't just looking at the camera but he seems almost aware of it, another typical visual style. There were all very common aesthetics of the late 90s and early 2000s The slouchy sexy female poses are also common from this time period, like Pulp Fiction's iconic poster.  Some of the other character shots we've seen have characters in long sleeve shirts with short sleeve shirts on top, a very typical 90s look as well. The soundtrack has more 90s tunes than the other two films (which had 0 I think?), so either Gunn has decided to do something different, or the "time skip" has some kind of significance. Chris Pratt (and thus Quill) is a last minute Gen Xer so this time period fits with him going into adulthood. We know the 60s/70s soundtrack from the first two films are because of Quill's mother, and he dealt with both parents over both films. Now he's over that, and perhaps has to be the "parent" of his crew, so the soundtrack finally grows as well?
Why nebula kinda
I wonder how much screentime Cosmo and Kraglin are going to get? I hope they’re with the team full time and it won’t be like they get left behind on Knowhere “just in case someone attacks while the rest of the team is away.”
Drax is standing so incredibly still…
Mantis is my favorite
Remember that colour of the logo tells you who is gonna die? Well look at the logos on these and let me know who
It might just be the perspective but these look terrible.
I want the Nebula one framed on my wall!
Why’s there a blank one?
Nebula has an... *Interesting pose*
This goes HARD.
Omg. Cosmo! I have a 1 year old Golden Retriever puppy & imagined if I had that but my puppy’s face/her name like the poster/wall paper.  Any ppl that are good at photoshop here? 🫡
Those dark eyes sealing the package real good. You gotta give it to thanos, he had taste
Looks like star lord has huge Popeye arms
The preview on my phone showed made the Star-Lord one fuzzy, and for a second I thought Tom Cruise was gonna be in it.
Peter quill AKA HELLBOY, sorry HELL LORD, sorry STAR LORD.
Where is Adam Warlock?!
Peter - "I'm tired of these jokes about my giant hand. The first such incident occured in 1956 when -"
I need this Cosmo poster. 😭
The perspectives are funky but work on almost all of them but Star-lords poster is just weird
These remind me of the first posters from SOLO. I think the design turned out to be ripped off from another artist. The retro style is cool though.
Gamora hitting that jojo pose energy
That doesn't even look like Chris Pratt unless you look closely
No Warlock?
Kinda looks like the background they used for Eternity in Love and Thunder
Team Mantis
Why Gamora
i love rocket
Quill looks like Spanish Tony Stark in this.
No Adam Warlock?
What the dog doing tho?
What’s wild is when I watch any movie with Drax, all I think about is how much Dave Bautista has evolved as a performer.
I want one
This Barbie likes music.  This Barbie likes guns.   This Barbie can turn invisible.  This Barbie is a badass.   This Barbie can read minds.  This Barbie is Groot.   This Barbie is the bestest boy.  This Barbie is an archer.   This Barbie is figuring things out.
Lol why do these look like bad fan edits?
Why all the women are making a "sexy" pose? Lol  Like, with Gamora I get it, but Mantis should make a funny pose like Drax and Nebula a "cool" pose like Quill.
These are ugly
Obviously this movie is going to do well, so I think they are really spending too much on marketing.  Thats a lot of different stuff!
I just want the original Groot back.
I bet nebula dies in this one.  Each movie has had someone die and it's related to the color of the title.
Isn’t this timeline’s Gamora dead? So is it younger Thanos’s Gamora in this film.
All the girls poses feels so weird like damn
I think superhero/marvel/comic book movie fatigue has finally hit me because I’m just not feeling this.
Yeah I hate these
I like the look on this posters. They are giving me the space vibes.
I do not like how the galaxy pattern is overlaid on all of the characters. The planet on Nebula’s leg really sticks out…
Im just happy to see a poster from marvel thats not just an ugly collage
I hate this new buff Groot. I hope he fucking dies.
Why did they brown face Crisp ratt? ... Can we just get rid of him and replace him with Pedro Pascal instead
Not really digging the uniforms - I mean I get it - still
I imagine James Gunn had a hand in making sure marvel didn’t do their usual sucky movie posters  I will never forgive them for their slurgyish Shang chi posters
Star-Lord look like he rocking the power glove LOL
BIG HANDS RUN
Reminds me of that King of Queens episode with the photo of Carrie’s huge hand.
Do they all look like they have a “home planet” somewhere on their body except for Rocket? Peter and Cosmo look to have earth on them, Groot has a very green planet, Drax a very red one, but I can’t find a planet on Rocket’s body.
Didn’t the green one die?
Don’t know if anyone noticed, but Rocket and Gamora’s posters are taller than the others. Probably means something since Rocket is supposed to be the main plot point of the movie and alternate Gamora is, well, there….
I just want Quill to wear his helmet at least once in this movie, we haven't seen him wear it at all in these trailers, it'd be a shame if he ditched it completely
Seeing Chris Pratt in this shot… he could totally play Booster Gold in the DCU.
So I take it Kraglin is a regular cast member… I liked him more in a limited role Yondu’s 2nd Command.
Love the drax one, so 2000s
Yea, not a fan lol
Why does starlord look more indian?
What’s with that pose on Nebula - girl would be the first one ready to blow someone’s head off.
Same with Groot
Peter looks like he's listening to it
Looking like Dwight and Michael when they drop the Scranton rap
I'd listen to it
I thought Quill had a Hellboy thing going on.
Even knowing the perspective his still feels really off. Dig the style though
Since Gamora died Quill had to substitute and apparently he’s left-handed.
Star-Lord right after he grabbed one of Mario's mushrooms.
This is the 90s baby.
It's either they're all women, they're all going to die, or they're just lying on the cold hard ground **OH OH**
The males all have a body part close to the camera, like it's supposed to be 3d
How else could you see that they are wearing high-heeled platform boots? Have to make it obvious they are women, space men don’t wear high heeled platform boots
Probably for different camera angles and poses for each character.  Quill is standing straight on  Rocket is standing angle-top-down  Drax is squatting angle-bottom-up  Nebula is sitting angle-bottom-up  Mantis is cross legged straight on  Groot is leaning forward top-down but his height makes it look like it's bottom-up  Cosmo is being a dog  Kraglin is hunched over straight on  Gamora is pointed feet straight on
And Mantis is opening the elevator doors.   Not sure how that one passed QC.
At the same time the photos are edited to make all the women look as unattractive as they possibly could.
Did she come in during the unsnapping?  Can’t remember how alt Gamora came about.
deceased? i dont see anything bad about the first one
It's Mantis for me...🥵
You are correct. The other child comment is not.
This was so insightful, thx. I think I heard that Peter found a new music device on Earth so he  can listen to other eras of music now? But idk.
Because Karen Gillan
Which one is he in?
no clue
I really dislike Quill's massive hand. It doesn't read as forced perspective to me. It reads more like "EMBIGGEN"; He just has a massive club hand now.
Yeah not sure what they were going for but it doesn't work for me
I don't disagree.  I'm not a fan of the matching costume approach, personally.  Maybe it's a marketing thing, but the diversity of appearance and personality on this team was always one of its appeals to me.
me too💀
Damnit.... I went back and scrolled through them XD
Me when I see Nebula
It’s only the guardians
yes
not until later
before i saw it was official i thought it looked weird so i agree
Gamora's pose is rather... suggestive.
i like celestial body groot
its different for each poster
yes
So youre gonna steal them and repost them tomorrow,  right? Lol sad karma farmer.
too bad💅
You’re gonna get downvoted because ‘Crisp Ratt’ is really dumb but I agree that looks nothing like Chris Pratt, it’s bizarre
Whatshisname reminds me of Die Antward on an album or something.
im not ashamed to admit that was my first  thought when i saw the poster before i realized its a weird perspective.
so he grabbed his own mushroom?😳
The movie is obviously going to end Blake’s Seven-style with everyone being killed off. I have a feeling that Gunn doesn’t want anyone else to play with his toys after he’s gone haha
🐐
#TROUBLE  #TROUBLE  #TROUBLE
Trouble, Trouble, Trouble
Gamora has always been wearing heeled boots since Zoe is tiny and the guys (and trees) in this are pretty tall. Not sure about the others tho
TOS Trek guys wore heeled boots.  Obviously that was a long time ago.
Im pretty sure Grandmaster would wear high heeled platform boots.
It looks like they're all wearing boots. You can't even see them properly in most, ironically the person that shows their feet the most is Drax lmao.
What about Bowie?
Yet they’re still extremely attractive, shit’s crazy
What benefit could that possibly have for them?
2014 Gamora came forward in time with 2014 Thanos in Endgame.
She's from the past, just before the events of Guardians 1, she jumped forward in time with Thanos when he captured Nebula (and her Pym tech) in Endgame
Alternate time line Gamora.
She came back in End Game when younger Thanos came to the future to stop the Avengers.
You realize I am talking Gamorra, not Nebula.
both. both is fine.
ok then?
Let other people have their opinions.
he was gifted a Zune at the end of GotG 2
Yeah, he got a Zune
this comments: 🗿
They must not have released his poster for some reason, couldn’t see him
no idea. also i guess they must be introducing a new planet character. they could have shown him better though
(Mark Ruffolo infinity war spoiler moment)
Everlong video vibes....
Dude went full hellboy
Yeah, she was in a sexy pose. ooooooooooo
same
The Trailers that I've seen have had the one that is similar to Nebula.   In the first Guardians, it has a greenish brown border.  Groot.  In the second Guardians it had red and blue. Yondu.   Third one had Nebula's colors.
No regrets 😉
me too
😏
Or everyone except Rocket dies
Lmfaooo  Funniest video on the internet.
Karen Gillan is 180 cm so she shouldn't have any heels
I’m sorry this adds nothing except my automatic thought with TOS was “terms of service” and had a laugh.
That’s right - thank you.
Y’all take shit much too seriously
Maybe another child of Ego?
💯💯💯
the first few guardians 3 trailers had a orangish-yellow and a gray inside, meaning rocket. the other one has drax's or peter's, which ones had a blue-ish colors?
r/beatlejuicing
Everyone but Rocket and Mantis
It used to be.  It still is but it used to be too.
just checked and Zoe isn't even that small (169cm), so discard my whole comment
Boldly go where fine print has gone before.
No problem.  To paraphrase Miles O'Brien, temporal mechanics are a motherfucker.
Ok
makes sense.
https://youtu.be/IDdOSLcah_4?t=118  This one?
If cosmo dies I die
Well, Chris Pratt is 188 and Bautista is 193, so maybe they used them for Zoe only
at lot of the more current trailers too, and yes.

I hate every movie that harms a dog.  I don't even give the movie a fair chance after they portray the death of a dog.  I don't know why, it just ruins my day seeing that in a movie.
My only exception to this rule is John Wick. The wife dying is too cliche, but from the point that he buried his dog, I was like "Yup, these fuckers deserve everything that happens from here on out."  You can kill a man, but don't fucking touch his dog.
Same, but I’ve made the exception for John Wick
Yeah but John Wick did to the people who killed his dog what we all want to see happen to people who kill dogs
Exactly
> what we all want to see happen to people who kill dogs  This is the motherfucking way
What a great time to be a beautiful woman who loves comics. Cosplay makes the world a better place.
I chose a longer wig than what she wore in the avengers movie because I didn’t want to risk a lord farquaad situation LOL. Unfortunately I can’t pull off short hair like Scarlett Johansson can
You look like you have red on your ledger
A+
Great!
Why can’t all cosplay on this sub look like this
Great costume   At big Comic Conventions, do they allow cosplayers to bring their fake guns in?  I’ve always been curious as to what the rules are.
You look amazing
Iron Man 2 vibes
Great job!
Sweet mother of pearl, I think my soul just cried a little  You should be stored in a nunnery where no one can get their grubby mitts on you  We are simply not worthy
[removed]
Yes
If Jessica alba was a redhead
*Nobody* wants a Lord Farquaad situation. ;)      Great work here, though; keep it up!
Ledger? Are you talking about the skirting board? 🔎 I can’t find it 😣
Because not everything can shine like the sun. We just accept it.
I’ve never used a fake gun at a convention but the convention I’ve been too have [these rules](https://imgur.com/a/vsONrl8) for cosplay props. So technically I wouldn’t be permitted to bring these in until I add an orange tip to them.
I can't speak for everywhere but at conventions in America, no they don't allow fake guns. They only allow real guns.
Aw thank you! :)
Thank you! :D
LMAO definitely the most creative response I’ve had yet 🤣
Lmao I don’t even use onlyfans nor any other nsfw platform. Flame off
Any guy who uses the phrase “go back to the streets” is a “low value man”

Hahah thank you!
😬😬
Lmao
Thank you for explaining that.
😬🤷‍♂️
Probably because you’re on the stupefying end of the attractive spectrum  When a woman looks so good as to put a Disney princess to shame, it’s hard to string words in a complimentary sentence  I’m just good at it, it’s my cross to bear

Fanhouse is a safe for work platform where i post my cosplay sets? [Feel free to read the guidelines](https://fanhouse.app/docs/content-guidelines#adult). I’m sorry you equate “exclusive content” to porn  PS. Note I didn’t even mention my social media/links anywhere in the comments. This dude was the first to bring up where I post my cosplay sets ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)
Any woman wearing a Black Widow costume is seductive. That’s the entire point of the Black Widow costume. Besides that, she is reasonably covered up showing no more boob than you would see from a dress.   Not only that you are accusing this women of being a whore and saying she belongs on the streets because of your attraction to her and now that she has proved she’s not you should apologize   Grow up.
I thought it was funny
You know the addition needs to be addressed when one starts thinking anything branded as “exclusive content” must be porn.
He then proceeds to delete his comments when he’s proven wrong.
At least someone did! Haha ❤️
It says "removed", not "deleted". He got reported & the mods hit it.
Alright fair
Rocky Raccoon by the Beatles. I get that it would have been too obvious a pick though.
December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night) by the Four Seasons has always had a guardians vibe to me.
 I'm surprised they never used "Holding out for a Hero", maybe it's because it's been used so often.
I can tell you I’m horrified for how Do you realize??  might be deployed and I’ll be bringing my tissues in case…conversely I’m excited to see No Sleep Till Brooklyn maybe be an absolute *banger* of a moment
An action scene set to All Along The Watchtower would go so hard! I'm interested to see how Creep will be used in the movie since thats on the soundtrack
Seven Bridges Road by the eagles.
I really wish they played the guitar riff section of The Chain by Fleetwood Mac instead of what we got, personally.
Nothing too well known.  So many fan suggestions were very high profile mainstream hits.  The awesome mix songs work best when they are lesser known and under appreciated.
T. Rex - Bang a Gong
"working my way back to you" by the spinners.   Just seems like such a guardians song
Life On Mars by David Bowie Freebird by Lynard Skynard BallRoom Blitz by Sweet  Killer Queen or Dont Stop Me Now by Queen Sympathy For The Devil by The Rolling Stones Come Together by the Beatles  But most of all im Suprised no Elton John was used, could totally see Goodbye Yellowbrick Road, Bitch Is Back, Pinball Wizard, Saturday Nights All Right For Fighting, Rocketman, I'm Still Standing, etc being great songs for Guardians movies.
Goodnight Tonight by Wings is one I feel like could have worked, but I really like Gunn’s song choices.
The original Hooked on a feeling is so much better than the Blue Swede version, so I'd say that one.
“Space Child” by UFO. I always saw it over an emotional scene or into the end credits.
Sweet Talkin’ Woman by ELO
Black Water - Doobie Brothers
Maggot brain or Agony of defeet - parliament funkadelic
Hotel California by the eagles
It was always a pipe dream, but I've been hoping against hope that we'd get [Run With Us by Lisa Lougheed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouPYQlhempw) in one of these movies since early 2014.
Anything by Bill Withers.
Drive by the cars
Blueface - Thotiana
"Those Shoes" by The Eagles
I think Love Shack could've fit the Cherry Bomb scene in Vol1 just as well if not better, since it's one of my favourite songs.  I also wish we got a Mantis scene set to a Madonna song since her comics title is "The Celestial Madonna"
The Whole of the Moon
"Walk of Life" by Dire Straits.  I specifically wanted to see it over the opening action scene, as with "Mr. Blue Sky" from GotG 2.  The last couple lines are almost too perfect for this series:  "And after all the violence and doubletalk There's just a song in all the trouble & the strife"  Practically the series thesis statement right there.
A lot of these suggestions on this thread are in the game, which is very good and all should play.
carry on wayward son
I kind of felt like Aerosmith's "Sweet Emotion" would be a good fit. Or anything from them really, even a soundtrack exclusive track.  But I'm not complaining.
"Camellia" by Daryl Hall and John Oates
“Hey jealousy” by the Gin Blossoms, used to show the relationship Peter misses with his Gamora/wants with new Gamora. “All I really wants to be with you, feeling like I matter too, if I hadn’t blown the whole things years ago I might not be alone” and “the past is gone but something might be found to take its place” fit then really well imo
April Wine - I’m on fire for you baby.
Take Me To The Kaptin - Prism  It’s Not Unusual - Tom Jones  Come On Eileen - Dexys Midnight Runners  Rich Girl - Hall and Oates
I’d say less obvious, more expensive.
This would off been amazing.
Iirc it's in the game!
TBF, the MCU has already used it in the second episode of Loki
I heard it from leaks of the SDCC trailer, beautiful song and have been hoping its actually used in the movie since.     It's gonna break us
Someone suggested creep being used on top of Rocket's backstory. Which is just too perfect
This. I have an awesome mix playlist on my Spotify that started with the first movie and I’ve been adding to it over the years. Ground rules are I tend to avoid big mainstream bands/songs while one hit wonders and other lesser known/under appreciated songs are prioritized.
100% this
That's a very good point; I hadn't thought of that.
It is! I'm playing the game right now and it's so fun! I'd honestly say they portray certain characters better than the movies - Groot and Drax especially.
Honestly everyone but Rocket, the game does better imo. Idk man, Gamora and Quill are way cooler in the comics, and the latter isn't some bumbling fool...he's competent.
I absolutely love the GOTG game. Enjoy it!
I think I agree honestly, I've got a few chapters left but Gamora has really grown on me in the last few, and Quill is a lot more competent. Rocket is amazing as well but he's also amazing in the movies, he's the only one who's basically the same, except we get more back story in the game, which we'll be getting in Vol 3.  The tone of the game reminds me a lot of the first movie, before they Flanderized Drax and Groot.
This lowkey feels like something Vought International would do.
 I hate the fact that they have made a whole production about this.   Just a simple interview without all the extra (stock) footage would have been enough.
Legit impressed by his recovery.
Happy about how good he looks now
Why does Reddit always get so weird and negative. The guy most likely agreed to how this story was put out. Damn clip had me in tears. Shits wild.
Weird vibes coming from this comment section. Like the worst of humanity is trying to be edgy.
Glad to see he's doing well. I have no doubt he'll be traumatized by this for a good while, though.
Damn people really love to be offended by everything and find something to complain about. Even if this was a cash grab… If you can’t make a cash grab from almost dying to a damn snowplow then what the fuck can you make a cash grab over? If I was making a cash grab I’d be all like.. “OOOOHHH CASHH GIMME” . You motherfuckers act so high and mighty like you wouldn’t do the same. Miss me with this edgy shit.
Damn, that part about the note he wrote made me tear up.
I'm interested in this interview because I am a sucker for "The Time I Almost Died" interviews.
This is giving  *A Marvel Studios Special Presentation*
He’s not a martyr
He got a better deal than Schumacher. Glad he's OK.
FYI folks Renner has a decorated and highly successful career outside Marvel. He agreed to this. Relax.
feels like a mayor of kingstown episode
Up next on Hell's Kitchen
At first i cared, but now i am like.. wtf who gives a shit.  got in an accident, almost died, survived. move on.  wtf is there to open up to?
Ain’t nothing gonna take down that beautiful hair
So dramatic lol
Vought woulda had a better title like “Crushing Blow: The Fall of an Avenger”
I legit noticed this about some of the Disney stuff, but most notably I thought the majority of the Black Adam movie felt like something straight out of the boys. Some of the scenes were so reminiscent of the “dawn of the seven” film that I almost half expected to see Ashley on set lol
I saw that tweet too buddy
Maybe a little. I don't think he'd have agreed to it if he didn't want to tell his story. There's obviously an interest. If nothing else, it's probably pretty helpful to his career to show that he's on the mend and everything.
It’s like watching Discovery stretch what would have been a 5-minute YouTube video that just gets to the point
Seems a bit heavy handed production value, he's just a man who got hurt and is lucky to be alive and didn't mess up his face that he needs to work as an actor, that's the real miracle , but there's bigger things happening in the world than a single man, however famous or heroic is
That's how ABC News does 'news' now unfortunately. It's about sensationalizing everything rather than presenting the facts. It's why I don't watch much TV anymore.
He's had issues in the past. But what he did was damn brave, and the fact that he gets another chance is incredible. I hope he comes back healthier than ever.
Because it feels very corporate
They have nothing else to complain about like they always do so this will do for now
It’s not edgy to say that the way this was produced was overly-corporate and feels like a reality TV episode about what was a pretty serious accident to an actual person.
This ain’t even the worst 😢
I don’t get how it could ever even be considered a “cash grab” 🤣 it’s a fucking interview on ABC news. This is a guy who was getting paid Marvel money for gods sakes. I don’t think he’s hurting for money, and I seriously doubt ABC is paying through the nose for him.   This is more about PR. And that’s fine. People ARE interested in the story. And he’s ready to tell it. Why bitch about it 🤷🏻‍♂️😂
Lol I know the way they’re presenting this story is silly
Did anyone say he was?
Believe it or not, nearly dying is quite traumatic
You literally just explained what he's opening up to
It’s because he’s a celebrity
Probably to deflect from Majors?
*pulls hair*
Hmm almost like The Boys is making fun of things that already exist
Literally everyone was saying this bro
I agree, people might think it’s a crash grab, but the dude was run over by a snowplow. He deserves to make some money from such a horrendous experience.
That too right. He's a professional actor, who also works in action movies, this is also to make sure people see he's back to working form and able to make a living again.   It just happens to be that reporters have a job to do too which is to sensationalize the fuck out of it but I think he sincerely wants his story out there and to show he's okay.
So? He’s agreed, it’s a really interesting story. I don’t think we should mind the production, especially because the victim is fully aware and not being preyed upon. Ya’ll need to chill
I get that complainers exist, it’s the number of people who will agree with them that worries me
Can attest.
I'm interested in the story of anyone who survives events like this. A couple days ago, I listened to an interview of a random snowboarder who got buried in several feet of snow under a tree, was stuck there for a long time until somebody found him and dug him out with a shovel. It was crazy. He was buried under so much snow that he couldn't even hear the guys voice as he was digging him out.  So, the fact that Jeremy Renner is a celebrity certainly gives this story more traction, but it's not a story solely because he's a celebrity. Anytime someone goes through something like this, it can be newsworthy.
lol
so black adam is creating something like from series about making fun of things that are already exist? damn where does it ends
I’m sure they are well aware.
Yes, we are allowed to reference movies outside the MCU.
Run over by a snowplow ***to save his nephew***  I feel like it's not mentioned enough that he was helping people with the snowplow, and was crushed when it started sliding towards his nephew and he pushed him away, a real-life example of the [Heroic Sacrifice trope](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice)  Dude 100% deserves anything that can be done to help him recoup from that.
I don’t get why anyone would even care if it’s a cash grab lmao  Obviously at least some people will be interested, but if you’re not, then just don’t watch it
There’s nothing wrong with being hesitant about it. And I’m someone that happens to feel like the dramatization of the snow plow is a bit in poor taste. Believe it or not a lot of this feeling that people are expressing comes from a place of concern for Jeremy. I’ll hear the guy out just like you, but there’s nothing wrong with people asking for a little tact.
Whoa whoa whoa, Don’t shoot the messenger…no need to get so triggered.
One of the two of us is having a stroke
>> Dodd revealed that Disney still made him audition “for my role of the voice I created.” He was stunned when got the news that he got the role (again), but “nothing comes easy for the X-Men.”    I’m stunned as well, Bub
Fascinating
Crazy right?! I was hoping to get the other re-audition scenes and hopefully we'll be able to follow up with them or they'll reveal it in the bonus features.
> Disney still made him audition “for my role of the voice I created.”  Not that surprising.  It's been 25 years.  People's *actual* voices can change substantially, there was the potential that his Wolverine voice just didn't exist anymore.
Oh my stars and garters
Assassins…X-men…oh man!
>> He also mentioned that the studio they used is the same one they recorded the original series. When asked how it felt to return to the same recording space, Dodd said, “It was magical.”    This was pretty heartwarming to learn though. Looks like the producers knew what was needed to get the VAs back in the those moments.
Disney is crazy corporate. It might've just been a technicality so they couldn't be sued for impartiality. Or something. Maybe.
They all exist in a way in a corner of the marvel universe. It's just that different earths tend to follow different designation that they believe.
Sony is not oversee the whole MCU though, their comment means nothing, just like how morbius is irrelevant to the MCU.
What interests me is that everyone thinks the 199999 comment from the trailer was referencing the MCU but really it could’ve been any Strange in any world. Although with context that line is a bit too emphasised to be a throwaway like that
It's like that episode of Futurama where the professor creates the alternate universe in a box and they fight over who gets to be called Universe 1
He's a very good actor
Here's a stretch, good acting? Amazing charisma? You think folks only get hired on their resume?
I admittedly haven't seen it but consensus is 'Last black man in San Francisco' (2019) was utterly fantastic and he was specifically highly praised for it.   So that.
The thing is, I’m sure they’re constantly scouting talent. You’d rather lock in someone early in their career so you can get them at a lower price than have to hire a big name actor and end up paying exorbitant prices (like what, rdj getting 30 mil for like 6 minutes in homecoming or whatever that was). It’s also a selling point for marvel to say ‘look at all these careers we skyrocketed - you could be next.’
The last black man in San Francisco
Didn't the one responsible for all the casting say that she wanted him in the MCU after watching Last Black Man in San Francisco? That's in 2019, the same year you mentioned. So it's probably that. You don't need to be in a lot of movies to get cast I guess, you just need a really solid performance that can move the casting director.
The same thing happened with iman vellani Ms marvel was her first acting role and marvel took a chance with her
Might as well ask what Marvel saw in Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston, who were both pretty much unknowns in Hollywood before Thor, probably more so than Majors was when he was cast. Sarah Finn and her team are just very good at what they do.
Yale school of acting is one of the most prestigious in the world, and has been a literal star actor factory for decades.  Lupita Nyongo, Angela Basset Meryl Streep , Courtney B Vance, Sigourney Waever Yahya Mateen, Frances Mc Dormand just to name a few.  Coming out of there with honors pretty much guarantee you a opening in some of Hollywood most exclusive rooms.  The same way tech companies actually go recruit future employees in top schools the same way top agents go recruit in top acting schools.
He was absolutely the best part of Lovecraft Country.
Doesn’t matter now that man is toast 😂😭
Weird question… they obviously liked his acting abilities. It’s not like Chris Evans was some A-tier listed movie star. Neither was Hemsworth I don’t think. RDJ, I think before Iron Man was an addict I think.
His acting skills
Marvel likes to take chances with new actors (Iman Vellani), as well as bringing in already successful actors like Hailee Steinfeld. They like to switch it up a bit, and i appreciate their effort on casting
They saw *The Last Black Man in San Francisco* and enjoyed it.
Marvel loves a fresh cast. Having a big celebrity cameo is fantastic, but discovering good fresh talent is even better. Jonathan Majors really is an incredibly good actor. I imagine he auditioned for a role very early on an Marvel has had him in mind for a long time.  I just read that back. Fuck I’m full of shit.
I am pretty sure that by now, Sarah Finn has drawers full of cards from agents who send their unknown but talented actors to her because she can spot the talent and nails the casting 99% of time. Ask Hemsworth, Hiddleston or Iman Vellani.  And you don´t need to go with total unknowns but against type is fine and taking risks as well. Check Paul Rudd or even Chris Evans (yes, there was a backlash when he got cast as Cap).
That's the reason for sure
yeah but even good actors have to audition...and go up against other actors, they just offered it to him  never said folks only get hired for their resume, it's just weird he got offered it so early in his career instead of auditioning
It garnered a *hell* of a lot of awards and festival attention, as did Majors.   And Majors had 4 movies total come out that year. Though none of them were particularly big an none as success of Last Black Man, all of them were well reviewed.   And they would have been shooting Lovecraft Country for HBO at the time. His casting was announced in 2018, Jordan Peele and JJ Abrams involved. Whole thing was very highly promoted and covered.   That's the exact kinda of things that goes down when an actor pops over into bankability. It's around when I first heard about him. And the Lovecraft Country news is very much a breakout, suddenly bankable career moment.
Say what you will about the content lately (which I still enjoy) but Marvel has always been pretty damn good with casting. Who was Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, Chadwick Boseman and the list goes on before they were cast? None of them were big name actors yet but they knew they had something special to offer.
Hiddleston had already been in a couple of hit prestige pictures, including War Horse at the time. And Hemsworth had a prominent roll in fucking Star Trek. Pretty much all of the Hemsworths had been enough of a thing on Australian TV for long enough that there was already hot boy buzz about Chris and Liam on interwebs.  They weren't virtual unknowns. Both these actors were earlier in their career, but on the radar and garnering attention.  This is kinda like the line that Robert Downey Jr was unhirable with his career destroyed when cast in Iron Man. In reality he was regularly working and had been in a number of very successful and prominent films recently, including Zodiac. And had even been hired by Disney for a kids movie (not a good one).  Marvel hasn't actually plucked all that many actors out of obscurity.
Now that's a lie.
I'm not saying u have 2 be an A-list star   I just found it weird how they offered him the role of kang when he had very little in his resume, at least they guys u named had a lot of roles AND they looked the part.   and I'm not questioning as if it's a bad thing, he was a good pick I'm just wondering what they saw in him and the very little he did to play such a big character in this company, that's all.
 Yeah, and on top of that, most actors do audition for years and work on smaller projects before they have their big break.
>they just offered it to him  Where are you getting that from? He auditioned like anyone else
I'm depends on the role and casting agent. Some roles are written with an actor in mind.
RIP Lovecraft Country. I loved that show (and book)
Prominent role in Star Trek?!? He had less than 10 mins of screen time
No, you’re wrong. This was what was being reported at the time: https://deadline.com/2009/05/toldja-marvel-studios-about-to-announce-chris-hemsworth-as-thor-9308/amp/  “He’s Tom Hiddleston, unknown to American audiences but an award-winning British actor and Royal Academy Of Dramatic Arts (RADA) graduate.”  “Chris Hemsworth also a virtual unknown to American audiences, yet he was approved to play the lead role in Thor by Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige and the film’s director Kenneth Branagh”
I'm just saying what the article said  it didn't mention an audition
They clearly had already seen of his prior work and went "Thats the guy we want".
Can you imagine nebula as iron man? She is already half robot(is that we call her?, idk), that’d be pretty cool! Perhaps a what if episode
It looks like Karen Gillan is the Marvel fan getting her picture with Iron Man
Tony Stank?
Sick cosplay dude. You met Karen? Tell me she’s super cool. Been a huge fan of hers since Dr. Who.
a fan takes a picture with iron man
I love how in every pic of her with a fan she looks like the fan being impressed to be there.
Looks like Antonio Starch got Karen pregnant
She looks like Amy Pond.
...okay for real tho is she pregnant or what
Me remembering first 10 minutes of endgame.
Is she preggers?
Ngl I thought you were RDJ for a hot sec lol
Isn't that Salt Bae?
Cosplay looks spot on for Karen, but why is Robert is his suit for photos.
That’s not a very flattering jacket
Hispanic Scott Baio.
Is Karen fat now?
He really does look like Tony Stank
She’s dressed like Amy!
I think they prefer the term Cyborg
Except why? There's already that girl from Black Panther who was shoehorned into being Ironman and was super underwhelming.   Call me crazy but there's at least 5 other characters who'd make it fun but at the end of the day why does there **have** to be another Ironman ? She's already Nebula
Is this comment going to be on everyone of these pictures? It has been the past few days.
You will not see him appear
She's from my home town (Inverness). My friend has met her a few times and said she was nice.
I met Karen she is really cool and you can talk with her about everything. Normally Iam really shy around celebs but with her around it felt less akward :)
I follow her on some social medias. If you didn't know she was famous, you'd think she was just some awesome person down the street (in Scotland). She seems very down to Earth, very fun and an honestly nice person.   I wasn't a big fan until I started seeing on social media and other places when she wasn't acting.
He'd be one lucky bastard if he got Karen pregnant 🤘🏻💘🔥
Yeah  ikr 🥰
Yes.
what does it matter?
I honestly thought this was just a picture of the two until I read the flair
She clearly dresses for comfort when she’s not on-set. Can’t really hold that against her. Those skin-tight suits can NOT be comfortable.
I’m sure she’d just be all torn up if she read your comment.
I'm gonna guess that she was cold and someone lent her the jacket. It is quite oversized on her so I doubt it's actually her jacket.  Edit: LOL. Sure, downvote but the sleeves go up to her fingers. That's not her jacket.
Don’t be a cunt?
Pretty sure it's just the jacket and the way it's sitting. I had a very similar (if not the exact same from looking at it?) Levi's denim jacket in 6XL and when I tell you, it swallows your body up and makes you look quite wide.                        Of course, who cares if Karen were to gain weight anyhow, but I don't think that's the case here (someone posted a similar photo of their Nebula cosplay with her at this con and she's wearing an oversized jumper but looks a lot slimmer than this picture conveys)
I feel like the people downvoting you are some of the same people who preach how okay it is to be fat.  If so, why can’t someone ask if she’s fat now?
Thought maybe i forgot how she looked from the past couple posts. Maybe it’s the fit of the clothes? But nah you’re not alone regardless of the down votes
There was a large comic festival in Chicago last weekend.
Oh so its Iron Cyborg, the cyborg with an exoskeleton
Who hurt you?
I mean her introduction into the MCU was lackluster and I'm not sure I'm feeling the actress but it's not like she's a new character they created for the movies, she has a comic book counterpart
Oh, is it? Just commented the first thought that went through my head about the picture.
That’s good to hear. Always afraid of the “never meet your hero’s” thing. She seems so genuine and silly on Instagram so I hoped she was IRL. lol
Ya she reminds me of a friend of ours. Very down to earth, silly and just nice. I enjoy supporting those types of celebs much more.  I liked her from Dr. Who and then followed her on socials too where I started to become a bigger fan. Really hope I can attend a con one day!
Cause she looks preggo and it’s neat to know when people are pregnant. What a stupid question to ask.
It doesn't matter, except that I now know that is actually her. I thought it was also someone very convincingly cosplaying Karen Gillian. I was really impressed with how much she looked like her.
It doesn't, and people are fucking gross and personal about judging a woman's body online as usual.
 This is nothing against her but more in general...  Most of the time I see these Comic Con pics, it kinda irks me that most celebs put so little effort in their outfits and make-up...  ... like you have many fans paying up to hundreds of dollars for a quick pic, it makes it all look kinda cheap...
Its a genuine question that everyone wants the answer too.
Maybe she gained weight for a role in a new movie? Wtf are people so damn sensitive?
But no one did that and they were just curious. You seem like the person who gets irrationally upset about hypothetical situations
Literally nobody is judging her for anything.   It’s just super noticeable when someone suddenly starts exclusively wearing baggy AF clothes.   She probably doesn’t want to announce anything since the pregnancy is probably in the second trimester and you never know what can happen.   Just about everyone seems to be happy for her.
When a female looks much bigger than you are used to seeing them then it's a normal question to wonder if they are pregnant.
ah yes no one ever judges men.  especially when Fat Thor was a neverending punchline for three hours.
When I met Stan Lee, I think he may have been asleep.
Well don’t pay to meet people. What a dumb concept. Also why pay to meet the person if you just want fakeness?
Some of the higher-tiered ones wear a trucker hat and big sunglasses during the whole con. But to each their own.
Touch grass.
Literally zero people other than you give a Fuck
people don't like the word 'fat'. does she look a little more comfortable with herself? absolutely
its not AI, its a cosplayer posing with Karen Gillian at the festival, AI isnt involved in the slightest its just a good costume
I always just assume they have a basketball sized tumor growing off their spine and will tell me when they're comfortable sharing.
More like Excelsi-*snore* amirite??
  I don't pay?   I don't get your fakeness comment
 But isn't that weird?   Like I really don't get why my original comment gets downvoted so much 😅
All of the comments in this thread are asking if she is pregnant. So people obviously do care
Probably just as well. I totally lost my cool when I saw him. Something along the lines of: “Ermagerd Mr. Lieber! It’s an honor to meet you! You shaped my childhood!”
Maybe your wording suggested some sort of tone that you possibly didn’t intend?
>Literally zero people who are socially well-adjusted give a Fuck  FIFY
There’s literally only 2 comments, but you straight up just said she was fat
nope! someone that probably made the suit themselves and did the makeup, im into making costumes myself and its awesome what people can create
Still sweet tho. I’m jealous. Always lived in BFE and dirt poor so cool stuff like that I just gotta read about lol
  Yeah, probably  I was especially talking about the cases you named (sunglasses, hats, and so on)  ... which I consider not really 'fair' to the people paying hundreds of dollars to get a pic.
4 comments out of 6 commenting on her appearance change but ok keep pretending she doesnt look different
I checked 17 comments at the time of my comment, there was only 2 mentioning pregnancy
Get a life, man.
Groot Scissorhands!
That was filmed in Halifax at a place called the Piece Hall. I was near at the time, Marvel had most the area locked down but you could see big banners with Russian writing on and huge Russian Dolls. Saw Emilia Clarke running from the explosion and talking to a guy I couldn't recognise before getting in an old beat up car. Think the guy was Ben Kingsley Adir.   Also saw crews a few days after they were filming right by my office in Leeds. They had Russian street signs and traffic signs over the top of the existing ones. Sam Jackson and Ben Mendohlson were shot walking down a road with a daft looking green supercar pulling aside. Never thought I'd see West Yorkshire transform into Russia but here we are!
Wow crazy scoop lol
Is he dicking over a friend again by stupidly talking abt something he's seen he shouldnt be?  Bc last I remember he doesnt get any promo material from  marvel any more.
Doesn't the first episode of *The Falcon and the Winter Soldier* end in a similar way?
He shouldn't be sharing that kind of info.  I remember him saying that he removed himself from getting marketing material but most likely got kicked out from Disney's mailing list.  If you removed yourself from getting marketing material then why are you seeking out screeners and then promoting them on your own channel just to show off.  He's abit of a liar and desperate for attention. Can't stand him anymore.  Have totally lost all respect for this guy.
Ok the biggest WTF that Marvel have regarding the Skrulls is ........  >!Skrulls are immune to Wandas transforming/mind control spells. They remember the world as it was before M Day happened.<
Maria Hill has been a Skrull all along!
His co-host Robert Myer Bernet has read the scripts for the show and has been praising it for the like a year which does get me excited
Yup, saw the set pics, and it seemed to me she was genuinely distraught by whatever happened. I thought the explosion would happened a little bit later in the show but looks like they're starting with a bang. Literally lol.
Keep the quirky comments to yourself. I shared something about the upcoming show that I haven't seen anyone else post yet. It's not a crazy scoop it's a potentially useful info about the show many people are currently theorizing about.
Last time he had leaked set pictures, he leaked Charlie, Tobey and Andrew's involvement in No Way Home.
he said he does not attend premiers, but RMB had the script for months now I'm sure he knew about and still he gets screeners despite him not really being a fan of movie screeners
And they're not even done introducing new characters.
A little buildup sounds good to me.  There have been too many introductions and not enough space between.  The next movie or show comes along before we had the time to absorb and integrate the last one.  Nothing feels like a big event and no new character has enough time to build a following or connect to the other heroes because we have just abandoned them a few weeks later.
I feel like we are about to experience a Phase 2 type of build up! If phase 4 is parallel to phase 1 like Kevine Fiege said. I actually feel like we might see more Avengers socializing and collaborating sooner then later!    Secret Invasion: Nick Fury, Warmachine, Skrulls The Marvels: Captain Marvel, Kamala, Monica Captain America 4: Captain America & Hulks Coven of Chaos: Agatha, Wanda and her kids Echo: Daredevil, Netflix Defenders  Daredevil: DD, Punisher Kingpin Ironheart: Riri, Okoye, Pepper Potts Deadpool 3: Deadpool & Wolverine, X-Men Blade: Blade & Eternal characters  Other Disney shows in production can involve Kate Bishop & Yelena, Spider-Man 4 with Spidey interacting with Avengers, Fantastic 4 can involve the Pym family, ect. Also Loki is kinda the center of the entire saga, so I hope S2 it involves tons of other Avengers.  These are just thoughts not spoilers. But I do think Captain America 4 or Deadpool will be our Civil war level event films. And Fantastic 4 leading into Kang Dynasty is when we will start seeing things feel like Infinity war. I just think they are juggling a lot, and hope they can stick the landing by the time Kang Dynasty and secret wars rolls around.
This kinda makes me concerned about the Young Avengers, but the time they decide to make a YA project they might not be so young anymore, and that's if they even ever do the YA
So I think while you might not see them as quickly, your specific examples are 100% definite I believe Shang Chi is one of the main characters for upcoming avengers especially since I believe his Director is the Director for Kang Dynasty . . . also the Ten Rings, and Kamala's Bengal's seem to have similar connection to ancient realms.  Kate Bishop is going to play a major role in one way or another, maybe on a 2nd team or a young avengers type thing. First of Hailee Steinfeld is a really big name young actress who brings a lot to the table, she is a great get for the next era, she has the appeal to the young female audience and is attractive and charismatic enough for the male audiences to be in on her. Along with Florence Pugh they have 2 top level females in the perfect age range to carry that demographic.      Xu Xialing and other 2nd characters or adjacent characters might end up being lost in the shuffle of all the Phase 4 characters.
I feel like the spin-off characters will get the axe before mains do. we can’t take back the Agatha show. But it’s stuff like that I imagine they put on pause.
> a little downhearted that we might not see some beloved characters again for years  But that's what the fans wanted
Iger said in the investor meeting that releases were not reducing.  What he said was we wouldn't see the same characters over and over i.e. no more solo trilogies.
Not too upset. I mean, sure we won't see them in years. But wouldn't you rather they re-appear in a good project? If they really do focus on quality over quantity, then when they do return it should be massively better than whatever they would do now.
This is something that the "MARVEL NEEDS TO SLOW DOWN! I'M FEELING OVERWHELMED!!!" people never actually considered. People have already been complaining about it taking so long for certain characters to reappear so imagine how much worse it's going to be now that they're slowing down and reducing the amount of projects per year.  We might not see Moon Knight again until 2025 or 2026. By the time they get around to a second season, no one is going to give a fuck about the Jake Lockley tease.
Well think about the real time gap for Sam L appearances. Far from Home was 4 years ago.
Ugh
This has nothing to do with what OP is talking about. They acknowledged that the delays are a good thing but pointed out the fact that we're going to have to wait a long time before seeing these characters again.
Secret Invasion: Nick Fury, Warmachine, Skrulls   The Marvels: Captain Marvel, Kamala, Monica   Captain America 4: Captain America & Hulks   Coven of Chaos: Agatha, Wanda and her kids   Echo: Daredevil, Netflix Defenders   Daredevil: DD, Punisher Kingpin   Ironheart: Riri, Okoye, Pepper Potts   Deadpool 3: Deadpool & Wolverine, X-Men   Blade: Blade & Eternal characters   Other Disney shows in production can involve Kate Bishop & Yelena, Spider-Man 4 with Spidey interacting with Avengers, Fantastic 4 can involve the Pym family, ect. Also Loki is kinda the center of the entire saga, so I hope S2 it involves tons of other Avengers.
We already know that the number of releases is reducing. According to a recent report, it's now going to be 3 movies, 2 shows and a 1 or 2 specials per year.
*Scoopers* have said that, Bob Iger said there would be no reduction in Marvel content in a meeting with shareholders. What Iger did say was there would be  reduction in Star Wars content.  I'll choose to believe Iger over mytimetogrift etc
Surprised to see E Ross getting a mention. I expected his role to e fairly small.
Re-added because it had been taken down after they had accidentally revealed the release date last week.  I like that Everett Ross is featured in this synopsis too, the trailers have made it feel like he will play a very minimal role, but it's nice to see that he's in the same level as Fury, Talos and Hill.
Actually love going into a Marvel project without knowing what will happen. Haven’t felt this way in like 4 years due to scoopers spreading crap over twitter every single day💀Watch this be a critical hit with reviewers and fans alike, cuz they don’t have any predefined expectations or cameos!
About to ask if the clandestines were coming back and then realized it means secrecy and stuff. I’m stupid lol
Everett ross will be a skrull, I'm sure of it
I've not seen Quantumania yet so I hope it comes to Disney+ before this.
I just hope Talos doesn't die in this show. I want more of Ben Mendelsohn in the MCU.
I didn’t get a chance to keep up with Secret Invasion information until the trailer dropped earlier this week.   What was the old synopsis, and how much changed?
I know it is being telegraphed in the trailer, but I hope that Talos doesn't die in the series. I like the character and I like Ben Mendelsohn.
That's very specific wording on Talos. Y'all better leave my boy alone.
When is quantummania coming on Disney?
I thought that said Jonah Hill for a second
Awesome, really excited for this show. I think it has the potential to beat out WandaVision and Loki as my favorite of the D+ shows.
It says they learn of a clandestine invasion, implying it has already happened, but it also says they race against time to thwart the imminent invasion, implying it *hasn’t* happened yet. I’m confused.
Sam Jackson is one of those actors who makes even bad things good.
It’s missing the Oxford comma
Let's hope this is the grounded, story-focused MCU entry, much like Andor was for Lucasfilm.
This is cool, but where the hell is Coulson. Might have to start a petition.
Clan Destine?
It is definitely looking less superheroey and more spy-fi, which I am definitely up for.
Sam Jackson looks good with a beard.  I always forget that.
That image is really rad, I like it a lot!
I'm hyped!
So exactly when does this show take place? Like right after the blip or does it take place after Wakanda Forever?
So I'm making this clear - this happens before Nick is replaced by a Skrull, right?
Do I need to watch quantummania before this?
Actually sounds interesting, may be the first MCU release I watch since No Way Home
Will we see evil skrulls in it? It might be another black widow where political point take over narrative
Cool. I can't wait to see it. Do you think Goose is still alive? How long do fluerkens live?
They should have made a secret saga for it  like a movie avengers secret invasion  that would have made a just to secret invasion comic series  as in comics it was a big event
I thought this was set during the five year gap?
Secret Invasion could be a big Avengers level event. I feel a bit disappointed that they relegated it to a tv show
So Fury is working with Talos?
So the plot of Capt Marvel is the Skrulls were just refugees trying to survive, and the plot of this is there are groups of Skrulls who are out for conquest?
This should really follow into a movie  Can’t say I agree with a lot of Marvel decisions post Endgame
12+ is worrying
So when exactly is “Present Day MCU”?
I thought they showed the skrulls as peaceful. Wonder what the story for this will be like
What exactly is present day MCU?
Same  Hopefully he is explored a bit more as a character.   I loved him in Wakanda Forever  Hoping to see Val as well.
I mean if you have Martin freeman in your show you should probably mention his character however small his role is
I always expected him to be a Skrull honestly
I think they're setting him up to be an Heir Apparent for Nick Fury since Sam Jackson is getting pretty old and might not be around for Phase 6. Easy enough to start planting seed now so you can keep the role of "super spy/Chaotic Good Government Agent/Superhero Liaison " filled within the MCU narrative.
Maybe it was changed because of how his story in Wakanda forever had to be changed
I would love for Everett Ross to be some kind of undercover important boss
Yeah, I don’t count on nothing being leaked in the coming weeks though.
Besides one potential cameo I’ve heard which won’t say even without the confirmation I know next to nothing bout this show and it’s by far my most anticipated MCU project and has been for a while now
Yeah. Its really hard for me to refrain from watching trailers and seeing shit online. I have next to no knowledge of Secret Invasion and based on the way the MCU has things set up, it can't be too similar to the comic event.
I have one predefined expectation of a cameo given how long and how many sources have been circulating that for, and that is a major part of my excitement for the show.  But other than that, I’m impressed how well this one has been kept under wrap compared to the entries from the last couple of years.
That's preventable... I'm go into every marvel project not knowing what will happen.. I don't watch any trailers, stay off of discussions for the most part..   I only found out about secret wars within the last two weeks 😂 I still have no idea what it's about, I didn't read The synopsis in the post
I wonder why Furyb is the most wanted man on earth
i hate to break it to you, but Mephisto's in this.
Interesting choice of words though!!!
My first thought is their use of "clandestine" here will lead to some wild fan theories lmao
Yeah Nick is a few months too late on that
There was always something fishy about him. I remember the rumors being he’d reveal himself to be Red Skull when he first joined the MCU
I'm thinking that lady from the DODC. The one that gave Ms Marvel a hard time.
Yes.  Quantumania comes on Disney+ in 2 weeks.
Have you seen Loki season 1? If so, you're basically up to speed.
The old synopsis was a little more generic and I would call it more of a description actually, but here it is:  >Secret Invasion is a newly announced series heading to Disney+ that stars Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury and Ben Mendelsohn as the Skrull Talos—characters who first met in Captain Marvel. The crossover event series showcases a faction of shape-shifting Skrulls who have been infiltrating Earth for years.
In two weeks from today.  Actually that's when it comes to digital, but it's usually the same date for both.
Ye would watch it
I would assume it’s a small number of them have got into the positions necessary to start the invasion proper, but there aren’t currently enough in place yet to stand a chance if the rest didn’t show up. I don’t know if that made any sense.
Sign me up!
I would be content if they would just at least reference AOS or something, doesn’t have to be a cameo but damn the show is too good to be ignored.
Clandestine is like a synonym to secret or hidden, no relation to the ones in Ms Marvel
Clandestine means "kept secret because it is illicit"  Clan Destine, the villainous group, is a different thing. It's supposed to be 2 words, Clan (aka family), Destine (Adam Destine is the patriarch of the family).  But of course they called the villainous group Clan Destine from the word clandestine, because they were keeping themselves hidden.
November 2025, 6 months after Wakanda Forever
Its after Far From Home.
You mean Far From Home?  No, after Far From Home.
No
No.  It will EXPLORE the period of the blip, but won't be set during it.  Fury was blipped in case you forgot.  My guess is that the Skrulls started their invasion during the blip and we'll see flashbacks to that.
same, but i guess it'll just be Fury and SWORD trying to figure out what happened during the Blip
Yeah exactly. It even says "present day" in the synopsis. 2023 was during the blip.
I’m the opposite - I think TV is the perfect match for it. Episodic format allows them to slowly reveal the extent and severity of the threat over the course of 6 (is it a 6 episode series?) weeks, and that extra runtime gives them the freedom to go more in-depth on the backstory of how the invasion happened, richer world building and generally more developed characters.   Plus I think it’s very unlikely that this goes the way of Age of Ultron where a world domination event is started and ended within a single entry - I imagine this ends with them having scratched the surface of the Skrull invasion which is then continued in future entries.
Of course
No, not exactly.  [I explained this in another comment here in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/12cc9bw/secret_invasion_has_been_readded_on_disney_with_a/jf2lt85?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3)
The trailer literally came out a few days ago?
A comment that provides so much value to us all.
All Marvel Studios projects are 12+ lol  I know it's PG-13 and TV-14 in the US, but in Europe, the equivalent is 12+.
2025.  Specifically, this show takes place in November as the first episode takes place during Russia's Unity Day, which is on November 4th.  Wakanda Forever took place in May 2025, She-Hulk spanned throughout a big part of summer of that year and ended in August, Quantumania happened on July 24th 2025, Ms. Marvel happened in September/October 2025 and now we're in November.  GotG Holiday Special technically happens in December 2025, after Secret Invasion.
2023 maybe? The Blip (where people come back from the snap) happened in Q3 2023. The show comes out in Q2 '23, so it's close enough, I guess?   The problem there is that the last time we saw Fury was in FFH in Q2/Q3 '24... Maybe the show starts during the 5 year gap, and crosses over into MCU 2024/2025?
They have already revealed the reason behind the invasion.  [Here is a rundown](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/128gj4e/the_reason_behind_the_skrull_invasion_in_the_mcu/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)  Basically, Captain Marvel never found the Skrulls a home and they ended up staying on Earth and acting as Fury's spies.  Now, 30 years later, some Skrulls are starting to get tired of Fury's and Talos' promises that they will find them a home one day. They are tired of living their lives on Earth, wearing other people's faces. So Gravik radicalizes those Skrulls, they create a rogue, separatist sect and they start the invasion.

There wasn't much to love about him in Wakanda Forever, such a minor role, more of a setup for future storylines in other movies I recon. So i'm glad taht he seems to be gettign bigger role in the series than we expected.
I think Val will show up. She’ll probably be hunting him down since she had him arrested and she’ll hear that he was broken out.
According to this description Ross is suddenly an ally of Fury. I guess it makes sense that Fury would have friends in such government roles but we haven’t seen that relationship before. I’m expecting him to be a “long time friend” and then the Skrull reveal would be even more devastating.
If any, I'd have expected Maria Hill to be that.
No way
Would love for his character to have more to do, but I feel like they've already kind of leaned on this trope for Val and wouldn't go the same route.
Mephisto Confirmed.
Hehe I love Daisy
Red Skull?  Maybe you have confused Everett Ross (Martin Freeman) with Thunderbolt Ross (William Hurt, Harisson Ford) who becomes *Red Hulk*, not the *Red Skull*.  Or maybe you're getting confused with Alexander Pierce who people actually theorized he would be the Red Skull.
The April 18 date is for Digital (buying/renting the movie on iTunes, Google Play, Amazon, etc.). They haven’t announced a Disney+ release date - in fact, the Digital release date isn’t officially announced either, the posts about it seem to be screenshots from a leaked trailer. I would say it’s likely to be on Disney+ the same day as Digital because that’s been the case for most of Disney’s post-2020 theatrical releases, even moreso considering Quantumania’s box office and reception, but it’s not a given because Avatar 2 is currently on Digital and still doesn’t have a Disney+ release date.
It’s crazy how Quantumania is still up in movie theaters for about 3 months.
Yea that was definitely a filler description which wasn't supposed to go out live.
I was getting excited for a slight connection for a sec lol
Oh thank god
Ah thank you!
Cool thank you for confirming. So that means E Ross is probably either in prison or gets broken out at the start of the show I guess?
Unless it's not really Fury? It's a Skrull impersonating him?
It says "present day MCU"
>- I think TV is the perfect match for it  I do agree with this. But the whole idea of the Skrulls is people finding out they were hiding in plain sight, maybe even being characters we've came to love/hate along the years with the MCU.  Enclosing this whole scope in a tv show with Fury, Hill and a brand new character (Emilia Clarke) plus others makes it seem completely deflated. I do not believe they'll continue the saga moving forward because they haven't done it with any production so far besides maybe Loki.
Yea but most of the D+ content has been ass.
Why would Talos do such a thing? That would essentially be treason against his own species, and when we saw him in Captain Marvel he had quite a high leadership position.  Edit: Sorry, I thought it was every skrull attacking earth
Thanks for the info, but still worrying. Marvel could have made this one for adults
Nope, we're in 2025 now.  Specifically, this show takes place in November as the first episode takes place during Russia's Unity Day, which is on November 4th.  Wakanda Forever took place in May 2025, She-Hulk spanned throughout a big part of summer of that year and ended in August, Quantumania happened on July 24th 2025, Ms. Marvel happened in September/October 2025 and now we're in November.  GotG Holiday Special technically happens in December 2025, after Secret Invasion.  The show doesn't take place in the blip, it will only show flashbacks to explore that period further. The main narrative is in November 2025, 2 years after Endgame (hence Maria Hill's line to Fury about him spending years at the space station)
Oh wow that actually sounds interesting. Hope it doesn't bomb like everything else we've gotten so far
i argee
Yep  They have also given her the role of Norman Osborn from the comics Dark Reign storyline (founder/leader of the Thundberbolts and Director of a governmental organization), and Osborn had a pretty big role in the comics Secret Invasion.  [I made a post a while back with all the characters I am expecting/hoping to see in the series](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/11k3bar/secret_invasion_should_be_a_big_crossover_event/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) and Val is at the top by far.
Well, E. Ross was just discovered to be giving the Wakandan's intel about US Government actions behind the USA's back. He's kind of in the same boat as Fury: a spy without a home.
I think his thing would be that he has been a SHIELD double agent loyal to fury
I knew it!  - Erik Voss
*Erik Voss enters the chat*
No, I was referring to Martin Freeman's character in particular. There was [speculation](https://whatculture.com/film/10-ridiculous-captain-america-civil-war-rumours-we-hope-arent-true?page=3), however unfounded, that he was or was going to become Red Skull. His first appearance was a pretty small role for a bigger named actor, so it begs the question if they had something bigger planned for him later. And if he turns out to be a Skrull, that will be a great payoff to this whole thing (even if it wasn't a twinkle in anyone's eye back when).
It's not even been 2 months
It only lasted a month in my local cinemas, very sad.
Oh no, that description had been there for months.
Ross was broken out by Okoye at the end of Wakanda Forever.  He's on the run now
Could be too, but I doubt it.  Still, the show takes place in present day.
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thinking_face_hmm)
> maybe even being characters we've came to love/hate along the years with the MCU.  i think people will be disappointed.     i agree that tv is perfect for this because a mystery like this told and revealed in a movie theatre AT BEST will be Knives Out -- while as a tv show we can string it out as Twin Peaks or Lost.     ...i just wish it would be more than 6 episodes.  ....but then again - that's because i'm thinking it'll be a mystery.  -- this is why i say people will likely be disappointed.  we don't really know what we're getting, but we're already theorizing some series that'll reveal some longstanding characters as skrulls (like rhodey?!?)  when the best we can probably hope for is Everett Ross...
WandaVision, Loki, Hawkeye, Moon Knight and the 2 Specials were great.  I personally liked The Falcon and the Winter Soldier and She-Hulk a lot as well, although I see their issues and completely understand some of the criticisms. Still, wouldn't call them ass.  Were they perfect? No   Were they A LOT better than the majority of Phase 4's movies? 1000%  Actually, I would even say they are better than half the MCU movies in general lol
They hit it off in Captain Marvel. They were also working together in Far From Home.  Are you confusing Talos for someone else?
He's been working with Fury for decades now.  They are friends.  What are you talking about?
Why not?
Yeah
It's the same as everything else on Disney+. This show isn't going to spontaneously be filled with "Fucks", fucks, and bloody violence.
PG-13 is for adults. There doesn't have to be titties and decapitations and F-bombs for something to be for adults.
I'd honestly LOVE it if someone were to 'tweet' MCU stuff in 'real time' and stuff.
I was talking about the definition of present day. I'm saying if we assume that the longline means our present day then maybe the movie starts in 2023 (during the gap) and continues into MCU timeline of 24/25.
Argue+agree?
a Skrull spy without a home.
I think his thing would be that he’s a longtime ally of Fury that the guy trusts, and then the reveal is that he’s a double agent for the bad skrulls.
Why would he become red skull lol
Hmm I see.  Very generic
Oh duh, I forgot about that!
Present day is 2023. They all snapped back in 2024?
>but then again - that's because i'm thinking it'll be a mystery.  They could write a mistery. Just not name it Secret Invasion.   Winter Soldier was a mistery and it didnt need to attach itself to a gigantic comic book saga. If anything it gives them more creative freedom
I'm glad you're enjoying. Outside of Loki and WandaVision, which I loved, I find they spend too much time developing the side characters and rush the conclusions when I would enjoy a more focused narrative like Shang-Chi.   I'm cautiously optimistic about Secret Wars, cus Sam L, but would feel more comfortable if it were in movie format.  Edit: Oh and agreed that the specials were awesome and refreshing.
This human/skrull war would make Talos have to choose between committing treason or saying goodbye to an old friend. Ik which one Id choose in his position  Edit: Sorry, I thought it was every skrull attacking earth
Psychological thriller but we have made it for kids too. Lol nice
Not exactly what you're looking for, but r/Earth199999 is similar
The synopsis literally clarifies it as "present day of the MCU"
at this time of year?
Spider-Man 4 title confirmed
It's incorrect speculation from more than half a decade ago, doesn't really bear any more thinking about more than the offhand comment I made above.
People knew that Red Skull had been recast, but they didn't know he was going to be in IW at that point.
Generic, or rather a description fitted for an business meeting as an elevator pitch answering “What’s Secret Invasion and why should we, the suits, care?”. Focused on the lead actor’s names, places the timeline via a movie name, too short to really set the scene, etc gives that away.
No, they snapped back in October 2023.  MCU's present day is currently 2025
It's not exactly treason.  The skrulls who are doing the invasion are a rogue sect of separatist rebels who were radicalized by Gravik.  It's not like all the Skrulls are invading and Talos is the only one standing against them.  They are the ones who committed treason.
Winter Soldier was also PG-13 and it's amazing.
why would you expect it to be different in rating from every single MCU release to date
Yes. I read that, as did a bunch of other people here and it's not clear. Why are you taking this so personally?
Understood
Ok, so present day is 2 years from now, Tomorrow is yesterday's future, and my head hurts from trying to keep up 🤯
That makes sense. I thought it was every skrull attacking.
Because this show actually would be good if there was a rating change? Also it'd be different from what we've gotten till now
Oh no, I am not taking it personally, just clarifying/pointing out things.
Season 3 is fantastic and I'm glad you enjoyed it so much.
Season 3 is SO good. All of them are! This is by far my favorite Netflix series ever.   Also can't wait for Born Again!
To me The Punisher had the best first season of all the Marvel Netflix shows then season 2 was good too but not better than season one imo…. but the thing with Daredevil is like dammm just every season just got better and better than it’s last…. it’s the best marvel show to me n I hope Born Again doesn’t disappoint
>Fisk work his way up from a prison inmate to getting married to Vanessa to being sent back to prison was oh so glorious.  I personally felt Kingpin being sent back to jail but with Vanessa safe and on the run, just like in Season 1, was a big letdown after how many people he killed and how many lives he ruined in Season 3, especially with Vanessa taking a more active part in his evil.  Would have preferred if Bullseye actually succeeded in his revenge, so Kingpin would suffer some of the pain he inflicted onto others, rather then returning to the status quo. Especially given if the show is canon to the MCU, he wasn't in jail for long.
Yeah this is a popular opinion and I just don't get it.  The ending was unsatisfying and stretched my disbelief too far.  Kingpin is just going to keep Matt's identity secret, just because?  Please.  And Matt didn't wear the costume.  It felt like a return to early superhero movies/shows where they were embarrassed to actually show costumed superheroes being costumed superheroes.  I wanted to see Daredevil.
Reddit aint your blog bro
Glad you enjoyed it. Just one point, they had their usual tight 6mths ar (ex hols), 8-10 days an episode to make this season incl all that action, rather than a long time, and its fantastic - again.
Glad you liked that!  Enjoy Punisher, Jessica Jones, and Luke Cage.
Daredevil is so good that I put it right up there with the best tv shows ever made like GOT, Dark, BB.  For me the top 3 marvel projects are - Daredevil, Agents of shield, Punisher
DD season 3 is the greatest thing Marvel or DC has ever put out, I'm glad there's still folks out there getting to enjoy it for the first time.  You missed talking about the best.performance in the season though, Ray Nadeem. He is in every way the audience surrogate here, and as he sinks deeper into Fisk's world, the viewer feels like he's with him for the ride.
He's going to keep it secret because Matt has dirt on Vanessa, and Fisk's love for Vanessa outweighs his hate for Matt. It goes back to Season 1 and the way Matt is a lot more open to the idea of killing Fisk until he learns about Vanessa.     I do agree that they missed a perfect opportunity (two, really) to put Matt back in the devil suit though.
You felt the need to comment this why exactly?
Yeah, I noticed that after I put it out. But Nadeem was easily one of the best parts of the season. I teared up when in his video to his wife, and was like "FUCK YEAH!" when his video came on on everyone's phones at Fisk's wedding.
You could ask op the same thing.
That’s cool.
That’s cool.
I prefer the original
Dope as hell. Love it
Do more
He is not alone when that happens, if you going to blame fury then so does Maria and Carol, especially Maria who suppose to oversee the alien activities on earth.
I think skrull invasion happen during blip, when everybody dusting... Skrull take over disguise as them, i mean now one will knew if someone vanish or not.  Like if parent of family vanish, skrull just dsiguise as one of the parent and pretending live as human while working for bigger invasion. Then sacond snap happen ppl comeback. Maybe this show will tell report aboyt why so many doppelganger after sacond snap  Btw about your post no one knew about skrull on earth except fury, danver, monica and her mother
Yeah, that's the whole point of the show.  Gravik radicalised a group of Skrulls who were tired of living in other people's bodies all the time and not having their own home. They were tired of Fury's promises to find them a home all the while he kept using them as spies.  And Fury feels guilty that it's all his fault.  They already explained all this in an interview.
Dunno if it's entirely his fault, he had good intentions, saving an alien race from at the time a more evil alien race.  But he at least feels responsible enough about it to try to fix it on his own without involving the avengers.   That's the vibes I get from the trailer.
Well seeing as Maria is dead...
The synopsis is that fury was allowing skrulls to live on earth in disguise while trying to find them a planet and using them as a spy network which some of them are sick of and start invading.
Oh damn really, I haven't watched any of the promo stuff other than the trailer
Hill. Maria Hill
Yep  Here is [a post I made analysing that interview and the whole reason behind the secret invasion](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/128gj4e/the_reason_behind_the_skrull_invasion_in_the_mcu/).  And [another post listing everything we know about Secret Invasion](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/1243u5v/potential_spoilers_everything_we_know_about/).  They are interesting reads if you care to know more about the show.
Im not a professional audio engineer and I could tell that was two different voice clips
[Dunno if they'll ever top the first time for Owen in the Marvel Universe tho](https://youtu.be/7y4-WSywiSY)
I think it's important we don't go on expecting any cameos, besides Rhodey's. They may have dropped that 'alone' in as they're aware people might assume Avengers are coming, based on some of the source material, and be disappointed. This looks to be like something they really want to be focused on Fury, and how he copes WITHOUT heroes to help him.  Speculating that we're getting cameos that don't materialise can really dampen enjoyment, even if they never intended for them to be there - ie MoM.  Go in expecting nothing, worst case you'll enjoy the show more, as it's intended. Best case, there may be an extra surprise or two.
They could have just added that for dramatic purposes. The original line reading in the show could be a bit more subdued which wouldn’t really fit with the tense tone of the trailer.
They showed a war machine cameo
agreed, i’m predicting a end credit scene or final scene in regular run time with something along the lines of avengers
Marvel notoriously alters trailers though, fun to think about
Personally I wouldn't even do that.
Dr strange getting beaten by Spiderman, yeah I get than Steven was trying to avoid hurting Peter, but you would think an ex-Soccerer supreme would be better at that
Peter would beat Steve in the comics now,  but back when he was in high school, he probably would have struggled.
Black Widow has lost against Crossbones, Winter Soldier and Taskmaster in the MCU. In the comics she has beaten each one of them.
Dr strange and Wanda
Not a character but I would like to mention Quicksilver against a bullet
Soooooooooooooooooooooooooo I think the thing that makes the hero fights so amazing is that they can always create ways to have 1 beat the other.     I see a lot of the Spider-Man V Strange fight in NWH.... the fact is, Spider Man has elevated senses and abilities... Strange has unbelievable powers that he has to actively cast spells to perform... SO in the MCU while Strange has to make decisions and choices, Spider Man is almost acting before Strange can even motion his hands.... For example, the scene where he is knocked out of his own body, the Spidey Sense (Peter Tingle) takes over and defends his body from Strange..... In the Mirror world, you can see Peter is reacting before Strange finishes the motion, which is why peter is able to dodge and avoid most attacks...   Also, in reality, if Peter were able to land 1 punch on Strange with a full strength blow, it would be a KO easy.....  Also let's not forget, they are essentially on the same team... Strange didn't try to like "Magic Missile" the kid, they are trying to capture/escape one another.      Captain America is supposed to be one of the best hand to hand combat heroes and Spidey essentially depends on his reflexes and spidey sense... I believe in the comics or cartoon there is a specific story where Capt beats Spidey and offers to help train him how to fight so he can be even better... Essentially Spidey would be out "boxed" by Capt,.
For any long running characters you can probably find an example of any one beating any other one and vice versa. There is no and never will be any 100% objective system of who will beat who.
Doctor Strange would take Wanda without any real trouble.
This is a weird question because the comics were never really ruled by that type of shonen-style power scaling. Heroes would almost always find some way to defeat the bad guy (outliers like the Korvac Saga were the exception, not the rule). Stan Lee wanted any fight between heroes to end in a effective stalemate to put the emphasis on how silly it was for them to fight in the first place rather than turn it into a "who's stronger?" pissing contest.  It might be a stretch that Spider-Man could get the better of Doctor Strange in *No Way Home*, but had that fight happened in a Spider-Man comic it would have turned out much the same.
> most would agree that Peter could beat Cap.  near-perfect trolling
doctor strange and spider man
Look power wise strange is much stronger, but peter didn't beat him at fighting but at quick thinking and combat intelligence. Strange is very smart but at different things, like his photographic memory.  This is all in the mcu tho, I'm pretty sure Dr Strange in the comics is hella smart.
I don’t think Strange has ever been Sorcerer Supreme in the MCU, has he?
Also comics Steve has weaker powers than MCU Steve (well, except when he did [this](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-89b4e0f324bf590919986db6ef467091-lq)).
Depends on what era of Wanda, he's going against.
Man got tagged by Angel he’s kinda inconsistent
In the comics? I got my money on Spider man.
[removed]
How am I trolling. Aren't you agreeing with me that Peter would stomp Steve 😭?
Comic Cap doesn't really have super strength unlike Peter
Dr strange in the comics would just flick his wrists and with a cast of the crimson bands Peter is stuck
The only one that even has a chance is during HoM is she she was buffed by the life force.
I got my money on something more important coming up before they get a chance to fight
That comment sounded so much like *comic book guy* it actually smelled, bobert_the_grey.  Whomever wins depends on the writers that day, but it's not like spiderman doesn't bleed. TBH ik not really interested in litigating it, hence why it's such a great troll.
Stronger? Yes. But Cap is the better tactician with the unbreakable, physics defying weapon.   It's at least more of a "push"
Experienced Peter not 15 year old civil war peter
yeah but if you search he's generally beaten him anyways lol
It really comes down to who the writer wants to win I’ll be honest.
I don't know who "bobert\_the\_grey" is but right off, I can assure you I'm not a guy 💀 Also like, Spider-Man being able to beat Cap isn't some uncommon opinion that only a few people hold.
No because editorial wouldn’t allow that
I feel we had a lot of Vaughn in *Punisher War Zone*, he literally uses a guy's neck as a diving board
Vaughn hadn’t made a good movie in years sadly
Watch Kingsman 2 and you might change your mind
Freebird plays as Frank just ... fucking slaughters his way through a church full of goons.
While we would probably get some awesome action…the movie would be extremely dumb
The Kingsman's sequels  Yikes!
Or a church full of innocent and mild-mannered people who were commanded by Kilgrave to kill each other (including Frank).
Well now I need to clean myself up
I will be ever resentful to Lindsay Ellis for popularizing the video essay format.
"It can't be done because it doesn't have tons of heroes involved"  I knew it would be something like this...
*Plays Press Garden music*
It's not even out yet lmao
Bruh ever you watch friendly space ninja essay vid..?  I think it the best on the game
I wasn't going to watch it anyway but you just saved my curiosity. Not surprised that their reasoning was nonsense.
Thanks for saving my time
Man I love Karen gillan, since her days on doctor who she stood out   Her role with nebula has been great and one of the strongest arcs in the MCU. Going from a one note villain to a full redemption
I’m going to be so bummed if Nebula dies…she must continue on!
Murder Barbie
She's doing the famous Nebula pose.
She’s hilarious about this thing
I’d recommend checking out her tiktok she’s pretty hilarious and has talked about some behind the scenes stuff before too
Karen is so funny but I’m here for the Nebula glow up honestly
Everyone who ever laughed at her is going to know the revenge of the fifth
She does such a good job as nebula.
Come on Barbie, let's go ~~party~~ kill something.
The what if version of her had major cyborg Barbie vibes too
Im a barbie girl,  From another world,   My arm is plastic,  Revenge is drastic,  I have got no hair,  Augmented everywhere,   Imagination, Thanos’ creation
This is great
MIGHT kill me? Of all the characters that I thought might die in volume 3, I never suspected it would be me. Oh well, I’m sure Gunn handled my death at Nebula’s hands well if it happens
Is this a template or something that people are using for their own meme.
Still can't get over how they put her head on a beer gut dudes body
They made her look like a dude.
Thought it was Billy Corgan at first lol.
Epic!
She needs the blond wig from What If
Gotta love karen gillan
Lmao, it looks like iDubbz cosplaying as Nebula.
Dang they did Karen Gillian dirty
Why is she holding her arm like that
Wow  Such Barbie  Very posed  New playing action
I didn't know Billy Corgan was in the new Guardians of the Galaxy.
Batman "WHERE ARE THEY‽‽‽" meme.
Dad Bod Nebula
The makeup isnt as good anymore tbh
For a scotch, she’s a miserable lookin ginger. That’s for sure.
They made her look like ply board
KG in Jumanji sooo fit!
I swap between finding her annoying and grating to sometimes finding her the funniest
Did they Photoshop Karen Gillan's head on a man's body? There's no way she looks that manly
Maaaaan, Karen is so hot, why do they have to dress her up like this? The looks like a blue Grace Jones.
Please blast me mommy nebs
What a crap poster.
I dislike Nebula so much. With her stupid whispering voice all the time.
Karen Gillan is one of the best people in the world imo. Amy Pond was everything to me so seeing her become apart of such a huge franchise like Marvel, playing a great role makes me so happy! She deserves it FR
She was easily the most beautiful of the doctors sidekicks, so I just love that her next major role was a shaved head cyborg monster who shouts 90% of her lines.
Also it's awesome that she kept the attitude, just in a tempered form.
The Doctor Who connection is funny here because one of the Kens is played by the upcoming Fifteenth Doctor.
Same, I loved Karen Gillian since DW. She’s been great as Nebula.
I wish her character on Dr who wasn't written quite so uh...Moffat  Edit: I like Amy a lot don't get me wrong but in her first season she's way over sexualised
**Character Death Odds**  Drax 2:1  Rocket 4:1  Nebula 25:1  Star-Lord 200:1  Groot 1000:1  Gamora 1000:1
tbh i completely agree.
Oh god, Karen Gillian did an entire bit about this photo.  They took it and they all realised how shit it was and they weren't gonna use it and then Karen showed it on her TikTok laughing at how shit she looked and now its official PR.
I loved her talking about it. "Why did I lose like that, what an I reaching for"
I’m getting strong 1996-Billy-Corgan vibes here…
Glow up??
i cant even comprehend how its the same person
That's good
A new trailer for the Barbie movie dropped yesterday, along with a bunch of character posters. People are using the poster as a templet for the memes
There's actually a selfie generator from WB. Google barbie selfie generator and it should come up.
yeah, i dont see the purpose either🤔
Me too.
She taught it looked cool at the time. Then she saw it was a mistake. Now she owns the mistake and laughs about it
Yeah, part of the ridiculousness is how square her midsection appears.
i have absolutely no idea
what 😳
Well… that just like… your opinion man.
Her angry dancing in the holiday special KILLED me
Excuse me but don't do Jenna Coleman, Freema Agyeman, and [Nardole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lt2fv3ut29I&t=174s) dirty like that.
“You cant escape ME, Bacon!!!”
Every time I see Nebula, I look for something of Amy Pond and there is nothing. I know she's under makeup and maybe some CGI, but everything about her--the way she moves, the way she talks--is so different, I can't wrap my head around the fact that they're played by the same person.
I read in an article that her delivery as Nebula is an amalgam of Marilyn Monroe and Clint Eastwood. I don't know why, but I just love that.
Excuse me…Freema Agyeman exists.
she was also a perfect casting in Jumani
I really did not like Amy. Clara was a huge step up, even if she overstayed her welcome.  That said, I love Nebula.
She was a breath of fresh air after 4 seasons of unrelenting "ROSE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ENTITY TO HAVE EVER EXISTED IN THE ENTIRETY OF SPACE-TIME ! ! !"  Rag on Moffat if you must, but the fact that the show is going back to RTD basically killed my interest in it.
My dumbass started reading these like time stamps.
Personally my bets are on Rocket dying and Drax retiring.
You are forgetting Mantis.  I thinks she's being off'ed in the movie and thats who Peter is broken up over in the trailer. His sister.
Do you think they will go the route of the comics and have Drax get reborn?  Since he is currently in the Riddick-Drax form will they go backwards to Idiot-Hulk-Drax?  Maybe they can cast John Cena?
I can't see them killing Nebula - first off, we've already seen her die! Plus, we've seen her sister die. I just think it wouldn't hit the same.
What about Mantis and Kraglin odds?
Mantis 1000:1
Actually, Groot's Death Odds are probably more like I Am Groot. 😝
I hope none of them die. Fed up of super heroes dying all the time. Please can a marvel movie have a fun, happy and heroic ending? I want to be entertained not depressed.
Yes
I know. Like logically I know, but damn she really becomes nebula in a way that I completely forget that she is Karen Gillan playing her.
yeah i saw a morbious meme somewhere with that format
Thanks that’s the answer I was looking for
You should look at her on the cover of Women's Health magazine.   I guess this is her real body.
Did I stutter?
It’s the voice. I just can’t handle it.
Billie Piper and David Tennant are two very beautiful people and I'll have no more said on the matter.
We're just gonna gloss right over Captain Jack Harkness?
Wait....the guy from the Inspector Spacetime convention in Community was actually on Doctor Who?   Mind blown. God, I feel like I'm constantly realizing that I missed meta jokes while watching Community, even though I've seen it like 4 times.
Yep.  I apologize for nothing.
Now, that's a Whovian I like.
They had to write Nardole out cos the show would’ve imploded due to that amount of sexiness.
So true about Jenna and Freema.
Freeman did not get a long enough shake of it...
He said what he said
His response was somewhere between “I have to escape, and maybe I want to explore what this has awoken in me”.
Even when she played Amy, she was extremely good at acting different in a wide variety of situations. Just a phenomenal actress.
I'm currently rewatching the Jumani films and having the exact same problem. I stare at her in the movie and try to see Nebula's character and my mind just can't do it. Such a testament to her as an actor.
I suggest the [older, battle-hardened Amy](https://doctorwhoworlduk.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ns6ep10c.jpg)  from "The Girl Who Waited", angry and distrustful, as the closest analog to her performance as Nebula.
Respectfully, I can’t agree.    She’s not remotely feminine like MM, and CE never, never yells to make a point.  She’s something else entirely.
There are a lot of people.  I wish them well.   Amy pond is the hottest dr who sidekick.
“Dance fighting”
I thought Clara was way worse as a character lmao, I like Amy but in her first series especially it's honestly off-putting how sexualised she was
I mean I don't think I disagree with that, still doesn't change that I think she was a horrendously written character at times and displayed the worst of Moffat female characters. If rtd coming back killed your interest that's entirely valid bit he's a far superior writer lmao
Damn Gotg 3 is gonna be 1000 minutes long??
same here. although i must say peter is also dying.
>>Maybe they can cast John Cena?    Maybe then Drax will finally master the ability of standing so incredibly still that he becomes invisible to the eye
Drax is already in his idiot phase though lol.  I don't they would recast Drax since he's been such a big character while at the same time not being vital that a recasting is necessary
I think that's cruel.  Mantis is one who has possibly more story beyond the Guardians.  Kraglin blends the Guardians and Ravagers.  Rocket retires with Lila  Nebula lives on.  She's finished her arc in getting away from Thanos and "destroying" her old self.  She will "reluctantly" run Knowhere and be very successful.  I think Drax dies accepting death because it is to save his friends / family juxtaposed with not being able to save his family.  It is not just to see his wife and daughter again.  Peter and Gamora I could see a bittersweet ending. Not every story ends perfectly, but for the audience is emotionally satisfying.  Plus Peter and Mantis have to look after each other as brother and sister.  That discovered connection means a lot to both.  We have no idea where Adam Warlock fit in and who else may show up.
I think Matis bites it during the movie and thats who Peter is breaking up over in the trailer.  The death of his sister.
Literally only widow and Iron man have died in terms of main heroes.
same here
thirsty redditor
too bad🤡
Heartfelt agreement.  Also, I stand by my initial assertion.
I WAS JUST SAYING HELLO!
hes a bit of a sex offender tho
The actor who played Rory, Amy's husband went on to play Rip Hunter in DC's Legends of Tomorrow.  He played a time travelor in a ship that disguises itself to hide, and has a plucky crew to protect time and life.
> Wait....the guy from the Inspector Spacetime convention in Community was actually on Doctor Who  What makes it even funnier is that he was on Community *before* his time on Doctor Who
To be fair, he wasn't officially in the series until 2 years later, so it's not technically a meta joke. Still, good to know.
Haven't seen it but yeah that convention name is definitely a Dr Who reference. ;)
I just adore this comment.
Maybe it was the other way around?   The femininity of Clint with the yelling of Marilyn?
I loved Oswin, from Asylum of the Daleks.  Clara Oswin from The Snowmen was almost as fun.  Unfortunately, the "main" Clara that followed those two was the least fun of the three.  Not BAD, but she didn't live up to her previous incarnations.
Yeah, no, her kissing the Doctor and then the Doc going to tell Rory at his bachelor party was uncomfortable. Especially since they try to make it seem like Amy and Rory were a good couple.
> he's a far superior writer lmao  Ah yes, a return to the era of farting fat people and slab blowjobs.  The vast majority of the RTD era is cringy as fuck if you try to watch it these days.  And most of the exceptions were written by.....Steven Moffat.  RTD's era also gave us Noel Clarke and John Barrowman.  Not exactly a win.
Really? Why do you think?   Personally I don't see Peter dying till Chris Pratt quits.
Oh God, that is a joke that requires the collision of like 3-5 memes.  I hate it.
i had a stroke reading that
I think Peter will be reunited with his grandparents. They were briefly shown in GOG2 and I think they were put in to remind us they are still alive. If done right it would be a very emotional scene.
Cosmo?
Well if you want to modify and add certain parameters then yes. Although please don't forget the fantastic Chadwick Boseman. That one was especially sad for different reasons.
I've been called worse
As you should, it's your opinion after all
I used to like Barrowman until it came out about his behavior on the DW set.
a bit?
Ah but he was in a Doctor Who audio play before that.
That’s the whole point… it’s a parody
Some might say it's streets ahead ;)
This is impossibly wrong.  Scold,  scold.  Edit: also thank you for participating in the discussion
I can't remember who said it but the issue is that a companion is supposed to show contrast to the Dr being an alien, the fact that she is constantly quipping and doing this Kevin Smith dialogue just makes her and the Dr so less distinguishable which is an issue when they're the leads of the show
I think that was the point of how she left the show. Never took her eyes off the path to her husband with her back to the doctor as she left him forever, she faced a choice and made it without any hesitation.
Even just how pushy she was being towards the Dr just felt kinda gross
OK so 2 actors from that season turned out to be not great people, doesn't affect his writing ability? I guess I just gotta agree to disagree cause beyond some of it aging a little funky the show had waaaaay more personality when Russel was at the helm and especially given the recent quality of the show he can only go up. I rewatched it all recently and like with every other time I do I just give up once Moffat takes over, Russell has continued to make great stuff since he left Dr who whereas Moffat kinda stagnated, plus he can't write women
The RTD era was written mostly for children. And Moffat wrote only 6 out of 60 episodes before he took over as showrunner.   Are some episodes silly? Absolutely, they're meant to be. The show was not intended to be dark and broody and scary. Moffat thought it should be, and Gibnall clearly thought so because it went several steps further when he took over.
Peter seems to being running in a burning area trying to escape it, and we also see Nebula carrying peter, but hopefully that's just a misdirect or he makes a great recovery. We also see for a second the Guardians look like they just got finish fighting and everyone is there except Peter, and we see Mantis crying.
Glad to hear it. You gotta be more careful buddy if having one wrong word choice gives you strokes 🤷
Wasn't trying to beat your top insult but whatever you say🙄
So like back in the 2000s?
A lot
Yeah just confirming it if they don't know anything about Dr Who, since the title doesn't give away the spacetime aspect.
Don't worry, it was a joke, but I like the way you talk
[https://www.reddit.com/r/GotG/comments/118nbxu/why\_i\_think\_starlord\_is\_dying\_in\_the\_new\_movie/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/GotG/comments/118nbxu/why_i_think_starlord_is_dying_in_the_new_movie/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)  it may just be that they editted the footage to misdirect people, like they did with hulk in infinity war.
>i dont they would recast  5
I mean I'm confused, are we gonna kiss or fight it out?
Yeah, I heard that he did some similar stuff on Arrow as well.
I’ve seen the show, it was an obvious parody. They even had Daleks called “Blorgons”
I don't even know how to respond to this lol
I love this vibe we have
who, me and you?
Spoiler Warning: Don't watch TV Spots from now on unless you wanna get spoiled.
cant wait!
To think, MCU Spider-Man will probably have kids, let alone, and grandkids before Comic Spider-Man ever even tries too... Shit that makes me sad.
I mean cassie heard almost similar story to this and now she becomes a rebel.  Also by the time peter had kids then earth would be filled with mutants, dinosaur and gods, it might be even crazier than current conditions.
I would say "Any Spider-Man has crazy histories to tell to his kids or grandchildren", but then I realize probably Holland will be the only one with kids, fucking Marvel Comics.
And then he will have to swear them to secrecy. Having this cool story and you can't brag to your friends lol
Wouldnt Strange's spell make it such that he can't tell his kids/grandkids, or something will happen to them etc etc?  Just wondering whether its an active enchantment, or a one time wipe. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thinking_face_hmm)
If he lives to tell them I don’t think he’ll make it out alive of Spider-Man 6 if they have Miles lined up to replace him he’ll need to elevate Miles in a sacrifice similar to how Tony had a huge impact on his life.
“When I was your age, I was in space fighting the Mad Titan!”  Oh, he will be an insufferable prick to a poor kid just trying to vent about how stressful school is.
Jesus, imagine if we have Tom Holland for another 15 years as Spidey and we get Anna-May Parker as 8-year old Spider-Girl webslinging in her underoos like her old man.
This applies to basically every Avenger who can or wants to have kids
“Now listen, son…”  “Who the hell are you? Get away from me!”  “Oh yeah. The spell…”
So yeah we’re just reposting twitter now
I honestly don’t believe MCU Spider-Man will ever have kids knowing how young-coded the character is by Disney, they will never let him even be married because it ages the character let alone having kids…  And i can’t even picture Tom Holland’s baby face playing a dad Peter Parker.
I can’t imagine MCU Peter living long enough to get married, much less have kids or grandkids. Either metaphorically (in that he gets a reboot eventually) or literally (dies in 5-10 years and passes the mantle to Miles a la ultimates), MCU Peter making it past 30 feels like a pipe dream to me.
THEY’L THINK HES LYING THOOO because everyone doesn’t know him
And nobody will ever believe him, he'll just be a senile old(er) man. 🥹
It's the great and at the same time sad reality of the movies vs the comics. The MCU characters are allowed to evolve, mature, and even pass away to illustrate real growth and passing of time. While comics by their share format the characters will remain more of less the same probably until the end of time.
Hell, even the animated version already has Mayday.
We will always have Renew Your Vows.
Damn you Paul!
I mean the spectacle tell all the more…more personal aspects though might just kill the mood “ then I was dead for 5 years, then I came back and watched my father figure/mentor die before my eyes, then another guy who I similarly looked up to betrayed my trust and tried to kill me,”  “Grandpa Peter do you need a hug?”   “ what no we're getting to the good part where my aunt/mother dies in my arms”
Cassie went from cute child to insufferable teen.   I hate how the MCU can be realistic sometimes
Peter: And that's the time I fought Thanos.  Kids: Big deal, last week at least three Captain Americas fought Galactus while the fourth mutant civil war happened next door.
At least Peter b has mayday now
Wasn't there a run where he had a daughter?
The greatest stories are the one you can’t tell lol
that'll be their punshiment!
Pretty sure it’s a one time swipe. If Peter tells people the truth those memories are likely to come back or they are least able to be convinced they are true since the spell was just to erase the memory of him being Spider-Man not actively keep people from remembering
But tbf, MCU Peter is already aging.
I mean Jon Kent is a DC mainstay now, yeah there are mishandlings along the way, but we got a lot of Superman as a father. So it's not necessarily the medium, more the company.
And Spectacular Spider-Girl
Wouldn't be that much hype considering the likes of shuri, thor, wanda also lost most of their families, especially since peter also a super powered individuals.  I think hawkeye descendants would be more impacted by his story, just like how kate was inspired by a simple mam that had challenged the odds.
It is funny to see that rocket and scott somehow suffers as a parent who deals with their new teenage kids.
She was insufferable because she has one expression and can't act worth a damn. Stuck out like a sore thumb
At that point Danielle Cage Cap. America might have start training her replacement.
It’s interesting. They named her Mayday but she looks like Annie May. Not complaining, it’s just funny how it turned out.
I assume there’s more than one, but there is one where he has a daughter named May, who is referred to as Mayday Parker
lol maybe.
So like omit
He’s 16 so not by that much
Yeah but a good chunk of them are also adults or it happened before their super hero careers took off whether we're kids. Peters childhood well his teenage years are kind if I intertwined with it and in Clints case his family came back
What? He’s like 17 and he’s out of High School now.
I wouldn't say shuri as adults and she is a miserable as peter is now, well except fot the money part.
No he got dropped out of highschool because of the memory erase thing  He’s getting his GED now
And that she still has friends who love and support her and at least a nephew. Peter is currently alone (even if some of that is by choice)
Peter is alone, but spider-man still have connection to people peter knows before.
Yes but those are Spider-Man not Peter. Shuri as a princess has the benefit of having this both interconnect. And on top of that still remember her outside the superhero stuff
I'm pretty sure Tony left a chore board up in the kitchen.   Cap had dishes.   Wanda had to vacuum.   Vision had to dust up on the highest shelves.
I say besides stopping threats they train keep watch for any remnants of super powered technology. I always get the feeling the Avengers kind of fill out S.H.I.E.L.D role in their absence
He get’s angry at coffee grounds in the sink. So it would make sense.
I love that idea. What do you think about Natasha?
She makes shitty pb&j sandwiches for the team
I thought Banner had cooking duties?  Maybe they did it together.
Beginning of endgame she’s got shitty pb&j sandwiches and offers one to Steve.  Banner is out at a diner or in his cabin on the beach, gettin drunk.
1. I hope Charles is shown to be a little self-righteous and arrogant in the MCU. He's not as extreme as Erik but he's not a goody two shoes either. Erik should be more complex too.  2. Something new with Wolverine could be interesting.  3. They can still split the groups between humans who are filled with pure hatred and envy and those who just don't understand and have legit concerns about super powerful humans who live next door and attend school with your kids.   4. Mutant with the power to de-age or he uses magic.  5. I agree.
These all sounds cool
I’m in on sinister…they also *have* to have gambit…honestly if they could make them look super dope, I’d be cool with a full sentinel themed dive …and for me, I don’t wanna see the Shi’ar —not yet at least.    I want extended background on guys the movies haven’t touched yet—cyclops back story, gambit, maybe night crawler…hell, Storm’s African roots/shadow king…but overall sinister is the big bad who’s set up over *multiple movies* where they really highlight and punch the anti mutant themes, and have the sentinels introduced then slowly, subsequently grow out of control over multiple movies also…the movie-over-movie “bad guy” is the mutant registration, the Trasks of the world, maybe Morlocks/Calisto stuff, omega red…but it’s a multi movie arch that’s setting up sinister, the sentinels getting out of hand as humanity’s weapon against mutants, and obviously the human-mutant schism …that’s my dream
First thing is that X men must be a story about discrimination and what discrimination does to the discriminated and to those doing the discriminating. Second I want "jerk" Xavier. 3rd I want the real Storm who has latent magic, is afraid of small spaces, and is a theif. I also want them to understand the dynamic between the characters. They need to understand Kurt is Wolverines best friend and drinking buddy. Understand how much Logan respects Storm and show the weird family dynamic between Rogue, kurt, and Raven. X men should be proudly "woke" in its themes and damn anybody who says different.
It's really easy to keep the themes of mutant prejudice and hate even if they aren't constantly around right now. They're popping up pretty sporadically right now so they just have to play up the "it could be your son/daughter/neighbour" aspect.  No multiverse necessary
I really hope they explore the LGBT parallels which is something the X2 did touch upon. Seeing Mutants treated the same sort of way the LGBT people are treated would make for a possible interesting turn for the characters.
I like a lot of your ideas and your points on the FOX Universe.... A big part for me is that Magento's Jewish heritage as a Holocaust survivor means a lot to me, so cool to know one of the biggest, scariest, most bad ass baddies could have been my Grandpa... Just brainstorming, but perhaps we could have a new story in which a Bishop or Cable or even Kitty Pride character has to do a Days of Future Past type jump to help save their future by bringing a younger Magneto and key X MEN into the future to defeat an army of sentinels or something, perhaps something goes wrong and creates an incursion which blends the X gene and young Magento and those in and around him at the time into a branch timeline that bleeds into the 616...  They can also write in some sort of "Ex Machina" that creates an awakening in the X gene in the 616 timeline.... so you would essential get your Magento from a Holocaust era, but still younger, in a new world along with a select first class of X MEN along with Kitty/Bishop/or Cable (whomever is the time jumper) in the modern 616....     The first story can be the outbreak of a new mutation that is occurring in youth across the planet along with some folks having strange reactions to certain medications or gamma type procedures. (X GENE awakening due to external factors)  Now the story can revolve around Magneto and the first class X MEN keeping hidden while they try to understand and help the new mutants who are awakening.... The story can center around the planetary panic as the governments start to quarantine and in extreme cases imprisoner the mutants who are awakening. There can be a huge divide between XMEN and Magento, which leads to him turning to recruitment of some of the more powerful and influential new mutants, and maybe even have him learn of the ESSEX organization that has emerged as the leaders in the Mutant Studies...... The film will be less of an action pack war between mutants and more like a Lord of the Rings style quest to learn the stakes, the world they are in, and encounter some enemies along the way. There could be a few really fun battles with young mutants who are just scared of their powers trying to fight off anyone that comes at them... and we can even have extreme governments involved in some battles... if you want to incorporate some of the greater MCU have something like Madrapore and the undergrown fighting ring involved... you can have a neat little throw back where we can see a Wolverine cameo, as he would be best reserved for a 2nd film that is much more small scale and X TEAM focused   Could be a neat tie in to maybe have one of the teams sent to "de-escalate" a situation be the Thunderbolts, have them get their ass kicked by a small team of recent mutated kids OR have them beating the hell out of the kids, only to have them get smashed by Cyclops and another X person.... would be a great way to cross over and show how strong Mutants are, especially those who have been trained.   There is a lot of ideas, I can keep going but I am going to stop as I doubt anyone will read all this anyway.,
Sadly, I think unlike Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four, Marvel Studios isn't going to reboot the X-Men characters i.e. recast Wolverine, Xavier, etc. with a new young cast in the MCU. If them already bringing back Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman and Ryan Reynolds is any inkling, they're gonna just multiverse in legacy characters and then introduce an X-Men of an entirely new characters in the MCU eventually.   Which is disappointing, but I feel inevitable.
Namor calls himself a mutant in BPWF
:D
They are absolutely going to recast at the appropriate time. Jackman isn’t going to stick around. He is doing Deadpool 3 as a favor to Ryan Reynolds.
Kevin Feige literally said that they don't want to recast certain characters though.
I'd say the good faith non-nitpicky ones hold up well as criticisms.
I'm pretty fucking tired of hearing everything in phase 4 sucked. It's like the internet has completely unified against marvel studios.   It's especially egregious with things like Moon Knight, which is a damn good fucking show.
That everything post-Endgame sucks
The people who say the mcu is not  cinema. If you don't like something or it's not for you, that's fine. Say that. But to go and bash something that someone else has worked on and bash the fans (directly or indirectly) isn't cool. I don't care who you are. I personally don't love horror movies. I'll watch one here or there, but it's not usually something I go for. But I don't jump online or interview with someone and belittle horror movies or the people that work on them or enjoy them. They're just usually not for me. I know people who will never see top gun maverick and I know people who that was their first movie in the theater in years. Just because some people don't like a movie or show doesn't make it any less valid than anything else it's just a difference in taste or opinion. Not right or wrong, just different.
I had fun with all of Phase 4. I also didn't expect perfection.
To the people who say phase 4 sucked and was terrible. My rebuttal is that what made a great superhero movie 10 years isn’t the what makes a great superhero today. Those standards is what make a superhero movie mid at best. People expect every superhero movie to be like endgame when that is not the case. If u go into a superhero movie with no expectations and to just enjoy it, you will actually enjoy it more
Phase 4 ain’t even that bad😆 it’s literally just Phase 1 again…. And even then those movies weren’t as Amazing as the internet wants y’all to believe. 💀 I was There day 1 for every single film of the MCU since Ironman and even then the public reception was that Incredible Hulk, Thor and Cap were poorly received. Even tho Ironman was a hit, I remember vividly how much people were still making fun of the idea of an Avengers team up movie. Cuz the forums and general public didn’t know or care about anything but Spider-Man back then. 🤷‍♀️the way all the bandwagon stand that join after infinity war act like Marvel was this Mega Phenomenon since the start ain’t true. I get people think the quality has dipped. It’s a fair and valid critic, but those that act like phase 1-3 was perfect cinema are doing way too much.
“I’m watching entertainment designed for children and I feel the need to defend it publicly. I am clearly a loser, don’t waste time critiquing these films because it’s all I have.”  Should shut most people up.
> able to give the kids powers. Somehow, the fact he needed Zeus's lightning bolt to do so   Thor gave powers to Jane long before visiting Zeus.  > figured out where Riri was, of course they couldn't retrieve her themselves. They turn blue  Namor isn't blue, and he also can fly at over 100 miles per hour.   Riri lives at MIT, which is 500 feet from the Charles River.  Since Namor was able to secretly travel all the way up the Wakanda river, he could have easily grabbed Riri himself if he knew where to look.  The only way that sequence can make sense is if Namor attached a hidden tracker to Shuri, so he was able to follow her to Riri.  But that's the kind of thing filmmakers would show happening, if they were aware of it.  For example, suppose the scene where Namor gives Shuri an antique bracelet was moved to earlier in the film, when they first meet. Planting a tracker could help explain why he wanted her to take a gift.
"Just have fun."
They have the dumb.
I don't think Love and Thunder actually had an unusually high amount of jokes. It just had lower quality jokes so people started noticing how hard the MCU in general tries to be funny. I'm sure Ragnorak had a similar amount of jokes, but since it didnt have a literal 10 year old meme in the form of screaming goats, people largely saw no issue.
WBN, Wakanda Forever, and GOTG Holiday Special all came out in the past six months and were all well-received but when Ant-Man disappoints people suddenly jump back to "everything has sucked lately".  DC has been experiencing the same thing for quite awhile now doesn't matter how many good movies they have, it's always "they need to get back on track".
MK is not good. It gets so much wrong about the disorder it tries to portray, while also devolving into typical sludge by the final episode.
The only show I thought was actually at the bottom was She-Hulk. Eternals and Thor had something to enjoy if you know how "fun" works. Most of everything else was pretty cool, at least as good as the early MCU that wasn't at the level of Endgame. And yes, Moon Knight was fucking sick! I understand complaints about changing him up too much, but I think they still focused a lot on what he was about. Some adaptations (Like Gotham Knights so far) just seem to throw random stuff on the wall.
I thought it was spotty and taking peoples opinions about a franchise as a personal attack is a bit much
Rebuttal, ALMOST everything in phase 4 sucked
Moon Knight fell off lmao.  It's got a few mcu highlights buried in the same awkward pacing and plotting issues that the rest of the Disney plus shows have.
That super solid run of absolute bangers from Civil War to Far From Home at the end of Phase 3 just raised the bar too high. I don't know how anything could ever compete with  that timespan of movies ramping up to a never-before-seen event like Endgame.  There are Phase 4 projects that are both better and worse than movies in all other phases.  Personally, I think one of Phase 3's darling movies, Ragnarok, has huge issues with jokes undercutting dramatic emotional beats and felt like a crazy person when everyone complained about the exact same thing in Love and Thunder.
Are you saying that's your rebuttal or the opinion you don't agree with?
It's not even just that, but Martin Scorsese saying he never watched them. Same with Bill Maher saying how superhero stories or comics are "for kids" or "aren't books." I mean, what subjective tastes am I supposed to have, picking up drunk women while drinking alcohol I don't like, pretending my job as a janitor is "Fun because responsibility," and beat off to my tax documents? Or maybe it's the 69th crime drama?
Even the worst shows to me weren't hard to watch.
I've been agreeing that Phase 4 is about as good as Phase 1, when people didn't even like Hulk, Thor 1, or Iron Man 2 as much, and I still enjoyed them.
I agree with comparing it with Phase 1. The only movies I remember actually getting praise were Iron Man 1 and Captain America 1, and I could still rewatch the worst movies and shows. They are overall fun in spite of lacking in other qualities.
As long as it's not implying "turn your brain off and enjoy," then I see nothing wrong with finding something to have fun with. Nothing is gonna be perfect anyway.
"But the woke agenda!" / sarcasm
I made a post recently asking why everyone is ignoring the great projects and only focusing on the bad ones but, unsurprisingly, I got mass downvoted and attacked for making that post.
I agree with all your points about the depiction of DID, but it's not a disease, its a disorder.
[it gets plenty right](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-moon-knight-gets-right-about-dissociative-identity-disorder-5248670)   The things it gets "wrong" are due to the need for dramatic suspense. Like if Marc, Steven and Jake were aware of each other, the show has no suspense whatsoever.
Where did *I* take it as a personal attack? I said I'm sick of seeing it.   The top post on r/Lego right now is someone who turned the Lego infinity gauntlet into a toilet and the comments are full of "how appropriate given the MCU now".   It's just rampant right now. Any place marvel might be discussed is followed with dumping on the entire MCU now.
the opinion I don't agree with
All the shows were well made and entertaining. She-Hulk gets the most hate from the neckbeards, but that's because they were accurate predicting, and making fun of, their very reaction to She-Hulk.   Anyone that knows the comic book version knows that it's pretty spot-on.
Gotcha, thx
So were just gonna [cherry pick articles](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-moon-knight-gets-wrong-about-dissociative-identity-disorder-5270502) to make your point?  The show crumbles under its wrong depiction of the disease. Steven coming out when the mom is about to beat him makes no sense. Steven becoming the primary makes no sense, he was created as a temporary escape. Jake makes no sense, the other personalities would know about him. Its completely backwards and the show would be better off if it just followed the disease more accurately.   I get they have to take liberties but it doesn’t work even with what they present in universe.
I mean, there have been a number of spotty entries into the MCU in the past few years. People aren't just saying these things out of nowhere. It's not their fault they think the MCU is going downhill.
Honestly, making fun of your fanbase rather than just making it a good show never made sense to me.
I said in my comment, the things it gets wrong are due to needing dramatic suspense.     If this is your hangup, then you were never going to be satisfied. Marc's DID is never accurate in the comics either. Writers need their characters to be unaware of what's going on in order tell a story.   Fight club, for example, wouldn't be a movie if the narrator is aware he's Tyler Durden the whole time.
>So were just gonna cherry pick articles to make your point?  How can you accuse someone else of cherry picking articles and then cherry pick an article that supports your stance?! lmfao
WTF are you talking about? It was a very funny show, which is what She-Hulk is supposed to be.
You didn’t read my comment. It would have made the show better if they had been more accurate. Disregarding the inaccuracies, what they present within the show itself makes no sense.
Because im not cherry picking, i actually gave examples to back up my argument. I just did that because the other commenter did it lol.
Based on the very article you sent, I disagree. If it were more accurate, none of the multiple personalities could be violent. Pretty funny when one of the loudest complaints of the show was that it wasn't violent enough.   It also says the multiple personalities should know each other. If they did, we have no suspense at all. Marc and Steven would be aware of what Khonshu is up to the entire time and we don't have a show.   The article says "Split", "Fight Club" and "Psycho" are guilty of all the things Moon Knight is. Are those all bad films, too? My heart goes out to those suffering from this IRL, but an actually 100% representation of it would have no action in it whatsoever. I simply cannot fathom how that would make for a better super hero show.
Every discussion like this always seems to lead to "You were wrong to hope for something better than what we got", it's tiring. You're totally right by the way.
Again, you didnt read my comment. I literally said that I understand they have to take some liberties. I just dont agree with the ones they took because they dont make sense in universe nor with the disorder they try to portray.  They could have literally held off showing Jake until the final episode, but they screwed up and made him show up earlier. They could have just given us a fight scene but they got lazy. The characters dont really acknowledge it after that. Its just poor writing regardless of whether its accurate or inaccurate (in this case, it is quote inaccurate).  Those films work better in universe, also they have nothing to do with what I said so idk why youre bringing them up. They still fall into stereotypes so yeah, maybe they are bad films in terms of representation. They still make more sense than Moon Knight.
The accords weren't about secret identities. There was no rule requiring the heroes to unmask, only to register with the authorities. Spider-man would have registered as Spider-Man.   Never understood why Spidey having tech is an issue.
You ain't wrong, but it won't be popular here.
It's almost like the point of civil war was Tony rushing into something to appease his guilt that he clearly doesn't follow himself.
You have no idea what you are talking about. Sokovia Accords were absolutely about secret identities. Spider-man would have to get registered by his legal name Peter Parker. He would have to provide his fingerprints and a sample of his DNA. They mention this in the movie. Look it up.  So realistically, Spider-man would never support any side thats pro Sokovia Accords.  Spidey having Iron Man tech just cheapens the character. It is not something I am willing to spare the time to explain.
Tony's motivations are irrelevant, at least when it comes to Spider-man's side of things.
They aren't though? Tony did a Tony and wanted to be the one to bring in a secret weapon even though it made him a complete hypocrite
It is irrelevant for Peter Parker, who wouldn't want to side with him on this issue.
It's 100% relevant. Yes Tony's a hypocrite for it but that's literally the point of the film that his need for retribution clouded his judgement
You don't seem to get it. This isn't about Tony. Fighting on Tony's side goes against Peter's interests. Your argument is based on Tony's reasoning and judgement on the film, which is irrelevant as to what would Spider-man would do in that situation.  Would you fight on someone's side knowing full well end result would be your secrets are revealed and your loved one would be in danger because of it?
the sokovia accords has never had the secret identity aspect that the comics registration act had. it was more about shield telling them when they could take on missions i don't think they ever said anything about secret identities
Again, you have no idea what you are talking about. Have you even watched the movie? Sokovia Accords has nothing to do with Shield. Secret identities were a part of it.
bro don't know why you feel the need to be so aggro about this, ok i said shield when I meant the government my bad i guess but I don't see how that changes the point, literally when did they ever make mention of secret identities in the film, spiderman is basically the only mcu character that even had a secret identity at that point and pretty sure we never see anyone other tony know who he is
