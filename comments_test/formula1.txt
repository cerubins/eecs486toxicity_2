0/10
Compared to other drivers? A bit sad  Compared with the rest of the planet earth? Brother is livin’ da life wtf u guys taking about he’s gucci
Not at all
He surprised RB by jumping to Renault and running from a fight, then didn’t keep his word to Renault. Because he’s always smiling and laughing he wins the popularity contest but he’s not loyal and he paid the price while banking millions. 1/10.
Bad boy multi millionaire got to live out his dream and still on easy street doing cool stuff still making millions. Fun, sun, cool cars, travel, low stress. I’m kinda jealous.   I feel 2/10 bad for him, because it must be awful suddenly having the emptiness for something he was laser focused on all his life.
I don’t.  F1 is cutthroat
He has earned more than £30mil per year for the past 4 years of his life. I don’t feel bad for him at all.  That being said, I think F1 would be better off if he found a seat. Felling bad for a guy like that is laughable though.
Don’t feel bad at all. He’s making a killing while having a blast doing fun shit.
He just got paid what’s thought to be $20,000,000 to leave a team that has a shit box of a car, to join a team he use to win races with, getting paid even more on top of that, getting advertising deals, getting to stay home more often, traveling the states, doing sim work for RB, reserve driver in case anything happens to checo or max in the fastest car on the grid which he would have a massive shot of winning a race, and he’s in prime position to take the seat of checo if him and RB start to have issues which it seams like they might. I’d say he is doing life 10/10 right now. Yea it would be nice to be on the grid, but he’s getting paid to relax and be the same person he’s always been. I wouldn’t be surprised if he is driving for RB in 24 or 25.
None! He made his own choices.
Not bad at all.
LOL. He seems to be living his best life right now.
I think he’s a dumbass for not even trying to get a non oval (street and road course only) deal in indycar and stay in single seaters if he wishes to get back to f1
No. He didn’t perform at 3 different teams so his fate in F1 is his fate. That said, I do empathize with him…but he lived the dream.
Considering how McLaren are doing so far, I feel kind of happy for him. I know all drivers want to be in a car but he’s getting a payday and he gets to relax a bit. Hopefully he gets a driver for next year.
Was he dropped by McLaren unfairly? No  Was he not paid his salary? No  Does he have the gall to think he'll ONLY return with a top team? Yes.  Do I feel bad for him? No.
Dan made some poor choices and suffered the consequences. He was slightly bamboozled along the way but it seems like he takes responsibility. Maybe a 3/10, he’s talented and could of done better if he made different choices. He’s made the best of his situation and doesn’t expect us to feel bad for him, so I have a large amount of respect for the guy.
How bad do I feel for an F1 spokesman/ part time driver/ test driver/ celebrity who is being paid well for doing very little?  Yeah- I don't feel bad for him at all.  He is doing just fine and has a far better life than I ever will.
To see all of the RB Press Photos he's been in lately, and all the Internet pics of him alongside Sergio and Max, you'd think RB is a 3-car team
He got his bags while he could. He will be fine.
I empathize with any driver that doesn’t leave by choice, DR perhaps moreso because he was one of the best drivers on the grid for a while.  These guys spend their lives chasing the dream, they are all competitive as hell, and it’s a big mental health hit to be forced out of a seat.  Yes, it’s easy to say DR made some bad career moves, but you know he burns inside when he’s in the paddock on race weekends yet not in a seat on the grid.
I am sure he is feeling empty like me when my girlfriend broke up with me. I am sure with time, it will get better. But I am sure the emptiness is real even if you get paid millions.  How bad I feel for him for his career and future? None  How bad I feel for him because of where he ended up despite where he was some years ago? 10/10
There’s far more people on this planet that deserve sympathy over this millionaire
He's a multi-millionaire, did decent in the world's most premier motorsport event, and has millions of followers. Nobody needs to feel bad for him lol.
How's he a bad boy? Nothing about Daniel is threatening or controversial
But ever since he left RB, it's going downwards for him. And he won't be considered at a team battling for podiums, and the other teams don't suit him well.i think he's pretty much done in F1 as one of the 20.
Yeah they’re really trying to make “3rd driver” seem like a legit thing lol.

There's nowhere for him to go in the top 5 teams, they are set on their lineups. Only way he gets into RB is if there's a performance clause in Perez's contract that he doesn't meet
Ah, yes, a discussion about DR's future  Clearly people here never [overrate his prospects](https://old.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/wfnhk8/daniel_ricciardo_is_in_a_great_position/) and can stay objective  Teams will surely fall over themselves to sign someone for 2024 who will turn 35 with his last good season in 2020
WRC, WEC, Indycar, NASCAR, DTM, Podcasting.  Love Ricciardo but it’s over unless someone gets hurt.
He’s got the best job on earth right now, still going to every race and making goofy shit for RB’s Instagram without any pressure to perform? Sign me up, I’ll do that.
By and large, I think his time in the sun has ended. He's a big name, a good personality, and is excellent publicity for Red Bull. He had a career most can only dream of, even if he didn't fulfill his dream of winning a WDC.    As a driver, I believe he's heavily overrated for beating a rookie Max and two very midfield drivers in Hulk and Ocon (who was coming back after 18 months off). He got soundly beaten by a slightly more mature Max and then absolutely soulbatteringly crushed by Lando at McLaren.   If he is going to make a return, it's going to be at a backmarker team that uses him for the publicity and the money he brings in. Think Haas, or Alfa Romeo. But he's said publicly that he only wants to race for a contender, and fat chance any of the current top 5 are going to bite on a 35 year old 3 years removed from his last good season. Better to take a chance on a rookie, or try and buy one of the 2nd drivers away from Ferrari/Merc/RB.
What are they talking about -- he dropped a "broad hint" that he is "ready to return" to F1 in 2024?  Fucking hell -- he was ready in 2023, but couldn't catch a ride.  I like Danny Ric -- and think he's better than at least 5 or 6 (maybe more) of the drivers out there right now.  But, the media B.S. of "he's ready for a return" drives me nuts.  Honestly, although Lance Stroll is doing way better than a lot of people give him credit for, I'd love to see Daniel Ricciardo up with Alonso this year -- I think it would make for a hell of a spectacle.
I wonder if Ricciardo could act as a super sub like Hulkenburg last year.  Especially if Gasly takes another penalty soon.
Well, it's way too soon to tell, but Haas might be an option if he lowered his price. A high price made sense last year, because many suspected that McLaren would have to pay him less (or possibly none) if he got a seat elsewhere. Next year, if a Haas seat opened up, that wouldn't be a factor. But, both drivers have points right now, and he'd have to deal with Guenther. I don't really think that highly of his chances elsewhere though. Haas feels burned on young drivers (unless they come with a big paycheck), so he makes the most sense there. Unless he's really impressing on the sim. And he has a tire test coming up at some point. I mean, they could throw him on AlphaTauri for a year if they wanted to and just see what happens. Red Bull has done crazier things. They've also used their junior team somewhat inconsistently and fired drivers whenever they felt like and demoted drivers back and kept them there so... who knows for sure.
Haas wanted Hulkenberg when he hadn't had a full-time seat since 2019, and he doesn't exactly have many accolades to his name. And got beaten by Ricciardo in his last season.
Particularly at his price
I thought for a second that said podracing.
I don’t even think he goes to every race, just when there’s promo driving involved. Pretty sure Australia was his first race and probably Miami will be his next.
Yeah but you aren't a racing driver.  You can bet its a pain in the ass for Ricciardo to turn up at every race and just watch. All the hassle of being away from family and friends. Having to do a load of PR work. Come race day, you are standing in the garage with a pair of headphones on.
Fans have so much false hope for Danny, and I like him as well. However, its VERY unlikely a top team will ever give him a shot again.  And yes, Lance is hated on because of his dad's money. Hes much better than given credit for though.  The pole position in Turkey proves that. He will consistently finish top 5/6 this year. Look how well he's done with broken wrists and no testing
The big difference between them (which many people seem to ignore when making this comparison) is the fact that Hulkenberg was willing to drive for Haas in order to make it back onto the grid. Daniel has made it fairly clear that he isn’t interested in driving for a backmarker team and unless he changes his mindset in that regard it’s very unlikely that he will return.
Beggars can't be choosers, if the drive is there I think he'll change the decision
Agreed on every single point!!!
He literally has only beaten a single team mate over the course of a full season, and that was Sirotkin...   I swear, Lance will go 0-23 vs Alonso this year, and people will still be saying "he's doing better than people give him credit for." Brother, I can't think of a driver that has this consistently been behind ALL of their team mates yet still stays in F1.
Tbf if Lance was a junior of Red Bull or Ferrari he would not last long. Max 2-3 years.
I think he eventually will lol, unless he gets Checo's seat, he will only be able to join backmarkers and I think if he wants to get back into F1 enough he'll accept it.
Steiner has said Daniel's price was just too high. It isn't that he isn't interested in driving for Haas, otherwise he wouldn't have been talking to them.  What he needs to change is his price tag.
 > I can't think of a driver that has this consistently been behind ALL of their team mates yet still stays in F1.  This what we call a nepotism.
Nepotism is one helluva drug.

Fast driver in a fast car
Max is a fast boi in a fast car
The car is clearly fast. But also he's able to get the absolute most out of the car compared to Checo. Similiar to the 2020 season. Lewis was winning by 20+ seconds sometimes while Bottas was a distant 2nd. A fast car is a fast car, but ultimately the driver makes the difference.
Not only is he the fastest driver in the fastest car, he is incredibly adept at working with his engineers to get the most out of it.  He knows his car, and it's kinda funny how often he'll nonchalantly radio to his engineers after setting a blazing lap 'hey guys, adjust such and so and I can shave 2/10ths off X sector' while the rest of the grid is losing grip all over the place.
Its not even his final form, in Australia he was going so soft on the car that he was running into tire temperature issues, meanwhile in quali he was able to get the tires up to temperature within the outlap while other teams took the outlap + 1 more lap.
He is one of if not the best drivers on the gird. He is in the best car.  Those two things allow him to win pole.  Combining my first point with the pole he can pull away from everyone with the clean air he has
How the fuck are reddit casuals gonna answer this  When all the F1 teams with their engineers can't figure it out.   Joke
Were you born the night before Bahrain?
They sandbagging - he’d be finishing full minute ahead if he actually pushed.
He can pull way more than a 10 second lead, if I had to guess, had the race been normal in Australia, he could have been a good 40-50 seconds ahead of Lewis.  Why? He's incredibly talented, and he has an insanely good car, with incredible downforce and amazing aero.  Where as one team might have really good top speed, or one team might have great speed in low speed corners, the RedBull is just good at everything.  People compare it to the Mercedes of 2014, but I don't think it's comparable. The Mercedes just had a monster of an engine, so much so they had to turn it down because it was embarrassing.  But the RedBull is just so good everywhere that there's no one thing that makes it great.  And when you put the best driver on the grid in it, he's going to destroy everyone.
The car is 95% of the performance. The left over 5% decides the inter-team battle. RB is just that much faster.
1) Max  2) RB19  You pick the order between those two.  Even with out RB19, Max is a fricking machine.  I'd love to see what he could do in one of the midfield machines.  He'd put Norris, Russell, etc. to shame.  I don't know why he is so good, but it feels like he was absolutely born to do this.  I feel like he barely has to try to be so good.  Edit:  If you put Max, Hamilton, and Alonso in identical cars, I'd root for Alonso, but I still think Max would edge them out.  He's unbelievable.  It is like watching AI drive a car.
Max go zoom zoom.
The car was built for him, not checo, so Max should be somewhat faster. But, holy hell, he seems way faster. Alonso or maybe Hamilton could possibly compete with Max in that car. Nobody else IMO. I'm not a RB fan but I won't claim they've cheated bc of the budget cap issue. It's just a damn well engineered car driven by a top tier driver (who happens to be abrasive).
Max is a better driver and Redbull built the car to suit Max not Checo. I think most teams could build the "fastest car" on paper but having a team/driver that can get the most out of it is another thing all together. Take Mercedes obviously on paper it is fast and that's why the kept the same concept, but can the team/driver actually consistently work with the car? Last year they would have a couple of horrible races and then one good race where the car works. Hopefully it's different this year, but I have my doubts.
Huh?
A 10 second lead is putting it lightly. In the last race he passed Hamilton and built a 2.5 second lead in one lap. Sure he maintained the lead at 10 seconds but even when he ran off track, he dropped 5 seconds and gained it ba k in 2 laps.   I think Max could win by a minute or more if he pushed all race.
The RB is a fast low drag car for any driver + The RB is built for Max = Max is uber quick in a RB.  = Ferrari tears
Lol, but has anyone found anything about the RB that makes its performance dwarf the other teams?
So true. As he and Perez have the same car but different setups so wild. Max does make the difference he is the better driver. I wonder if anyone will find out and try to copy RBs design before the season is over?
That's my point. He is not even using his full potential. If he does. What are we gonna see for example   Max wins say Canada GP  with a 35-second lead. If I was another team I'm planning for next year if RB is pulling out 20 second plus wins.
No what's that supposed to mean?
🎯🎯🎯 I believe that. Why not sandbag and save the engine..with the penalties you get for engine changes.
True Mercedes had a monster engine in 2014 but they also had great aero & a good chasis. I don’t think its accurate to credit all their success on the engine
Yes, it's almost embarrassing. before K Mag lost his tire. He had a comfortable 10-second lead over Hamilton. It's not even fair. With Max driving talent. You give him a competent car. Call. me in the morning the race is over lol
Have you seen him compete in other arenas?  He dominates even when his car (or virtual car) isn't the best, or is at least the same as others.  He is on another level from any driver in F1 before him.
Still hard to tell how Max would perform with other top drivers. He has still yet to have a tier 1 teammate. But we have data from Hamilton and Alonso and how they perform with tough teammates.
Nah Hamilton would just ram them both off!  /runs away
He does have the talent for it. He's a natural to racing like how Lebron is to basketball, and Ronaldo is to soccer.
Teams building cars around one driver is a myth. They design what they think is fastest taking into account feedback from their drivers where convenient/necessary. It can happen that their theoretical fastest suits one driver much better than the other, but it's never their first consideration.
This is such nonsense, I don’t know why people keep saying this?? You don’t build a car around a driver and when that driver is Max Verstappen *you don’t need to*. You design the car to go fast within the rules and restrictions and the driver works out what to do with it. Check out Scott Mansell’s video of Alonso *forcing understeer* in his Renault or any of the videos about Senna jamming the throttle to keep his turbo pressure up. A capable driver figures out how to get the best out of a car and whether people like him or not Max is a very capable driver.
No one's quite sure how but I think the general consensus is that they somehow generate wayyy less drag than everyone else. So they are way faster than everyone on the straights, while also having really great performance in the corners.
Obviously, if it's one thing, every team would copy it. And it's worth pointing out that the differences are in fact very small, just not in the context of F1.  All the teams try to design a car that's very fast. Red Bull has managed to design a car that's fast in the straits but has enough downforce in fast corners to be fast there as well.  So it comes down to aerodynamical and suspension. Plus a powerful engine of course.  As for Max, he's just better than most. The best drivers don't lose unnecessary time in corners.  Some people have analyzed what he does differently, but the most impressive thing is that he can a adapt his driving style to the car and the track.
RB went with aggressive anti dive anti squat suspension. Allows them to get the car as close to ground as possible and maximize aero potential. There’s a video that just came out about it
I’m sure teams have a rough idea of where the RB gains its advantage (combination of the floor and rear suspension) at this point but they neither have the budget nor the wind tunnel time to tackle the issue and catch up. There’s also regulations preventing other teams from flat out copying RB so it’ll take this season or several seasons for other teams to catch up as changing either the floor or rear suspension changes the overall geometry of the car.   It’s hard to say who will catch up as their closest competitors have their own unique set of issues. The Mercedes is conceptually wrong and will require a complete rework.   The Ferrari, while conceptually correct, seems to have a lower ceiling and will also need to be reworked.   The Aston Martin is aerodynamically solid but they purchase the rear suspension and gearbox from Mercedes. For AM to even consider approaching RB, they would need to rework the rear suspension which would require reworking the gearbox and I suspect that’s beyond their capabilities at the moment.
If someone knew this, they wouldn't be on reddit, rather they'd be trying to get hired by RB's rivals.
Driver61 reckons it’s the floor.
If the FIA is consistent with Racing Point in 2020 that would be illegal
The powers that be will continue the trend of the past where if a team is too far ahead of the pack, they will look to use the rules to cut the advantage.  It happened to Williams, it happened to Mercedes twice, it happened to Red Bull in the past, it’ll happen again.   At that point all of this Superman talk will relax a bit.
That's how F1 used to be. Watch 1994 for instance, some days Schumi just laps the entire field like he did in Brazil. In 2002 he would lap pretty much everyone up to like 4th place regularly and pull out 30 second leads with ease.
Awww Ferrari boys
Max has been showing this kind of potential for years.... He just didn't have the machinery because the Mercedes was too fast. Everyone knew the moment that Max got a car that the average F1 driver could compete for wins in would be when Max's championship domination started. It's been obvious ever since he debuted at 17 what the future was. It was probably obvious to people who watched him in F3 what the future was going to bring.
No. Max wouldn't win in the second best car. He would get as close as Alonso does in AM.
Hah -- nice.
You had me until Lebron.  :-(
Would make sense, Neweys entire mind is a wind tunnel
Link?
The issue with Racing Point wasn't them copying, copying is explicitly legal. The problem was them using the *literal designs for Mercedes' brake ducts* to create *exactly* the W10's brake ducts. They had the designs because prior to 2020, the brake ducts were a purchasable part. They were punished because they didn't elect to use the brake duct designs they legally purchased from Merc in 2019, but decided to in 2020, the first year they were forced to design their own. If they had used them in 2019 as well, it would've been legal for them to use them in 2020.  Copying is the name of the game in F1.
I saw him in his first year in F1. I knew he was not going to flash out and fail in F1. Even with the slower cars back then he was getting the most of out them. Now RB has given him a top car. Pray for the rest of the field lol
Messi to soccer? Lol
Yes, but the only reason the fia launched investigations and were itching to give a penalty was because the were so close to the merc
If I knew anything about soccer other than players taking flops, I might understand.  I'm just messing with you.  Messi is incredible, and Lebron is other than being a complete ass with his politics.  Play the f-ing sport man, do what you do, and stay out of the other shit.  That's just my opinion of course.
Messi = more talent but also a lot of hard work,   Ronaldo = more hard work but also a lot of talent.
I hear you. I only mentioned Ronaldo/Messi as a comparison to Max. As he's a natural champion. Like them and Lebron.
Ok.  We're brothers.  Except for Lebron.  He's an ass.  Ok, some people say Max is an ass.  But Max > Lebron.  In my world anyway.  Wait, there was a golf tournament today.  Gotta go see what's up with that!

Now to find DNA and combine them to create a great driver
If you buy records, you have to play them.  If you buy shoes, you have to wear them.  If you buy F1 racing gear, you need to DoorDash
Nice collection  Out of curiosity I looked up Daniel Ricciardo race worn boots - $4k and that’s without the schoey
The list of things I wouldn’t do for those JPM gloves is very, very small—almost nonexistent.
Put them all on and you become Juan Marcarlo Fisitoyber
How much was the helmet?
This mf is building exodia
Do you ever just walk around the house wearing the helmet?
Awesome. Nice haul.
I love those early puma suits with the thick epaulettes
Really nice!
Where did you get the JPM gloves!
Whats the O+ on the belt is that his blood type lmao
Neat collection OP! Did you purchase these online?
Cool gear! That's a Frankenstein's monster I'd like to see race, haha!
Nice for getting all race-used!  I really prefer those over the replicas!
Now this is some merch I’m properly jealous of, Fisi was my favourite. Very nice!
do you know which races?
KewL
With your powers combined,  I AM CAPTAIN PLANET
To genetically engineer the ultimate number 2 driver?
Gianpablo Webtoya
It's in the sweat baby, sweat.
Yes lollilolololollo
I got my dad a signed model of his 1999 CART Reynard a few years ago and it’s still one of my proudest eBay finds.
Ok what about paying 10 grand
Helmet was around 6,000 USD
I have tried it on. Fisichella either has a small head or I’ve got a giant melon head
I know another collector based in Germany that had them available.
Yes, used to be a very standard thing to put on a racing suit. Of course it's a bit redundant these days in formula 1 (because the drivers are well known and documented by the medical staff), but for smaller events it comes in handy when there is an emergency requiring a blood transfusion ASAP.
It might actually be, I’m not 100% sure. I know for a while drivers had to have their blood type somewhere on their kit. I’d imagine now all that info is stored somewhere that track doctors and officials can access it easily
Not OP, but he posted this comment elsewhere regarding the JPM gloves -  > I know another collector based in Germany that had them available.
Gloves and suit not sure. Working on photo matching the helmet currently. After only a little looking, maybe Monaco and or Bahrain.
I know you are kinda being facetious... But on a serious note, would you really say that Montoya was the number 2 driver when he was at Williams with Ralf?
Athlete sweat
That wouldn’t be a dealbreaker necessarily.
How much was the suit
It can be both melon head
People talk like here was chasms between them. Ralf and Montoya are more of a Rosberg Hamilton than a Hamilton Bottas

I think us hardcore F1 fans should temper our expectations for this film. It's probably going to be a movie with racing, not a movie about racing.
If Ron Dennis plays Ron Dennis, then this movie will win an Oscar.
Brad Pitt starring as Fernando Alonso in “GP2 Engine: It’s a Yoke”
That tweet is almost the platonic ideal of clickbait, because the movie isn't actually going to be about Lewis' career and the description 'star as an f1 driver' is beautifully vague.  Every single response is assuming it's about Ham instead of being an original story.
***Driven 2*** *Finish First*
IDRIS? He knows the effect he has on women  Joking different Idris but I love his name
Can’t wait for the Josh revel video on this film
F1 is pretty film-worthy in many aspects. I’m looking forward to this
It's definitely loosely inspired on his career. I mean, it seems like the main character dynamic will be between this young driver and an older one that kind of mentors him. Lewis didn't had anyone like that when starting his career. Unless Brad Pitt plays the ghost of Ayrton Senna talking with Hamilton at the end of the Monaco tunnel.
**LH:** And the film ends with him winning his 8th Driver's World Championship.  **JK:** Um, Lewis? The script says it's his 7th-  **LH:** I know what I said, *Joe!*
Gonna hold expectations of it, but I’ll be hopeful of it because of Rush, speaking of, I gotta rewatch Rush. Absolutely fantastic movie, robbed of some Oscars.
F1 version of Days of Thunder?
*Manipulated: An Abu Dhabi Story*
I just hope it's not a story about the whole of F1 being against him or some shit, I can just see it though
[Angelina Jolie Details Abuse Allegations Against Brad Pitt in Countersuit](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/04/movies/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-lawsuit.html)
This will certainly be less dogshit than Driven.  Just how much less remains to be seen. Sadly my confidence is not high.
Brad is playing Alonso?
So who's playing Nico Roseburg?
[removed]
They got me in the first half not gonna lie.
woow!  Kiddo is getting roles. Hope he does us well representing the living icon LH44.
Ok but how many quarters can he collect on his tires?!!
i love this. i expect downvotes for saying this but the idea of a dark skinned Black man as an f1 driver is a dream.   i’m not saying anything about lewis at all, but making a movie about it with Damson as the focus is a really good way to play up an ideal of what it could look like.   lewis is bi racial (he’s Black none the less) but him making a movie and casting Damson as the lead is an intentional choice that showcases he’s really on the pulse.   there is a lot of nuance in this, but idk this is a really good thing to me, a dark skinned Black fan of F1.
Sports movies are generally crap but interested to see how this goes.  Says a lot that the only car racing fictional films I’ve ever enjoyed is Cars 1… it wasn’t really even about racing either
Why does Leiws get referred to as Sir Lewis all the time but no one uses Max's knighthood when referring to him?
Vettel to play Toto.
The Lewis thirst traps in that twitter thread 🥵
Dam son
I feel like a movie about Kimi Raikkonen would be much more exciting.
There won’t be any racing in it, it’s a film about F1.
I think so too, I do think Lewis is putting effort into getting certain details right, he was asked about casting in a presser and he was kind of cagey but he made clear the effort to get someone right was extensive. If nothing else Lewis really cares about the project enough to make casting details and probably others look right and be right
Even as a massive fan of F1, my expectations for a movie "with racing" will always be considerably higher than one "about racing".  Good movies tend to be about people, not technical details and the FIA rulebook.
I'm sure audiences would be riveted by in-depth discussion of brake differential and which midfield driver will benefit the most from a four car DRS train
All I need is an F1 version of Top Gun Maverick and I’m golden. Give me that visceral feel and I’m sold. Plot can be junk, but it won’t be.
Movie racing is usually so godawful, I'll be grateful. Just endless gear shifts.
Kosinski is really good with special effects tho
Just like how his song with Christina Aguilera wasn’t really music?
I mean, it'll be like this season then?
Like Drive to Survive
"Well, if I were to play myself in a film, which I must say is highly unlikely given my schedule, I believe it would be an award-winning performance. You see, acting is not so different from running a successful Formula One team. Both require precision, discipline, and a relentless pursuit of excellence. And as someone who has spent his entire career in the fast lane, I am no stranger to the pressure and demands of performing at the highest level. So, if given the opportunity, I have no doubt that I could bring a level of authenticity and gravitas to the role that would leave the Academy no choice but to hand me that coveted golden statuette." ~ Ron probably
Still we rise.
I was like, “damn, son! Idris will star as an F1 driver…”
r/unexpectedoffice
Id still watch this what's wrong with me
Don't give them any ideas. They would probably actually do this
It's actually an older retired Hamilton, mentoring the younger hotshot Hamilton who just joined F1.
Weird comment to make, given the things Hamilton has gone through in his early career.  Edit: And, as always, do yourself a favour and actually read before commenting. The character inspired by Lewis will not be the lead role.
Why not tho? I mean cliche af but it's been used all the time for a reason
Half the movie will be about his earrings
I wish he would step back from on screen parts, we aren't trying to see all that
The plot description floating around sounds disquietingly like Driven.
No he's playing Anthony Hamilton.
Rosberg
Somebody who's good doing evil characters, like Jack Gleeson
Was this necessary my guy?
the movie is going to suck anyway
This is ringing in the back of my mind, when I saw the headline. Could only hope it's not true. If it is, yikes
Working title: The 2021 Belgian GP
Oof
Toto we went acting
Especially if it's about LH, he didn't really race much once he got to Merc. He just drove a car while other people drove their cars behind him.
Yup. From the article this Tweet is based on (which mentions nothing about it being based on Lewis's life story. Tweet is wrong), they made them do driving tests.  >Producers have been meeting with prospects for the role going all the way back to November, with Kosinski, Bruckheimer and Apple execs seeing dozens of actors. At the top of the year the lists were cut down to a handful of actors, with Idris making the final cut. Besides doing a number of screen tests, actors also had to show they had the goods to handle the film’s intense driving scenes and were put through a number of driving tests in January.
I would love a movie where Sam Collins intersects explaining how the car works or the rules.
OH, YOU'RE NEXT TO THE GUY YOU ARE RACING, JUST PUSH THE PEDAL DOWN MORE AND BEAT HIM, OBVIOUSLY!
Movie racing has never been produced by someone sitting in the cockpit before, it should be interesting to see what he contributes
“Ron, we’ve done 748 takes, why do we need to do another?”  “A piece of paper was misaligned by 0.13 degrees. It was unacceptable”
You are now a moderator of r/RonDennis
Excellent!
I genuinely am not sure whether this is an actual Ron Dennis quote or not.
I love Idris, but he's too old, the way Brad Pitt is too old to be a driver too.
Nothing. It's a movie about a thing we all share such a strong passion towards so most of us would enjoy it. Unless it gets basics wrong which would put off most fans. If it's half as good as rush or Ford v Ferrari, I'd be happy.
Hottest prospect on the grid dropped into a championship winning car…yikes
Because I hope it’s more about F1 rather than using F1 as a background for a story about injustice or whatever. Could still be a good film I just hope for something more F1 focused. edit: and not a LH biopic
Jack Gleeson has quit acting iirc.
Outrage addicts. They can't help themselves.
What did he write?
#stillweponcho
People are taking details and running with inaccurate stories hard. I feel like they just saw a young black actor and went "it's Lewis" when it's never been stated it's his story beyond his attachment as a producer.   I don't get the impression Lewis is being pushed around or is only there as a name, he seems invested enough to try to do his sport justice, people are so quick to jump on anything involving this man to discredit it, and it's still in production stages.   Curiously I remember Sir Lewis saying he watches movies involving cars and racing and saying "oh it's not like that at all" and picking apart the errors so I'm very interested how accurate it is.
Gear shifting intensifies.
Are you auditioning for the Will Buxton role?
Kosinski also did a fantastic job showcasing the speed and capability of the jets in Top Gun, using a mix of real footage and CGI that you couldn't tell wasn't real. I won't hold my breath, but I think it has potential!
Steve McQueen made a Le Mans movie in the 70s. The racing in that one felt legit. And to be honest the racing scenes in Rush were still pretty good.
Going full blast down the straight - downshift!
Did you just bump the camera? Now it's out of alignment and we will have to reshoot the entire movie.
I was too young to truly enjoy RonSpeak as it happened!
Rush is great, Daniel Brühl did an incredible job on Niki Lauda you couldn't ask for more
Not conveniently, the other hot driver Kimi fucked off to Ferrari and Alonso was the 2x champion with all the actual heat and hype behind him. There was zero reason for McLaren to do a Hollywood style massive launch in Valencia unless Alonso was their guy
Conveniently forgot the press labelling him “ghetto” and fans showing up in gorilla costumes in the late 2000s, right?
It's obviously not an LH biopic. The main story is a rookie enters F1 and a seasoned legend (Brad Pitt) comes out of retirement to help him. That is not Lewis' story, but I'd guess there will be a bit about the only black driver in F1.  Lewis said he wants the racing to look real but he also said the film will pull on fans heartstrings. It's produced by people who make blockbusters so I kinda think it's gonna have typical movie tropes, surrounded by F1.
Every movie uses a background to tell a story about something else. Or do you think Top Gun is a documentary about semi naked beach volley players that occasionally dogfight on their jets?
I mean I'm down for an LH biopic, but as a hardcore fan that would be kinda boring lol. Maybe they'll make something good happen.
Something about Angelina Jolie alleging abuse by Bratt Pitt.
Yeah, it's a movie about Wehrlein, definitely
Yeah, I thought Rush racing was great, was a little over the top but that's to be expected.  Racing doesn't look that exciting from inside the cockpit, so you have to amp up the drama a little.
LeMans and Grand Prix are about as legit as you can get because they ran the real courses with the real race cars and drivers. Graham ~~Chapman~~ Hill even gets a couple lines in Grand Prix. LeMans used a lot of footage from the actual race that year as well.  Rush used real cars but only filmed at Brands Hatch and a little bit at Nurburgring I think.
Don't forget about the people painting their faces black as well
So.. like Driven with Stallone?
Yeah basically exactly what I don’t want lol. But I hope it I can be a good ambassador for F1
Tom Cruise described Top Gun as ‘a love letter a aviation’ And it was at the forefront of that movie rather than ‘occasional’ as you put it. I hope it is the same philosophy for this movie. I’m not sure why that’s a problem for you, you condescending James Hunt.
That’s a good point actually. I want either an actual faithful Lewis biopic OR a film that does justice to F1. Not one that tries to do both.
Wait? Which part if Lewis career is boring because dam that 2007-2016 period be wild
Or it's a fictional movie?  They say it “follows \[Brad\] Pitt playing a racer who comes out of retirement to mentor a younger driver and take his final stab at glory on the track as the younger driver’s teammate.”  This didn't happen to Hamilton. We're already in fictional territory and we know one sentence about it.
Graham Chapman? The one from Monty Python? Or did you mix up Graham Hill and Colin Chapman?
Sounds like Cars to me.
If you want a movie that’s just racing, then go watch a race.   Even Rush and Ford v Ferrari were far more than just racing
I'd describe it as military psyops but that's just me. The Airforce knew what they had In giving the Hollywood go ahead to a movie like that. Probably didn't predict how amazing the soundtrack would be but they knew enough to give that much cooperation
I just rather have a good movie than some generic F1 content. Not saying it can't be great like Grand Prix was and I guess that would fit your taste better. We just like different things in movies my friend. I'd prefer if it focus on the characters as I can watch the races to have anything F1 focused.
Apple is also producing a documentary about about Lewis. Content/themes in a documentary vs. feature film is world's apart.
No I mean we already have seen everything. Like the career itself is the movie. We don't need a film recounting it all.  But would I be down for one? Absolutely. I just think there are more creative things they could do.
LOL, yes I did. Graham **HILL** gets a couple lines.
To be fair Cars set a really high standard for car movies
When did I say ‘I want a movie that’s just racing’?
The US Air Force had nothing to do with Top Gun. It was the Navy’s showpiece
Whose we because plenty of people haven't. The audience for movies is bigger than "F1 fans on Reddit"
If it's navy why is it planes!!!! Boats can't fly Siggi /s
You could have stopped without that last reply. But thanks for letting me know.
That is true. I was just stating my opinion.
Planes ARE boats. That’s why the sky is blue like the sea.
Fair. Sorry about that.
I get you bruv we have seen it all, probably not worth it unless Lewis tells the behind the scenes

I think its a good point. A lot of people are saying Norris should jump to Mercedes, and it's true, they're clearly still strong, but _no one_ is a match for RB at the moment, so it's a difficult time all around for any team that isn't Red Bull.
memers here can laugh here  all they want, but what he is says is true, its hard. you need all the right gear to click at the right time, but all in all its more important to turn up to race day. Maclaren are still going at it, for that I cheer!
TLDR: McLaren is struggling but people shouldn’t care because Mercedes is struggling too after such a dominant period.
Mercedes had the second fastest car in Australia and were running 1-2 before the red flag and were 2nd in the championship pre race.   The idea that being 2nd best is a catastrophe is ridiculous. If they were really struggling they'd barely score points.   Red Bull are just better.
Woah is me
Yep, just like no one was a match for Mercedes for years. The sport just "breeds" dominant eras.
F1 is an engineering competition. So if you're not the fastest formula you're usually miles off the pace, even as the second fastest team.   It's way more luck than skill for the drivers. If Lando was in a RB and Max in a McLaren then Lando is leading the WDC points. Max is probably a better driver, but you can't go any faster than the capability of the car.   If you're not on the fastest formula you're unhappy.
Well Norris should go to Redbull and ride that magic carpet in car form that Adrian Newys big bald genius head produced
It’s the skewed sense of success we have.   For a lot people, winning is just everything. If you’re not succeeding you’re failing. Senna’s quote *”Being second is to be the first of the ones who lose.”*, is all too relevant.   We often forget that Formula One is not an easy sport and where a lot of things need to go right for you to win and even then, success is not guaranteed. It’s really hard to make a competitive car and it’s even harder to win multiple races a year. Finishing second or third is viewed so harshly.
Yeah, if they get closer in pace at the end of the year than the beginning that’s all I can ask for at the moment
Yeah but mclaren have been forever struggling!
>The idea that being 2nd best is a catastrophe is ridiculous.  you can be second, just behind first and somewhere in the fight.  Or you are second and not remotely close to challenging for first.   Mercedes and Ferrari are struggling massively compared to Red Bull, no matter what place they currently hold in the WCC.
There are levels to 2nd
According to both Alonso and Hamilton, the AM was faster than the Merc.   Ferrari also said their car was faster than the AM which, if true, means Mercedes were fourth fastest.  >The idea that being 2nd best is a catastrophe is ridiculous.  It is a catastrophe if your aim is to be the winner, not first loser.
Well there is simply being 2nd and within touching distance of first (Red Bull in this case), and then there is a distant 2nd miles off from first.  Mercedes and Ferrari find themselves in the latter. Of course they'd be pissed. They are here to win, not settle for podium places. Aston Martin has only recently joined them so they're not quite at that point yet.  But if Mercedes were still dominating you'd get your knickers in a twist right?
If you’re going to make a pithy comment, at least spell ‘woe’ correctly.
Woah
Woah
At least in recent years, dominations have sparked due to regulation changes.   The best way to avoid having a team just winning absolutely everything is by having stable regulations. That way, if someone gets a head start everyone has equal chances to eventually catchup. 2021 is the perfect example, and we never saw a really tight grid with that package of cars.   Mercedes had a massive head start for 2014 and they carried that advantage until 2017, which a reset on the regulations prompted Ferrari to challenge for a while. The same happened with Red Bull in the late 00’s and early 10’s.
I think Ricky Bobby said that first.
Just the last 10 years. Now Williams...
Exactly, yes. Max was almost 2 seconds ahead once he overtook Lewis, in half a lap. This is crazy.
If you're not first you're last - championship contenders
if Ferrari are faster than AM why are they shit? lol
> 2021 is the perfect example, and we never saw a really tight grid with that package of cars.  2021 had a significant regulation change, otherwise Mercedes would have simply run away with it again.  Apart from that I don't think you're necessarily wrong. It's basically down to the law of diminishing returns.
Well the other half of the equation is Lewis easing off drastically as soon as he was passed.
Sainz was probably the fastest non Red Bull car. He lost track position due to the red flag
Because their engine keeps going poof
Sainz was unlucky pitting under SC which dropped him to P11 and later collected a penalty, otherwise they could have had a decent result.  Ferrari being faster is based on stuff like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/129ovqy/drivers_race_pace_australian_grand_prix_2023/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb).
But still, that was like 1 full second for half a lap. Not too shabby.
He lost track position because he channeled his inner Kvyat
They were faster in Australia. No engine went poof there. It's more the fact that Sainz got unlucky with the SC/Red Flag and had to make his way back from P11.
> Because their engine keeps going poof   Someone clearly didnt watch the race
Apart from Hulkenburg in the end how was any of the Australian GP failures on their engines?
Lewis was close to 1,5 seconds slower in S3 compared to his previous lap. So Verstappen made roughly 5 tenths in one sector, which is close to nothing.   It was the laps after that where Verstappen just stretched his legs and went 13 seconds up with no trouble at all that are scary.
? He lost track position because he pitted on lap 9 then the red flag came out on 11. He lost 7 spots.
5 tenths in one sector is a big-ass gain, friend
Close to nothing? LMAO

One of the greatest and a true legend.  On a side note. I love how almost every picture from that era makes you question if people were suicidal back then. Safety was just such a non issue.
I love listening to Jackie Stewart talk about his hero Jim Clark and how he finessed the Lotus. I wish I had been alive to witness racing back then.
I don't think I've ever seen a photo of Jim Clark in a race where he was in traffic.   Maybe it has happened but normally what I've seen is him a long way ahead of the rest of the field.
The GOAT
Truly the GOAT, rip
The Grand Tour's documentary on him was absolute chills
Greatest ever. Reading about him and the respect he garnered from his peers changes the way you look at every other driver since.
What a legend. I always found it impressive how even with the ridiculous amount of danger back then, these guys would get behind the wheel of anything in lot of different categories aside from just F1.
It's doubly sad because he ran away with the first race of the 1968 season - he finished 25 seconds ahead of Graham Hill, in the other Lotus. There was a four-month gap between the first and second races, so to fill time he entered a formula two race at Hockenheim, where he crashed in bad weather into some trees. He just have spent the time relaxing but he wanted to race.
I met the owner of Jimmy’s Zandvoort winning Lotus 49. Great guy, he was well aware of the historic significance.
I'll be driving home with my headlights on in honor of him. I'll even take the long way home. Really enjoy the drive.
There’s a good hour long doc on YouTube called Jim Clark: Quiet Champion. I watched it when it was originally on BBC about 14 years ago but watched it again recently.
He was called "the flying scotsman", just like colin mcrae
As a Scot I'm slightly embarrassed to ask this but what made Clark so special?
Greatest pure racer of all time.
Watched his documentary last year, guy was incredible, just couldn't stop racing, no matter what it was, and unfortunately trees don't make good barriers.
Just in case anyone is wondering, this is the entry to La Source at Spa Francorchamps in 1967.
I dont know too much about him, but if he was an f1 driver why was he in an f2 race? Were drivers allowed to demote back then?
My childhood hero.
Wonder how many wdc he would have won, legend
[A great piece from 2008 on Jim Clark and Ayrton Senna](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.thenationalnews.com/sport/other-sport/even-legends-have-heroes-1.509813%3foutputType=amp)
If you consider how good Jim was in absolutely everything he sat in (touring cars, Indy cars, even historic race cars) - he was quite probably the greatest driver of all time.   Not a claim I'd normally make, as it's impossible to compare era's, but Jim had the rare ability to be able to be as good, or better, than the specialists in whatever he drove. Even Fangio, for example, wasn't quite as good in sports cars as he was in Grand Prix cars, whereas Jim was simply brilliant in everything.
Top 3 of all time.   Senna, Clarke,  Schumacher.  Rip legend.
It's hard to have a definitive goat ranking in motorsport, but no one can deny that Clark is one of the classiest, chivalrous and fastest drivers of all time. In terms of pure class, Clark, Mika, Jenson, Seb and Sir Jackie are my all-time favorites.
after watching his documentary recently he became the greatest racing driver for me
The grand tour made a great short documentary on him  you could apparently very easily tell which parts came from Clarks car because they were in a much better condition  https://youtu.be/0zqeTYuXUig
He was driving a Lotus. Colin Champman’s “build lightness” killed more than one driver. Jim Clark had a mechanical failure, went off the road and hit a tree.
Greatest driver.   Not greatest F1 driver.
Probably the greatest driver of them all, I have been to his museum in Duns a few times he had the skill at the wheel to wear the tyres evenly across them not to wear out the fronts or wear out the rears but to wear them all evenly, so perfectly in control of his car a skill we have never seen since...  But also the fact you could turn up to the race with him, give him the keys to any car and he was likely to win in that race no matter the car, he was a jack of all trades when it came to his skill at the wheel
Nnnnnnnnnnhnnbtygb to b nubhjbbobkkb
Can we consider these men race car drivers or stuntmen? These men had balls. You riding on an engine with the fuel tank behind you. No sear belt, leather helmet. Wow, those days you had to be slightly crazy to drive those cars.   Have to tip my hat to Jim
Why was he in F2?
I believe he once said of himself that he was just a simple Scottish farmer who enjoyed driving.  Brilliant.

Hope I get to visit his grave someday.
Absolute legend 👏
Safety in general life was much less of an issue. People in Europe were really still rebuilding from the war and rationing of butter happened well into the 50s in the UK.  It's quite easy to compare race cars from today to those from yesteryear but everyday life from that era is a much better comparator.  A good example is that seatbelts were only required on passenger cars from 1965 forward in the UK.
Safety was a *suggestion* back then. Like yeah, you should probably use your seatbelt during the race. No one's gonna stop you if you don't, and there's a slight concern that you might be trapped in a huge ball of fire if you happen to crash and can't get out on time, but hey, better than being tossed out of the car altogether, right?
Isle of Man TT and road racing still look like that.
Look at that photographer sitting casually by the side of the road. A very nice spot but very sketchy if a car goes off there. 😅
Yea man for sure. Watching Rally especially highlights this. The spectators are literally on the road in front of the cars. Hundreds of them at a time.  Remarkably hardly any died. There were a few big crashes into the crowd that killed a couple of people and injured 30 or so but could have been much worse.
That mentality lives on in rally spectators.
The Jim Clark Rooms in Duns used to have a little booth with TV footage of him - apparently I was mesmerised as a kid just with how elegant it was. A lot is now on YouTube.
He either won or broke. He did sometimes have trouble clearing traffic
Didn't both Senna and Fangio recognize him as the greatest at one point, as well as Graham and a few others too? I mean how can you even make an argument againt that when freaking FANGIO tells you he was ***the*** guy?
My favorite Jim Clark stat is that he still holds the record for most grand slams in Formula 1 (pole, race win, lead every lap, and fastest lap) at 8, and he did it in only 72 starts (Hamilton is in second with 6, but slightly more starts, of course).
Maybe Ram.   On account of all the sheep in Scotland.  Whatever you want to call him, Jimmy was amazing.
When they get serious, they absolutely nail it
“he wanted to race” sums up his racing carreer very well
In Canada, almost all cars have the headlights on at all time
Well he won in just about everything he ever drove. And he drove a lot of different cars. He pretty much was racing most weekends in all sorts of different series'. He was winning in F1, open wheel in Australia, sports cars, and touring cars. He got 2nd in the Indy 500 twice I believe. Jackie Stewart said that when Clark died in an accident it was proof that any of them could.  [This is a good documentary on his racing career.](https://youtu.be/iUItVMy-C8M)
He was a natural talent as a driver. Was skilled driving all different types of cars. He was a great sportsman and respectful person on and off track. He often either won or had a car failure.
At the time there was only one other driver who could hold a candle to him if the car was vaguely right, Graham Hill - and that was inconsistent too (which I suspect Graham would have put you in no doubt about).  What's more, he was the same in anything he drove, regardless of discipline. As an example, he jumped into a Lotus Cortina (of course he was familiar with the car, having raced it and been significant in its development) to do the RAC rally alongside the equivalent of the WRC stars at the time, and was running fourth when he went off. I believe he'd not done a stage rally before.  But he still went back home to tend to his farm, was adored locally as a nice guy, supported local motorsport and had that magic combination of being shy and quiet, but also making friends and genuine connections with anyone he met.
https://youtu.be/0zqeTYuXUig  They did a feature on the Grand Tour. The bit about how smooth he drove and not wearing the machinery down is massive. Much more of a difference then to now
Back in the 60s, driver's raced as often as they wanted to, and often in a variety of different series.
Clark raced in just about everything, he won F1, British F2 and the Indy 500 in 1965
F2 was not a demotion or a feeder series as it is today. It was another open wheel series, like driving IndyCar.
Back then it was not considered the stepping stone into F1.    It was a more budget friendly championship, but not linked to F1 directly. The regulations made the cars slower, but also cheaper.   Most recent similarly we have is Alonso who drove the Indy500 in the Indycar championship, during his time at McLaren F1.   So imagine him doing it for the whole season where the races didn't overlap.
>A good example is that seatbelts were only required on passenger cars from 1965 forward in the UK.  1968 in the US too  my '67 Mustang LeMons car has infinity more seatbelts than it legally needs (not that it's street registered...yet)
Now that u say so, would it be safe to run actual F1 car on that kind of old circuit taking into account today F1 cars much more safe?  I love the scenery this picture provides.
>and rationing of butter happened well into the 50  This is an unusual connection to correlate butter supply with safety standards in motoring.
Idc who said it, the man had 23 races without engine car issues and won 25 races, I think that says enough
Well he was undoubtedly the most talented before Senna, so it makes sense that they say that. After that came Senna and Schumacher which many drivers would consider the greatest.
I think there’s a picture of Senna visiting the Jim Clark museum at the Jim Clark Museum.
Did he farm sheep? I can't quite remember.  Theres an incredible fondness for him in Scottish borders among the generation that has living memories of the chap. They knew how special he was, he clearly didn't but that was the charm!  I learnt to drive a car on the airstrip he used to take off and land from when going to and from grand prixs. Also been to Charterhall several times, where he made his name.
This became mandatory in Brazil ~5 years ago, maybe a bit more. All cars must have them on during the day (and night ofc)  I got like 3 tickets in less than a year until I finally got 100% used to turn them on during the day.
So was f2 more just like another sport and less like a subdivision of f1?
Ahh makes sense!! I wish it was still another series but i get why its a feeder series
1997 in Brazil, less than 30 years ago.  That's crazy!
I think it would be very dangerous today. Wrapping a car around a tree would be pretty scary
Some old circuits is dangerous per se. Regardless of the level of safety the car you're driving has, if you're reaching the top performance, most of those circuits (some layouts of Monza for example) are just dangerous.
The 1955 Le Mans disaster was in part because the cars had become too fast for the track, but was deadly for fans, as *83* spectators died, and one driver.
whoosh.  I'm stating that the OP is comparing to today's world which is nothing like the world of the photo being shown. Rationing butter is an excellent and common example of how different the worlds are and it's a logical fallacy to consider the old world through the lens of the new world.  I shouldn't have to spell this out so literally but here we are  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Schumacher's passion gave Ferrari its golden years.  Transformed an entire team into greatness that it hasn't touched since.  MSC has a serious argument for being called the GOAT.
Prost is so overlooked
He did farm sheep
That was originally how it was set up to be yeah
Yes it originally was meant to offer competition with smaller and more affordable cars, but it was treated as a different competition, not a lower one per se
It was comparable to GP2. The formula level directly below F1
I have a Brazilian friend and he can confirm that Brazil is usually late to the party lol.
I mean there is a Motor series that runs in isle of man, isn't that more dangerous?
Look at spa and how crashes in Radillion play out, Anthoine's death was far from a freak accident
Woosh unnecessary - perhaps I was overly dry 3 beers in!  I do love a weird statistics trick though.
Idk people always say prost wasn't raw talent but was incredibly smart and patient and knew what he needed to do to get the points for wins and championships. That's talent, but talent in a different way. Different conversation really. Raw driving talent vs racing(?) talent? Summin like that
And I bet they were the fastest and most mechanically sympathetic sheep in the world.
Absolutely, the Tourist Trophy is probably the deadliest competition that comes to mind, every edition we hear of fatal accidents, and that's because it's still an "old school" track, it was already called out by Ago 50 years ago, let alone for today's standards.
It is most certainly more dangerous than most circuits yes.
No room for crash barriers when the narrow road is lined by old stone walls... those that run the TT or the Manx GP accept the level of risk. No way would these events be designed today.
Yes and there were 6 fatalities at the iom tt in 2022 since 1937 only one year hasn't had any deaths.  Motor sports and racing is inherently incredibly dangerous and while deaths or serious injuries in f1 are now thankfully very rare the same cannot be said for many other racing disciplines.
teetotaler ;)
Eat some carbs, mate. Too soon for you to be skimming posts.
Dude your name is the best I’ve seen here lol
There was the 1982 and 2012 event for recent ones. Though In 2012 it occured during Isle of Man Manx GP event instead of Tourist Trophy.
I understand what you saying, however there are sports that aren't safe per se and people still follow and practice then  There is a boxing type with ni gloves UFC is dangerous as well Medieval fight is a thing Slap fighting as well  And the list goes on  What in trying to bring is, they will be a moment people will bring back in some sort of a way dangerous racing even if it's a small event.
Is that an accusation 😄
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Well we are talking about a Scottish driver 😉
¯\_(ツ)_/¯

I reckon the top 3 will be 1. Pulling 2. (Hamda) Al Qubaisi 3. Garcia  Pretty serious talent drop off the further you go down.
I don't want to be mean. But this grid looks terrible. Also lot of the drivers here seems to have taken huge step back considering this series is at F4 level.   This concept seems flawed. I don't think they can find 15 female young drivers who should be doing F4 and also have 150k euros to spend for this series each year.   And even if they did, champion of this series will not be prepared to go against boys - who raced in more competitive series in their careers - in the next category. I hope I am wrong, but this whole concept seems like a "PR Exercise" to me.
Can’t they sponsor a couple of teams in F2 and F3 instead of starting a whole series.
Is this gonna be on f1tvpro?
So glad Megan Gilkes gets another shot. She’s a great gall (with fantastic parents) who can do really well in this series. Also really anxious to see how Khaled’s daughters will fare, knowing their dad as a racer.
For the life of me I can't find where we will actually be able to watch this? Why start a race series without clear information on how the audience can actually see it?
Rather than all the “hot takes” with their noses in the air about the concept, I’ll just say if it’s on F1TV, I’ll watch it.   I don’t need this to lead to an F1 grid-slot for it to be of interest.. I can just enjoy single-seat racing, enjoy seeing women get involved in motorsport, and not put up unnecessary goal posts for the series or it’s drivers.
Wtf happened to W Series and why is F1 academy even slower
I appreciate the article, as I've not kept track at all with news for F1 Academy.
The favorites are probably Marta García and Pulling (who I think is touch overrated by the community), but I would not be surprised if there was a surprise.  Honestly, I would have liked to see someone like Sidorkova here.
This will be more detriment to the women than help. They’ll have fun racing and perhaps look good but they won’t and can’t learn and progress unless their racing against their peers and men in a real main series. They’ll waste good career years in a series that leads nowhere, holds no esteem or regard for a resume when trying to move on, and can’t teach them well if they’re not being put into real racing scenarios (ie against men in main series). Not to be too mean but Jamie Chadwick looked pretty hopeless out there on her first Indy nxt race. It was a tough track and only her first outing but it was not impressive at all even though she dominated w series and that obviously didn’t help her progress her race craft or evaluate her skill for main other series
That website has more cookies than the Girl Scouts.    Run away Boyz.
Anabelle Brian let's go!
Bring it on. I for one would rather see some fast women that some of the dudes.
This is just the W series dog with a shiny new collar.  Won't work. Not a single name on this grid is good enough for F3, and i have my doubts they'd hold their ground on F4.  Just look at how Chadwick is doing once she got out of the kiddie pool that W Series was - laughing stock of the Indy Lights paddock, beached the car 3 times on her own on her debut race. Notice how the articles about her dissapeared once that happened?  The intention behind this is good, but it doesn't work. Nobody will watch just like nobody watched W Series, and eventually sponsor money will dry up.  Putting women on the kiddie's pool so they can race each other doesn't help anyone. W Series proved that.
I think there will be some surprises in there. Plenty of unknown talents and lots of testing time to develop before the season starts as well as during the season.
I think the goal here is long term, not the now. Such things need to be in place before you can reach a competitive grid
>I don't think they can find 15 female young drivers who should be doing F4 and also have 150k euros to spend for this series each year.  Absolutely, which is a big part of the problem that this series is hoping to help address.  There are so few women in any tier of motorsport, which has a knock-on effect on the number of girls starting the sport at the grass roots level. Visible representation is important and this series is trying to raise the profile of 15 female athletes - there's a reason the phrase "if you can't see it, you can't be it" is prevalent in a lot of female sports.
Isn't it literally the point to develop talent?
There’s absolutely no way they’d be spending the amount of money required to set up an entire racing series, complete with teams, circuits, sponsors, etc for a “PR Exercise,” what are you on about mate.    Also, its called F1 ACADEMY. It’s a development feeder championship FOR getting into the numbered formula series. They looked at W series, said “fuck that” and made their own.
> I don’t want to be mean.  And yet…
The reality is that none of them are at that level and it would be very damaging to throw them there when they aren't ready for it.
That's waht I don't get. Surely if the whole "need to see it to make it happen" crowd really feels that way - the best way forward would be to find the best 3 or so female drivers out there, and secure them funding for as high as they can go. Isolating women drivers just furthers the idea that they can't hack it in the primary series, right? Maybe I'm missing something.
THANK YOU! I've been saying this for years. Having women compete in an entirely separate series does nothing but harm. The FIA should instead have some sort of scholarship fund for deserving female drivers (or even better, any deserving drivers regardless of gender) to get rides in series people actually care about. With all the money they've thrown at the W Series and now this, that's entirely doable.
W series flopped and I guess no one watched it. So they’ve made F1 Academy to try it again, will most-likely flop again
W Series is a true meritocracy. Iirc they take applications and then have a few test days then pick what they think are the best drivers. Then give them equal cars and treatment and pay all the drivers prize money.  F1 Academy works just like an F4 series. You get in contact with the teams and cough up €150k and then you might get a seat.
I think like some people have said, it's more for inspiring the future. So hopefully younger girls get inspired to do more. And, really, for the price, it offers more track time and all on good tracks. 15 testing days on top of the 21 races over 7 race weekends. All the women who choose this (or their families who help choose for the younger ones) have weighed the options and think this is their best option. Whether that be to try to get attention shining in a smaller pool, or because this is what they have funding for because other F4s are more expensive, as I understand it, and the costs just keep going up with higher series. I'm trusting them to make the right choice for themselves.
Because women racing against women couldn't be 'real racing' 🙄. Sorry to say it but you're part of the problem, mate
Well, what's your grand solution then?
Considering theres a FIA girls on track finalist in there, I expect a good showing from her as well.
Good take. You're not going to see a lot of top skiers in countries without snow.  There needs to be infrastructure in place for ppl to develop skill from a fairly young age. Edit: typo.
Yeah, but you don't adress that by filling a grid with amateur level drivers.  That just leads to people not caring about the series because there's no real talent on it. No one wants to watch mediocre drivers racing each other.  This is the same as W Series. The series that Chadwick, who is really being a joke at Indy Lights and was a joke at F3.5, dominated with her eyhes closed.  We literally just had this exact concept, backed by the exact same arguments you are using, fail.
>They looked at W series, said “fuck that” and made their own.  Actually, no. What happened is W Series flopped on its own because nobody was watching and sponsors gave up.
Just look at how Chadwick is doing in Indy Lights, the Indycar equivalent of F2. Mind me, she's the driver who won W Series with her eyes closed and one hand out of the cockpit.
And end up like the girls who were in moto2 3 or gp2 gp3? Waste of a grid slot
To be fair it was nearly impossible to actually watch it, it was being broadcast on the most bizarre channels for most of its life.
W Series is still a thing isn't it?
> W Series is a true meritocracy  Not really, they put Noda in without her even testing
When the best female racing driver in history (mouton) was against this series you know it probably wasn't a good idea
Yeah threads on these topics always end up outing some dudes.
what I mean by real racing has nothing to do with women. if you actually understood and read what I meant is that this new series is unconnected anywhere, leads nowhere, and has no cache or importance to any other series so it cant or wont help grow these women as racers and wont help them move on to other series. to actually learn something or earn a credit for their cv, they need to try a known important series like the f series, indycar ladder, or other sports car series that are known and held to some regard
I like this skiing metaphor a lot! What is worrisome, is i'm sure if the talent doesn't develop fast enough, whoever is investing $$ is going to stop. Hopefully we see a great snowfall
Here's the problem: women are massively underrepresented in motorsport, to the point where filling a grid for a single series is difficult.   There are two ways of dealing with that. One is to put the series on regardless and try to use it to drive women in motorsport forwards, and the other is to sit around and complain that there shouldn't be a series because of the quality of the field.  I know which one I'd rather have happen, because only one of those actually leads to things getting better. You have to start somewhere.
Your attitude is ridiculous.   Basically, it's not good enough now, why bother. You gotta start somewhere. I've worked with people like you and it's fucking painful as shit, just always dumb excuses as to why not to do something cuz it's not going to be perfect, so why bother.
The series failed from a marketing standpoint to advertisers, that's a whole different issue from addressing women's motorsports and giving them equal visibility.   There are A LOT of examples of a weaker division, once given proper attention producing a competitive environment given enough time.   Is it a money sink?   Well it shouldn't be given how much bank the brand makes, and how little it would cost for them to help boost the ecosystem.   That said without resources from the bottom up, it's inevitably futile since even if someone DID want to get into the motorsport, it would still be increasingly difficult for a young woman to do so.
That’s not what I meant. I meant that they’re learning from the mistakes of W series and taking it way more seriously lol
There has only been one IndyNXT (not Indy Lights any more) race this season. Not fair to judge her on her one and only race so far.
That shouldn't be a surprise, her Formula Regional season showed where she's at imo.
The key word here is "deserving".
It was easy to watch in the UK before Sky added it to their catalog.
There's a variety of factors.  They have limited testing time, she's young so can improve (compared to some drivers in their 30s), she has lots of open wheel experience etc.  They took a gamble and thought she'd do better.
Wasn't she one of the development drivers though
This series is connected directly to F1 and FOM, who are providing half the funding to lower the barrier to entry for the drivers.  There's also a focus on maximising the amount of testing and practice to help develop the drivers who compete in it.  Finally, for those at the top of the series, they're already connected to some of the biggest names in junior racing (Prema, ART, Carlin etc.) which will help for moving up to the next level of the ladder.
It will take a long term investment mentality to be sure, but there's so much money flowing through F1 and FIA they could regulate (internally/voluntarily) that some portion be set aside to help subsidize the very expensive league.  But if women's college basketball this year in America is any indication, there are a lot of viewers to be earned down the line.
This will fail the same way the W series did as no fan of motorsport will want to watch a bunch of mediocre drivers compete in a race series it's not why we watch motorsports. We want to watch the best of the best compete and gender shouldn't be a factor. Jamie Chadwick is a classic example of this, all the hype around her for dominating the W series, tell me again how she did on her debut at Indy Lights?  Your argument about "leading to something better" is also flawed as it doesn't take a grid filled with mediocre drivers in a female only category to inspire the next generation of girls it only takes one exceptional female driver to do just that. The only way to find that exceptional driver is to have her compete on a level playing field against the best males in the series and beat them. If there is a female racer out there that is a stand out talent in the junior categories you'd think with the push for representation in motorsport she'd have no issues getting financial backing and sponsorship to move up the categories as long as she had the talent to go with it.  The only thing these female only categories are doing is enforcing the fact that as soon as females go up against a male in the same category they're going to lose and it's not even close. To me all these female only series scream of PR only and that's just sad and unfair for the drivers involved.
Or of curiosity and unrelated to the topic, but what do you have in mind when you say weaker divisions subsequently producing competitive environments?
How so? I ask that sincerely. This feels like a lot more of the same. A mediocre field of women drivers isolated from the main stage.
Yeah, but people would say "it was a long time ago she's better now" etc. But on Indy Lights she's being one of the worst 3 drivers which is a real feat considering some of the people she's racing have next to not open wheel racing experience.
If they were deserving, wouldn’t they be in already?
They should get directly into f2 from the regional formulas or already established series. This new series is totally unnecessary. if they are good enough they will rise
The problem is that your whole argument relies on finding this one exceptional driver who can beat the male drivers and inspire a generation.  The sad reality is that that driver probably doesn't exist right now. To find that driver you need a bigger talent pool, and to get a bigger talent pool you need more girls to start racing. Unless you have any better ideas, the best way to get more girls to start racing is to raise the profile of the women currently in the sport and show them that they can get into the sport and compete at a high level.  The problem is circular, and the only way to change things from how they are now is to do something different. Waiting for an exceptional talent to materialise out of nowhere to inspire the next generation is only going to end in one way - nothing happening and nothing changing.
A 3 year old girl doesn't know what an exceptional driver is.  I've got a friend with a young girl who loves Chadwick because she wins and looks a bit like her.  The fact that she's on tv is enough, toddlers have no idea about the difference between f1 and w series.  Now this family isn't in Europe or rich enough to do anything with this, but I'd imagine if a rich family had a daughter in a similar position they'd be more likely to act on it and follow their daughters interests and get her into karting.  That's what the series is trying to do.  It's obviously going to be a failure from a competitive aspect, but it's all about increasing interest in the next generation.  At the moment we don't have an exceptional female racer who can compete with the guys and that's mainly a numbers game.  The only way you're going to find that is by increasing the numbers of 4 year old girls who start competitive karting.  And that happens through increased visibility.
Sorry maybe I mispoke. The concept of weaker drivers, in this case, getting to compete against stronger adversaries provides opportunity for growth. The comment was "why field 15 amateur level female drivers" and the only response is "well then who?" since there are (as we can see) very few if ANY female drivers who can compete at the top level *at the moment*.      If the division exists, and they are given the ability to compete, then growth will occur naturally. Without that division existing then zero growth can occur. That said, without any lower tier support below this, its kind of pointless because how would people get into it to begin with? Thats also part of the problem.
I'm going to ignore what you said about mediocre because that's literally not the point, but a big difference is the backing from F1 that this series has - and their plans to incorporate it long-term into F1 weekends. Hugely different to W Series which really was not connected to F1 hardly at all.
She's also the 2nd oldest driver in the field too which doesn't help for easing expectations.  She's no longer a young driver, it's make or break, and she's not making it.
There's been one race and she out qualified both her team mates and came 14 just behind one of them? I'm not sure how that is worst 3
Not necessarily. There are lots of talented drivers who can't get rides, primarily due to lack of funding. The scholarship fund would at least partially help with this issue.
>This new series is totally unnecessary. if they are good enough they will rise  Male karters outnumber female karters in the UK by 14 times. The problem is that not enough girls are taking up the sport at the grass roots level, and even fewer are staying on when they do start, which why we end up with such a tiny talent pool at the F4 level and above.  Series like this are critical for getting more visible representation of women in high-level motorsport. Having 1 female F3 or F2 driver once every couple of years is nowhere near as powerful a message as seeing 15 young women racing in F4s, with the best of them in contention for F3 seats in the future.
These series aren’t really to promote the current women into f2 / f1, but to inspire young girls to become drivers that may one day race in f2 / f1.
Mediocre was probably harsh - and off point - so I retract that. That said, wasn't W at F1 some weekends though? I swore I saw some formula W coverage at the Miami GP or something but I may be misremembering.  I suppose I see the point though, you need that logo to pop up on the F1Tv app and such so that casual viewers will decide - what the hell - and watch it.

Perhaps worth noting that his "slagging off" was because Massa spun, unforced, out of a clear win at Malaysia, which would've won him the title no problem.  2008 was a bit like 1997 or 1999, where the key title contenders occasionally did their level best to not win it.  > The team failed to capitalize on Kubica’s maiden victory in Canada that summer  In fairness to Mario, BMW were only clinging on by dint of other's failures and in that explicit instance that Hamilton had kindly eliminated most of the opposition. It did make *sense* to focus on 2009, although unfortunately for everyone KERS was a disaster. Mario knew (rightly) that BMW didn't take kindly to missed targets, and their target for 2008 was podiums.
Ah Felipe. That 2008 title challenge made him the first hero of mine in F1.  Massive massive shame that he was never the same after his injury in 2009. Watching his career flounder and slowly die off from 2010 onwards was painful.
I remember Kubica pleading with BMW to keep funding keep pushing 2008 car and not go all in for 2009 car. They didn't listen to him and the 2009 was shit.
I'm glad I scrolled all the way down that article for a random photo of Nick Heidfeld with a falcon
I thought Felipe Massa title charge started in Monaco, when Ferrari signed Alonso and started a process of kicking Raikkonen off the team.  Or maybe in Germany, when they switched suspension in their cars, completely breaking the balance to not suit Raikkonen's liking?
I thought Massa was jumped by Raikkonen in rhe first round of stops in Malaysia 2008.
He has some of the best moments when the drivers met with whiting before each race though.  He was always calling something out
i would say after he was never the same after brazilian gp 2008.
I started to watch F1 to support him
Yes, he was a 30-second world champion back in 2008.
Raikkonen started this process himself by being only marginally better than Massa in 07 while being the highest paid driver in F1
Lmao cmon now. Raikkonen was just not that great in 2008.  The reality is that both Massa and Hamilton had some pretty big blunders that year. An on form Raikkonen should have won that title with ease. Yes he wasn't even in contention.
There were rumors circling around back then that Ferrari wanted to kick out both of their drivers.
Checo to massa speaking out for stroll: “Are you his father or what?”
Nah he carried his form into 2009 and was better than Kimi until he got injured.   His injury seemingly gave Kimi a second wind culminating in that win at Spa.   After that, I would say he wasn’t really the same. But he was also up against Alonso who was insane. Massa beat Kimi in 2008-2009 but got destroyed by Alonso. But Alonso also destroyed Kimi.
I remember the first half of 2007 people questioning the signing *at all*.
Kimi was actually /slower/ than Massa during their time together. The median gap IIRC was 0.15%
Raikkonen was well ahead of Massa in 2007. Massa beat him at just 4 events (Bahrain, Monaco, USA, Turkey), compared to 10 for Raikkonen (Australia, Malaysia, Canada, France, Britain, Hungary, Belgium, Japan, China, Brazil)
Not that great, okay then. He dominated Malaysia and Spain early in the season, got awful luck in Australia (because you can't call it any different after getting into Q1 with just a single lap, and then being dropped out in P16 after a mechanical problem, on a track with no overtaking opportunities), and got okay-ish weekends in Bahrain and Turkey, finishing both on the podium. He was fighting for the victory in Canada (before Hamilton happend), later led in France until his exhaust decided to destroy his bodywork, he was way ahead of Massa in Silverstone (who spun like 918492741941 times)...   Did I miss anything?  Oh yes, Monaco. An infringement even before the race started, tyres was not fit into the car 3 minutes before the race started. Ferrari being Ferrari, it started back then.  Seriously, it was Raikkonen's championship to lose, and Ferrari did their best. Massa was fully supported by the team, and up until Singapore, he was mostly benefitting from others bad luck, while his points lost was on him.
Is this just simply taking the races finished without looking into context?  Because in Australia Massa's gearbox broke in qualy so he had to start 16th. In Malaysia he was quicker than Raikkonen all weekend and was ahead until that erratic move against Hamilton. In Spain he was ahead of Raikkonen when Kimi retired (and was easily a few tenths quicker all weekend). In Canada he was also ahead before pitting and missing the red light.  So before France we either had weekends where Massa completely outperformed Raikkonen, weekends where Massa was ahead but made a mistake, or weekends where Massa had a mechanical issue.  In the second half Raikkonen was better. But in Germany Massa was ahead after Raikkonen slipped and missed the pit entry, then in Hungary Ferrari forgot to refuel Massa in qualy, and in Monza Massa's car broke down when he was again ahead of Raikkonen.  Then, as agreed internally whoever was ahead in the championship after Italy would be de facto number one whereas the second driver would be helping him to win the title. Even if you say Raikkonen would have beaten Massa in Belgium, Japan and China anyway, giving him Brazil is definitely incorrect.

Wait until the summer break
I think it's far too early to be making any kind of decisions. Entering the summer races is probably about the time you have a fairly clear view of how your drivers are doing, and that's when you probably think about making decisions. But there's no rush.
KMag has been hosed by a safety car in one race, and a red flag in the other. In the 3rd he scored a point in a season where there are only going to be 2 surefire points paying positions beyond the top 4 teams.   Wait for the season to play out and we can have a real discussion about it, but rookies and even younger drivers are not the answer.
Simple, just find another blonde driver.
Unless Haas decide they want/need even more money than MoneyGram is already giving them (or he goes full Mick Schumi and shatters a couple chassis), I reckon he re-signs. He’s been a loyal asset to the team since 2017 and was only let go in the first place so Haas could take Mazepin’s money. If Haas really is operating right around the budget cap with the MoneyGram sponsorship like they claim, I can’t see them dumping their longest tenured driver to the wayside for the comparably small scraps that the likes of Zhou or Drugovich would bring
HAAS has made is clear that they want two driver who will drive well and not wreck the car. They do not want to bring young drivers up to speed. They want decent results and minimal damage.  Both of their drivers are good drivers who will score points when possible and bring the car home in one piece, barring the occasional front wing end plate. Neither will ever be a WDC, or likely even a race winner. That’s ok.
Just a guess here, but I don’t think Tsunoda/Zhou are the ones to favor a team switch after this season is over.   Tsunoda - beating Nyck, getting attention from the media to be Checo’s replacement for 2025.  Zhou - as you say, being competitive with Bottas. Solid midfield driver, already getting used to the car baseline.  Therefore, KMag’s only worry has to be Bottas. I think AR drop him [if things remain unchanged for the rest of the season] and promote Pourchaire. Bottas will probably be looking for a team switch and Haas will likely be the destination for that.
Yes, this is very very early. I'll give you an example of how wrong these early predictions can go:  In 2020, after the 8th race (Italian GP), Checo was 11th in the standings (34 points) while Lance was fourth (57 points). Checo had missed two races because of COVID, where he was replaced by Hulkenberg. In one of those, Nico qualified 3rd and ended the race 7th after a controversial call to pits when he was running 5th. I remember at the time how a big bunch of the media and fans were declaring this as the end of Checo's career: outscored by Lance Stroll and his replacement doing as good or even better than him after getting into the car at short notice. Then the Vettel announcement comes.  Fast-forward to the end of the season: Checo 4th in the standings, six top-5 finishes, two podiums, and one win. Plus, he had a DNF while running comfortably third with three laps to go in Bahrain. In the end he got the Red Bull seat.
I’m a kmag fan so I might sound biased. But saying he has little in the way of noticeable accomplishment since his podium is wrong. He has never been in a car that was capable of much. The McLaren in 2014 wasn’t even good enough to actually get that podium. But he has multiple times gotten extremely good qualifying results in a very bad car.   For this season compared to hulkenberg it isn’t looking great if you only look at finishing and qualifying results. In Bahrain he was just slower he admitted that himself. But in Saudi he had a gearbox issue during qualifying which slowed him down a lot but still managed to get p10 in the race.  In Australia he got absolutely destroyed by the red flag and went from a comfortable p11 to last. He said he had enough pace to get in the points had he stayed p11. But then he messed up and crashed.   Not keeping magnussen in Haas would be a big mistake and also not wanting him in another team would be dumb. He is very experienced and has a lot of pace. He can drive in every weather condition and type of track. And will get the most out of the car when needed. Just look a brazil
You know what getting Mag and Hulk in the car makes me wonder ? Was the 2020 and 2021 Haas car as bad Mick and Nikita made it look ?
I believe this one of the silliest start to the silly season ever... Next we are going to discuss the 2026 drivers now..  \s  I would enjoy the races and not play team manager. You hsve the right to your oppinion I will not give mine, I am a dane after all 😊... I'm just looking forward to kmag being under a little pressure from a teammate again.  Have a great weekend!!  Edit: removed danish words
There is no reason for them to switch drivers in their current position unless next year they would make really fast car. Kmag and Hulk are not the greatest drivers but they are expirienced and will bring some points during entire season. Taking rookies as Haas make no sense because if they are bad they will cost you much more money in crashes and if they are good they will go to better team. Tsunoda and Zhou may have better or similar results but change of team does not mean the same performance. ( Look at Ricciardo for example) Also looking at someone performance based on first 3 races is just stupid. Leclerc is a top 3 driver and hes got like 6 points now.
Well I think if we look at the Gunther Steiner playbook, they will replace kmag with gio
lol  He understands how HAAS operates and that is very much unlike any normal F1 team.  That works very well for HAAS and I cannot imagine them taking an existing driver unless they have huge financial backing like Mazepin.
You are forgetting the biggest reason why they re-signed magnussen which is experience, which goes a long way towards building a good car.
> He is also being slightly outperformed in races (13th vs 11th average finishing place)   We've had THREE races and the comparison is P11 vs P13...  Summer break... Season has barely started. Patience.
If I was Geunther/Gene I'd be looking around. Hulk's a perfect fit for them and I knew as soon as he was announced it was the right decision. K Mag's too inconsistent, good on his good days but then goes missing and is trundling around in P16 or whatever way too often. He's not bad, but just not good enough that you'd want him there long term based off his performances.  Ricciardo if he's willing to drop his huge salary demand would be worth a punt.   Maybe a bit *Prema*ture for 2024 but Bearman looks like he'll make it to F1 and with the FDA link Haas might be a good bet. He has a lot of potential, if Haas could get him in, grow him and keep him for a few years he could be a great asset for the team.  And after that maybe Felipe Drugovich, I rate him and think he's a pretty good driver and I know his F2 championship will get downplayed because it was 3rd season, but he looked so assured and composed last year and I think he has the right mentality to succeed in F1 if a team like Haas gave him a chance. He also brings some sponsorship which a team like Haas will be happy to have.  As for Zhou and Tsunoda, both look like they'll be with the same teams next year and maybe beyond and I doubt they'd choose Haas so it's unlikely.
I’m sure it will all be sorted, and you don’t need to worry your pretty little head about it
If their teams cut Zhou or Tsunoda loose, I think they would both be worth considering for Haas. They've also publicly mentioned Danny Ric, who I think would be a great option, except I can't see him tolerating Guenther- who is an amusing character but seems like a nightmare boss- or Haas's low pay and low performance. If Williams lets Sargeant go, I think he would be worth a look at a Haas seat. He has some speed potential, and Haas does try to look like an American team. I think Williams will give Sargeant another year though. Haas seems less likely to go with a rookie after past comments (unless the rookie comes with big money, and then they totally would do it.)
See if Hulk has any brothers or cousins…  Bring em all in…
I know this isnt the answer you want, but summer break will be the first meaningful evaluation point.  Hass will just need more race performance data than 3 races.
I think it's fine the way it is. Haas aren't really striving for greatness anyway. To replace KMag they would need the right combination of experience, availability, an improvement over KMag, AND a willingness to drive for Haas. That narrows down the options to the point where I can't see anything changing in the near future.
You may be overthinking it.
You are talking about a man with a 2-1 race record against his team mate this year like he is a dead man walking.  Besides being extremely immature, you are also not seeing why Haas has valued KMag for years. He is actually one of the least crash prone drivers on the grid, and accepts Haas' pretty unique culture based around "shut up and drive" basically. And generally well liked by Gene, Steiner and the team.  Unless he actually completely falls off, it seems unlikely they would let go off him for some theoretic other driver, even if Hulk ends up beating him in the championship this year.  And then there is the whole question of who would actually be a good replacement and want to go to Haas in 2024? Zhou, Tsunoda and Albon are the only realistic choices with contracts ending in 2023. Bottas has a contract until 2025. Maybe a bit of a fuck up by Sauber, but I'm not sure they're ready to potentially pay two years salary to him. Also like KMag it's just been 3 races, don't write him off yet.   Zhou will probably get a new contract with Alfa/Sauber and will be happy with continue with them considering his good relationship with Bottas and the new money that will probably start to come in from Audi as soon as 2024 or at least the promise of them being closer to the top in the future. I don't think Haas will be able to realistically outbid Sauber here.   Albon and Tsunoda I think are both good enough to get extensions at Williams and Alpha Tauri respectively and will want to stay there with the hope that it might open up a seat later at Mercedes and RB. And I don't think Haas will be able to offer either of them more money that they'll make with an extension with their existing team.  So realistically I feel like the only obvious option would be Ricciardo coming back. He already ruled out Haas and we know that he wanted way more money than they could afford, but maybe a year away has loosened him up on that. The threat of  Andretti coming into the sport definitely makes "honorary" American Danny Ric more appealing for them as a driver. Besides just easily being the biggest name driver they have ever had.  Personally I feel like the culture at Haas would be pretty terrible place for Ric he seems to drive the best when he is in a good mental state. But if he was actually available at a reasonable price I could see them picking him over KMag if his performances falls off this year.
This post gives me AI vibes man. Stats don't tell the whole truth.
I don’t see HAAS picking up another young driver after the Mick debacle.  They might snag someone like bottas if he becomes available,  but I don’t see them moving for Yuki or Zhou.    I think they will stick with Kmag unless it becomes clear they’ve got a points capable car and he’s regularly missing it.   For some reason Gunther really seems to like him this round, so he’ll have to really screw up.  Maybe a few more crashes like he just had would push him out.
Far too early. He's been doing fine in the races, granted the quali gap is eyebrow raising, but I think that's more down to him not having the same confidence in car as Nico. I expect Hulk will be the kick up the backside Kmag needed, and he will raise his game in the coming rounds. He just needs to get a setup that suits him a bit more, he had that in Saudi and done well there.
What I would do is starting off with Alfa Romeo: bring Pourchaire up to F1.  He has proven himself worthy of the drive hands down.  This being the case, keep Bottas and unfortunately let Zhou go.  In this instance, Haas should take Zhou and let KMag go.  They’ll get a great amount of funding and support from China, which will help a lot.  Zhou will once again have an excellent mentor under Hulk and will only get better honestly.  I would let Yuki make Alpha Tauri his own team kind of like Gasly.  He deserves a chance to get a shot at Red Bull if he keeps improving.
I can say one thing, Hulk has totally won me over, I thought it was a terrible idea to bring another older driver in, but man has he stepped up.  He's embarrassing Kevin, if I was Haas, I find a younger driver to go with Hulk, but they may still prefer the most consistent points.
Can’t wait till the silly season starts🥳
IMO, we will just have to see how the season will transpire for both the drivers and HAAS.   Both drivers are doing great each driver scored points in the last 2 races KMag 1 point in Saudi and Nico 6 points  in Australia. The car is good and they both are trying to get the max out of it. But given we are 3 races in to the season we will have to see how the team performs.  Because if they under perform or are mediocre no young driver will go there, but if they are performing better that last year the may look for a new driver, the one that will bring a lot of sponsors with him or a lot of money.
It’s still really early but my guess is KMag is not getting a new contract from Haas.    I think Tsunoda will be looking at other opportunities if there are open seats. He won’t be getting a promotion at Red Bull.  Zhou is better than I think most give him credit for and if I recall correctly he brings a lot of sponsor ship money to the table which Haas is always in need of.  Haas won’t do this but I think they should at least kick the tires on giving Herta a seat on the grid.  Ricciardo still believes he’s above a Haas seat, and someone needs to let him know that his own perceived value is much less that what he thinks it is.
Bottas, kmag, tsunoda, Zhou and Albon need to pick it up and have a good seasons.
Hulk and Ricciardo
Honestly, if they change their driver line up again, Gunther has to leave with that driver. The fact that haas has made no meaningful progress in 3 years, had rotated driver line ups since 2020, flirted with bankruptcy, took so many years to get a proper sponsor and not to mention taking on two new debutantes without knowing how to handle debutantes.  I don't know how Gunther keeps getting away with it considering people wanted binotto's head when he showed significant progress (although I believe he should've left as well) along with the questions people asked szafnauer, Lawrence stroll and McLaren.
Didnt kmag do well last year? Were only three races in and the last race was a shit show. Hulk is eager to prove his worth and is doing so but I wouldn't write kmag off unless it's goes really bad for the rest of the season.
You say all of that about Mag, but he's stuck driving a Haas!
Are you new to F1? :)
Hulk + Tsunoda!
They already tried to get Albon last year, and for now unless Sargeant starts to mop the floor with him from the next 5 races onwards, I can see him staying with Williams or moving to a manufacturer team.  Tsunoda and Zhou don't sound lile bad options as they would have some solid experience in the next two or three years.  Right now Oliver Bearman still looks super green and mistake prone, even with Ferrari support I think that Haas would push back.
KMag is supposed to be carrying the torch for the next generation, but if he's dropping it, then yeah, I don't see him keeping the position.  Not to mention: Nico is outclassing him right now for that exact role.
Knowing Haas they’ll call Giovinazzi 🤣
I thought Magnussens contract ended next year
Thank you for the measured response, versus having a little fun theorizing who would be a better fit given what we’ve seen.  C’mon, have some fun!
I agree. He got a raw deal with pit stops in 2 of the 3 races so far and scored a point when given an opportunity. And his race pace has been good. I think they had a real chance at a double points finish last week if they waited one more lap to pit and got to put on hards during the red flag. Kevin will be fine the rest of the season.
Dennis Hauger, come on down! /s
Albons got this down 😂
I think the potential sponsorship revenue from Chinese companies via Zhou would be would worth more than the MoneyGram deal, but that's just speculation
I've seen a couple places that Bottas is under contract with Alpha Romeo until 2025. Now, I don't know that that's for sure true, and I don't know if there are any escape clauses on either side, but if there are any on the team's side, that would probably be really expensive. Maybe not if he had another seat- I obviously don't know what the contract looks like.
I want all of this to be true ONLY because we need BottHaas to become a thing lol
From current performance, Tsunoda is only looking at losing his AT seat if they dump both drivers. But, Red Bull has done that before. They've done it in the middle of a season even. I was assuming that OP thought both AT drivers would lose their seats (say if both Iwasa and Lawson really impress), and OP thought Haas shouldn't look at Nyck. Or, maybe they think Nyck will improve. It's realistically too early to make great guesses about any of this, but that's how early speculation works.
I hadn't thought of this. I don't know if AR drop Bot after this season but i wonder if he'd go to haas
Meh, Yuki going from AlphaTauri to Red Bull would be a bit too much too fast. I think getting him into a slightly better car would do well for proving his worth in 2024 (or not) and then a move to Red Bull in 2025.   Zhou would also benefit if he's looking to break into the midfield and take himself beyond just pay-driver status.  I will say I'm extremely doubtful that either Alfa Romeo or Haas (both of whom are cash strapped) want to pay $20 million over the next two seasons for Bottas considering his performance at the moment.
Bottas wants to hold on for 2026 and the Audi introduction.
Komatsu, the chief race engineer for Haas did an interview where he said something to the effect of people in the team felt like there was a couple of races where the 2021 car could have finished in the points were it not for the drivers.  I'm assuming Hungary was one, but I'm not sure about what others.
Like others have said, the 2021 car was the 2020 one, which got points twice, once each for MAG and GRO. It also trundled around at the back of the pack for most of the year. Even if MAG stayed, I think the most the car would achieve was battling semi-regularly with Williams and Alfa Romeo, which Mick was occasionally doing near the end of the season
It basically was the 2020 car, and that was horrible
Both the car and the drivers were abyssmal
I think they should give Gio a shot in free practice to prove his worth. Maybe at COTA?
No way Gio gets back on the grid, even with maybe KMag Nando Bottas Lewis leaving in coming years
Problem is that Hulk may be able to shop around too. Haas isn't a super attractive team to be in. It's probably safer to re-sign KMag.
True, you should be worried about is Charles' and Carlos' contracts in 2024 lol
Albon is the only other driver I know of with a contract expiring in 2023 (well, and Lewis), and I'm very confident Williams will resign him. Clearly things can and have happened with drivers moving before contracts are over, so it could be worth throwing some other names around, but I don't see Haas buying out a big contract for anyone like Bottas unless Sauber could make it a good deal- say because they want to bring on someone Audi wants early. Anything could happen, but Bottas makes a lot more than Haas likes to pay.
ChatGPT, write a reddit post describing why Haas should drop KMags from their driver roster based on his performance this season.
Zhou has proven himself to be an asset to Sauber.  Doubt they let him go at this stage.
Ricciardo had his chance, he turned it down and they snagged Nico.
I mean the question was "how would you approach the Haas lineup and Kevin Magnussen moving forwards?", and that's honestly how I'd approach it!   But if you want a driver consideration, I'd take a chance and drag Stoffel Vandoorne back into F1. Or Pourchaire if Sauber want to stay with Zhou.
Marketing themselves as an “American” team whilst taking a boatload of a Chinese money would be 100% on point for Haas
Believe it was reported when Zhou first signed for Alfa that he brought $30M with his sponsorships. Which is a ton, don't get me wrong, but it's still gonna be a lot less than whatever MoneyGram is paying
I’m not sure Haas could sign Zhou unless he loses his current seat.
Honestly don’t think they would take Chinese money, with the current tension between the west and China. Could end up being another disaster.
Admittedly, I didn’t know Bottas was actually contracted that long. I thought it was until 2024. Then yeah, $20m seems a bit too steep to pay to not drive.  Most likely that Zhou gets the boot then. Or Pourchaire sits out a year (like Piastri) and they extend Zhou another year, but that seems unlikely.  Zhou should have enough experience by then to Steiner’s liking.
Baku maybe, if one of them had a great restart (and Mazepin didn’t try to kill Schumacher).
Worked so well before!
On their current form, I’d do a Danny Ric on the both of them.
Albon is through 2024, and I think he'll stay with Williams for the time being if he can't get anything else going  The others with expiring contracts are George, Lewis, and Lance (all of whom I think re-sign with their respective teams)  And yeah a Bottas buyout to me would make no sense
This is true, but my question would be, would you rather Zhou or Bottas help your driver of the future grow?  Zhou could do it but Bottas could probably help more.
Interesting call with Stof! Would be interesting to see if he could redeem himself after his disaster initial foray into F1.
100% on point for American team to take Chinese and Russia money.
Absolutely fok smashing indeed
It was also later reported it didn’t end up amounting to near that by the time all the money was in and counted at the end of the year
I meann they took Russia’s money and there’s been a good bit of tension there, even before 2022
Lol, I hope you were the Ferrari boss and you did that to Charles just so he'd be saved from the mess that is the red team.
Whoever is fastest.  I think I would lean towards Zhou at this time with the new aero package. He has just as much experience with it as Bottas and seems to have a better feel for it.
Exactly. Daddy Gene has proven he has no scruples when it comes to acquiring money. He just pinches it when it comes to actually developing the team.
Well, for the most part, I don’t actually care about the driver. The car, and the team that developed it have always been the star for me.  However, there are two on the current grid that I would like to see drive for them, because they really are stand out talents.   Verstappen or Hamilton (both will probably never happen).  Leclerc, recently, has given me the impression he is replaceable
You'd be a perfect fit for Ferrari's management lmao. If anything, Ferrari should be begging Leclerc to stay, with the way they're wasting him.
If you say so.
Red Bull is so fast that they can afford to put paint back on their car.
They kinda have announced It earlier, It will be fan made
I want the aqua and pinks to be bright and in your face.
Run the best entries for quali and the race but use the worst entries for practice
I'm really looking forward to seeing the fanmade livery. Is there any way to see the submissions?
Hot pink with flamingos please
~~If we exclude some special testing liveries, is this a first for them?~~  ~~They always raced with their classic livery no?~~  The white one, of course!  How could I forget haha!
Finally something exciting livery-wise
Will this be the Synthwave Alpine livery we've been promised?
A Miami nights neon/synth wave type livery would be so cool
Can’t wait to see it. There are so many talented fans, wonder which one was chosen
People complain that the car looks the same every year but these special race liveries are always a treat
Oh yeah I already forgot about that.
Seeing Guadalajara always remind me of Joey getting mixed up between that and LaGuardia.
I kinda liked these helmets, I kinda would have preferred it still really.
Why are they hyping up Miami so much when Baku is next? I get the America hype but cmon Baku first…
Hopefully it goes as great as it went for Merc 2019 special Germany livery
I hate merc but their miami cap was great
We need the special livery curse more than ever this year.
Dont get too excited, we're not getting a full special livery. The Livery for Miami is one of the Fan Designed livery competitions and the only bit that will change is the Sidepod area if the templates that came out around the car launch were correct.
Checo looks like Alonso in his helmet😳
Why is their one off liveries so cool but when it comes to the real liveries, they don't change anything from previous years?
Most of the time Red Bull rocked special livery, it went terribly for them.
The helmet in the picture looks horrendous, like a textbook example of how to violate good design.
So double dnf because of special livery curse
is the Miami GP track surrounding finished now, or is it still looking fake? especially the painted lake was horrible.
Please surprise us RB, a special 'special' livery on the lvl of the white RB
Is he from Guada?
We knew that already
Nice
They were awesome, you mean.
Can't wait to see it. The white one at Turkey looked incredibly.
Anyone know how they make those custom helmets?  Is it a wrap, or hand-painted, or what?
Hype!!
Dumb question, do they get a new paint design for each race?  I didn’t really notice the designs changing race to race.
Lead paint to make things fair
I'm prepared to be whelmed
Ooooo, I’m so excited to see what they come up with! Sucks that the track isn’t that great.
And I'll be there live!
Just like their “clean slate” livery announcement for this season, right?
This will be 1 out of 3 special liveries for RB this year. The USA special- part 1.
So Red Bull Cheever Racing livery?
Crossing my fingers they make it Synthwave vibes
Ford tribute like the old white Honda tribute?
Ngl it kinda looks like he has a dummy on the front of the mask without zooming in obs
Camo bull please!
I'm just excited to see something different
Ceramic coated even
The difference paint makes in regards to laptime is very minimal tho
Lead paint.
Mercedes seething and coping.
Tear off coating every lap
Can’t fit the salary for a livery designer into the budget cap I guess
Just front wing end plates though wasn't it.
Trying to think if there’s a Red Bull flavor with a vapor wave can
Would be funny but sadly doesn't work like that i think, i doubt they can repaint it in the garage
No there isn't
Red Bull announces new drink... Pink Flamingo.
Was a great two corners
They had a few instances but don't ask me for the years, like the james bond one or the star wars one
istances I can remember: Monaco, various years (late 2000s) Silverstone (2012, 2019) Istanbul (2021)
Silverstone 2007 and 2012 they had their liveries made of fan faces iirc
Not too fast mate, let's see what they come up with first.
No, it's the same red bull livery, but the side of the sidepods and nose are fan designed.
Do you really want a month of nothing but Baku news
Gonna put a protection film on after too
I think the paint thing meant you could add 6kg of ballast elsewhere to improve the balance of the car
*regard to
Too many caterers on staff 😔
the sides of the nose and a bit of the sidepods if i remember correctly
Everying but the part with oracle on it, im worried it will look abir off but we'll see
Honestly perfect time to release a new flavor or limited time gimmick
Easier with vinyl like mclaren
They can wrap though
James Bond must have been early 2019 because i vividly remember gasly in a tuxedo racing suit
Don’t forget the Wings for Life charity ones they used to run; I believe the last one was britain 2012
Yeah everybody is pumped until they come out with a 2022 McLaren Singapore livery 🤢
Yes, the no fun club must be grumpy at all times
Gonna develop the car for Checo.
6kg ? probably 600g
If you're getting the paint to balance the car then you're doing it wrong.
I love this meme
It's basicslly the side of the body, and the end plate on the rear wing. No touching the engine cover/airbox. [This is the template](https://firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_COM_20230203_2034_37_9931.jpg)
They've been doing seasonal releases that are more hit than miss, and some that I wish would've become a regular product. But they all just have 1 "color" and then the chrome bull aesthetic on the can.  Closest thing I could find was a [pacman promotional red bull of the normal flavor.](https://www.mashed.com/img/gallery/red-bull-flavors-ranked-worst-to-best/3-red-bull-energy-drink-1643136414.webp)  And this is the closest "[livery](https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/0d5bf2ea-formula-1-alternate-liveries-renderings-21-1024x555.jpg)" I could find though it's only spec work from an artist on the 2019.  [Or this Toro Rosso artist spec work livery.](https://www.racedepartment.com/attachments/20170119215406_1-jpg.168751/)
I live near a shop with a huge energy drink case, and I’m always surprised that the Red Bull section doesn’t have f1 branded cans. Past drivers, present drivers, big victories. Hell, do a themed one corresponding to recent events and it seems like it would attract a lot of interest and generate “collector’s item” cans.
In my very unkowing thinking:  Would that hold and wouldn't that be a risk for performance loss?
Exactly.  Or thy hype that RBR got before their launch this year, after they "blank canvas"-tweet. That was hilarious, you could feel it from miles away that it would be the same livery as always, but everybody went mad.
Let's not go crazy here.
Nah, definitely 6kg, read that multiple times and IIRC it was even said on the tech preview for Race#1 on the official F1 YouTube channel. And i read somewhere that generally speaking 10kg is 0,3s laptime so I wouldn't say it's insignificant  Edit: misread the discussion a bit. 6kg is the total amount of paint on a car, not the amount stripped off as it seems.
You’d be surprised with how much Liters/kg’s of paint you’ll need to properly cover a couple square meters tho
Woah those are dope, as a newer fan I've never seen those livery's before and now I'm even more excited to see what RB bring.
The summer edition from a few years ago had me hooked.
I think it's McLaren, or maybe Williams who use a vinyl wrap for at least the full nose of the car. It's held so far, but now that you mention it, everything fails eventually and this has the potential to be either funny or tragic.
Straight form [Alpha Tauri's website](https://scuderia.alphatauri.com/en/painting-performance-f1/):  >Painting a road car usually involves between 25 and 30 kilos of paint, while a Formula 1 car requires just 1.5 kilos. Today, thanks to constant research in this area, the figure is getting even lower, so that the amount of paint required is really very small, which produces a clear weight saving.   So 1.5kg for a while F1 car a the time of writing (2020) and even less now. *Definitely* not 6 kg.   The figure you're referring to is being regurgitated on social media and allegedly comes from a single (unverified) source that claims "Beat Zehnder" said somewhere that the paint weighs 6kg, with the original source/interview of that nowhere to be found - at least not by me so far.
So if the car weighed 1 kg it would only gain 24 seconds a lap, nice
A WHOLE car is around 6Kg. The parts they’ve not painted probably add up to a kilo at best for RB
Couldnt the FIA force teams to cover every bit of carbon fiber on the chassis with either paint or gloss to incentivise actually painting the cars again for teams?
To be clear, none of these were actually created by Red Bull nor ever on an actual car. There are some cool artists out there though that love to create their own renderings, some of which are far better than what we see IRL because they aren't constrained by board rooms, branding guidelines, and contractual requirements.
Unfortunately it’s going to look very similar to the current livery - the only part fans are designing are the front wing end plates and part of the nose
The yellow tropical one and the winter edition fig apple one are my fucking jams.
Paint isn't the only thing they put on though  >"The paint might be light but to get a good finish you end up doing quite a lot of filler work and prep on the bare carbon before you put the paint on  https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/f1-teams-strip-off-paint-go-faster-2022-04-26/
Yeah, no, I feel like the graphs converge dramatically somewhere before that point 🤣
The car weighs a bit more than 6kg  /s
Misunderstood that figure, mb, you're right!
But why
> none of these were actually created by Red Bull  where these just random fan made renderings or commissioned by RB like this one?
> front wing end plates and part of the nose  Short of changing sponsorships on the car I'm not sure how much more you could do
I mean Ferraris weighs about that after the fire is put out
To incentivise actually painting your car with a livery.
Fan made. There’s some cool artists out there like Sean Bull who do livery concepts for fun, but it also ends up being great advertising for them and can get them real work designing liveries for real cars.
Yes, we are checking.

It's almost like he was a good driver all along
A big credit is that Nico was always available in the absence of one of the drivers, which allowed him to present himself on the track. For this, Nico is known for his sim work.
Happy to see him doing well so far
Hulk has been a decent surprise thus far but the true test will be how Haas does as the season progresses. They started off reasonably well last season as well before they dropped off considerably.
It's been just 3 races...
Enjoyed the podcast.
Nico has the talent to have been a WDC, but never made the right decision (or had the right luck) to get a better seat (mainly the timing of Nico Rosberg retiring after Hulk had already signed for Renault and then of course 2020 when he was rumored to get the Red Bull seat over Albon)
He always was.   Anyone who thought he wasn't should have been on medication for whatever was wrong with them.
  people can forget that he won the 24hr of Le Mans on his first try.
Not only available but proving he can jump in and extract performance straight away almost
I think the new sponsorship, and maybe a smaller car repair bill than last year *should* allow for more development throughout the season. Also, Hulk having a pretty deep well of experience should help push development along.
Still better than the previous contracted driver.
His race pace has been a bit mweh, it was better in Australia but that doesn't say much yet, however he has reached Q3 every time so far.
He was also very close to a ferrari seat in 2014 before they went with Kimi.
Pump the brakes on the WDC bit. He was a good midfield driver who could’ve been a solid #2 at a big team but he was never in the same league as Alonso, Hamilton, Vettel, Verstappen, etc.
I wouldn't say WDC level but multiple time race winner and in possible championship fight. The many possible moves to Ferrari (replacing Massa) or Mercedes (replacing Schumacher or Rosberg) will forever haunt me and I'll always dislike Renault for not allowing him out but that's life.
Oh... Max together with Hulk could've been interesting, I know they get along really well but I'd be curious how that holds up lol.
Wasn't he also considered for a Merc seat too?
He’s half-right, Hulk was once coined the next Schumacher, but he fizzled out in subpar cars. I’m confident Hulk can win races in the best car, but at the end of the day he would be outclassed by the Verstappens and Hamiltons of the F1 world
Didnt he have one of the best junior careers ever compareable to people who went on to become wdc? Why shouldnt he also get to win a WDC if hes given the car?  Making such statements seems pointless when the car you drive makes like 70% of the difference between beeing on the podium or at the back of the grid.  Just look at Bottas: in the arguably worse car (but not far from being equal tbf) he smashed Perez in 2021 despite having double the DNFs and taking a ton of grid penalties for testing engines and also got twice as many poles in that season than Perez got in his entire career and yet now that Bottas is in an Alfa he is lucky to be in the point while Perez is almost guaranteed to finish on the podium.
I believe Max originally pushed for Hulk.
Yeah hulkenberg and hamilton both won gp2 in their first season but their career trajectories couldn't be anymore different

Normally the new liveries on older cars are decent-ish for me but this one just doesn’t do at all.
This livery highlights how UTTER SHIT Alpines liveries have been since 2022. 2021 & 2020 were so much better man🤦🏽‍♂️
That's definetly an old car painted on Alpine's colors. The floor is a dead giveaway, the 2020 renault had a much wider floor.
Why's there a blind guy at a gaming festival? Don't the majority of games kind of have a prerequisite that you need to be able to see the game to play it?
Keep the blue off this car
Unrelated but is insomnia any good. Been thinking about going for years
And once again Szafnauer and BWT destroy a nice livery
I hope it's in the new Forza Motorsport game when it comes out
Alpinocchio
What the fuck is happening with that nose? Is that what they really ran with in 2020? That whole front area doesn’t seem familiar to me.
Fuck BWT, all my homies hate BWT.
Shit looking like a borzoi dog
It's even got Esteban's number on the front and Pierre's on the back. Someone wanted an early finish the day they were putting this together.
Probably because the livery is pretty trash
There isn't such thing as a 2020 Alpine livery
That's what happens when you insist on keeping your company colors intact and you have a sponsor who insists on pepto pink, so you just do both...it turns into these ugly liveries. As much as I hate the pepto pink, the car would look so much better, all pink or all blue.
We got one good year of Alpine liveries. And they absolutely smashed it.
This 100% the 2020 car. The nose matches, the sidepods match, the airbox, the bargeboards  They al do not match the 2021 Alpine, and no Renault car before 2020 had this nose, airbox, sidepods or bargeboards
The slim nose was in the 2020 car. Older models had a much wider one.  Unless this thing is an exhibition car made up of mix of several cars...
The plaque next to the car said 2020 Renault Alpine F1 Car, and had all the technical specifications of that year's car
That's what the plaque next to the car said. It even had a bunch of technical details about the car, including dimensions, weight etc...
It is though. You’re wrong
Floor edge and airbox very much tell me it is.
It’s the [2020 Renault F1 car](https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/renault-2020-car-livery-melbourne/4738292/) with a Alpine livery.  Confidently incorrect
Keep the pink off this car.
It's definitely a nice experience if you are into the gaming world. There are a few different ways to experience the event. 1) hard-core lan party. BYOD, camp onsite and play any games non-stop for 4 days. 2) Watch the esports tournaments on the several stages. 3) check out the sponsor booths, cosplay merch, and the fan experiences (like alpine, British army etc...).. I'm not a gamer, I was there for work, but it's a pretty interesting event. I woudnt spend more than a few hours in it though. Im Not into games, at all.
It’s a very common thing for showcars, Ferrari have been presenting their new car with both numbers for at least a few years now.
Same shit the 2020 Renault black & yellow livery
That's because this is a frankencar. made up of several pieces to be shown at exhibition. That's why the sidepods and the nose match but the floor does not.  The 2020 cars had a square-shaped floor, you can look it up if you want.
>Unless this thing is an exhibition car made up of mix of several cars...  Yes, that's exactly what this is.
Ignore this person, their wrong. It’s the 2020 Renault (now Alpine) no part of the car is from another year, it’s all 2020
>and had all the technical specifications of that year's car  No, the floor is not the 2020 car's floor. This is a frankencar, which is a very common thing in exhibitions.  Also, Alpine didn't exist in 2020, it was Renault.
The Aston Martin that was at the Houston Marathon earlier this year did the same thing - 5 on one side, 18 on the other.
Ah, ok then. I'm not keen though - just makes it one degree more obvious that it was actually raced like that.
[Floor looks right for the 2020 car](https://cdn-6.motorsport.com/images/mgl/6D1LqMG0/s1200/renault-f1-team-r-s-20-livery-1.webp)  Do you want to be more specific about what you mean? 2021 had the cuts, so it's not that, and the car is much too wide to be 2016 or earlier. 2017 to 2020 all had roughly the same floor size, but with progressively more detailing.   Again this lines up with the picture being a 2020 car with a 2022/3 livery.  Edit:~~The bit I don't remember form 2020 is the little cooling vents and duct by the halo, looking around for comparison pictures.~~ [Found one, the duct was added later in the season](https://cdn-1.motorsport.com/images/mgl/6gpbaqa0/s8/esteban-ocon-renault-f1-team-r-1.jpg)  It may well be a frankencar, but I'm not sure the floor is the dead giveaway
The floor is also the 2020 floor. It’s not a frankencar. You can look it up if you want
Its the RS20 for sure. Its not a frankencar or a show car. Its a legit car with all of the aero present.
Everytime i see Ralf flying, i can't stop thinking what would be going on Michael's head seeing him take off.
All ten footage have a Brundle in there commentating, am I right?

Maybe I'm wrong but the feeling is that they might have a more aggressive development plan this year.  Last year they never brought massive things to the F1-75, maybe the biggest update was the Paul Ricard floor, instead I remember that Red Bull always had something new here and there.  Would be cool for the championship if they can fix this car and make their concept work well again... we'll see.
I‘d leave the tyres on.
Not to be an ass, but are these tweets written coherently in Italian. I swear I frequently have to double check the comments to see what they mean.
Going to be a long two months..
Man, Ferrari really is Italian, or?
Errm, Aston Martin and Mercedes are going aggressive too, plus those two teams have the best in-season development rate. We are more likely to see them win a race this season than Ferrari. Again, this is just my observation, not a statement as I am not an engineer/mechanic.
Wonder if the reason they didn’t do much updates was because they had so much development of the f1-75 before the season even started, meaning there was less of a plan to update it from the start in order to not compromise the 2023 car’s development.  I wonder if their 2023 car was neutered heavily because of the mid-season 2023 rule changes last year, leaving a lot of their concepts as inferior when red bull may have started the rb19 later in the season last year?
The biggest difference is that last year’s development took a lot of time to arrive on the track.   Who really knows what was the financial situation of the team last year, it wouldn’t be a surprise if Ferrari blew most of the budget before the season started. As a consequence, updates became scarce and very separate from each other.   I can recall a few different floor specifications, the rear wing for Canada and the French Grand Prix upgrade. Apart from that, Ferrari’s development of the F1-75 was fairly limited. Mercedes and Red Bull did a much better job in that area.   It appears as if Ferrari now has more room to work with, development wise. That’s why they’re going aggressive with development. Looks like Ferrari is following the right path, develop the SF-23 and then decide whether the concept (a.k.a philosophy) is the issue or not.
In Barcelona also they brought good upgrades, that helped them be above RB again, despite their engine amd strategy going boom, but generally yeah they were outdeveloped by both RB and Merc.
You mean like how they used up their budget way before the end of the year in 22?
Leave them on permanently? Congrats you just decided the strategy for Charles at Monaco. Bottas pays his respects.
Italian to English can sometimes be a bit all over the place.  The jist is that Ferrari is gonna go aggressive with the development plan with upgrades planned for Baku, Imola, Miami and Barcelona. Their impact will influence what stays and what goes on the 676 which is the project name for the next years car.
They are working on a package of upgrades to be finished in Spain. This is consistent with the developments they have tested out at the last two races. They are trying out different parts to get a clearer direction of development from Spain onward.
Mostly, with the caveat the way journalists, especially sports journalists, use Italian is a clusterfuck that isn't fully correct. It's something that is mostly accepted by now tough.
We are checking
Comments like this always make me wonder lol. What else are they supposed to do? Not update their car? Like, yes, others will also update their cars but so what?
Updating car post TD39 would be useless. Because car characteristics changed after that.
I'm thinking they realize the potential is there for a contender with upgrades and aggressive setup changes. The season isn't going to wait for them to get their shit together, time is of essence
The Barcelona upgrades were pretty substantial. In Spain, Ferrari were clear of Red Bull in the race until the failure.

I like that brown is trusting stella to evaluate where the team needs to improve from a technical talent-perspective.  People want to get brown out of there but I think he’s giving the team the tools they need to start change: more investment, more autonomy / less micromanaging, and hopefully better acquisition of facilities and talent will follow suit.    Stella probably still has some affinity for ferrari and their engineers to some degree, but I think so long as they push to get guys in higher positions such as sanchez, and do the same with recruitment drives from other top teams there can for sure be some kind of growth.  Every midfield team is now / has been doing the same recruitment drive as mclaren after witnessing aston’s success + natural cost cap ceilings leaving some staff from top teams available, the issue now is red bull and mercedes will have to rely more heavily on their “advanced technologies” divisions to offshore their best guys to keep them affiliated + pay them high enough salaries to keep the midfield away.  In order for midfield teams to poach top guys from top teams they’ll need to offer enormous salaries with benefits that may force their team size to be smaller, but what choice do they have at the moment other than to play the top team’s strategy with developing “advanced technologies” divisions.  Aston’s already on course to develop one, will mclaren do the same with mclaren applied technologies even though they sold that division off?
I have the feeling that Seidl leaving is the best thing that could have happened at Mclaren.
Sure👌
Yes, one would expect that as normal operating procedure upon departure.
I kinda think Mclaren is stuck in a negative feedback loop. It’s hard to attract/retain good talent when you’re not competitive, but you can’t become competitive without the good people who make that possible.   I’m sure they can turn it around, but it’s an uphill battle that might take a couple years. There’s also the danger that changing too much too quickly could make the situation worse.   This is assuming that the leadership structure in the organization is oriented so that everyone is moving in the same direction. I’ve worked places where there’s multiple directors with different ideas of how to run things, and that gets in the way of executing the task.   In those cases, the project still gets done, but it happens very slowly, with cost overruns and unnecessary delays.
Brown: When in doubt, add sponsors.
The review:”we’re not good enough”
Strange way to say Seidl was right and we were wrong
This is the closest he has ever been to admitting that McL was hiding behind Daniels struggles in the car. Now that he’s gone the headlines are all about how shit their car is and how weak they are in the technical department.
How’s that working out?
 No shit you fired him you coward, you non accountable pos. Every gain McClaren earns this year is due to the ppl Zak fired to get the heat off of him. Teams do not make major turns on a dime. You will not see the difference of new hires until 2025 or later. Granted he was involved with production of a complete shot box of a car. However, all the credit for the improvements he also deserves credit for.
Can someone explain why Seidl continues to be held in reasonably high regard?  Guy comes over in 2019 during McLaren’s resurgence, presides over a halt of this momentum over the following three years, smirks a lot and has Zak babysit/cover his media duties, leaves and refuses to elaborate. I don’t understand.
Zak brown never was the problem, people just need a scapegoat.
Who the hell wants brown out of there? He's been nothing but great.
Why would you say this?
IMO I think that Seidl departure is more a win for Seidl rather then McLaren suddenly "have a fresh restart", and to be honest when I read this article it feels more like Brown is having more influence under Stella and time will tell of that is a good or bad thing.  Having three technical directors is also something where someone like Newey would think like "oh, they going to doing it again? HAH!", I barely seen such structures working in the current era of F1 and Davide Sanchez wouldn't have a major impact on the 2024 car but rather on the 2025.  Also it isn't fair to solely putting Key under the bus, McLaren has an aero problem and guess who is responsible for that too? Peter Prodromou, and guess who is head of aerodynamics under this three TD system? Exactly, Peter Prodromou!  I'm not impressed by Davide Sanchez at all, often he made a mess when he was at Ferrari until Simone Resta come up to basically rescue the car and cleaning the mess Davide Sanchez has made.  And if there won't be a deal with Honda "soon" for McLaren then this team is basically given up everything beside 2025, how longer that deal takes how more time Honda would lose in terms of R&D.
With Seidl and James Key gone, I would like to think McLaren is near rock bottom and can only go up for here. That being said, good on Brown to shake things up and here's to hoping for the best. McLaren does deserve better, especially with the driver talent they have.
Yeah it’s going great
Which is why they’ve done it.
Well Aston Martin managed to get good people from RB and Merc even though their results were much worse than McLaren. How did they do that? Well they paid better than the market and imo this is the biggest issue for McLaren, they do not have the resources or decided not to allocate them to the F1 team. They should’ve went ham for better people after their debut in 2022 when the car was still 1 sec off pace in race trim compared to RB and Ferrari.
They have 2 more than Alfa Romeo.
Which is why they’ve made the changes…
They can both be right.  Their car has been struggling but Daniel was consistently underperforming given his salary and a clear liability in the fight for 4th in constructors. He was brought in to challenge for the main seat at mclaren, he wasn't doing it.   In 2021, Lando scored 160.daniel scored 115.   Lando scored 122 points in 2022, the 2 Renault scored 92 and 81 points respectively. Daniel scored a mere 37. Lando should be the minimum benchmark Daniel is aiming for because Lando has the exact same car, and he is a far more experienced driver.   Put it this way in 2022 if Daniel had just half the success Lando was having with the car, mclaren would have got 4th.
Deranged
Like ferrari, or whenever things go south in most teams.  People are asking for mike elliott’s head for the mercedes concept, but if they start axing people left and right they’ll become weaker.  Red bull has had remarkable stability ever since they signed newey, no one was ousted from the team etc… even in the renault turbo hybrid days they were tight (aside from the renault engineers lol)
Oh boy, after Saudi Arabia, people were calling Zak nothing but a fat American businessman who is not qualified to lead McLaren. One of the posts about Zak's statement about the team's performance was filled with comments basically dunking on him for sucking and how he has the most sponsors for the slowest mobile billboard in F1.  Idk how to evaluate CEOs of racing teams other than by the sponsors they bring in (Zak is probably the best at that) and how quickly they can make personnel adjustments when the time is needed (hopefully Stella turns out to be great).
Bro look around here long enough and there’s a vocal minority who want to see some heads roll.  I feel comments like mine are needed to reinforce that that narrative is stupid for the sake of redundancy
Because there was no progress since Seidl took reigns in the middle of 2019. The car already was an upper midfield fighter. Seidl managed to keep the niveau at first. The 2020 and 2021 cars were great on some tracks but on other tracks  the car suddenly was really bad.   The first real test for them was 2022, where Seidl and his team had to built a completely new car without a good baseline, like they had before (the 2019 car).  The 2022 car was the most uninspired of the whole grid and really showed a bad development rate after the initial performance gains of solving the brake issues.  Seidls and Keys legacy in 2023 is a car, which was the laughing stock of testing the second year in a row. If he wouldn't have left Mclaren we would now talk about him being the wrong guy to lead the team.
Why can't both parties get away good? Seidl left for the role of CEO which isn't the same as team principal anyway. Obviously, Brown would never give Seidl his own job. We can only guess if Seidl would have also left Mclaren to be team principal at Alfa/Audi.  I am also not sold on the matrix structure BUT Andrea Stella has a long history as engineer and is the head of these people. In a way it is not so different to Newey, who is the head of his senior technical staff. Just that Stella managed additional things as team principal.  At the same time, Stella isn't as bound by other activities, like Horner or Toto are, for example. Zak Brown is ready to take a lot of media duties on himself for the team and manages everything sponsor related which should enable Stella to keep a close eye on his senior technical staff.  There are some great and some bad cars Sanchez designed, so it can go either way. However, his backlog of F1 cars is worlds above Keys cars.  I don't know much about Prodromou but I imagine there is a reason they advance with him instead of Key.
You realise the legacy the have right now is from Seidl’s reign, right?
Early days on Stella’s reign but already a lot more optimistic than last year.
not a news article really
For sure, money is always a factor. There was also probably some word-of-mouth that helped. If an Engineer hears that someone they know, respect and enjoy working with has moved to AM, they might be more receptive to a move.
They’ve not made changes on their own. Outside factors made them make changes
Thanks for putting into words what I've been tossing around in my head as a McLaren fan for the last year or two.
Agreed. McLaren is strange in the sense that, I can’t blame them for making a lot of the decisions they did. Honda and Key seemed like slam-dunk obvious choices that simply fell flat. Even Seidl seemed like a good move at the time.  But it’s a good sign that they’re willing to move on relatively quickly when something isn’t working out. I have high hopes for Stella.
Thanks for giving context.  McLaren have been really hit or miss, although many miss in the last years. Even during the Honda times, their poor car design was often hidden by the engine woes. It always amazed me that a team with such resources had such development issues. Sure, Seidl should have improved this but somehow didn't. I will be surprised if with the personnel changes ongoing they get to the root of the problem.
According to Stella the old structure limited Prodromou in particular from being involved in the aerodynamics. This structure allows him to use his knowledge more to assist the development. We’ll know if it works when they start bringing upgrades that this technical team have made, potentially around Summer time.
The problem at McLaren isn’t the personal. It’s the horrible infrastructure
McLaren thought they had to cut their workforce in 2020 to meet the cost cap conditions in 2021/22. However last year they realised they didn’t need to do that and so started recruiting again. In particular the aero team which was cut down significantly. Stella led the review of their technical team and they’ve been recruiting aggressively adding engineers from Ferrari, AMR and Red Bull, with more to come. That’s more of the news story but when you read the headline, it’s just ‘company carries out review’.
This restructure started months before it was announced. And anyone who saw their situation last year would say the same.
the racer had an article that OP likely used as an 'inspiration' to write this. Suggest you read it, its good.
I think it's easy to look back and be disappointed with Seidl, but F1 is such a fragile sport and I think even just maintaining position in the WCC is a really impressive and difficult thing to do.    Given the turmoil McLaren went through in the years before, I think a bit of a steady/safe, if uninspiring hand is exactly what was needed.    The hope now is that McLaren can be more aggressive, with quicker and more ambitious developments.
So what you're saying, Adrian Newey's former right hand and his number 1, Prodromou was basically kept just on the sidelines, and not allowed to work on the car. Prodromou was aero chief on some of the most dominant Red Bull Vettel cars.
It’s both. They can’t put all the blame on their lack of infrastructure when they were able to put themselves on an upwards trajectory in 2019. They know they’re underachieving with what they have and they know they need the personnel to be able to exploit the benefits of their new infrastructure. No point having all the new stuff and not having the right people around to use it.
It was both. They are fixing the infrastructure, it’s built & is currently being correlated and is all due online later this year. They also let too many technical staff go during Covid & the cost cap reshuffle and it’s caused them big problems, they realised it last year and have been on a big recruitment drive. There also needed to be some serious restructuring in the technical department which Stella is in the progress of doing.   We don’t know the ins & out of what has happened with the 22 & 23 cars but suffice to say, it happened under the watch of Seidl & Key. Both are now gone, one voluntarily, one dismissed. Seidl’s role at McLaren would be coming under a lot more scrutiny if he hadn’t departed for Alfa Romeo’s last December.
Seems like shit management if they thought they had to cut but recruited instead.   Is incompetence more of a headline?
Not that he wasn’t allowed but that his influence was limited by the technical structure. It was too simple from the sounds of it and people didn’t know what they were supposed to be doing without stepping on someone else’s toes. It sounds like this ‘matrix’ structure, albeit a more simplified form of it, will allow people like Prodromou to actually have a say without worrying that he’s going to infringe on someone else’s authority.
Well the guy who overlooked the cost cap mess is now Audi’s CEO so good luck
Well, then they're fantastic.  Welcome to the future!!!!!!!!!!!!

Mercedes doesn't need a plan B because if the option presents itself, his seat is Plan A for half the grid
I'm sure they have multiple plans depending on when exactly Hamilton quits.
Ferrari: Amateurs….we are already working on plan Q….
Russell developing into a great driver probably eased a lot of concerns about Hamiltons retirement.  Like sure that seat will attract many names but outside of Leclerc i don't see any top driver that would be able to lead the team. But thankfully for them Russell is slowly stepping up to that role.  I guess they will try to entice Leclerc to join them. Besides that i have no idea who they could go for if Lewis decides to hang it up unless they buy out Norris from his contract.
Does anyone really believe this. A billionaire CEO and no Plan B.  Come 'on sheeple.
They do not think about Plan B because they have already Plan B developed.
Why is everyone talking about Hamilton quitting. He hasn't once suggested it's a possibility.
And yet another "Will Lewis quit this week?" article (ok, this year, but you know what i mean).  This is getting extremely boring.   He, and Merc, just had one of their best race weekends (other than George's DNF) in over a year and still the "will he quit" articles continue.  Each year his contract has been up for renewal, Toto and Lewis have both said they are happy to let talks wait until they can relax together and sort it out and both have stood by their word each time.  Another non story.
This is spoken about way too much
Lando, Charles - they got options
I love Lewis Hamilton but there's no way they'd ever admit that if they were.  That would just be bad PR with zero benefit (it's not like his seat would be hard to fill).
Verstappen to Mercedes 2026?
Lewis isn't going anywhere, dude is way too competitive. Like Alonso, they are probably going to have to drag his ass away from the car.
I don’t think Lewis quits, but he might retire.
Definitely \*not\* thinking about popular, underutilized Australian pilots
I don’t see Hamilton leaving F1 until he has 8 championships to his name.
Norris would be a no brainer
They're a huge company, of course they have a plan B. And a plan C, and D, all the way up to plan M probably.  De Vries is probably one. He's their Formula E champion.  Leclerc would probably love to make the switch for less money than Hamilton.  Imagine Mercedes going for Perez, he'd be all over it. RBR would once again be without a decent 2nd driver.  I can see Lando Norris taking the seat next to Russell, too.   Why not Sainz.  Or bring back Maldonado.
Simple answer is Mick coming in as Georges Partner.
Why would Hamilton quit?  Even If he loses 2008 to Massa (which I think is very unlikely unless it hits courts and judges literally order the FIA to make it happen), I think that would just spur him in to try and get two more championships to beat Michael.  Unless he somehow gets a serious injury I don't think he'd consider retiring for a good few years yet.
After Hamilton i only see lando getting the seat for mercs and he would give a tough fight to Russell and if they have a championship winning car it'd be epic
Plan A is Lewis Hamilton.   Plan B is a set of steak knives.  Plan C is you’re fired.
They still got Mick in their back pocket.
Albon waiting in the wing to take on as Seat #2 of a top tier team. Mark my words, Albon will end his career with one WDC and multiple constructor wins. He’s a very good driver (yes i propagate Albon praise everywhere i go).
Mick would make a perfect number 2 for George.
I can't imagine him retiring yet.
What do you wanna bet Toto watched the end of Tom Brady's tenure in New England and learned that you don't unnecessarily throw away a GOAT level talent, regardless of where they're at in their career.
Please Merc, save Charles!
Hamilton isn’t going anywhere Mercedes knows it. If it were not for Toto, Hamilton’s contract would be so much lesser next year
Leclerc will come knocking around, I'm sure. Also Toto has hyped up Charles in recent media interviews. That is the Plan B.
Bullshit. It's a multimillion dollar franchise. They have a million plans and just as many insurances in worst cases.
Yeah the Wolff became a billionaire by not having an eye on all the outs. Uh huh. Lmao ofc he has plans for every continuation of every possible outcome.
WDC Felipe Massa might be avail.
Lewis is not quitting F1
1. Hire Lando Norris 2. If that fails, hire Esteban Ocon 3. If that fails, try to sway Leclerc or Perez 4. If that fails you are basically left with Mick Schumacher...yay?
I’d love for Hamilton to walk out mid season and have mick take his seat
I doubt they would ever opt for Plan B, since they have other options available to them no need to waste time thinking about it
I don’t think Toto will let Mickey to drive the second MB if Sir Lewis indeed retires. No Mickey no.
Probably Norris or Ocon, the latter being a bit less exciting.
I would be curious if they needed to pick for 2024 who their driver would be in the event it wasn't Lewis. Lando doesn't have a buy out in his contract. Leclerc's deal isn't done until the end of 2024. Would they make George Driver A and get someone like Sainz or Checo? Would they promote Mick? Danny Ric? Would Fernando Alonso drive for Mercedes?? It's a good question because the stars aren't quite aligned for them to land the ideal replacement
Lewis will stay for now because he is enjoying the fight with Alonso. IMO, Nando and Lewis will both retire at the end of 2025.  Leclerc will be the favorite for that seat when Lewis eventually hangs up his helmet. Lando will be in contention as well, as long as he can beat Piastri convincingly.  Persononally,I think Piastri will get the better of Norris.
Because Lewis never quits.
Buy Norris contact. That's it. Toto has a billion. I'm sure he can buy it.
That means Lewis staying on is the plan B.
Why would they lol, any driver would go to them and they can pay any driver they want.
If Russel gets on top of Hamilton on merit this year will they still pay Lewis a crazy amount to stay for another year and why ?  will Lewis stay for less ?  Wil Russel push for financial equality and Mercedes dish out 100 million for both drivers ?  Stay tuned .....
Hamilton has way too big an ego to quit.  He's feels he's right on the cusp of getting a major record...i don't think he has any chance of it...and i also think max would end up breaking it in the next decade anyway...but hamilton doesn't see it that way.
Aaah Merc sandbagging
Mick Schumacher!
Give Mick the seat
They wont pay him $70 Million anymore if George is doing same job with same/better results for $15-20 million. I don’t think that this a better decision.
It's pretty damn obvious that it will be Norris.
I get the feeling that whoever replaces Hamilton will only have the seat untill Antonelli is ready
Plan B is known for his rapping not so much his racing
Nando lorris
Why they need a plan B if plan A is already there, sitting beside Toto every race?
thats_bait.gif
I mean what are they going to do if Hamilton retires? 3/4 of the field would pay to be in that seat. He isn't retiring so the question is stupid.
Sure they have, and his name is Lando
70% of the grid would give anything to be in that seat. Merc don’t need any plan. Especially when you have Lando wasting time in a tractor.
I don't really accept this. i know the Merc seat is still highly desirable and they won't be lacking for options but it seriously makes me question their leadership if they haven't got a robust future proof plan in place.   granted you would never say it in public and they have always doubled down on support for lewis at every turn but i sure do hope they are not caught napping.
I would assume plan B is just offer lando the seat
They absolutely have back up options: I think the two at the top right now are Lando and Leclerc (if they believe they can get him).   Beyond that I assume they would be keeping tabs on a couple names: De Vries (would be easy as he’s already in house), then some more weirder ideas: bottas ( he knows how to work with the team, is reliable as a number 2 and might want to take another crack with Lewis gone, fernando (very outside but would a supposedly short term but high upside driver).   No chance they haven’t game planned out every possible outcome for a driver.
Yeah, it's fine. I'll take the seat.
I didn’t know Hamilton was pregnant
They dont need to think because plan b is named Mick Schumacher
Toto said it so it must be true!
Jesus there was more ads than content on that site. I could barely read anything before there was barely anything to read. Why would Mercedes openly say they were considering anything after Hamilton...it would show as a loss of confidence to the other teams.
Crazy how some people here thought last year that in the future Nyck de Vries would take the seat of George or Max's number two, LMAO.
Lol exactly, can't see anyone except the RBR guys who'd turn down the offer when Merc comes knocking on their doors.
It would be ironic if bottas come back to win a few
I actually have my conspiracy pants on and I’m convinced Toto and Lewis have an agreement to leave together after the end of 2025, Vowles is taking over Mercedes, Russell is given the lead role, Mick comes back, Williams is turned into an alpha Tauri sort of Merc b team with Hamilton buying into it
Imagine bottas comeback
Mika Hakkinen will end his sabbatical for the Mercedes seat.
Eh, they had to scramble like crazy get Bottas when Rosberg quit.
Plus we all already know who it would be.     Lando. It was always going to be Lando.
I appreciate somebody saying it. So many people think way too hard about Merc/Red Bull/Ferrari's driver plans when it doesn't matter, because when the time comes they'll find someone, they are the end goal to a very large percentage of the best drivers in the world.
Leclerc will be the first choice for Merc, and he will jump into the chance. I would love to see him at Silver Star. Ferrari ruining his prime yrs
I have a 🔥 take that is probably closer to the Andromeda galaxy than fire, but:  ***if*** Hamilton retires; Alonso takes Hamilton's seat; Toto and Alonso butt heads a bit, but they sort things out and Alonso gets to be the lovely racing gremlin we love; and Russell gets developed as a talent even further.
Any company a tenth their size will have a whole alphabet of plans
I’m most large companies it’s actually required by the board to have succession planning for all important personnel. They absolutely have multiple plans and are likely always having exploratory conversations in the background with agents just in case. Thinking otherwise is completely naive.
We are checking
I think Charles really wants to win with Ferrari so i don't know if he'd take the offer. Lando on the other hand, Id love for him to be in that seat.
Yeah, I was going to say that too. They have a plan B for Lewis, it’s George.  As for plan B for George, they’ll have plenty of options to choose from.
I’ve been very very impressed by Russell. That boy knows how to drive.
To be fair, the plan was always (I believe) for Lewis to assist George and his transition to a top team and preparing him for the no 1 driver role for when Lewis does actually retire.    I don’t think anyone was unaware of the talent George has and the potential for him to be a champion. otherwise why give him a seat at Merc.
The two most likely drivers they could offer a seat to, and that would probably take it, are Lando and Albon (eternally and criminally underrated). They could also go for Mick (if they dare put their money where their mouth is) or Yuki if he doesn't get the RBR seat due to some shenanigans.
Dont Russell and Leclerc want to be #1 driver?
I think Norris would be a better fit for Mercedes.
Buying out Norris from his contract doesn't seem like a bad idea honestly.
Lead em into a wall or a gravel trap
Not sure if it’s even possible to buy out Norris’ contract since he has no get out clause. I would pick Leclerc over him anyway if I were Mercedes.
Toto is Batman confirmed?
A billionaire CEO with no plan b who had a sudden short term replacement to find a few years ago.   I agree. No way. It'd take five minutes to think about!
Baku is 3 weeks away, we’ll see so many non-stories for the next few weeks
Yeah, Toto and Lewis are basically family, and Susie loves Lewis as well.  Lewis will leave whenever he wants, most likely after he wins his 8th, if that isn't possible, he and Toto will probably head out together.
Na it's definitely weekly lol  Toto has said he expects Lewis back. Lewis has openly said, multiple times, he intends to stick around for a bit longer.  But everytime there's an article questioning his retirement that leaves out his quotes explicitly saying that's not his plans, it goes to the top of r/F1
Hamilton certainly did not have one of his best weekends in over a year as George beat him throughout the entire weekend.
Not if Helmut has anything to say about it.  Helmut vs Toto, battle of Austrian super villains.
Russell is clearly Hamilton’s successor.
Has contract till 2028
This is Toto's wet dream.
I doubt he’d move anywhere unless RB messes up BIG.
The only way I see Lewis retiring is if he somehow makes his way to Ferrari and they break his spririt like they do all their drivers
Mark Webber?
He is not getting any younger, and it's getting a bit difficult with RB cars ahead of him. Merc will need time to get to the top
Maybe as an honorary team principal or something.
All undoubtedly accurate or at very least plausible. "No plan B" is hyperbolic. Every team has plans A through Z. I guess maybe Mercedes *could* skip B, but they'd still have a C.
He’s not ‘losing’ 08 to Massa. Massa is considering his legal options which almost certainly means some kind of suit against Ecclestone/FIA for loss of potential earnings/career damage, but the championship itself is set in stone
Very basically, he might be sensing that an eighth could take years. At the moment it seems a hard bet it'll ever happen. Then who's the smart one?
Aaaand we lookin plan B, quesion
They already have their plan B. It’s Russell.
They would probably go after Albon before giving Mick the seat, at least I would. Albon is a much better F1 driver than Mick and he's close friends with George.
I think they’d also look at De Vries, Bottas, Albon, or Fernando before Mick. Mick was struggling mightily last year at Haas, vs Magnussen, I think he has potential but that would be throwing him in with the sharks when he’s barely shown an ability to swim in the shallow end.
netflix would love that at least
I imagine that British GP would be a memorable farewell.
Me personally, I don’t think they would go for Danny or Alonso. I think it would be either Leclerc which seems like the most likely option imo, or Norris or Checo. I don’t think Nando will want to leave AM for now and Danny, as much as I love him feels like too big of a risk.
That’s not how contracts work and obv Toto wouldn’t be paying it personally lol
I don’t think toto would be paying for norris’ salary out of him own pockets
They don't just pay that money for sporting reasons they do it for his marketability and the sponsors he brings
Hey if Russel wins 7 titles and has 103 wins for Mercedes engines and have the largest fan base in and out of f1 then definitely
Lol vettel was younger than him when he won his 1 wdc and went on to win 4 consecutively there is no guarantee that red bull wins after that
I mean all (or at least very nearly) F1 drivers are hyper competitive and want to win. Why wouldn’t Lewis want to win his 8th?
I and many other people have this feeling that max isn’t going to hang around for as long as the likes of Hamilton, Alonso etc. he’s already been in the sport since he was 17 and I swear he’s spoken in a way that makes me think he’ll move on eventually onto something else and doesn’t care for the records.
red bull can fuck up any year and max may never win a title again. Im pretty sure the order will change again in 2026
Hamilton’s salary varies between £29m and 35m, depending on year.   No idea where some of you get these made up numbers from. You’re likely including money Hamilton earns via sponsorship and bonuses which has nothing to do with your point.   https://racingnews365.com/f1-driver-salaries-2023  https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-news/88574/f1-driver-salaries/  https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/formula-1/driver-salaries-hamilton-verstappen-leclerc-29372866  https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/f1/formula-one-salaries-lewis-hamilton-27399769
Obvious to redditors.   Except those that are sure he's going to Audi.   And those that think he's going to Red Bull.  And others who know he is staying at McLaren forever.    But yeah, obvious
Russell is going to veto that one mate
He'd be a good second driver to Russell.
It’s obvious in the sense that reddit and random bloggers seem to desperately want it to happen. Other than that it’s not obvious
It’s a little too early to say anything about mini Kimi though
Perez might even take the offer.
Max to mercedes to shake up the media, and challenge himself
I could see that for a gap-filler.  Bottas still has good pace and they left on good terms.
I like those pants.
Williams X44 does have a nice ring to it
I want what you are smoking buddy. Mick isn’t coming back, and Williams is backed by Dorilton who wont be looking to become a B team
If we’re doing this then I’m imagining a Seb comeback.
We are checking
Keep your ‘ead down
Question 🙋
People said the same about Lewis and mclaren , all it takes is shitty workplace culture and choking championships   Ferrari seems to have both covered
I think Lando will use his relationship with Seidl to jump to Audi, then partner with a popular second German driver to get people interested.   A Mick Schumacher perhaps
Win? His new target is to finish a race.  https://www.reddit.com/comments/12dqyod?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=4
And I think Charles wants the WDC more than he wants it with Ferrari. Winning it with Ferrari would just be a bonus, his goal is to win though.
I think Lando wants to win with McLaren as much as Charles wants to win with Ferrari.
As much as we all make fun of Ferrari and their fuckups through out the seasons, every driver ( including Verstappen and Hamilton) would love to win a title with them.  Imagine Ham winning a title with Ferrari after 17-18 years. He would be GOATED forever. Say what you will about Ferrari but winning a title with them means prestige which you would never achieve in any other team.  It is such a shame Vettel never won with them :(
Does he? I mean, I guess the Ferrari name still has some appeal, and whoever wins next with them will go into the motorsport history books, but winning with Ferrari is several years in the future at best. In the same amount of years Mercs has way better chances of winning, imo.
Did you not notice him drag the worst car on the grid up into the midfield? Did you think that was random?
Goosebumps whenever I think of Sakhir 2020... so close to being the 1st reserve driver to win a grand prix (I believe)...
Lando, Albon and Mick are all feasible, I don't see Yuki getting the seat unless he performs extremely well this year, which I doubt
I just want albon to be given a shot at a good car in a good team instead of that pan-pressure situation with RB
Are you talking about Bottas? Because they gave him a year contract each time because they had talks with Max in the past and had George in the pipeline.   Bottas was the back up
Absolutely.  Oh well.    This is the way.
....the one where Hamilton took second?   Just to be clear. You're saying retirement is now more likely...because Hamilton took second and was elated with his team about it
Ahh.  You are one of “them”.    George retired.   Lewis took second.   Pretty sure that means Lewis “beat” George.    Incidentally, prior to last weekend, Lewis had more points than George.   Or is there some other reason that George was beating Lewis that didn’t involve points!
He can leave if the team isn’t meeting performance metrics
Yea mate
De Vries and Bottas might want to look first to beat their teammate before they can get considered to that Merc seat, which they are struggling to do on a consistent basis (Bottas) or even at all (De Vries) at the moment.
That's not what I'm saying.   Of course he would want to win it...i'm saying he doesn't realize it's a fruitless endeavor.
Thanks HarrierJint, you're probably right. I am in the wrong to make that assumption, do u know how much does George's make as base pay?
Nice piece late last year that McLaren are planning their various drivers (Palou etc.) to be ready in the not-wild eventuality that Norris leaves or Piastri disappoints. McLaren have their plans, so I'd imagine Merc do too.   Surely Norris, indeed. But perhaps he'd rather wait and see what happens with RBR. Although interesting from Tost this week that Tsunoda to RBR in 2025 looks very possible.
I don’t think Russell has nearly enough power to veto decisions on the second driver, especially if it meant getting what is probably the most talented driver not on a top team
Idk man, the signs are there, we thought it was early to talk about Max too
Hate to say it but he wouldn't be given the offer
He would be stupid not to.  Mercedes will find it's way back to the top again and his chances against Russel are probably a little bit better then beating Max on merit .
No lol, he'll be a number 2 driver anyways. Might as well be it in the fastest car then
Does Mick mean nothing to anyone?!
Jokes on you, Toto comes out and gives Susie the seat.
I can see how that might work, and I love me some VB, but I think it would pretty quickly turn into:  "Okay Valtteri, we're going to let George through after turn three."  "Sigh."
Maybe so but VB has mentioned several times how he feels much better about himself and much more freeing as you can see a lot more of his personality now than when he was at merc. I dont think he’d want to go back to be a second for Russel of all people. He’ll probably retire after his Alfa stint or join another low team.
Lmao Charles, Plan L
Copy, Understood.
Lewis *did* win with McLaren
Popular and successful German driver who comes out of retirement to drive for a new German team…where have I seen this before?
Someone as crash prone as Schumacher isn't getting that seat especially in the cost cap era
spain without the a
Russell being good shouldn't surprise anyone. Even in F2 he wiped the floor in his rookie season with one of the most packed grid ever.
I'm not as serious about Mick or Yuki lol, I don't actually see it happening but they're options.
Rosberg.
Russell broke down wtf are you talking about lol. He was beaten.
Very difficult that RBR won't reasonably meet the performance standards before the change of regulations tho
How are you so certain that it is fruitless? Things can change quickly in F1. Brawn GP came out of nowhere to win in 2009. Red Bull were dominant for four years in a row and then were nowhere near Mercedes. Red Bull are again dominant. Aston Martin was nowhere last year and now is one of the quickest teams.   All it takes is finding one loophole, one innovation, or taking advantage of one new regulation, and everything can change.
Lando has talked repeatedly about how he really doesn’t like the RB culture, and he turned them down in the past a few times
Its probably going to be Norris, or maybe even Leclerc
Depends on what Mercedes would be looking for. If they've got their eyes on a promising rookie, but the moment comes too soon, a more experienced driver could be their preferred choice.
Except if Hamilton goes to retirement, and Russel goes to RBR or Ferrari. Then Merc night have some knee-jerk reaction.
I hope you say that only because of his age.
Idk man a person that wouldn't be good enough to beat George but will do everything in his power to hinder Verstappen would be pretty solid.
For me it’s more. He may be given the offer. But it’s not like he’s be driver one given Russell beat Hamilton last season.  I don’t see a world where it’s not a sideways move in his eyes.   He’s 33. If he moves it will be to be driver 1 somewhere
I agree, but he doesn't seem to think he's a number two driver, and he might think he can beat Russell and be the #1.
Micks purpose at mercedes is to be waved around occasionally to collect brownie points with the media. Until he actually lines up on the starting grid when hamilton or russell are out of commission i dont believe that they actually intend to let him drive the merc.
I am sure he means something to Mercedes' financial advisors.
Does Mick mean anything to Mercedes if they can get someone better?
He’s an average rookie, what are we missing?
Mick and George could actually work for Mercedes in a Hamilton-Bottas way. It could avoid headaches for Mercedes if they are fighting for the title. And Mick is no slouch. He was champion in both Euro F3 and F2. He deserves another chance
Not anyone trying to win races or championships.  Honestly, after all the nuthugging of Mick that Toto has been doing since they brought him on, it would be hilarious watching him justify never giving him a seat if Lewis leaves.
You mean comes out of the closet and gives Susie the seat as divorce settlement?
Where would hamilton be if it wasn’t for the level headed bottas? Lol
I wouldn't imagine he'd be asked to #2, but I can see your point.
“For now”  -	Felipe
It’s been 5 years since Seb has been good, and there are still three years before Audi takes over. In 2010, Schumacher had been out of F1 for 3 years too, but he was brilliant in his previous season.
Felipe Massa never would have survived
I get downvoted when I say he can beat Max, which a truly believe he can.
I think we mean the same thing, I was talking about Bottas being the back up plan when Rosberg suddenly retired
Toto didn't hire Rosberg, or are you talking about when he retired? If you're talking about when he retired suddenly, Bottas was the perfect Plan B knowing they had Russell coming up in the future. Fast, good at qualifying, isn't too close to Hamilton.
....beaten? Lewis and Russell raced for all of half a lap before Mercedes decided to split them.  And more to my point, Lewis was THRILLED with the result and blowing up all over on his team. Of all races to think Lewis would call it quits, you choose the one that made him lively and excited lol  "Ahhh yes, he's heaping praise on his team and screaming for joy. Clearly a man who is beat be his teammate and retiring" lol
Which is 2 years prior to 2028. He has an exit clause if the team isn’t performing. Neither you nor I know specifically what that entails.
Because Russell exists.  He is matching Lewis in quali and race pace which is more than what even Rosberg used to do at the time.
Really? That’s interesting, bcs I feel like RB culture is significant better than other teams’. It’s crazy competitive and obv if you aren’t performing, you’re out. But it seems like they really value those who perform well.
Lemerc era is definitely on my F1 bucket list.
There's a reason Max and Lewis mention and rate Lando highly. If they think he's got it, he do got it
I like this timeline.
Norris will end up at redbull in 2024/25.
Perez is far more reasonable than most would guess. There is reason to believe he would be happy to leave Red Bull if another potential title-contending seat was open.
hot take, its Albono
I want it to be Leclerc so he can 1) be in a competitive car and 2) shove it to Russel when he out races him week after week.
It's probably going to be in several years, as Hamilton himself as openly stated
Its an interesting one, because I agree that they could be main considerations, but at the same time, I feel they're both drivers who are (or were) very loyal to their current teams. Charles has deep roots at Ferrari. Somewhere like Ferrari is/was very much home to him.     Similarly for Lando, McLaren have worked closely with him, and he has been very cooperative in negotiations and has shown a great deal of trust/comfort with being #1 at the team.   However, the lack of performance at both teams _is_ wounding, and it can only go on so long before a driver will jump ship to another team.   Mercedes, Ferrari and McLaren are all in an interesting spot though. Regarding performance, you could list them respectively, but __none__ of them are currently capable of putting a serious, sustained challenge up to Red Bull. Moving now might be a side-step or net a few more podiums, but it's a big risk when realistically none of them are ready to challenge for titles in the current circumstances.
I think there’s a chance that Hamilton stays long enough to let Kimi Antonelli rise through the feeder series and then get promoted directly to Merc. That kid is on a meteoric rise AFAIK and he’s in the Merc academy.
Yeah its hard to see why he would turn it down. I know he loves Ferrari and it was his dads dream but at a certain point enough is enough dealing with the Scuderia
Albon?
You're right and they may even want to avoid a Hamilton-Rosberg situation by taking in an experienced driver who might not be as good as Russel. But let's face it, Perez is getting old and he's no Alonso. Assuming Hamilton retires after the 2025 or 2026 season then Perez would be 35+ years old. Doubt they'd wanna pick him up then.
I definitely think that Kimi Antonelli is the driver they hope can replace Lewis in the future. He is only 16 years old but he is one of the biggest talents in the world
I hear there is a Rookie currently racing with an Merc engine driving a hypetrain
Lando is the sweet spot.
Get Vesti in there!!
Grosjean gets that drive after all. You heard it here first
Hülkenberg to Mercedes confirmed.
I still think they'd be looking a lot harder at LeClerc or Lando or someone along those lines.  Maybe even Ocon.  I do love Perez though and am sure he'd do admirably in the seat.
Ahh yes. The Valtteri Bottas condition.
In before Hulk to Mercedes!  ^(only for Mercedes to be incapable of scoring a podium)
Russell won't get a seat at RB with Verstappen there and won't choice Ferrari over Merc
You're missing that his dad was fast and that his dad had a ton of die hard fans. He is average at best but you'll never see anyone admit to it because of his father.
De Vries never got his Merc seat either, Merc doesn't keep reserve drivers around to take seats in the main team
Ah.  My fundamental point is that Wolff has been caught on the hop before so I don't believe he's got no backup in mind.
Hamilton was outpaced throughout the weekend. Nothing more to say.
Yeah I was referring to the original comment.  If the team didn't perform in 2027 he may use his exit clause (if it does actually allow him to just get off the train for the following season) but it'd be weird if by that time Hamilton was still in the Mercedes and they still didn't have his replacement all set up imo.
So having a more competitive teammate means that Lewis will never have a chance at winning another title? What? Even if George is closer, Lewis was the better driver last season, despite the fewer points.   And how many races has it been this season? Are people really writing Lewis off because of a few races?
I don’t know exactly the time stamp, but I think there were a couple times in Beyond the Grid where Lando talked about it. One was talking about how he decided to reject joining the RB young drivers because of how controlling and competitive it is. And he also mentioned hearing about the culture from Carlos, and I don’t think Carlos has great things to say about the RB culture.   He also talked about how when he was in F2 (I think?) Marko approached him and it was very bizarre. He started asking Lando a bunch of weird and technical questions and then talking about how Max would know the answers. It didn’t seem like it left a good impression.   He’s made some comments about George being less fun at Mercedes as well, though that may have been taken a bit out of context.   Honestly the biggest reason why I think Lando will stay at McLaren is that he likes the culture.
Ledestiny
Thoughts on a dark timeline giving us LecBull?
Agreed ! Leclerc deserves a better team than the shit show he joined.
Most likely. If they're smart. If Christian blinks at the right time, Toto would be smart to make Lando an offer to avoid racing against him.  I think. I hope.  I like the guy.
Yep. Horner has been pursuing Lando for years now, and McLaren hasn’t looked more hopeless for the immediate future since about 2015. If Norris is ever going to leave McLaren, it’ll happen either this year or next - and Red Bull doesn’t have a succession plan for Pérez, who is currently speedrunning Carlos Sainzing his way out of the RB family. The puzzle pieces fit, it’s just a matter of whether they will fall or not.   If it isn’t Norris, I wouldn’t be shocked or disappointed to see any of Albon, Hülkenberg, Ricciardo, Herta, Vandoorne, Pourchaire, or Hauger (Hadjar doesn’t quite look ready yet though he’s still got the entire season, and I really don’t buy the hype on Iwasa or the little that remains for Lawson) get the seat - each of them has either proven that they have second-tier talent at minimum and are more deserving than pretty much any driver besides Norris of a car capable of winning or has impressed greatly in the junior series but been passed over.
Merc wouldn’t offer him the seat though
Not sure I see it. I could see Norris or Leclerc giving up on their teams and jumping ship more. Unless there's contract time/wording preventing that choice.
Crazy how Albon is considered a top driver. He just  beat Latifi last year. Thats it. People tend to forget how bad Albon was in 2020 in the Red Bull and how much better Checo was in the same car. There is a reason Red Bull got rid of Albon. 1 season of beating Latifi doesnt make him a top driver
Sure, but who's betting on Ferrari or McLaren challenging before Merc? I'm certainly not.  I don't see McLaren ever really mounting a serious challenge again as it is. They've only gotten further away from it.  Ferrari seems to run on passion. But passion doesn't build a car or think through how to win a race or championship.  I think Leclerc's reached a point of realising he will never win with Ferrari as the team it is now. The way he talks, it's like all he hopes for is bare minimum.  I think this year may get Norris to that point with Mac too. They've taken steps back, not forward.
Albon and George at Mercedes would be the closest duo to create Rosberg & Hamilton situation; childhood friends, similar ages, both similarly talented.
If that was the case then Perez might as well stay put, it's the same role
A Kimi is exactly what we've been missing in F1.
Fernando Alonso?
Oscar Piastri? Or Logan Sergeant? Or Lance Stroll?
I'd think RBR would want to shoot their shot as well if Lando is available.
Vesti is great but he's not nearly aggressive enough yet.  Needs some time to mature.  But then again we're almost surely talking a few years into the future here.
Albon to Mercedes, Vesti to Williams if he does well in F2. That would be great
Fucking finally. Sniped by Hamilton as Mercedes’s second choice in 2013, sniped by Renault as Mercedes’s first choice in 2017…
I'm not sure if LeClerc would be willing to make the move and risk being #2. And I'd think RBR would be interested in both if available, especially Norris, who would probably be very interested in that move. And I don't think Mercedes would pick Ocon over Pérez though.
Stranger things happened.
Rusell was outpaced throughout last year tbh, but noone cares just look the the standings
By that time Antonelli will be in that seat
>Lewis was the better driver last season  Disagree. They were neck to neck in quali and race pace - https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/10cv16f/2022_teammate_qualifying_and_race_pace_gaps/  Note that if a driver qualifies low in a good car, their average race pace will be higher.  >Are people really writing Lewis off because of a few races?  No. Its because Lewis hasn't had a teammate who could actually challenge him since 2016.  It is not out of reach to assume that the Merc car post 2016 had more potential that even Lewis failed to extract. No one is perfect.
Lando is also a very competitive person, he will stay at Mclaren as long as it aligns with his long term goals, and that their development aligns with potential championship aims.   I think if he’s looking to switch he’d have most of the top teams attention, I think the reason that RB comes up a lot is because Checo has shown an inability to keep up with Verstappen in any competitive way, and they could be looking for a number 2 in case in future seasons the gap tightens up and they need a better driver. The reason Audi comes up is because Seidl is there lead engineer, who designed a pretty good car, and Audi has deep pockets and would seemingly be an attractive option
Lecaas it is
It’s wild that Ferrari is considered a shit show. They absolutely are a shit show. It’s just wild that they aren’t serious contenders.
Landos consistency is up there with Max and Lewis Imo. He needs more experience running up front , but once he gets that, he will be a force.
I’d love to see Hulk in RB next year just to give the dude a podium
Leclerc, Sainz, Ocon and Piastri all have their contracts end at the same time as Perez. I'm taking all of them over anyone you named. Maybe Albon. Hulk will be 37, Danny is also getting a bit older and has been bad the last couple of years. The other 4 have proven nothing compared to the drivers I have named.
Why not?
i'd recon they would like someone more of a Bottas than a Roseberg
no one is saying he's a top driver, but hell make a good henchman with the right setup
Lando would be closer tbh
George would have Albon covered tbh
I do not think Albon is remotely quick enough for that.
I'd love an Albon/Russell line up at Merc!
Year 2057, Checo is still saying that he has a chance to get wdc this year!
Could you imagine? Record for most races without a podium followed by WDC? The ultimate proof that the car makes the biggest difference.
At some point you have to back yourself, know you've got the talent and work for it. Lewis became WDC by pushing his talent against Alonso, against Nico, against Seb in a different car but he's still Seb. Prost had quality teammates, Senna too. Anyone who is good has to push themselves against others on their level.    If Charles or Lando or anyone else suggested doesn't have the conviction to do it they'll miss out
He was in the latter part of last year but this year George is the real Bottas 2.0 in that George has stepped the fuck up every session and if he actually keeps it up will truly be the Merc #1 if this trajectory continues.
That’s a bit misleading though given that they weren’t really driving the same car for part of the season. Look at those posts from Canada onward. I don’t know the specific gaps for that time period, but Lewis was ahead of George in quali and race pace like 60-70% of the time. When he wasn’t a guinea pig he was clearly better than George, and I would say that’s a more representative sample.
Well, he signed with the team when they have been very open about not expecting to be competing at the front for multiple years, so he knows where things stand and has for a while. I don’t think he would have signed a long term contract with no exit clauses if he wasn’t ready to be patient.   Yes, he’s very competitive, and I’m sure that he loves being the clear number one at McLaren. If he goes to RB he will clearly be the number 2 driver. And there’s a decent chance he would be the number 2 at Merc or Ferrari.   And yes, RB would definitely be interested in him. They’ve tried to sign him multiple times, including right before he signed his current contract, and he turned them down each time. Obviously things can change, but idk what realistic reasons people could possibly have that make them think he’d sign with RB. People pushing for him to sign with RB seem to be unaware of the actual situation.   Audi is the one that I think is most realistic. The timeline matches as well.   But every time people are confident that Lando is definitely leaving as soon as a top seat opens up strikes me more as wanting it to happen rather than based on likelihood in reality.
It's really crazy, yes. They could have won in 2018, in my opinion. And two years ago they a had a good car, just terrible reliability.
It's easy to call someone consistent when he has a midfield car... when you have a bad race it might be the car and not you.... Just look at Perez he was a very constitent with Force India/Racing point... but against Verstappen it's another story...
I mean they only way to get that is to plop him in a RBR and let him go. Rip Perez if that happens though, they are a great duo and I don't think Perez leaves of his own volition.
Leclerc and Sainz, sure, but they have had race winning cars. Ocon maybe but I can’t see him wanting to go to Red Bull - I think he’s realistic enough to know he wouldn’t be able to touch Verstappen but not willing to take a second driver role. Piastri is a rookie (albeit quite impressive), let’s give him more than three races before passing judgment. And nobody cares about when Checo’s contract ends - Red Bull will be happy to buy him out if they feel he’s outstayed his welcome and they can get an upgrade (even if only in attitude).
He’s on the older side compared to their other options, and even now in a top team he’s not winning constantly.  I like Checo, but I also liked Gerhard Berger, and I can say a lot of the same things about Berger.
Because Norris, Leclerc, Sainz, and maybe even Albon would all be younger drivers who have more potential and are currently equal or better than Checo.  Norris seems the most likely option.
If they took Perez given his age they'd just be back here in a season or two, I think they'd be looking for someone that would be there for a little while to get some stability personally
Maybe. Then again, if you have two drivers who can win a race off their own back, that makes life hard for RB who generally only has one. Not to shit on Perez but he's not the driver Max is or the others seem.
just like how lewis did to nico but we are here for it
DONT SAY THAT
Nah. Albon put a larger gap on Latifi than Russell did, and the Williams engineers have said that both drivers were similarly quick but they’d give the slight edge to Russell.   Alex is massively underrated for the same reason Stoffel Vandoorne is massively underrated - neither was able to get close to an all time great at their peak during their rookie and second seasons.
I don't think the difference would be much bigger than Hamilton - Rosberg was to be honest.
Checo: This is my year!  Ferarri: *Issues cease and desist for copyright infringement*
And if he's still racing at *checks notes* age 67 I think we could just give him an honorary title
>That’s a bit misleading though given that they weren’t really driving the same car for part of the season  This is not true. Lewis was testing SETUPS, not parts. They had the same car all season, just different setups.   Lewis wasn't comfortable with the car and tested all kinds of setups until he found one that fit his style halfway into the season.   Russell found his on day 1 and hit the road running. I'd say he was more adaptable than Lewis last year and hence scored better. https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-news/97283/george-russell-lewis-hamilton-mercedes-test-items/
I think he also signed at a time when they were on a more upward trajectory, I might be mistaken but didn’t he renew in the old regulations? At that point they had improved year on year, had Seidl and were very competitive with Ferrari for most of the year and he split up Leclerc and Sainz. Since then they have been on a much less appealing trajectory slipping further back from the top and losing their place as the best of the rest.   Also the timelines didn’t really make sense for a RB swap and none of the other seats were open, Checo had a decent first year with some promise, so not sure how advanced his talks with them got, Ferrari just signed Sainz and Mercedes has signed Russell or we’re about to?   I think at the end of the day Norris is going to have a lot of options as long as he maintains his form, and that he wouldn’t just stay at Mclaren because he likes the culture if they don’t improve the package
You mean last year right?
I still think it’s really weird that 2018 is considered the year with more title potential than 2017. In 2018 Ferrari were absolutely outdeveloped by Mercedes and could barely challenge for wins in the last half or so of the season. 2017 was closer in terms of points, and if you take away the crash in Singapore and unreliability in Malaysia & Japan the title goes down to the wire. More things would’ve had to have gone Ferrari’s way to win 2018, imo
Funny that 2018 was also a year they were caught cheating 😅    All that being said, it was exciting seeing those 2017 and '18 title challenges. Really feels like Vettel made some critical errors and Ferrari development simply couldn't keep up with Merc
Disagree. In the midfield its much closer and you have to contend with many different strategies. The front runners are generally a few seconds apart and are running similar strats. Not to mention starting mid pack and dealing with everything that entails.   Also, thats how all cars work. They might be better at some tracks, but worse at others. See: Mercedes. Lando extracted the absolute maximum out of the car in 2021. There were very few races where he was the reason he didn't finish in the points or below the target points.
I don't think it's really an apples to apples thing Perez in the FI vs RB or Norris in his Mac vs possible Merc seat.  It's a different beast between midfield (McLaren wishes this year) vs front running. When they're tusseling for top 3 everything ramps up to an extreme degree.  I mean it's not gonna be as heated and desperate when you're fighting for 7th.
Yea but will they be willing to buy him out and also buy someone else out? There isn't a viable option as a free agent next season really.  Piastri is going to be very good. The list of drivers with his junior credentials is Hamilton, Leclerc and Russell and that's it.  Not sure your point about Leclerc and Sainz tbh. You don't think either would jump at that chance to go for red bull over how inconsistent Ferrari is?  And Ocon the same imo. All it would take is a few dnfs for Max and you have a legit chance to win a title. Wouldn't you take that over the potential that Alpine have?
What if they take someone from F2 instead?
And Albon got punted out of a lot of points.
Kept saying they should put alex back at the bull, the dude certainly can fight for it now
Hamilton - Bottas at best
I did not mean they were literally driving entirely different cars, but that the setups were so experimental that at times they basically were different. Doing wildly experimental setups can have just as much of an effect on car performance as testing a new part. Those experiments were done to try to fix the team’s problems, not his own.   There’s a reason why Lewis in Canada was thrilled to stop the experimental setups and joked that maybe George could be the Guinea pig now.   [Here](https://www.racefans.net/2022/06/11/hamiltons-recent-deficit-to-russell-is-due-to-set-up-experiments-says-wolff/) is Toto saying that Lewis was struggling due to experimental setups. Those setups were being done in an attempt to solve their huge porpoising problems, not because Lewis couldn’t get to grips with the car. I trust what Toto says more than I trust George talking himself up.

Let him be the race director
*signs himself on 5-year-deal*
I would love to see a grid with Christian, Toto, and Alonso as TP’s. The shit stirring would be next level.
Imagine Alonso as Ferrari team chief..
> Damon Hill  If you were curious, like me, and didn't want to go to the article itself.   _______________________________  It's from a podcast (i.e. another lazy article) where they were talking about the late red flag at the Aus GP.   > Alonso took to the team radio and said: “Stupid rule! How the hell you can put a red flag before? Maybe it’s because we don’t complete a lap, we go back to the same positions. It happened in Silverstone.”  > “We were making a joke that he should be a lawyer. I’d get him to defend me in a murder charge!” Hill said, speaking on the F1 Nation podcast.   > “It’s boring driving the car, he needs something else to do. He’s going around going, ‘Can I do the strategy as well? Give me more information.’  > “He already understands the rules. You’d expect someone who’s been in Formula 1 as long as he has and had all the experiences to have learned something, but you can’t automatically assume that.”  > Hill likened Alonso’s mindset to that of Michael Schumacher, a driver that shared a rivalry with the pair during his lengthy F1 career.  > “He’s invested in this, he understands it, and he knows, like Michael Schumacher as well,” Hill commented.   >  “Michael Schumacher understood where the openings were, where the opportunities were, and he took advantage of those, and it’s the same with Fernando.    > “He’s got to become a team boss eventually, because he’d be brilliant. He just understands this game.”
We looked like a bunch of cabrones. Gotta call Flavio
I think he wants to be the retired driver who hands around the pit for AM. Like Prost.
I'd change professions to work for them if the opportunity presented itself.
So when he turns 80 and stops racing?
Real shame about Michael. He would've surely also been a TP or even replaced Stefano eventually
Alonso vs Vettel
And sign himself as the first driver at the age of 55
Hard for me to see this. It seems like the folks who become TPs are usually people who have some driving experience but weren’t big winners. It seems like it would be a big pain in the ass of a job, and he should have lots of money in the bank.
I'm dubious if he we would be a good TP, but he sure as hell would be a great strategist.
He’s sharp with strategy while he’s driving, I can only imagine what he could be like guiding strategy sessions or making quick decisions.
Wowow, Let him finish his rookie season and get some racing in he has a long career ahead before we start talking about future career guys jeez
Team boss and FIA boss. You heard it here first
One step closer to Alonso as FIA Boss
That would be one big disfunction
Too old
Oh yeah like Briatore.
[removed]
Damn. Hill so unpopular that they have to go with 'f1 champion'?
He has always been into the politics of racing, it’d make sense.
It was Damon Hill if you don’t want to open the article.
Hell, he could be a Chief Strategist honestly, might be a better use of his incredible talents. Dude is practically doing it straight from the car.
I think the mind fucking would be world class
Maximum penalties
Alonso for FIA Boss and Vettel for race director. You know, sensible people with love for what they do. You can switch the order obviously, would work too.
Oh the absolute scenes that would create HAHA
10 second penalty to Ocon
All the time you have to leave a space!
“Alonso, why do you keep screwing over Hamilton with your calls?”  Alonso: Karma.
5 second penalty for not leaving da space!
Equal engines
alonso in dts: there are heroes and villains in f1, i am the bad guy   sith lord alonso race director era shall begin
Lewis would never get another race win.
would that be legal? like can Lawrence stroll swap out his son for fun?
Can you imagine how much Shithousery would come out of that
DtS licking chops as I type.
It would be chaos and there would be so much news between races then! 🤣🤣🤣
Ferrari would never fumble strategy again.
He'd be Horner's successor as chief shit-stirrer in the paddock, I don't see that working for Ferrari.
He would be a better strategist in his sleep than the current Ferrari team could ever be on their best day.
Hill, the accidental champion
Team Boss, his passion was racing not politics.   I think the sport would look a little different, the disrespect Lewis gets would be called out. Micheal was always so complementary towards people up and coming people, to the idea someone overtakes his legacy, so gracious, especially towards Lewis.
Alonso doesn’t know how to play politics that’s a L take my man also you fail to consider than a lot of bosses are indeed man babies who try to constantly feed their ego
Eating propaganda like Nikado Avocado gorging on food. Nice.
I agree that those are bad qualities in a boss. Unfortunately many owners/directors find those qualities attractive in a leader. Once that person sees their organization as an extension of their own ego, they often employ their usual bullshit for the company’s benefit. Sometimes with toxic effects…  Honestly I think these qualities are true of most new team principals - save for the occasional career engineer who got promoted into management. And some of the experienced/successful ones just become better at politics
I would love to see Fernando throw meatball flags at people for not leaving the space
Nando with a sniper poping a cap of the person that doesn’t leave da space
Karma
All the time you have to leave da space.
No, not FIA boss
I understood that reference
Idk if vettel would enjoy all the gladhanding of FIA boss.
I assume you mean can Lawrence drive in place of his son?  The answer is no.  You have to have earned enough points on your FIA license thing to compete in F1.
Well I know this is going back a bit but Jack Brabbham famously drove for his own team
Alonso could do it, because he has the necessary Superlicene, Stroll Sr. doesn’t though
Ferrari would also have one seat pitwall.
No way a guy that did a wheelie with an F1 car full speed would consider any damages meatball flag worthy.
So you’re saying Iron Man 2 isn’t accurate?
See also: Dan Gurney, Bruce McLaren, and Graham Hill.
alonso gonna have to be TP, engineer, mechanic, strategist all at once
I'm still confused how that alpine, that self destructed every other race for no reason, somehow poped a wheelie and was still able to pull a P7
Inconsistent rules are F1’s bread and butter
At that time I think it was
Is that not the Monaco Historic Grand Prix? I don't know if that requires a super license.
Tony Stark.
And driver, he's just going to glance at the pitwall as he goes by to update his and his teammates strategy
It wasn't the car, it was Fernando
It can hurt itself but it can’t be hurt by others
The same way McHonda would piss itself every few laps, but still managed to keep going after getting clubbed by Raikonnen (Singapore 2017)
NFL enters the chatroom
Some sort of a super license has existed for decades, but yes it was made significantly tougher to get one in response to Max getting the seat.
I honestly don’t remember, thought it was F1 and that he owned a team. Stark racing or something

Alonso is such a fantastic heel. Him being in a good car is great for the sport.
Excerpt from the article: "Yet the one thing it should not be taken for is a lack of respect, for Alonso does sincerely hold the likes of Hamilton in high regard?"    >In my time at Ferrari,” says one senior ex-Scuderia man, “Lewis was the only other driver Fernando [Alonso] worried about. Yes, other drivers might have been in faster cars and he’d accept that. But on a Grand Prix weekend whenever you’d discuss the challenges, it was only ever Hamilton that Fernando referenced as being a threat, solely because of what he could deliver as a driver.   >I think Fernando had matured since 2007 when, as a team-mate, he’d been shocked that a rookie could be at his level, be a threat to him immediately and had not reacted well. With hindsight, he understood that Hamilton alone stands as something beyond the norm. I got the impression that there was no one else on Fernando’s radar as a rival.”  https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/october-2014/30/decoding-enigma
I hope when he finally does retire , he gets the respect he deserves and is the perfect example of stats don't tell the whole story. He is in the same league as Lewis and MSC as drivers.
Tl;Dr - it's all gonna *kick off* with Hamilton. Eventually. They respect one another massively etc etc but it's Gonna. Kick. Off.  https://youtu.be/IXhNZ9d25eg
Hamilton and Alonso are just something else entirely. What amazing drivers.
I feel like the 2023 season is the season of Alonso and I AM HEAR FOR IT.   merc and AM being similar in performance is gonna make for a great battle as max checks out at every race
I think that Lewis also kind of understands how Alonso must have felt. But if he feels any frustration at all towards Russell, he can imagine how much worse it was for Fernando in 2007.   I can’t think of any analogous scenario in any other sport.   6 years in the sport. 2X and reigning world champion. Took it to Michael Schumacher and Ferrari at their peak. Then he moves to a new team with the #1 on his nose and a rookie teammate. Hamilton’s performance was a shock no doubt.   How could a rookie match his pace? But even though, Fernando did have the experience and in a way it hurt him because he had trouble adjusting to the new car. He struggled with the brakes. And Lewis had incredible luck too. But ultimately I think Fernando would have been fine to deal with it and ultimately beat Hamilton, but the real disturbance was how everyone reacted. It must have been so surreal and confusing to see the team attention and admiration turn towards Lewis. The press was absolutely in love with him. And in the matter of a few weeks, the fans at all the tracks started carrying Hamilton banners and his fan base exploded. This is the stuff of movie plots. Not real life. The young pretender was a real contender. He was the champion and at times he must have felt like chopped liver. The fans loved him. Peter Windsor and the British press had huge massive hard ones for Lewis, and even his team now was over the moon with their British star.   Fernando may be a fan favorite now, but the early half of his career, he was the “the bad guy”.  He challenged Ferrari (evil), he fought Hamilton (evil). That covers the first third of his career. Only when he went to Ferrari did he gain a ton more fans.   Now, looking back at the last 23 years of formula one, if you compile a highlight reel of the 50 most compelling and exciting moments and stories, I think you would watch Fernando being involved in more exciting moments than any other driver. The reason being, Fernando is exciting to watch even when he has a shit car and is fighting for 7th. Other champions only really put on a show when they have a competitive car. If not, they are quite lazy and boring to watch.
Meanwhile Stroll is having an underrated season while still injured and no one talks about it. Alonso is 6 tenths faster than the car and Stroll is like 3 tenths off him, this means Stroll is up there with the best and can go beyond the maximum of the car. He's getting his win this year.
Back in 3rd
Heel is the perfect word for him in my opinion. He's much the same as Marc Marquez or Tom Brady.
As a wrestling enjoyer you absolutely nailed it.
Those are excellent quotes, indeed.
I remember in Abu Dhabi 2010, when he was stuck behind Petrov with the championship slipping away, his first concern was if Hamilton would win the race, despite knowing Webber and Vettel were ahead of Lewis in the points.
I remember an additional quote that Hamilton was the only guy, Alonso felt, for whom the car wasn't 100% the ceiling. Hamilton could come from anywhere, any weekend. If another driver doesn't have the car, put them out your mind. Never Hamilton.
Are people disrespecting Alonso? Maybe imma get downvoted but I feel like he gets more respect then any of the world champions that came after. He definitely gets more respect then Button and Seb and probably more then Hamilton tbh at least from the F1 community he does.
There are numerous analyses of "best ever F1 driver" highlighting Alonso on the basis of beating teammates most substantially.  Here's one that comes to mind; https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-best-formula-one-driver-might-be-a-guy-who-hasnt-won-since-2013/
absolutely. his crowning achievement in imo is his 2006 championship. you can argue that the ferrari in 2005 was neutered for whatever such reasons, but beating michael schumacher (in his prime) with a killer ferrari on merit is legendary
Very much so. He's just never had the car to prove it. Even with Renault it's arguable it wasn't the best car much of the time.
Only people that read british propaganda disrespect Fernando
The fact Aston Martin and Merc arguably have equal cars is what makes this the most fun. This will be a proper arms race, Red Bull can have their championship this is where the real fight will be.
De la Rosa: best lineup of all time, 2007. Bar none.
Something that will always make me sad is that we never had Hamilton and Alonso on equal cars. Imagine how amazing the last decade would've been with Hamilton and Alonso fighting tooth and nail to win championships. Instead we had Alonso fighting random guys for the 14th place for far too many years.
Let's not forget Alonso was 26, Hamilton 22. They were still young, psychologically speaking, and found themselves in a giant and fierce battle the media was feeding like crazy because Spaniards on one side and Britons on the other had very strong feelings about their country not being robbed of the chance to win a title. There was a gigantic amount of pressure on both of them to win and to prove they were better than the other.  Aside from that, some things are bound to happen. Teams work best when there's a clear first and second driver, but Hamilton had way too much potential to conform to the role of second driver. There's a reason you don't see Alonso driving with Verstappen at Red Bull or LeClerc joining Hamilton at Mercedes - their biggest rival would be their own teammate, they'd take each other's points and, as a result, allow someone else who overtake them. I 100% understand why Alonso was angry that a rookie was taking points from him (when that usually isn't the case), but I 100% understand why Hamilton was not holding back his skill for someone else's sake, too, because I would have done the exact same thing. And kinda same goes now for Russell - he's an excellent driver, he shouldn't hold back to help Hamilton. He should aim to beat him.
Hamilton didn't have incredible luck in 2007 what on earth are you talking about? Its the complete opposite, especially in the last 2 races when he had a massive lead in the championship and should have easily won it. And Alonso was literally favoured over Hamilton in the early season and had all the chance in world to keep healthy relations with his team before trying to blackmail Ron Dennis into sabotaging Hamilton's career using his own involvement(emails) in the Spygate Scandal so let's not paint a picture that Alonso was some poor little Mr innocent. He clearly was no such thing.  And entertainment value? Lol. Hamilton has been involved in more box office entertaining moments over his career than Alonso has. Just look at the rivalries Hamilton has had. You're acting like crazy situations like Spa 2008 vs Raikkonen didn't happen to Hamilton all the time, never mind his rivalry with Alonso back then. Hamilton has been involved in more crazy on track battles than anyone. He has plenty of peak entertainment box office moments vs Alonso, Raikkonen, Massa, Vettel, Button, Rosberg and Verstappen - all for podiums, race wins and even championships. I mean what about Turkey 2010 and Canada 2011 vs JB or Bahrain 2014 and Spain 2016 vs Rosberg, for example? Hamilton had crazy rivalries even with both of those teammates. We can list an endless amount of moments with Rosberg. Their last race at Abu Dhabi 2016 was insane. What about Silverstone 2021 or Saudi Arabia 2021 vs Max. Even Abu Dhabi 2021 is box office, despite the credibility of F1 as a sport taking a total nosedive that day. We can also include races where Hamilton's own team has let him down strategically or whatever so he's had to fight back through the field. Hungary 2021 vs Alonso, for example. Nobody cares about that battle if Alonso was holding up anyone else but Hamilton. It was a total 15 minutes of fame moment for Alonso while having to live in Hamilton's shadow for years and years. That's why Alonso can't keep Hamilton's name out of his mouth. He's been resentful about the trajectory of their respective careers for years and he'll throw some shade out of nowhere when Hamilton isn't even thinking about him because of how irrelevant Alonso has been. This about sums up their relationship. Alonso throws shade then Hamilton will just post a tweet about 2007 to shut him up.   From 2007 all the way up to this day the list is absolutely endless for how often Hamilton has reached peak box office entertainemt status. I'd even argue to people who don't want to call Hamilton the GOAT that he's provided more entertainment than any other driver in F1 history.   Alonso, I'm sorry, but he's been out of the game for way too long. Spent too many years in crappy machinery while Hamilton has been up at the front where it counts winning 100+ wins and poles and 7(really 8) world championships. Alonso has what? 32 wins and 2 titles? And he oniy has himself to blame. He ran away from a title contending McLaren instead of face Hamilton again in 2008. Alonso had the chance to become a consecutive 4xWDC with Renault and McLaren from 2005-2008 but he blew it and Mercedes never wanted him because they blame him costing them a bunch of money and ruining a lot of relationships in 2007 as well.
Stroll doing OK for sure this season. Bit much to suggest he's underrated though. Great first race especially given his injuries. DNF in the second race and then a decent run in Australia - but let's be honest with ourselves - a VERY flattering result in the end and not really indicative of the quality of the drive. Not hating - fella is doing well. But hard to argue that he's underrated.
What you're saying makes no sense. You cannot go beyond the maximum of a car, and you certainly cannot go a specific amount of time beyond it.
Let's not forget that Alonso is new to the team and him getting quicker as he gets acclimatised to the car is only a natural progression. Will be interesting to see the pace differences later on in the season.
Alonso was never 3 tenths ahead of Stroll.   0.17 seconds in Australia  0.26 seconds in Bahrain, and Stroll didn't finish Saudi.   All this, with healing wrists btw.
Stroll at 20 points this season has already more than doubled latifis career points in 3 races. Absolutely on form. Gap between the two highest scoring canadian drivers the past 15 years is going to be massive by the end of the season
Who’s your plug? PM me.
Bruh don’t compare Alonso to Brady ever again, Brady has no redeemable qualities.
Someone should be able to explain this better than me, but I think that was because if Hamilton won there was a chance that neither Hamilton nor Vettel would win the championship, but if he didn't he was out of options stuck behind Petrov
Alonso and Verstappen are the same way, as was Schumacher, and almost certainly Stewart, Clark, Ascari, and Fangio, though I wasn’t fortunate enough to watch those old masters at work.
I think fundamentally he's very underrepresented in discussions of GOAT. Hamilton, Senna, Schumacher tend to be the predominant.
As of today, yeah, Alonso's getting truckloads of respect.  Hasn't always been the case however. Many people plain ignored his performance at Ferrari, and the disrespect was at its fullest during his McHonda stint. That, on top of being vilified by the British media since 2007
The parent comment alludes to those who don’t respect him, those who pine over the stats. There are plenty of awful stat-based takes and Alonso is one of the usual suspects in that discussion.   People who know F1, the difficulties involved and the relative luck of being in the right team at the right time of course respect Alonso. Some here would have you believe that success is only measured in titles.  Him tying with a rookie was enough to the seal the coffin for some.
Before this season that was a different story, the love for him has increased immensely since having a competitive car
Alonso has been out of the F1 debate for years, especially as new people came in that never lived the years of Alonso in Renault and Ferrari. Looking at the stats alone, he's just a random guy that won twice almost two decades ago and has been a midfield driver ever since - it takes a bit of knowledge to realize that guy in a mediocre car fighting for 8th place is on the same league as Hamilton and Verstappen at their prime.  I feel this year is different because, with Alonso leading the non-Red Bull pack, a lot of people are talking about how consistently great he has been in 20 years of racing. But that definitely wasn't the sentiment a year ago - people talked about Hamilton, Seb, Schumacher and Verstappen, and Alonso wasn't even mentioned.
[Here's](https://f1-analysis.com/2021/07/08/who-was-the-best-f1-driver-each-year/) another interesting model too that's supposed to show the best performing driver each year
For me 2012 takes the prize. Alonso drove an absolute shitbox and somehow managed to fight Vettel's title up to the last race, where he was one position off taking it. Vettel's Red Bull was a very dominant car, I haven't really seen any other season were a driver could somehow compensate such a great gap between cars with his skill alone.
If you ignore Red Bull, this season is quite interesting so far. You have Aston and Merc quite close and Ferrari not very far behind (Sainz has pulled quite good races so far, and I guess Leclerc will be back into the frey once he realizes the season has started). If things stay the way they are, I'm sure Alonso and Hamilton will enjoy their battle for 3rd far more than they enjoyed most seasons. And whoever loses will have to pretend they don't really care when we all know they'd both sell all their championships in exchange for winning this battle.
The only two GOAT candidates to ever pair each other, in my opinion.   The only lineups that come close IMO are Alonso/Button, Hamilton/Button, Hamilton/Rosberg, and Fangio/Moss.   Maybe you can argue for Verstappen/Ricciardo, Vettel/Ricciardo, Hülkenberg/Ricciardo, Hülkenberg/Pérez, Pérez/Ocon, or Prost/Senna.
Well we did in 2007! And that was cutthroat beyond belief. Had that gone on anymore one woulda killed the other in their sleep.
Perfectly said. 2007 couldn’t have gone any other way. I think Alonso’s bitterness at the time was completely warranted as were Hamilton’s feelings. Only years after can they both understand and completely respect each other and their roles back in 2007.   And yes, had either one of them been given a clear #2, McLaren would’ve won the Driver’s Championship. They (McLaren) completely screwed theme selves. But how could they have known that Hamilton would be the GOAT?  I do think that Fernando got dealt an oddly bad hand that year with his teammate. In every other case of a champion driver getting shown up by a winless teammate, at least that teammate wasn’t an absolute rookie. They all had at least paid their dues in sub par machinery.
I miss spoke. What I meant to say was that Lewis had incredible luck in the first half of the season in 2007. For the whole season, he had as good of luck as Fernando. But it was disproportionate. He had 9 podiums in a row to start off with. That got the hype train going super hard. Had one of the “bad” races occurred sooner, maybe the tension could have been diffused a bit more.   Hamilton is absolutely the GOAT in my eyes. It’s undeniable. But his blockbuster moments aren’t “endless” they definitely are finite. And I don’t know why you think that by saying Alonso may have more then anyone over the last 23 years is a dis towards Lewis. First of all, he wasn’t even there for the first 6 years so zero examples. Then you have the fact that when you have a dominant car, a lot of times your races will be boring. Yes, you listed very nice memorable moments. But there were many races along the way that were dominant and not very memorable. All in all, I think Lewis and Fernando are the two most exciting drivers of the last two decades. It’s simply an exercise of watching the season highlight reels for every season since 2000 to tally up the totals.
Did Ron Dennis write this?   Alonso favoured by who? The mechanics who wanted to work on his car during the first couple races because he was a champion? Hamilton literally admitted that McLaren favoured him in the latter part of the season.   Ron Dennis also siding with Lewis every chance he got is noteworthy too. The infamous Hungary episode is the perfect show of him as a boss. Hamilton starts shit, Alonso retaliates, they get a 1-2, but Ron isn't happy because it was Alonso who got the pole (after getting already worn tyres during his pitstop).   You're so clearly pro-Hamilton and anti-Alonso that it makes taking your comment seriously impossible, especially as you're twisting facts to make Lewis look good.
Except if your name is Lewis and you’re in Singapore.
Race pace is quite irrelevant imo..  As Alonso said in Saudi "if I had been told I had a 10s penalty I would have opened a 11 or 12s gap."  In Australia before red flag Alonso was fighting Hamilton while Stroll was behind an Alpine.
And missing testing
Stroll’s car is infinitely superior to anything Latifi ever drove. I really hope this comment is tongue in cheek because, even though I believe it’s obvious that Stroll is several tiers above Latifi, points pretty much tell nothing.
He’s also won a lot more.
Yep. Seb needed to win, if Hamilton or Button had jumped him it would had been all over.
I have never understood why Senna is represented in those discussions. Prost was his equal (arguably even slightly superior), and both were fundamentally flawed drivers - which is why their fights were so epic. Prost was the master of patience and consistency but was useless in the wet and mediocre over one lap. Senna was a rocketship pilot in the wet and in quali but made many unforced errors and too often struggled to keep it together over a full race.   Verstappen, Hamilton, Alonso, and Schumacher vastly outclass Senna, and in my opinion so did Stewart, Clark, Ascari, and Fangio.
I am talking about the future when they retire. Lewis will be definitely rated much higher than he is now in the future. I hope the same goes for Alonso. Vettel gets the respect he deserves ,Button also more or less.
The F1 fanbase is also one of the most overreactive sports fanbases. The opinion of a driver can change from race to race. One race Checo is getting screwed over by RB the other he is not worthy of driving the RB. There is not another sports fanbase that changes Its opinion of an athlete so quickly.
This one is amazing. Of the 18 years in his original stint he was the best driver 13 times, losing the Schumacher twice, Hamilton twice, and Riccardo once. Dominant.  The 538 analysis showed him really head and shoulders above everyone else. I'm a believer that there's no one more talented and driven in the car. Outside the car he's just too much.
As they said on the race podcast; the convergence across the field is stellar...other than RBR.
Prost/Senna is definitely closer than Hamilton/Rosberg or Alonso/Button. Senna and Prost are both top 5 all time drivers
Nope. The 9x podium streak for Hamilton wasn't luck. Alonso let himself down with subpar performances in races like Bahrain, Spain and Canada. That's why Hamilton took the championship lead from Canada onwards and his 9x podium streak ended with bad luck in Europe where a wheel gun failure saw him end up the the barriers in q3 before the 2 colliding BMW's clipped his tyres and gave him a puncture after a fantastic start from 10th in the race.  And I still completely disagree about this box office argument. We will be here all week going through the box office moments Hamilton has been nvolved in over his career. Its definitely more than Alonso. I mean even Monza vs Charles Leclerc is a memorial random controversial moment that springs to mind. The FIA clearly bent the rules for Leclerc to win on Ferrari home soil that race. This has been the norm for Hamilton for most of his career. Something crazy always ends up happening when Hamilton is in the mix, for one reason or another, good or bad.
> The mechanics who wanted to work on his car during the first couple races because he was a champion.  100% correct. Thanks for posting the fact that Alonso was favoured in the early season, with no team members wanting to work on Hamilton's car, with even internal politics being used by a few staff members going against protocol by asking senior members of staff to make sure it never happened, as they all saw Hamilton as the clear #2 and wanted absolutely nothing to do with him heading into 2007. And in the end Alonso got Mika Hakkinens title winning crew!  > Hamilton literally admitted that McLaren favoured him in the latter part of the season.  100% false information. Hamilton has never ever said this. You just completely made it up. I'll tell you what Hamilton has said though. He's said about 50x that McLaren favoured Alonso in the first five races and it was only in the sixth race in Canada that Ron first have him equality to Alonso.  > Ron Dennis also siding with Lewis every chance he got is noteworthy too  100% false again. Ron Dennis literally admits favouring Alonso on strategy over Hamilton in the Australian and Monaco GP. He also stopped Hamilton from attending the Barcelona test at Alonso's request, due to Alonso being treated as a clear #1 at that point.  > Ron isn't happy because it was Alonso who got the pole (after getting already worn tyres during his pitstop).  False again. Ron Dennis was called to the stewards to explain Alonso's actions and he actually lied for Alonso by saying his actions weren't deliberate when the whole world knows that they were. That's why McLaren were disqualified from scoring constructors points in Hungary. They penalised both Alonso and Dennis for lying.  Also, Alonso wasn't on used tyres. He was on brand new hard tyres that he specifically chose himself because he was more comfortable on them than the softs that weekend (go check the post qualifying press conference where Alonso states this fact).  The narrative that Alonso was on used tyres came from one of two lies Alonso told the stewards. This narrative was created to explain why Alonso stayed longer than he should have done in the pits when we all know it was a deliberate action by Alonso to stop Hamilton getting a final run at pole. Alonso lied and said he took longer than he should have done because he was arguing about his tyres with his engineer. Its totally false. Alonso did not hold Hamilton up accidentally due to arguing with his engineers about being on used tyres. He also made another lie saying that he followed the countdown from his own engineers, which was different from the actual countdown for him to go (when the lollypop was raised). That's totally false as well. There was only one countdown and Alonso clearly ignores the lollypop being raised. That's why the stewards penalised Alonso. He got cought red handed lying and is lucky he wasn't disqualified from Qualifying altogether for stopping a rival from fighting for pole, like Schumacher did to Alonso just the year before at Monaco 2006.  > You're so clearly pro-Hamilton and anti-Alonso that it makes taking your comment seriously impossible, especially as you're twisting facts to make Lewis look good.  Speak for yourself. You are just spewing the same pro Alonso propaganda that came from the Spanish media years ago. Its all so easy to debunk that its laughable at this point. 99% of the Alonso apologist stories from 2007 are 100% false.
Or your name is Ayrton and you're in Monaco. Or Kimi, as a matter of fact.
Yeah. That qualy was something else. As close to perfection as you can get
The teams simulation likely accounted for the metrics it could with some level of caution, hence why their theoretical best was beaten by HAM.  Athletes are freaks of nature but unless they start shooting laser beams from their eyes let's cool it with the blind acceptance and further hyping up something said in the heat of the moment while ignoring context and common sense.
Absolutely. Makes a huge difference.
Cheated more too
Each to their own really.  Personally: Schumacher for taking what being an F1 driver *meant* further. Hamilton for equalling the success with no black marks.   It's easy to see why Alonso would feel aggrieved.
I have no idea where this thesis of Prost being a patient master and Senna an uncontrollable freak came from.  Senna obliterated Prost performance-wise when they were teammates. Like, it wasn't even close in both quali and race outside of the times when Senna's car broke itself (which was way more often than Prost's).  Adrian Newey spoke about the difference in his book and highlighted that there was indeed an aura around Senna and that Prost didn't feel as special.   You can't compare Senna with Schumi, Nando, Lewis, Max because the level of professionalism surrounding F1 completely changed over the years, it's about how dominant you are relative to your time.   I mean, I respect your opinion, but putting Prost equal/above Senna just feels very incorrect.
A year ago Ferrari had the championship in the bag and RBR was on the back foot
In what universe are a driver with poor quali pace and awful wet weather ability and a driver with horrible consistency and very beatable race pace top 5 all time? Besides the one where everybody looks through 80s nostalgia-tinted glasses, that is.   There are eight drivers who I believe to be or to have been *complete* drivers, without a significant flaw in their skillset, shown consistently over at least 4 years. Those are Verstappen, Hamilton, Alonso, Schumacher, Stewart, Clark, Ascari, and Fangio. Vettel had years where he showed that he could be complete in the same way, but he never sustained that level for consecutive years, only reaching those peaks in 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2017. Neither Senna nor Prost *ever* demonstrated that level.   Also lmao at what I assume are your picks for the most egregiously bad inclusions: Alonso >= Hamilton, Button >= Rosberg, and all four >= either of Senna or Prost.
Maybe you’re right. Fire up the YouTube and start taking notes. Also, I chose to go back to the year 2000 because that’s when I started following full seasons of F1. It’s a bit arbitrary, but that’s why.
Kimi in Spa.
Or your name is Sebastian and you're in India
A year ago Aston Martin was the worst team in F1 and Haas looked like best of the rest
Lmao. You're on something. Talking about "objective" truths. It's your damn opinion, man.   You want a flaw for Hamilton? Wheel to wheel skill. And Verstappen hasn't had a WDC teammate so far in his career.
What.
You’re earlier comments clearly have thought and analysis behind them, not raw emotion. I think you’re talking to a wall in regards to the other commenter, based on the reaction.
From 2000? I don't think so. Alonso's box office moments really only began from 2005-2006 when he was first fighting for championships, only 2 years before Hamilton entered F1.  Hamilton was straight box office from day 1 in 2007.
Kimi in Monaco is also a beast. Look into the 2005 pole lap he did. Absolutely majestic stuff.
Not gonna apologize for an objectively correct take that goes against the mystique of a driver and an era that are both lionized beyond belief.
Mate. Alonso didn't start with the best car on the grid. There are moments like putting his Minardi on provisional pole in 2001, or becoming the youngest F1 race winner in 2003. Hamilton never had those moments, and never will.
Yeah you are right, i just think he was the King of Spa.
Provisional pole? Is that a joke? Alonso qualified 17th! Lol  Youngest race winner? Who cares? Hamilton took over Alonso as youngest champion in 2008(before Vettel took the honour in 2010) on top of all the other records Hamilton has over Alonso. One of my favourites has to be winning titles with more than one team. Hamilton is the only driver since Schumacher to accomplish this legendary stat. Its even more significant knowing that Alonso had the chance to win 4 consecutive titles with 2 different teams, Renault and McLaren, from 2005-2008 but Hamilton walked into Alonso's life and wrecked his career. Sent him back to a non competitive Renault and won a title with McLaren instead of Alonso in 2008.
The car they wish they had
What a great 22nd birthday present for Oscar.
I'm thinking why they would be doing this at all, since the difference in them old cars is very big? Could they be running some correlation runs for their new wind tunnel? That said, I didn't see any rakes on the car there.
Why were they testing?
Any idea why the run the car without any sponsors?
I get a kick out of anyone calling this testing. It’s driving.
He would, but he would have still qualified behind RB in Bahrain. Max 	1:29.708 and Perez 1:29.846 in Q3 2023, Ricciardo 1:29.927 and Norris 1:29.974	 in Q3 2021.  Shows how ridiculously quick the RB19 is
According to Wiki, Piastri has never raced at Imola, so may be as simple as helping him learn the track.
Everyone benefits from more hours in F1 cars. Sometimes people use karting as practice, so even an old regulations F1 car is much much closer than that. The same muscles are worked the hardest, and whatnot. I imagine especially Oscar benefits from extra hours, and wouldn't be good to piss off Lando by giving his teammate more advantages anyway. Extra time on a track they'll race at soon is also good for everyone.
According to Formula Uno (I think?) it was correlation work and they’re ‘lucky’ to be able to use a car that was good enough to win a race and score podiums.
It’s not broadcasted publicly so the sponsors won’t be seen on TV either way
I think both of them would take that over the boat they're driving now
and?
Are they hoping to extract a feel as to what might be the issue with 2023 car?   Also, read that the secret to RB19 is its front suspension and last year it was the rear.
Yeah, I wondered that, but didn't bother looking it up. Looks like he hasn't in major car competition at least. I wouldn't be surprised if he'd done private testing there like this before.
True but neither were the tests with the Indy drivers in the same MCL35M but they didn’t removed the sponsors then like this time.
"So how many knots does your boat hit?"   McLaren: "Idk, but it does (k)not finish the race all the time"
They already told you. Not sure what else there is to elaborate.
Mclaren is correlating their new wind tunnel, they can do that easily with the old car (unrestricted testing).
It literally adds nothing but a bit of exchuse me.

No one making the comment of "Hope Gene calls you today instead of you him?"
Pietro seems like such a good dude. I hope he gets his shot someday.
They had to censor out his age when they wished him a happy 58th birthday.
OK, this made me laugh. There are 2 calls to Gene.  "I have to call Gene"  "Oh fuck, I have to call Gene."
*DTS has entered the chat.*
He got to race in two Grand Prix. That's already more than anticipated.  He is a part of the furniture. Might get a run if the stars align but will never get the seat permanently. Many more talented drivers out there.
Being a test driver for the same team 5 years in a row has to be some kind of record.
He's great on camera. I think he has more future possibilities there than on track and I hope he gets them.
Seems more likely his lil bro Enzo (currently in F2) will get the shot. They are close and even have done some sim racing events together.
Yeah you're probably right unfortunately.
Pedro de la Rosa was a test and reserve driver for McLaren from 2003 until 2009.
Haas loves to keep their employees lol
Luca Badoer was Ferraris test driver for 10 years (2000-2010)
Come on Pietro, you can beat that record!
Oh, I just looked a bit more.  Marc Gené was a test driver at Ferrari from 2004 until 2018.
Hmm it says on his wiki that he got replaced by Jules Bianchi for the 2011 season, so I'm not sure that's right. Still a hell of a run though.

The new liaison could hardly have imagined a better start to the season. Aston Martin has built a competitive car that only can't match Red Bull. Fernando Alonso also converts the speed into results. For the third time in the third race, the oldest pilot in the field claimed a podium position. **The Spaniard is hungry for more: "After three third places we are aiming for an improvement. At least second place," said the cheerful ex-world champion after the Australian GP.**  It's been ten years since Alonso climbed onto a Formula 1 podium three times in a row. The proud Spaniard last did this in Belgium, Italy and Singapore in 2013. His new team has already scored more points in three races than in the whole of last year. At that time it was 55 points. Aston Martin now has a total of 65 points – and is therefore second in the World Championship. In Melbourne there was the biggest haul so far: after 23 points in Bahrain and 15 in Jeddah, Alonso and Lance Stroll collected 27 points.  What was actually already clear after one race can now no longer be downplayed or even denied: Aston Martin has established itself in the top group of Formula 1. **"We were competitive on three different tracks. That makes us confident for the future tasks," says team boss Mike Krack.**   **And Aston Martin starts the update machine for them. It starts in Baku (April 30). Team wants to tailor a rear wing for the fast street circuit on the Caspian Sea – suitable for the long straights and mostly 90-degree corners.** It can be assumed that many other teams will also bring a wing for the corresponding level of downforce. Aston Martin will also make a few minor modifications to the car.  **The first really big serve is said to be for the Emilia-Romagna GP (May 21) in Imola. Team boss Krack explains: “We will still have new parts in Montreal and Silverstone. In general, we want to get every small gain onto the car as quickly as possible instead of waiting and bundling packages.** That was our approach last year, and that worked fine for us.  In 2022 Aston Martin made good progress with its new parts throughout the season. But the situation was different from today: **"We came from a much lower level. Now we have a much better basis. It will therefore no longer be so easy to make big development steps. But we are confident with our program."**  **Chief pilot Alonso sees his new squad facing a major challenge. "The season is entering an interesting phase where the question arises: which team develops the car faster?"** He adds: "The level of each team could shift from race to race depending on who is bringing upgrades to the grid and if they work. Red Bull, Mercedes and Ferrari are used to a high rate of development. We are perhaps still in a learning process in this regard." On the other hand, Aston Martin has more latitude in using the wind tunnel: 37 percent more than Red Bull, 25 percent more than Mercedes and 20 percent more than Ferrari.  The green car was probably the second fastest behind the Red Bull in Australia as well. Alonso seemed to be on his way to the front row of the grid, but then he was too cautious. The Spaniard squandered valuable time in the last corners of the final section, worried about being caught flat-footed by the wind. At the start of the race, Alonso slipped behind compatriot Carlos Sainz, but then benefited from the first interruption. Like Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen, he was allowed to do a free tire change in the pit lane.  That put Alonso ahead of George Russell and Sainz. From lap 12 the Spaniard was chasing his old adversary in the Mercedes in third place. Until the second interruption in the 54th round. Alonso felt he could go two to three tenths faster in the open air, but Hamilton made no mistake. An attack was out of the question because he never got into the DRS area of ​​less than a second to the Mercedes.  Hamilton and Alonso played cat and mouse. When the Aston Martin came closer, the Mercedes driver countered on the next lap. Aston Martin admits that Alonso would not have gotten past Hamilton. **Tire management was a top priority. "I don't think we saw the real racing speed [in Australia]," says Krack. "Everyone took it easy on the tires from the first restart to go the distance on the C2 tires."**  **It wasn't all about the wear and tear. Rather, the drivers tried to avoid grain on the rear axle. This was a risk in the cool temperatures**, but was much more pronounced on the C3 and C4 compounds. In general, the Aston team boss believes that you move within three tenths of a second with Mercedes and Ferrari.  There was also some luck involved. At the second restart, Sainz turned the number 14 Aston Martin over. Typical Alonso: Quick-witted, the race at Silverstone 2022 came to mind when the old starting order for the restart was restored after the Zhou accident. The message to the command post came from the cockpit.  "We were confident that the race directors would handle it that way again. It was important for us that the cars were roadworthy. That way we could move into our old positions. There was definitely a bit of luck involved. But we didn't steal anything. We got this good result deserved," says Krack.
Thumbs up for all my hype train buddies. We keep going strong since Winter testing!
At what point does it start to get embarrassing for Lance?
Why would it be embarrassing? Would you be embarrassed by not being able to beat Fernando Alonso?
never? Unless Alonso competely falls off a cliff, I never expect Lance to beat him. But I do expect him to be in the points when Alonso is. Dude is a solid racer, but Alonso is just that much better
Button was the closest driver to Alonso in quali pace outside of the refueling era, and even he was 0.15% off. Vandoorne was 0.31% off, Massa 0.35% off, and Räikkönen a whopping 0.53% off.   Stroll was 0.55% off in Bahrain, 0.24% off in Jeddah, and 0.22% off in Australia. That’s more than respectable.
Lance has performed very well in relation to Alonso so far. 2 broken wrist, missing the whole of testing and still only a couple tenths off.
Never. He's doing a great job against one of the best drivers of this generation.
It's not near that point yet, ask once it's late may
Never, unless Alonso drops pace like an anvil. Alonso is literally the same as his Ferrari years and his (2003-2006) Renault years. Still probably would be able to fight for the WDC with his current pace. Alonso ain't no old man, he is still ripe and ready to go for many more years.  Stroll also isn't far off, only a few tenths against one of the greatest of all time is very good at the end of the day.
I'd be embarrassed being beaten at any sport by anyone twenty years older than me, yes.
Good work on the stats - this is useful
What about Ocon? In 2021 he was 0.005% off in quali and in 2022 he was 0.133% off.
But if its still a couple of tenths in a few races
Then Lance would still be doing incredibly well. No one expects Lance to be beating Alonso.
Alonso is a double world champion and one of the greats. There's like only 3 people on the grid who can match/beat him. Expecting lance to do that is incredible unrealistic
I think Lance expects Lance to
Maybe let Lance do the expecting then
He should. The moment you don't expect that is the moment you have no place in a competitive environment. But that shouldn't mean that its embarassing to not beat one of the best of all time.
WTF

Just trying to jinx them -George
It's the exact same as last year, they're miserable and then have a good weekend at a track that suits their car and come out with all this positive PR, then do badly again at the following race and become all depressed again.  This is more boring than their domination years where they used to pretend their rivals had a chance every race.
Merc PR is so tiresome.
They won’t win every race this season, they will win every race this season and the next -George Russell after they get lapped by RB on a track they are bad at
Just do the McLaren thing: ‘the car suited the track, it wasn’t us. It’s the same car as [insert bad performance here], nothing changed, it was the track.’ So that when you do have a good performance on a track that *shouldn’t* suit the car, you can claim shock. Keep everyone guessing.
insane recycling from autosport. this is what george said after the qualifying
GR is the type of guy, who reassess claims made for PR
He's trying the reverse Ferrari curse.
The betting companies are offering roughly 4 to 1 odds on it happening, and Vegas always knows a hell of alot more than we do. That's them telling you that you can bet on a 20% chance that it happens, and when you factor in that they never give you what they view as the break even odds and they skew it a bit in their favour, they probably only see it at around a 15% chance that it happens.  I think 15% or so that it happens is about correct, because I think it is pretty low. Doesn't matter how much better you are than the competition, you need so much to go your way in the luck department to win every single race especially when there are still 20 more to go.
Thank God, what would we do without Russell's assessments?
This guy is so articulate
Do others share the sentiment that Russell has transformed into a peculiar public relations figure since joining Merc? It seems to me that during his tenure at Williams, he was more amiable and less inclined to express his opinions.
OK.  Why would I consider what a driver has to say?  If this comment was from Toto it would hold more relevance with me and most others.  Drivers drive, leave the assessment to the professionals.
George after RB slaps Merc in Baku: Well we only finished 48 seconds off the RB, very positive weekend for the boys.
What is this voodoo George.
The Hopium is strong in Russell, one race where Mercedes looked good, one Toto admits is most likely a fluke and George is take big hits from the Hopium bong
George Russell is the kind of guy!
>	This is more boring than their domination years where they used to pretend their rivals had a chance every race.  I couldn’t disagree more. Those years were brutal as a neutral F1 fan.
To be fair, journos ask them certain questions and what other answer can you give.   Norris is very honest, even pessimistic at times, is that better? Idk
The same quotes get recycled on different articles for weeks but you guys seem to think the Mercedes PR are giving daily press statements.
Don’t read it then
What an achievement that would be. Winning every race in a single season hasn't happened before. Even when merc was able to lap the entire field while driving backwards with one hand tied behind the back from 2014 to 2016. So doing it two seasons in a row would be an absolutely incredible achievement
Autosport living up to their name by putting their journalists on autopilot
To be fair, he spent more time near Toto than in his car last Sunday /s
Imagine the pain as a Ferrari fan...
I don't get it, there were lots of cars fighting each other, Max always found his way up there, Vettel as well. I've been rewatching 2013-2020 and only 2014-2015 was really bad. The other seasons were much more exciting than now.  I watched 2019 this past week and it was actually a great season. There were 21 races that season and 10 of them weren't won by Lewis. That's half won by other people.   Can we imagine a situation this season where Max doesn't win at least 17-18 races? If not more?   That would be essentially twice as many wins as Lewis in "the dominant years." Just seems like people have this idea that Lewis won every race, and he didn't, Max beat the win record last season with 15 wins, beating Vettels 13 win record that held through the entire Mercedes dominance.
\*agree
PR is more than press statements. Although Merc released that too weird global apology. It's als the coordinated narrative between all people who talk to press, toto, the drivers, staff. They're all over the place this season.
Pretty sure most of us won't
Yeah dude that's how it works, just don't read any headlines and you ONLY won't come across any Merc PR.
Red Bull with their "no fighting on track" policy probably has the best chance to achieve it. realistically only a horrible weekend with both cars having issues will prevent it from happening this year, I can't see Checo and Max crashing each other out like Lewis and Nico did.
Actually they were all replaced by ChatGPT.  And coming soon all the comments on Reddit will be auto created too. ;)
True, personally I find Russell a wealthy hot mess and think he'll be done with MB in less than 24 months.
and yet, here you are…
That literally is how it works
You think checo isn't allowed to race max and vice versa? If checo is quick enough they are gonna race 100% just like Nico and Lewis did. Nothing anyone at RB can do about two racers trying to win the WDC for themself. Question is wether checo can. I doubt it. Ultimately he will be outmatched just like bottas was
You're right. What are you doing here reading my comment then? You know how it works, and still you proceed to expose your self by reading them? I guess hypocrisy has your picture next to it in the dictionary.
I think we've had multiple examples last year showing that Red Bull will prefer their cars not fighting, and give teamorders. which is the safe way to play it and I don't see why they would change it all of a sudden, especially now that they are guaranteed 1-2 for a while unless one car has an issue.
Yeh Checo has no shot
I didn’t say your comment was tiresome though   That’s the difference
Yes we had the examples last year when it was a legit fight with Ferrari who had the pace for half the year and looked like a threat. Just like Merc used teamorders and didn't fight when lewis was in a wdc fight with Ferrari or rb - literally using the term wingman and all. But this year RB has a huge advantage like Merc had early hybrid era. So they have no arguments they can tell checo why he shouldnt be allowed to fight for his wdc. Maybe they will tell checo not to fight or they will tell max when he is second not to attack. But neither will listen. They will both rightfully fight for the racewin and wdc
but there was no significant difference in points between their teammates when they gave team orders last year (except in Brazil ofc) so unless they thought of prioritising Max even when equal on points with Checo(which I don't believe they do), that argument doesn't hold up. I agree though, in general I don't believe we'll see many on track battles between the two, which is why people were so disappointed last year that the rare battles were often cut short by teamorders.
I am fully convinced in a case like last year where at the beginning of the season its extremely tight between ferrari and RB on pace they would prioritize Max as he has undoubtedly the bigger shot at winning the wdc. Just like Merc would have always prioritized lewis over bottas in such a case. There really isnt the need though since lewis against bottas and Max against checo have proven early enough that they are faster. There really isn't much to discuss about. But this year rb his head and shoulders above the rest. So neither driver has any reason to really play the team game. Both know the wdc will be won by one of the RB drivers. So checo will rightfully fight for it and don't care. And Max won't care. We have seen it in Jeddah. Both were pushing. Team didn't want max to set fastest lap but he did regardless. Even said so. This will be the theme of the season. Checos problem really isn't RB not allowing him to race max. It's the fact that he won't be quick enough most weekends again. Its the same story like with bottas.

>"I doubt they're going to change anything."  Pretty much yeah...
No need to rethink. Rules are clear: Red Flag is for dangerous situations and it’s up to race control to decide this.   Sometimes it easy, sometimes it’s not, but it is and should be a call based on professional judgement.  And I’d rather have them call a red flag once to often, then not use one with a terrible accident as a consequence.
He's right.   We never had so many red flags in the past because traditionally red flags were only used for the most extreme situations.   I have never in the 40+ years i've been a fan of the sport ever seen a race in any category ever red flagged due to gravel or as little debris as was on track after Magnussen brushed the wall. Both were completely unnecessary and exactly the kind of situations the safety car was introduced to cover and has done without issue dozens of times over the years in dozens of categories.  If there's an incident let on and a race ends under the safety car then thats just the way it goes sometimes and people should just accept it rather than trying to change everything to spice up the show.   The sport should be valued before the show because if you start doing the opposite then your just going to lose some of the sporting integrity by having more of the controversies and chaos we have seen the past few years due to some of the show over sport decisions!
Has the FIA ever listened to drivers?  In my previous following of F1, circa 2010-2013, this was not the case.  Has this changed?
The red flags aren't the problem. Late race restarts are the only questionable thing here.  Late restarts should fall under the same safety discretion as wet weather restarts.  Also, the whole cold tyre thing is really self-inflicted. If F1 would have already banned the tyre warmer blankets, the drives would be more used to colder tyres. Just like every other series where they can handle it just fine.
Just do what other motorsport categories do elsewhere in the world. They don't red flag races for gravel and have standing starts. Why should F1 be any different.   It's a sport. Not entertainment.
They're definitly overkill.   A safety car slowing way down around the incident is more than acceptable as it was in past years. Or hell even just stop the grid behind the safety car until a safe path is cleared.   This whole return to the pits, free repairs and tyre changes and have a nice break shit has gotta go.  Standing restarts are also counterproductive to the concept of safety.
More red flags please. It's a lot better than losing 15% of a race to pace car procession.   No tyre changes allowed though. Just as I remember the rule once was.
Bet he wouldn’t be saying this if he was the one who got a free pit spot and gained 5> places
What they need to rethink is how the track cleanup procedure is done, it's astounding that they've gotten slower in the last 20 years, messing up the race at the slightest inconvenience. Watched the German GP 2000 a few days ago and Wurz went out on the main straight https://i.imgur.com/BfPXFe8.jpeg, by the time the pack got back on the next lap the car was gone and nothing more needed to be said or done.   Now not only do the cars ahead of an incident have to abandon their lap, but the same incident would take 5 laps behind a safety car to resolve. It's quite ridiculous.
No need to anyway. When they have to clean up the track, it's Red flag. It rightfully was.
The chance of an accident is a lot higher for each standing start you do though. Definitely higher than just fixing the problem under safety car. So the safety argument is a little thin for me.
The last couple restarts should have been rolling. Standing starts encourage desperate drivers to send it for points. In my opinion the idea should be to resume the race not restart it.
It’s both and you know that
I think the only change would be “tire changes if you get a puncture” with tires being tested after, but aside from that, yes. I don’t mind ending after safety car if it’s one lap, but I hate when we lose 3 laps to a safety car during crucial timing windows just to be hit by another safety car and another 3 laps
I think allowing tire changes but they don't count as your compulsory one just to avoid issue of huge variance of grip on a standing start
Alonso was saying this even though FIA game him his position back and Verstappen was saying it even though he won the race.  Even Hulk who ended up gaining to positions in the chaos didn't like the loose use of red flags.
He did gain places…and got a free stop
McLaren were the biggest gainers from the red flags you plum
He did. Lando was one of the people who was put in the best spot given the car due to the flags.
I have this thought too. Most complained that red flag for gravel on track was unnecessary. But if they continued and few more had incidents, then they will criticise for not having red flag. Some people cannot be satisfied.
For years drivers, fans and teams have complained about workers on track during live sessions. All under the guise of safety.   And now we have it, those safety concerns seem to be a thing of the past.
It's an intentional change in the way rules are applied. What nobody here seems to realize is that fans used to be really unhappy every time there was a safety car ending. People were asking for a restart just so there would be racing in the final laps.
Exactly. When cars are bunched behind the safety car there is plenty of time to clean between passes. More often than not, theres a fairly clear line to pass through.   The biggest risk by far in these situations are punctures, which I can respect being something they want to avoid at any cost, but I think its hard to call a Red Flag for every time there may be that risk..
These are two separate events.   Red flag is for the danger at THAT moment. And doesn’t take into account restarts or anything else. It doesn’t matter, because it is meant to immediately mitigate the risk.   That restarts can cause an incident is true, but in the past we would have rolling starts behind the SC. FOM/FIA changed this a few years back to standing starts IF the conditions allow it, mainly to improve the entertainment value. You could argue that this needs to be reverted back for all red flag restarts. Bit that’s up to FOM/FIA to decide.
It's not only the safe of the drivers, but all personnel that have to clean up the mess.
When there's shit all over the track there's nowhere that the safety car and the field can even drive through.  Red flags are an absolute necessity.
At the moment. But it can change.   F1 should never let its entertainment side set the rules.
I think the better idea someone has mentioned is tyre changes allowed under a red, but they don't count as your mandatory stop.   That way cars that already pitted aren't put at a lasting disadvantage, but all cars are allowed to change tyres as a safety measure.
And / or you need to change to the same tire spec.   Soft for soft, etc.
Fr they already were gonna gain 2-3 places in the wcc but they extra points/alpine death jumped them up 5 spots
Or put out a safet car
Show me any rulling in F1 and I garantee you there are people against it. Doesn't mean it needs to be changed.   Plenty of people have already gone out and said ending under safety car would be better than this mess where they bend the rules to try and get around it.
In a football match, if it finishes 0-0 at the end of the game, the fans are disappointed. That doesn't mean the rules should be applied differently or anything just for the entertainment factor.   Fans being disappointed to a certain extent is part of any sport. Sometimes it's egregious (like the Spa 'race' that didn't happen), other times it's a frustrating part of the sport (i.e. ending under a safety car).
Sure, if they just did rolling restarts after red flags like they used to I wouldn't be as much against it. But the fact is that since 2021 there has both been many more red flags called and more standing starts.
Under a safety car, track personnel have very clear info on where all cars are at all times. They can clean the track even on a very sort circuit for at least a few minutes, step out of the way, and continue. It's very safe in that respect and a Red Flag isn't always warranted.    Most of the time a red flag would be thrown in the past is if there's an extreme amount of debris (more than we saw with Mag's crash), or barriers are damaged and need repairing/replacing.
Yet we have had things get cleaned up under safety car for years and years without any issues.
Sure, if there is actually shit all over the track that they can't drive through. That wasn't the case with the first two red flags in Australia.
Or what if we allow tyre changes, front wing changes, damage repairs etc etc, but you have to enter your pit box to do so, then re-enter the pit lane to line up in whatever order you can slot in to?    That way a driver with a 20+ second advantage when the red flag is called could still change tyres for free and not be unfairly penalised (like the could under SC or normal racing conditions). A driver being hunted down on old tyres could still change but may lose a few places in doing so. Seems fair.    A driver with damage gets the massive advantage of being able to repair the car and stay in the race, but doesn't get to do so with no penalty
Yes, they can and hope no marshal is taken out. Even behind sc these cars very fast. Gravel on a blind corner is tricky to clean without putting someone in danger.
Abso-fucking-lutely not! Ending under SC is awful, Monza last year was so fucking disappointing that I'd love to never have to look at that again.  Australia was also effectively ended under SC and it was a disappointing end.  They should do a +1 lap when the restart is so close to the end.
RIP Jules Bianci
Could work.   I guess in this case, those that pitted under the yellow (before the red flag) could theoretically not get punished.  Maybe.  I just hate the idea of free pit stops.
This is what they did for years though without any issues. There used to be plenty of seasons that never saw a single red flag and it wasn't because people weren't crashing or there were never gravel on the road. Those things can be fixed fine under safety car, they have been many, many times.   But since 2021 especially the number of red flags have gone up like crazy and it's hard not to think that the real reason is a push for more drama.
The safety car slows down when going past the incident.
>They should do a +1 lap when the restart is so close to the end.  They do this in NASCAR and 90% of the time it either gets yellow flagged again because someone crashed (leading to *another* +1 lap) or four cars finish and the rest end under yellow...because someone crashed.
It is much better than just rolling the dice and seeing what the hell happens. Standing start with 2 laps left is a joke that takes the piss out of all the drivers that drove like hell the 56 laps before.  If you are that desperate for entertainment watch a crash compilation on Youtube.
The problem is they cant refuel the car so the car may not finish the race with +1 lap
It sucks, but shit happens in racing, sometimes it’s gonna be disappointing.  Like, the championship being decided several races before the end of the season is also hugely disappointing, but should they meddle with things to try and keep that from happening? Of course not...
Not under safety car. Just yellow flag. Which in hindsight was probably a mistake.
I am happy atleast once they decided to something right before something goes wrong. Safety is improving everyday and it is good for the sport. I know things went fine before but that doesn't mean it will everyday. They had audience standing closer to track before without any issues until one day it became a disaster.
Yep, and then the F1 car runs out of fuel.
Well up to a point, if it's completely unreasonable I suppose the SC finish is justified.
The red flag + safety lap period is enough for one extra lap of fuel.
Bianci ignored the double waved yellow flags. Hence his unfortunate death. On the day it was the right call by race control. They couldn't account for a driver ignoring the flags.
I would argue that it is actually much more dangerous to do more standing starts that safety car. That is where the vast majority of accidents happen after all. You don't see a lot of accidents under safety car.
I mean if standing starts are dangerous then they should start behind safety car. There are still options to improve.
Sure and that used to be the norm, but since 2021 they have started doing more standing starts instead. It's not hard to figure out why.

Podiums since the start of 2014:  1. Merc                                            250  2. RB                                                135  3. Ferrari                                          120  4. Williams                                       16   5. Force India/Racing Point/AM     13 (5/4/4)  6. McLaren                                      11  7. Lotus/Renault/Alpine                  6 (1/3/2)  8. Toro Rosso/Alpha Tauri              4 (2/2)  9. Sauber (Alfa Romeo)                  0  10. Haas                                         0
It took them a while to count these, eh? Congrats, that’s truly impressive and a testament of their dominance during these years.
God the new cars look *sooo good*
142 out of 250 are Lewis himself. Insane shit.
Source: [Merc tweet](https://twitter.com/MercedesAMGF1/status/1644275462087081984?t=mAKZG_9K5L_FJ_UegfiFFg&s=19)
Looks odd with the 250 being behind the 2014 car as well as inside the catch fence. If you look at the horizontal plane the car is on, it doesn't really work. Not a big deal, just a weird design choice
And people are still complaining bout RB dominating a few races of a new season
Hybrid era ended 1-2-3yrs ago when there was the new change. In that sense i mean that merc could still stay on to the limitless money they spent before hybrid era start which they magically knew what and how to develop ;)
Force India is impressive given their resources before amr
Williams still in fourth place mainly from 2014/15.
Until germany 2019 every car on the podium were either from Red Bull/Ferrari or have Mersedes powertrain
Fuck me McLaren are 6th!? I know McHonda was a dog mind, but still it's felt to me they've been comfortablly fourth the last few year's, evidently not anymore and evidently not even so it would appear.
Honestly don't think it'd take more than 10 minutes to count the number of podiums one team has gotten since 2014. The information is freely available online.
I really love the W14's look. shame it is not fighting max every race. It would be amazing to see the return fo darth lewis.
It does look weird... Maybe they could've angled the 250 a little so the 0 looks "closer" to the camera than the 2.
Yeah, because it looks like the same boring domination in the colours of RB is starting. And it would be nice to stop it before it drags on as long as it did for Mercedes.
What is this comment even about?
Last I checked the engines were still turbo-hybrids. So we're still in the hybrid era.
We're still in the Turbo-Hybrid / Hybrid era, my guy....
The hybrid era is now, old man.
They had a good car, but they gained a lot from being a Merc customer when that had such an surplus.   Btw all 5 of those podiums are from Perez and 2 more at RP.
And Williams is impressive as they have only had 3 in the last 7 years. The rest all came from 2014-2015 where they were easily the 3rd best car thanks to the insane merc engine.
7/9 of those were Checo’s, he truly could put that car in places it shouldn’t have been.
Ahead of McLaren and Renault variants says a lot.
Yup, 9 in 2014, 4 in 2015
Yeah when you exclude 6 (actually 7) of 10 teams then the chances are quite good that the 4 (3) teams left (Haas, TR, Sauber, Renault*) did not have a podium before. Especially as the then Renault used Mercedes engines when they got their podium as Lotus.
Which is thanks to Renault and their PU being shit mainly. Honda only started to get good in 2019, both Ferrari customers were either very new (Haas) or had next to no money (Sauber, before Alfa Romeo sponsorship).  And Renault vs Mercedes was extremly apparent: the 2015 and 2016 Renault/Lotus were very similar in chassis, but the engine was different and they went from midfield (+ one lucky podium from Grosjean) to backmarkers in just one year. They recovered in 2017/2018 with mainly Hülk being Hülk and dragging that car into the points.
How many podiums do you get for 4th?
I have no idea what you mean
Only 2 names so 2/2 is correct. toro Rosso / AT
r/whooosh
Probably it took them more time to photoshop the 2014 car over the number 5.
Also in 2014 and 2016 we had a great championship battle, that kept things interesting despite the one team dominance. We don’t have that this year.
Ofc we have hybrids but its a new era since the major changes .. ppl call era where most things are similar / most changes for the teams are same . Everything changed as u can see 2-3yrs ago .. so many dumb ppl here ..
On top of that Haas and Sauber never scored a podium when engines were equal or even now. So it’s a nice stat, but it sounds more hyped than it really is
I think he meant it was either RB or Ferrari as a team and Mercedes powered teams after so no teams like Sauber or Haas.  Germany 2019 being where Alpha Tauri popped up.
See how there is a "/" between Red Bull and Ferrari and then "or" to Mersedes? It means that cars on podium could be Red Bull or Ferrari and if it isn't them than it is Mersedes powered.
Oh I thought it was showing the podium places
Yea lol.
Yep. At least Rosberg was a top-level driver, Perez just isn't on that level to bring a championship fight to Verstappen. Not sure if Russell could challenge Lewis, if Mercedes could return to their 2020/21 form, but I'd rather bet on him being able to than Perez vs. Verstappen.
It’s been 3/23 races, anything could happen still.
Your statement was still incorrect though, as the hybrid era never ended. If anything what you were referring to would be the "era of unlimited spending," which is less of an era and more just the entirety of F1 before 2022.
Instead of hyped i would say redicoulous or artificial.  But yep thats it.
Yes, exactly what i meant, Thank you  And, if i were this commentator, i would say your comment is completely wrong because there were no Alpha Tauri team in 2019, it was Toro Rosso. :))  Sorry, i was too entertained by their answer ;)
Yeah he edited the comment
Ah yes thanks for the pointer I forgot about that.
And he answered before it was edited
And they were Mersedes powered
Which you also edited lol
For those of us not in AUS, is Channel 10 a big deal?
My US family loves joking about Australia having like 3 tv stations.  And the ads are for things like  “DAVES GARAGE DOORS. WE WIND EM UP, YOU LOCK EM DOWN! Call 13 18 21 and GRAB A NEW ROLLERDOOR NAOW!” (Made up).   Channel ten is like low Q nbc or Fox or whatever.  National but not exactly anything to be proud of.   That being said. F1 on free to air is awesome. So thanks channel 10!
Channel 10 is the least relevant and popular of the three major networks in Australia, yes they are backed by CBS but that was basically just a band aid solution to a sinking ship. In 2017 they were nearly $850 million in debt before the CBS takeover and the viewership figures are struggling to get up from there.  They however benefit from the anti-siphoning legislation, which is an Australian law for nationally significant sporting events requiring a Free to Air broadcaster to sign a broadcast deal before any pay-TV subscriptions can bid.

the first season I started watching F1. They really spoiled me with that one.
So by my made up logic:  2010 = 2022  2011 = 2023  2012 = 2024  Next year is looking to be a good one, 8/8
To save you a click: it's a quick summary of the 2012 season where 7 drivers won the first 7 races.
Never is a big word.  The 2030s might see the regs working to create such an even playing field that every driver has a chance to win.  The 2040s might see an experiment with reverse grids which means that any driver who gets an early win is starting from the back for a few races.  The 2050s might see a rule which says that any AI which wins a Grand Prix gets deleted after the race so that you need up with six different AIs and an elderly human Fernando Alonso winning the first seven races.
And it would be 8 if Perez won in Malaysia (which he had a great shot at), because it was Alonso who won the 8th race of the season in Valencia.
> In a season which started with six World Champions on the grid, there was no doubt that 2012 would open and close with fireworks.  If this was homework, I'd already fail the author after the opening paragraph.  We just had 2011 oblitterated by the RB7 to a degree not seen since the FW14B. If it wasn't for Vettel's occassional poor starts and bad strategies, they'd have won every race they finished without question - because that car would do no less than that. No one expected 2012 to be close.
ah yes more clickbaity titles that make no sense love it
I almost had a stroke when he claimed that Barrichello won the 2009 season finale at Interlagos.  Stopped reading right there.
Great season to begin watching! I've rewatched it a few now and it was a great year. So many great drivers and competitive races.
And my second, with all the stories and different champions or interesting seasons from 06-10, so spoiled
Sounds about right. So still gonna be an RB year but close
2024: RedBull wins 22/23 races..
I agree, Kmag with 200pts + fl and sprint races after first 8 races. Subscribe
Thanks.

>If this was homework, I'd already fail the author after the opening paragraph.  I don't get why some of y'all act like anyone who posts an article on here is asking for a grade from you.  Regardless, the author didn't say anything about it being close. They said there would be fireworks (aka it would be exciting to watch) since there were so many WDC caliber drivers. And that's totally fair, even if the cars aren't totally even. This year Max is gonna walk away with the championship, but we still have 3 drivers with a combined 11 WDCs fighting at the front and a range of young, hungry drivers right up there with them. I expect fireworks.
how do you rewatch old f1 seasons ?
Charles with the Alonso stare will be heartbreaking
Rotates reserve drivers in place of Perez, while Verstappen chills in second place every race and covers off any threat to the reserves. Then wins every race after the sixth.
And Checo and Sainz are there too.
> Regardless, the author didn't say anything about it being close.  ******  > close with fireworks  Literally in forewords of the given article m8
f1tv has archives dating back to the 1970s, although seasons older than 1990 or so are missing some (or most) races
The text of the article is "open and close with fireworks". "Close" as in the opposite of open, not "close" as in the opposite of far.

As always, Mark is able to thoroughly explain the technicalities of why a F1 car behaves the way it does without overcomplicating it for non-technical people like myself.  "So if you can limit that centre of pressure from moving too much, there is a big advantage to be had. Putting a lot of anti-dive into the front suspension would reduce the movement of that centre of pressure."  Newey and RBR have created something really special here. I'm not even sure that the additional WT and CFD will help rivals - this appears to be a more mechanical advantage and not aero.  "But the problem with anti-dive geometry is that it makes it very easy to lock the front brakes, as the front tyres are not being loaded up as quickly. Has Red Bull found a way of alleviating the worst traits of that tendency, so as to make such extreme angles of anti-dive feasible? It would have to be a mechanical system for it to be legal."  As a Ferrari fan I just hope the Scuderia can find a similar solution. The race pace gap is too big.
So according to the article Red Bull magic is in how their suspension is set up which gives them a massive advantage in the race but with smaller drawbacks in qualifying if the track is low deg and/or low temperature.   It seems like it's tricky to set up properly so sprint weekends might be an issue this year like it was last year.  Article alludes to Checo playing the media and fans against his own team which, in my opinion, will only go bad for him further down the line if he continues.
Fantastic article. Technical but easy to understand and insightful.  To me, the only kinks in the RB armor seem to be 1) starts/restarts and 2) braking zones on cold tires (or at least in Australia T1 and T3 as the article suggested).  Could the anti-squat rear suspension setup also perhaps impact their starts ever so slightly?
I always considered mentality as a big part of the sport, some drivers have that mentality, some don't. Max's existence alone is probably messing up with Checo since he kept asking about Max in radio in Bahrain and Jeddah. Interesting to see him go down this way. I think Checo should take Bottas' advice on being a 2nd driver and not go down terribly in his last years.
It's going to be a long ass 3 weeks.....
I think after Brazil Checo is a bit less restrained and willing to use the team as a scapegoat, much how he was semi-blamed for Max disobeying team orders based on him apparently crashing on purpose in Monaco.   However the far more notable thing is that RB seem to have designed a car that is essentially unbeatable, potentially except for when the sprints come around and setup isn’t fully possible.
Perez forgets that RB saved him.
It seems like every non-Max Red Bull driver wants to blame the team, the car, conspiracies, etc. for their failure... when the reality is that yes, Max is just that good and he is better than you.
How long would all the teams have known this? Presumably the ex-Red Bull guys at Aston Martin did. Seems likely most of the b-spec cars will look at this and try and work out the tricks.
Maybe instead of throwing money at studying what can close up the field for 2026, the FIA should just throw all their money at Newey and convince him to retire intead  Only way we're gonna close up the field imo
Honestly after all the shitting on the team for his own mistakes I'd like to see Perez replaced, but idk who they could get instead. For all his faults, he's a decent 2nd driver, at least in comparison to Max's other teammates (Daniel aside).
I don’t buy it (about Checo messing up that bad). Sure, he is not Max, but he is still very good and while all drivers mess up, he wouldn’t be repeating the same type of mistake over and over without adjusting and push that far to the limit in the first lap of Q1.   Documents did show that brake components were changed in Parc Ferme. Maybe he had an out of spec part. Maybe there was an assembly issue. Because during the race, he made several pases right on the edge at braking while on DRS trains, and there is no way that he can do all of those without  going off or even locking up the tires (like in FP and Q1) if the car was exactly the same.   I also don’t get the criticism of Checo saying that RB is giving him full support in his fight. The article seems to indicate that it puts pressure on the team and outs them on the spot. But isn’t it good PR for Red Bull if Checo says he is sure they don’t play favorites? And when I’ve heard this before, pretty much always he is answering a question where the person asking implies he may not receive equal treatment. What is he supposed to say?
I definitely enjoyed the tech part of this article.  I don't really have an opinion on the politics part lmao.
kinda crazy that most cars are running 15 deg of anti dive and red bull is running 45 and that somehow the other teams are not copying that yet
“Here’s what probably actually happened.”  Probably or actually?
Fascinating article, thanks for sharing
I dunno why but I feel Checo his RB days are coming to an end after this season or the one after. To me it looks like he’s not happy there anymore.
The ugly truth: Perez is not that good of a driver ( comparing to other current ones on the grid)
The amount of dislike for checo in the sub is staggering. The thing we have to read are just hysterical.
Id love to see Albon back at RB. See if and how hes grown
This car actually reminds me of the W11 more and more. A car that is lacking in tire warm-up, with which you see drivers front-locking all the time in practice, and going through quali you *know* the grid order doesn't matter because their deg and pace management will blow the competition out of the water during the race, anyway. At this point, you could stick DAS in there to cover its quali weakness and we'd fully be in 2020 again.
Newey talks a lot in his book about the importance of having a built in advantage in the car that can't be easily copied by the competition so you have a guaranteed advantage until next year or so late in the season it doesn't matter.  Which is what Brawn did to Red Bull in 2009 with the double diffuser.
This tendency to lock the fronts when threshold braking while turning will be a more of an issue for Perez. He likes to brake quite late and hard when pushing.(especially during quali)  Max on the other hand was always about braking early and sacrificing a bit on the entry to maximize the exit. Therefore this car weakness is less of an issue for him.
Newy spend most of his energy on the suspension, which is mechanical grip, which is why it deploys out of corners so quickly. I know people keep yelling about the floor being raised, but the actual potential of this car is in the suspension and their deployment from corners and all of that medium/slow corner stuff is where you would make actual track time. Raising the ride height means that the cars aren't running as stiff to maintain ground effect and this is why you were getting quick cars, but not just quick it's the way they move around on track now is much more manageable. Anyone who watched the testing would have a immediately realised they are moving closer in the way a kart would as opposed to a really stiff ute/truck   People are complaining about everything but this is why the cars are looking better on track and we're gonna get better racing this year
Red Bull had to be clever in 2021 to make something of the 22 car as they'd dumped too much resources on the 2021 campaign. Newey admitted that.  I guess that's why they took an aggressive approach on the fundamentals of the car, as they didn't have time to produce a dozen windtunnel models to find the last tenth of aero advantage. It's also why the car was overweight as parts had to be designed quickly. They probably took some calculated risk with their solutions and it paid off.  This years RB19 is basically the optimised version of last years car with proper development time behind it. The key question will be how they carry the car forwards from now on, at some point they can no longer rely on the strong fundamentals as others correct theirs. Maybe we'll start seeing more aero development efforts at Red Bull.
This bit as well:  >What this has tended to create are cars which lack rear stability under braking but which, as the car levels out as the brakes are released, then have a reluctance to turn in – ie the very opposite of what the driver would intuitively expect once he’s felt the rear instability under braking.  Could explain what Lewis was talking about a couple of weeks ago, not feeling confident in the rear.
Sounds like one of the more realistic theories about what makes the RB19 a beast on-track, and as Hughes already pointing out this also gives them the major benefit of running the car lower then almost all other teams (expect AM as it's rumoured that they running on a height level close to RBR).  I do wonder how other teams could improve on this area, this could also a reason why especially Alpine was/is focused on development of the suspension system and put them under extreme conditions in testing, anyway as usual the paddock talks so let's see what the answers would be from Ferrari/Mercedes/AM/Alpine and maybe McLaren towards Newey genius mind again.
I think he'll retire by himself after 2024 anyways, a perfect timing to bow out gracefully and avoid all the RB rumors next year. Doesn't strike me as someone who'd want to go to a worse car like Bottas, being 34 next year and having a family and all.
That's an excellent point about the Sprint weekends.  Not only is Baku a sprint but it's also a very low grip surface. You've peaked my interest.
At this point it probably doesn't really matter what he will do next. After last year's Brazil and all his statements he is not getting a contract extension no matter what
> Checo playing the media and fans against his own team which, in my opinion, will only go bad for him further down the line if he continues  I completely agree. He made it a point of duty to repeatedly blame "this issue" over the radio and in every interview when he is at least partly to blame.   It was a bit distasteful and embarrassing to see tbh. He is not winning the political or PR game at RB, especially when he doesn’t have the performances to back it up
Yeah I do get the feeling Perez keeps trying to be cleverer than he is.
I appreciate that he tries every year to do the thing. I also don't appreciate it, because he never will win when he plays dirty   I'm rewatching 2014 and Nico Rosberg is pulling out all the classics, a Monaco qualifying oops, brake checking Lewis at Monaco restart so he has to run into the dirty line and grab marbles, all of that only gets you so far and it was still relying on the Lewis  having engine issues, you can have a high level of talent and use all of those cunning tricks but when you are against a generational talent, that kind of mind game only works for a little while. Nico tried all those little dirty tricks and advantages, he tried to live in Lewis head. But the season is long and talent does not lie.   Max will prevail, unless he continues to have engine difficulties it will be Max. It will be Max the same way it was Lewis.
>Article alludes to Checo playing the media and fans against his own team which, in my opinion, will only go bad for him further down the line if he continues.  and may he long continue... i can't believe how badly he's fumbling the bag by TALKING himself out of the team 💀💀💀 if the rumors about daniel's matching sim times are true and he does good on the pirelli tests in silverstone (and monza?), well... let's go checo keep it up king!!! 🗣️
I feel like he has already dug his own grave with the way he has been talking about Redbull. Gasly saw what getting on the wrong side of the team can do to you. He might be thinking of retirement already, but I don’t know if Redbull will decide that for him this year or he gets to do it on his own terms next year when his contract expires.
The media play 'alluding' does seem just like that. We have seen Hamilton and plenty of drivers always blame the car. Big deal.  I get we are all tired already of seeing Verstappen win and the only likely competitor is Perez which probably is not going to happen so every week is going to be highly critical or positive of anything Perez does.   A bunch of hot conspiratorial garbage is in the threads below, because a bunch of redditors who think they know what happened because they look at telemetry. Completely ignoring how stable or unstable cars are from each other, how much of the inputs provide feedback to the driver, which drivers have better front vs rear feel and performance, and how they prefer to drive.
Some things I don't necessarily like about Checo, but his defending against Hamilton in support of Max in 21 at Abu Dhabi means he'll always get a pass for things like this, even though he'll always be second fiddle like Bottas.
So that’s why everyone at Red Bull has been crying about sprint races the loudest. They have the most to lose with reduced setup time. Max, Horner and Marko all have been adamant about their dislike for sprint weekends. Hahaha
Yeah the extra anti-squat would definitely hurt standing starts.
Bottas' advice to Perez: "Don't try to get into a spiral of wanting too much all the time."
Yeah, I mean, wtf Monaco (if true). He just wanted to be ahead of Max. It wasn't even for pole.
I can’t blame Perez for acting up a little. This is his chance at a championship and he won’t have too many other chances after. Even if he’s up against one of the best drivers on the grid, who he hasn’t been able to beat. If you can’t beat ‘em, politics them to death.
What are you talking about? Max kept asking about Checo too. Stop trying to create this narrative that Checo has a weak mentality. Every driver from the top 4 teams asks about their teammate during the races. In a team there’s always that innate competition with your teammate because you always want to be the best in the team. Stop trying to make Checo look like an outlier.
Probably because it's his only opponent, the only one who's times he has to worry about.
Have you read it? This is the best article you'll read in these three weeks - Newey is a wizard.
Maybe even longer....
Right! This subs favorite past time has become not reading articles and shitting on Perez.
Max forgets that Perez saved him.
This is the biggest point about Checo that his fans forget about
Just finished his book, How to Build a Car. He’s a legend. Worth checking out!
I have heard people say that Checo would be the ideal number 2 if he were more like Irvine, a driver happy to drive for the best team and make money knowing he most likely won't win. Given the situation it created at RB I definitely agree, it is gonna be interesting to see the Dutch gp and especially the Mexican gp this year.  Tbh I don't think they should think about who would go in the RB seat after Checo (if they decide to not extend him) the end of 2024 is still quite a bit away and enough time for current drivers to make an impression or new drivers.
Maybe if Yuki steps up this season, he might get a shot at the RB seat next season. He’s not done badly in the shitbox AlphaTauri put together so far
The biggest issue with Checo is that along with being slow he is also very inconsistent, looking like WDC challenger at one or two races a year, and looking like a backmarker in a couple of races each year. And then looks like a midfileder for most of the races.
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, Checo hasn’t really performed much better than Albon, their deltas to Max are pretty similar actually. It’s just that Perez has had much better cars, so his underperformance has been masked for the most part. An ideal number 2 driver would be a couple of tenths closer to Max than either Albon or Perez have been.  Edit: I guess my comment triggered someone because I just received a Reddit cares message. Lol.
He's still got a contract this and next year, so maybe Yuki, who knows.
complaining about 1 issue not being fixed is now shutting on the team? lol    checo is the first to thank the team and give them props, you people really seem to be watching some other f1
Charles to Red Bull pls, get him out of Ferrari asap
I also find it a bit weird to believe Checo made such a big mistake at the start of Q1. With the pace of the Red Bull he can certainly afford to build up his confidence and even then still have enough to at least get into Q3.   But at the same time if there was a genuine issue with his car during qualifying I would’ve expected Horner to mention it by now. I can’t see the benefit in trying to gaslight Checo and publicly pretend that the car was fine in qualifying. Like sure Max is the number one driver but Checo has a pretty big fanbase and also brings in lots of sponsorship funds from Mexico so it wouldn’t make sense to risk needlessly angering him and his fans.   Fully agree that Checo openly saying Red Bull doesn’t play favorites only helps Red Bull’s PR here and using this as an example of claiming his paranoia is a stretch. No driver (unless perhaps their contract already designated them as the second driver like a Barrichello) is going to openly admit they’re the second option especially in a scenario where that driver and his teammate are the only likely championship contenders with how dominant their car is.
I saw a couple of articles yesterday about Yuki being on track to move up to Red Bull in the future, and this article today confirms my feeling there is behind the scenes PR work to shape the story.
The comparison with on track passes does not make sense as his mistake comes from the lack of temperature on his tyres. He did lock up at the last restart, struggling with tyre temperature again.
Exactly. Perez was on pace in FP1 and FP2 without any mistakes. It was only after the mechanics worked on his car in FP3, he was locking up in every hot lap and went off in turn 1 like 4 times. Even a rookie won't make that many mistakes, much less a veteran like Perez.  I bet if there was a more popular driver in his place and had those issues, people wouldn't be questioning him. It's trendy to hate on Perez after all the drama in Brazil.
I wouldn't say that. Look at Sahkir. He beat everyone except Mercedes, with his race pace. Yes, he only beat Mercedes because they were horrible in the pits.  Perez is just not as good as Max despite how hard Perez tries. It is extremely demoralizing for Perez.
I know, like… you can’t ask how max is doing in the race because it’s either “annoying” or”paranoid”.. they are racing! they are in a competitive sport! are you supposed to not ask questions about how the best guy at the moment is doing??
That's an excellent point. On top of that they've also got a significant DRS advantage.  I'm interested to see if Ferrari and Mercedes can develop similar mechanical solutions in season. And then there's also AM.
not really, RB copied it 'pretty fast' and if there were just 12 more from the 5! non finishes from VET (BUT had only 1) he would be a champion
First one that comes to mind was the batteries split between the gearbox of the RB7. He mentions this one right from the get-go.  Edit: Also correct me if I'm wrong, but right at the end of the book Newey mentioned that he stepped back from day-to-day operations to some extent sometime between 2014 and 2016, largely in part due to the fact that the regs became way more restrictive and he was just fed up with the Renault engines underperforming and hindering his cars no matter what he did. But now he seems to be more comitted than before. When did that change, 2020-2021?
The trick of the brawn was the outwash front wing, not the double diffuser.
And honestly it’s funny, as past a certain point, the returns from late braking in terms of lap time are significantly diminished. Braking 20m earlier while still reaching the same minimum apex speed will lose you maybe a couple hundredths of a second, if that, and it gives you more flexibility in terms of what line you take through the corner.   Now of course that time is important, but for a car as strong as the RB19, those hundredths which maybe add to 2 tenths over the course of a lap (completely discounting any gains on corner exit) only really matter in Q3.   By far the biggest advantage of late braking is in overtaking, as it gives you track position on corner entry which you can then use to defend on the apex and on corner exit. Taking risks and braking late in a car with peaky front brakes in Q1 and Q2 is unnecessary.
And really, at that point, he had a great career  Could have been a midfielder his whole life, but luck made it that he jumped to the leaders and even if he was the 2nd car, he still won a WCC with the team.
He makes a couple more comments creating division and we have a new driver coming up
He's in the best possible car to try to compete for WC, he won't retire by himself.
There is a chance he might retire if he can no longer drive an RB, but no chance otherwise imo.
probably still 5-10 million reasons from him to sign a contract with Haas or one of the newer teams at that point.
Piqued, just FYI.
Pretty much if the team doesn't hit the ground running and nail the setup in one practice they'll be on the back foot.  Now granted it's still Red Bull, RB19 with Max and Checo behind the wheel so no one call really count them out but if things go sideways we may just get a win #104, win #33 or win #2.  Maybe Ferrari can have clean weekend and snag a win too.
I don’t think it’ll matter too much at Baku because even if they botch the set up, they’ve got enough of a gap to the field AND such ridiculous straight line speed. Maybe on some other sprint weekends.
Guys  Imola was a sprint weekend  They'll be fine
Sorry I'm a bit out of the loop on this one. Can you elaborate?
You'd think the deal-breaker would be Monaco, assuming the allegations aren't false. Brazil worked out for him because Red Bull and Max were very vocal about wanting to support him for second in the championship at the final race.
If Andretti actually gets to join Checo + Sargeant seems like a pretty obvious lineup for 2025.
What did he say during Brazil last year? I don’t remember any negative words.
doesn't he have a contract for next year?
Max also complains about the car when he is driving it but when he is out of the car, when asked about reliability of the car, (despite that jeddah quali) he says that there is no issue and its all about fine tuning details. Yet Checo is way too comfortable with it that his fans think that rb is sabotaging his car...
Maybe he isn't playing a game though? Maybe the engineers told him they knew what the issue was and it could be adjusted for his car.... And it hasn't been.  Ultimately we don't know what's been said behind closed doors (because the doors are closed) so we're all just guessing
To be fair Rosberg did end up winning in 2016. And that included him making a statement by not yielding to Hamilton at Spain which caused them to both crash out. Hamilton also seemed a bit worse off in reliability luck which played a part too.   Ultimately Checo can do whatever he wants but unless Max suffers a lot more in terms of reliability he won’t come close to what Rosberg was able to achieve. He simply isn’t able to reach Max’s level at all. Rosberg was still fast enough to beat Hamilton quite a few times even if Hamilton was a bit faster overall.   Checo to Max is what Bottas was to Hamilton where they are clearly second best and no matter what can only settle for the no. 2 role on the team. Bottas managed to have a handful of races where he could beat Hamilton on pure pace. Checo’s gap to Max is potentially even bigger as he has yet to beat Max on pure merit even once without the latter suffering from any misfortune or reliability issues.
*Except for 2016, where Nico Rosberg won the world championship against Lewis
Weirdest hate-boner
He’s doing a Carlos Sainz Sr (regarding Carlos Jr) and Ralf Schumacher (regarding Mick), but he’s doing it himself and he has a fraction of the clout that the Sainz or Schumacher name hold.   Ricciardo, Norris, Albon, and Hülkenberg all deserve much better than they currently have and would probably at least perform equally to Checo in the Red Bull. Would also be cool to see Alonso, Leclerc, Russell, or Hamilton in a car that can consistently fight for wins and racing against one of the tallest measuring sticks in F1 history in Verstappen - the comparison between him and (albeit aged) two other GOAT contenders would be fascinating. Even the likes of Sainz, Ocon, Gasly, Vandoorne, Pourchaire, Hauger, or Hadjar could easily be improvements over Pérez.
Maybe he should have finished ahead of Hamilton on pace, you know, at least once in 2021? That would have been far more helpful than holding him up for two laps when Hamilton then was able to just breeze away again. It took *very* fortunate timing on a VSC and SC for Checo’s defense to mean anything.
The general consensus around all the teams is that Sprint races only add unnecessary stress to not damage the car before the Sunday race.  If Sprint race damage somehow doesn't go into the budget cap for replacement parts the teams wouldn't be afraid to race harder.
Bottas is seriously a good person. So happy to see him enjoying his life with the sport.
People suddenly forgot about Checo's personality as a driver pre Red Bull due to Max winning the most competitive season and creating the illusion of Checo being able to play the loyal, good teammate role when it can be argued that he was a pain to be teammates with before. I don't wanna blame him but to me there is no reason why he wouldn't do it even if he gained nothing. I know people perceive Max differently and think he is the bad guy but I honestly dont think that he has it in him to create problems out of nothing, there is deff something going on.
> This is his chance at a championship  Its really not. I get that F1 has to market that and push that idea, but what are people seeing when they pretend like he's a challenger for the title? He couldn’t even come 2nd last year against the circus that was Ferrari
Dude just has the worst teammate and team to play politics. Max is just a weirdo for laughing and joking with Checo all day like they are not rivals and f1 doesn't exist only to get in the car to ruin his hopes and dreams with his antics and leave him like that to continue the circle of madness. And Helmut acts like Max is extraordinary for just existing while Horner loves him more than his real kids. Checo can never win when people in that team would literally take literal bullets for Max.
All of their radios are broadcasted, you are free to listen yourself.  I'm not creating any narrative about Checo's weak mentality, a lot of people already commented about it including pundits and journalists. In fact, the post you are now commenting on here is talking about that. Such a weird thing to say that I'm the one who is creating the narrative when I'm just a random redditor.
Yeah but he wasn't asking for gap, he was being "paranoid" about what times Max was asked to do. Going as far as claiming that there was miscommunication issues about Max's laptimes when there was none.
Newey concentrating on rear suspension was all the hint rival teams needed
I came to the comments looking for a summary and I was about to leave.  But I saw your comment and you'r right.  This is a really interesting article and I highly recommend people read it.
Yes i have, but when I see a headline with the words "downfall" and "paranoid", it just makes me shake my head. I get that the editor writes the headline and not the author of the article, but it seems to me that F1 media simply cannot get past their clickbait addiction.
I just think it's really hard to make it to F1 in the first place, if that's your mentality. Those type of people, who are okay with being second or lower, won't win all the lower level series.
They should get really good security for Mexican gp fully knowing that it is Max's strongest track and he will win it once again if everything goes alright.
Honestly, I think Ricciardo is gonna be so desperate and is currently with the team, that he would end up as a good number 2 and would be equal to Perez performance at the moment.  Probably is a good move for Max's happiness with the team. Ricciardo getting back into a top team might have nothing to do with his driving ability.
I'd love that for Yuki. He's made great strides with his driving, especially recently. I'm honestly just scared he'd get carried away with the speed of the RB car and start crashing again. But all in all I'd still love to see him get a chance at it.
I can't see how Yuki goes from "inferior to Gasly" at the end of 2022 to ready for RB at the end of 2023 when his yardstick is a rookie De Vries. Sure, he could dominate De Vries as he has done so far, but De Vries is still an unknown quantity in F1 terms. And lest we forget, he was not deemed a hot property until Monza last year.  At the very least, Yuki needs 2 years and ideally not to be in a backmarker car, which as the vehicle isn't always expected to perform well, it lowers the mental pressure to perform week in, week out.
I mean the consistency is usually what sets the greats apart. It’s a lot easier to be good at 1-2 things than it is to be adaptable to overcome a bunch of different variable changes and focuses enough to maintain that skill over long periods of time.
Checo has never looked like a WDC contender imo. I don’t remember many times where he straight up beat Max with no extenuating factors.
that was a big mistake from RB imo
Saying the team is a ''one car operation'', pretending not to know about the fastest lap being taken from him and then causing a stir in the media about RB favouring Max when they were both free to push, complaining about an issue that was fixed for quali when it was him being overly eager in quali and crashing are just some of the examples of him putting the team in hot water within the first month of the 2023 season.  After a season of controversies in 2022 starting with the remnants of Abu Dhabi then budget cap, Brazil, Monaco etc. the last thing RB need is someone who will keep the media talking negatively about them.  Seeing as they saved his ass from being out of a seat and done with his F1 career, he should mind his tongue.
Did he? It looked to me like he was evading Gasly's lockup.
> It's trendy to hate on Perez after all the drama in Brazil.  Rewriting history? Everyone piled on Max for that, what are you talking about?
Day-to-day changes in weather and track conditions can make a huge difference to car balance. Verstappen was getting caught out with the occasional lock-up too after Friday, just less than Perez because he's a better, more adaptable driver.  >  It's trendy to hate on Perez after all the drama in Brazil.  I'm sorry but this is blatant revisionism. Verstappen and Red Bull were getting all the stick post-Brazil. It's only turning against Perez because he made a lot of noise about Red Bull no longer being a "one car team" and his title chances two days before parking it in the gravel on his first push lap in qualifying.
It's not trendy and it also has nothing to do with Brazil. Checo is putting this on himself by talking too much. One example: he didn't mention anything about Max having a broken car in Jerez qualy and winning because of it (which is fair enough), but two weeks later he says it's unacceptable that he had car problems in Melbourne qualy and it was the reason he couldn't get another win. He needs to do the talking on track and not go the "to whom it may concern" route as soon as he wins one race when his main opponent is out of contention. He has the right to talk like that when he beats Max fairly over the course of multiple races, which has never been the case as of yet. This is what creates friction with Max and fans, a lot of big words but not consistently (out)performing to back it up.
I’m a brand new F1 fan. I tend to just lurk and read comments. It seems like everyone wants to hate Checo for every reason. To me it seems like a dude that wants to win and be a champion and actually wants to keep with Max even. Even though he probably can’t keep up with Max’s talent, watching the show it seems like pretty much every driver thinks they are a champion and hate losing to the other driver on their team. For some reason Checo is hated like crazy on here, when I would argue Bottas had the same mentality with Hamilton? He believed he could win too, and as much as he liked being on Mercedes, Hamilton outclassed him every year and he would reluctantly be a team player when he had to at times. I almost think it’s the same situation here but Red Bull has always preached they wanted 2 champion drivers capable of being number 1 and I believe Checo thinks he’s that driver. Whether it’s true or not he believes it. I don’t see the reason to hate on it. I’ll probably get a lot of flack for my opinion, but I am a very brand new fan and I’ve noticed that people don’t tend to like new fans here from most comment sections.
You are only as good as your last race. Remember the level Ricciardo was performing at in 2020 vs how he's doing now.  In reality Perez had a top 3 most dominant car in f1 hirstory and still couldn't put together second place in the championship last year. The reality is Perez is comparatively to the rest of the grid a b or C tier driver and I would imagine his continued employment at redbull will reflect that very shortly, whether that's this or next season. Its not just that he isn't as good as max it's that he isn't as good as max the Ferrari drivers, the merc drivers, the McLaren drivers, etc, etc.
I hate to say it but if Pérez was Spanish he wouldn’t be getting half the shit he gets. He’s just a competitive driver who wants to win. Is he better than Max? Probably not, but what’s so wrong about having that mentality, people defend guys like Charles and George when they do something stupid or just don’t shit on them, but if Pérez does something wrong they’re calling him ass. I wouldn’t say racist but there is some form of elitism that I can feel in a sport mostly dominated by Europeans.
But didn’t copy it fast enough to win the titles. If Brawn didn’t have the “built in” advantage RB would have won it, but the head start it gave it to them at the start of the season was barely enough to get them over the finish line in 1st at the end of the season.  Of course the “built in” advantages can be of varying complexity and some are easier to copy then other.
Not sure when he exactly returned to a more hands on role but he did started regularly coming to races over the last few years instead of staying in the factory.  I remember a recent interview where he talked about how he didn't like the new regulations initialy and found them too prescriptive but that then he saw some interesting areas that you can develop the car in and that made him focus back on F1.   He did say that in the Mercedes era he was mostly doing just the broad lines design but let others do the details while he focused on other projects, but that for the RB18 (and probably the RB19 since its a direct evolution) he did do (surprise surprise) the suspension himself.
Found the [article](https://the-race.com/formula-1/newey-in-depth-aborted-ferrari-switch-verstappen-and-retirement/)
The double diffuser was the part of the Brawn advantage that was “built in” and hard to replicate without a lot of work on redesigning the car.  While the double diffuser didn’t make the car much faster it did allow Brawn to focus on other parts of the car like the front wing without the risk of stalling the diffuser
Problem is, too many people in sports don't know when to call it quits
2 WCCs\*
> luck  Yeah that, and also being a very good and consistent driver.  Not everyone has to be a once-in-a-generation driver.
He's never competing for WC. FOM and some fans have been trying to make this a thing for like 2 years and I have no idea what they're seeing. The guy couldn’t even finish 2nd last year against that shambles of a Ferrari team
The gap between him and Max is as big as between Red Bull and the rest of the field.   On paper stuff might happen, but in reality we know how things stand.
Nelson?
I feel like Red Bull could afford to play it safe and go for a purely race oriented setup that protects their tires even at the cost of pole position or the front row for qualifying. Then in the race their aerodynamic efficiency and straight line speed advantage should still be able to allow them to pick their way up to the front.   But if the setup is as tricky for them to get right as it was in Brazil last season then yeah that can potentially open the door to one of Aston Martin, Mercedes, or potentially even Ferrari stealing a win. Personally I think they’ve learned from their issues at Brazil but I would love to be proven wrong and see another team genuinely challenging for the win at Baku.
Austria and Brazil were also sprints and both saw them lock themselves into a bad set up.  No one is saying they won't be fine.
Allegedly Checo crashed out in Monaco to stop anyone setting a faster time, max accused him of something similar
Perez is essentially getting out of line. Crashing on purpose in Monaco, stirring up bad PR, blaming the team for his own mistake, alluding RB used to be a one car team.  Horner was not pleased when he heard about it.
This subs version of Q Anon.  Sergio was P3 and Max was P4 in Q3 at Monaco. He knew he could wreck and that Sainz would then hit him and block the track and end Q3. Back and to the right. He also knew it would rain the next day and that Ferrari would have pit issues, allowing him to gain 2 spots while Max would only gain 1. Its the only explanation.   Max’s mom also had inside knowledge of Sergio’s infidelity.
I still believe there's something beyond Monaco. Max was still very friendly with Checo and there was no cold/awkward signs post-Monaco that you'd at least expect in small hints. I know the drivers can be ordered to play it down but I don't see Max as such an actor
Not shockingly Monaco qualifying was after he had re-signed he felt the confidence to do such a thing.
wouldn't it not even matter in monaco since alonso also crashed
Monaco was only his 'revenge' for Barcelona the previous week, where he was ordered to switch places with Verstappen and was 'robbed' of a win.
I would've thought Andretti would want Herta provided he have a super licence by then?
Stuff about Max showing who he really is, saying that he only has 2 championships because of Checo and all that.
Ah yes a Red Bull contract, the most reliable of guarantees of an F1 seat.
Why wouldnt it be? RB has no incentive to destroy their second cars chances. Im not saying Checo is fully to blame I just doubt RB would knowingly leave one of their cars in a bad position
Of course that could be true, but we can use the information available to have an educated guess.   Checo isn’t a stranger to binning it in qualifying, he's done it before when trying to push. I personally think he just made a mistake here.  Even if the car had a previous issue, why did he need to go full send in the first hot lap in Q1 without at least setting a banker before fully testing out the car to see if the issue is fine, while qualifying (which this car easily should)  The body language of the team and everyone else but Checo doesn’t really indicate it was that much of a car issue or if it was THE problem that caused Checo to go off. Horner subtly disagreed with him and I didn’t see anything from the rest of the team backing his version of events up  Checo has been taking pains to make everyone know it was a car issue. He said it in every single interview, even when being congratulated for a great drive from last place. He preferred to focus on the 'issue'.   He has attempted team politics before and it hasn’t gotten him anywhere and has made him seem a bit dumb and making excuses at some point.   The commentators (who know lifetimes more about f1 than the average F1 fan) leaned towards driver error and that Checo simply lost the car.   You're right that we won't know for sure but i'm comfortable having this assumption of the situation based on the evidence at hand.
People forget that Nico was able to win like 20 races against Lewis when they were teammates, Checo only wins races where Max had problems. Never ever he won a race fair and clear against Max on pace. Play dirty or not, Nico was much more better driver than Checo.
I'm not downplaying Nicos talent, he's top tier, he's just not Lewis, and he had to do absolutely everything, every trick, every exploit, every miniscule advantage and neglect other parts of his life, and still be the beneficiary of luck.   Checo is not in Nico's ballpark, let's alone Max's. He can try whatever he's going to try but I don't believe that Checo has the advantage on pure pace
Nico did everything he needed to do though. The gap wasn't that far.
i'm just happy to see you :(
Yeah, many people think back on some of his heroic defending in '21 but completely forget he was underperforming that entire season.
I still remember when him and ocon raced together. In Singapore him looking right. Claiming he didn't see ocon. Then openning his steering and putting ocon in the wall.
I remember loads of talk about the Perez rumours (back then) being idiotic because he'd never settle into a 2nd role, he'd fight and ignore team orders and it'd get extremely toxic in the team so RBR would never sign him, stuff like that was going around. But yeah all that talk went away pretty quickly probably for the wrong reasons.
"I want to hit him when i see him"  -kimi
It’s not so much that he actually has a chance so much as he realizes that this is the best chance he’ll ever get.  Checo just hasn’t accepted that he’s nowhere as fast as Max.
I mean, if I was a RBR executive I also would take a bullet for Max. Of course metaphorically but it would be insane not to protect him at all cost
You're putting wind behind it.
You merely read the title, which had “Checo” and “paranoia” attached to it and automatically assumed it was talking about Checo being paranoid.  It looks like you’re the only one here who hasn’t read the actual article. Here is the excerpt which talks about his “paranoia”:  > When a car is so superior, any reliability differences have a much bigger impact on the points differences between team-mates. If Verstappen suffered two DNFs and Perez won those races, it would take seven races of Verstappen beating Perez into second before they were back to parity on points. Verstappen certainly has realised this – hence his giving the team such a hard time about his reliability problem in qualifying at Jeddah. **Perez will surely have arrived at the same realisation. If he was a paranoid person – and most competitive drivers are – he might imagine** that the team may try to insure against getting into a situation where its favoured driver gets into a tricky points deficit through any unreliability, by ensuring Perez has an early-season deficit.  Mark Hughes is saying **IF** Checo was a paranoid person, as in merely speculating. He’s not saying that Checo **IS** a paranoid person.  You talk about the article detailing “Checo’s weak mentality” when it’s the exact opposite. Mark Hughes is saying that Checo has a competitive mindset and wants to ensure he has equal opportunity to beat Verstappen with the team.
What’s your first point? It seems like you’re the one who needs to listen to their radios since you’re claiming that Checo is the only one asking about his teammate.  Articles like this are just opinions and rumors, but people like you are taking them as facts. Calling Checo “paranoid” for wanting to make sure that he has the same opportunities as Max in a team that’s known to be shady and that’s designed around Max is flat out absurd. Checo is not being a troublemaker, he’s just standing up for himself. He already helped Max win 2 WDC’s and the team a WCC. Like every driver, he has to think about himself now and focus on winning a WDC or at least have an equal shot at it as Max.
Oh yea, true. But wasn't that rightfully so, didn't max send it and go faster than the team were asking him to anyways? So it's good for him he asked.
In the olden days when it was just print, you had various “entry points” to entice the reader: headline, photo, photo caption, illustration, and nut graph (a small summary or quote in large bold type).  In the digital online era, the headline has to do most of the heavy lifting while competing with everything else on the internet for attention. It’s unfortunate that headlines have become more sensational than before, but it’s probably the fault of the readers as much as it is the fault of the editors. If overly sensationalized headlines didn’t work, editors wouldn’t use them.
And they never will because no matter how good the article is if you don't give it a title that makes people want to click on it they simply don't.
We eat em up every time.
Agree, I'm not blaming him it for that either. The thing is that everybody knows that RB chose Checo to be there to get as many points as possible without making it difficult for Max. Checo trying to exceed expectations is perfectly fine, but only until the point when friction started between the two.
Would have been perfect with redbull honda to have a japanese "ambassador" but i think they will be looking elsewhere  maybe someone like Albon might make a comeback? I mean he carried the williams into points...
And then you have a problem when you are not great at anything, being a jack of all trades, master of none type who is also inconsistent.
He never did beat Max when Max finished the race and he didn't have mechanical issues, but he did have a couple of races where he looked like he might be able to challenge for a title if he could keep that level of performance. Which he obviously couldn't and those races were outliers.  And by challenge i mean if it's a season like this where its pretty much guaranteed RB 1-2 evey race and one or two DNFs can decide the title he could make it close, not beat Max outright.
I think he was carrying too much speed there, as he was trying to out brake Stroll. There was so much smoke from Gasly's tyre that I thought some it was from Perez's too lol, I cannot distinguish it to be fair 🥴
In my opinion people don't like drivers acting cocky if they cannot deliver it on track. Everyone on that grid believes that they can do better than others, that is not the point, the point is to actually deliver results. Max can say that he doesn't race for seconds and people might call him arrogant or whatsoever but we all know that he is right. Checo on the other hand keeps talking without results, there is no single race in his rb career where he did beat Max on race pace, fair and clear. Yet he is not ashamed to say that he made Max win 2 championships and how RB was one car operation before he arrived. We wan't to see results, we dont wanna see a driver who says that he wants to be a champion and then bin it in quali next race only to blame his team. I used to like him, I thought he was happy that RB saved his career and gave him a good car, yet he is insisting on putting the team under the bus this year.
I think most people welcome new fans. They are only disliked when they give opinions or make comments about things they have no clue on. I mean, I casually watch other sports, but I wouldn't dream to ever give my opinion on inside information to die hard fans because I do not follow those sports closely or for long enough to truly understand the ins and outs. For new or casual fans, it's usually best to first delve deep into the sport before giving opinions based on their own lack of knowledge or because one person told them. But nowadays most people just want to have an opinion on everything I guess. Disclaimer: I'm not implying you're that person.
You’re good bro welcome.
Yes, Perez had a poor Australian GP. But let's look at one race prior, Saudi Arabia. Perez took pole and won. Perez is more like a low A, high B driver.  Here is another situation. Remember the Mexican Minister of Defense. His efforts in Turkey and Abu Dhabi show he is a very talented driver. He kept Lewis, an S Tier driver, in check.   Ocon, a real B/C tier driver imo, had a similar situation in Qatar. Alonso told Ocon to defend someone like a lion. Ocon immediately gets passed by that someone, Perez himself.
Exactly, why not just let him be, if he beats max, great, if not than also great, let the best man win, let him dream. He’s a formula 1 driver competitive like the other 20 that dream to become champions.  People just want to fire drivers left and right and suck on the 1 guys balls so hard.
but the point about the 'built in' advantage is about it being hard (or impossible) to copy in season, if RB19 is good because of its suspension geometry, majority of the teams wont be able to change it, if its just fancy aero, its plausible they get it
Yes, but It was the outwash front wing that was their biggest trick that net them the most performance benefit, as confirmed by Brawn himself.  Edit: read below for more clarity on our discussion.
Tbh, if you don't really care about stats or "legacy" staying until they kick you out will bring you the most money
It's hard when you're already full in the lifestyle already and you're being offered millions of dollars to stay.
In his case I think it's rather obvious that there aren't many seats available to him at all. Others might have to make the retirement decision for him.  I love Checo, he's been a great help to Max, but he's not an amazing driver in the current era/car and considering his age as well I think any team would rather concentrate on young talent.
Nothing wrong with doing a kimi and just having fun lol
People like perez who haven't made hundreds of millions have one relatively short window in their lives where they can both do what they love AND earn millions, sometimes I think the public forgets this when thinking about whether they're "overstaying."  Personally, if I were in F1, I think I'd want to stay in F1 every moment I could, my "legacy" be damned.  Imagine going from being an F1 driver racing at the highest possible level at venues across the world to retired in a matter of days.
People should retire when they feel like retiring, period. I don't know why people have to tell drivers when they have to retire. If he wants to continue, and a team wants him as their driver, what's the problem?
That would imply there is a "right" and "wrong" time to retire, and that you know when that time us better than others.  Arrogant, and wrong.   Grow up.
which one was the second? RB only has had 1 since he joined (they didn't win it in 2021)
Yep but he tries to and apparently RB are happy with that situation.
Just to note, while it was not officially confirmed (and probably will never be), the BBC reported that multiple sources had made the claim to them when they wrote an article about it. It wasn't only the twitter guy who broke that story.
If Perez wants to be the number one driver, he can be. He just has to start raking in more points than Max. It's not going to happen because Max is among the best of all time, and Checo is just very good.  Checo is probably upset because this season he has the chance to win the title with a bit of luck if Max has a few car failures, because Checo should be guaranteed a lot more second places. Now that dream has pretty much already gone, short of a statistical miracle.  His failure to get second at Australia was not a good performance from him. He didn't make up places well, and his failure to qualify was his own fault.
This. Horner plays this game better than anyone and he wasn't having Checo talking that way. You cannot afford to have Horner disagreeing with you, and he had to do it 3 times... Never heard Max complaining about team ever, yet Checo seems comfortable with throwing them under the bus at every mistake he does.
He didn’t need Sainz to hit him, just being pointed the wrong way in that corner is enough to bring out the double yellows and end quali
I think we all had THE knowledge of Checo's infidelity to that point. We also knew about him being pro-life, saying that women belong to kitchen (in context of Susie Wolff) so his behavior towards women was always questionable enough which makes your point blaming Max's mom invalid imo.
I think max didn't find out about Monaco until much later in the year, hence the blowup at Brazil
Max also said that he settled it so I think that means he settled it, he's very straightforward like that.   I think it might flair back up again now that in my opinion now Checo is shifting back to his own campaign, but he might let pragmatism take over once Max makes a solid and clear run on the points
Or Max is really good at separating work and private life
Monaco seems like a bit of a false reason to me. Whether deliberate or not (and why it would be deliberate never made total sense as it was for 3rd and Ferrari were still in contention), but like you say, there were no clear ill feelings afterwards. It was a long way down the line before ‘that’ was the reason to my knowledge
He re-signed after the monaco win smh
That’s completely beside the point
Max would have won anyway in Spain
You mean when Max was lapping 3 seconds faster and was going to go past regardless of whether he let him or not?  Ahh yeah, that one.  Checo had zero chance in that race without a Max DNF.
Checo finished 20 seconds behind and he thinks he got robbed?
Maybe, I feel like the hype around Herta has died down. If Sargeant can stay on the grid he should be a better option with those extra years of experience.
Ohhhh, right! Thanks!
tbh they haven't dropped their drivers unless they were underperforming so...
Yeah being able to win 7 straight races against Hamilton is an amazing achievement even considering that Hamilton had already secured the championship in the first 3 of those and had one or two reliability problems for the first 4 races of 2016.
Yeah I think Rosberg trying to exploit whatever margins he could did partially help him beat Hamilton eventually even if it also included the latter having bad luck with reliability.   It’s tough for any driver to accept they’re clearly second best but maybe Checo can eventually come to terms with it like Bottas did. With Red Bull this dominant he’s still a good second driver for them.   If anyone else makes sizable progress to get close to Red Bull by 2024 then Checo’s almost definitely getting replaced. Otherwise if Red Bull is still decently ahead at that point I think they could still retain him, and they should have the leverage to only offer him 1 year extensions like Mercedes did with Bottas if need be.
42-36 in qualifying, pretty dang close.
"Damage limitation today, we were having a good race until Perez tried to kill me 2 times! Anyway he didn't manage to do so ending up P9😉!" -Esteban Ocon, 2017
That's the thing about F1 drivers, once they accept they're nowhere near as fast as the other guy, it's all downhill from there
>Checo just hasn’t accepted that he’s nowhere as fast as Max.  We're all just gunna be here pretending that Checo doesn't know his own race results for the past 2 years?  These are professional drivers in the most elite group on the planet. They're going to try their best to win. If they didn't do that, then they should stop racing.   It's possible to believe in yourself while still understanding the realities of your life.
Max not being able to close the gap to him in Saudi Arabia and Checo being just 3 tenths slower in P1 in Australia with mediums compared to Max who was on softs is proof that he’s very close to Max this year. And don’t come at me with the excuses that Max had an “issue” in Saudi when he wasn’t closing the gap to Checo before he reported his supposed issue. And in Australia, Checo’s chances of winning went out the window when his car’s brake balance was off most of the weekened. If you believe that that was just Checo messing up over and over then you’re just dumb and ignorant. Not even Latifi would make the same mistakes over and over and people here think a driver of Checo’s caliber would?
I would take a real bullet for him just because i think he's cute.
Social media.
[removed]
Max was not responding but he wasn't really sending it anyways, he slowed to take the fastest lap once he realized that he wasnt gonna make it. Checo was told to push. They never did the requested times, Checo really thought that team told him to go slow though, maybe he really thought that Max would be able to make the gap somehow.
Albon just made an unforced error and crashed his car? 🤣
That jack of all trades expression doesn’t apply to skills within a field. Also, thats a truncated version of the expression.  In sport you need to be good and rounded in all relevant skills for your position. To be the best you need to be master of all.
That just about sums up my thoughts as well.
>In reality Perez had a top 3 most dominant car in f1 hirstory and still couldn't put together second place in the championship last year  you didn't even try to refute that and go rambling about some other stuff that doesn't fit the context of the conversation just you can say you are right  if perez was #1 rbr driver and say latifi as #2 rbr driver - just to make clear the difference - they wouldn't have won last years championship. with that car. they wouldn't.  how one can assume that perez is that much better than ocon to rate him one full tier above is not understandable in my mind. they are equal, last year i would have given ocon the benefit
I edited the previous comment to add the part about how the double diffuser allowed them to use the front wing and deflectors on rear brakes without stalling the diffuser.
Beyond money, sports are also exhilarating and fun. What do you go to after that? Everything else is a downgrade. People go longer than they’re “supposed to be” because it’s fun lol
There was an NFL player a few years back that pretty much knew the reality of this situation. He set a limit of about 60-70,000 per year to live. Still drove his beater from college. Just trying to bank as much as he could and play for as long as he could to set him and his family up for a good life.
Nah it's a joke that they already have this year's
2023 is the second. Don't kid yourself, you know it too.
Only as long as they are far enough ahead to win WCC with an average driver. The moment they compete against an equal car, thats gonna change
Checo is a bigmouth, but he works with the team, he does as he's told. Verstappen is not easy to work with, and Red Bull has plenty of experience with second drivers that just didn't work as they wanted - I'm pretty sure they think Checo is the best second driver they had.
Brazil didn’t matter as Checo would have finished 3rd regardless because of his performance in that final race. Max giving him that spot would have still placed him 3rd at the end as he fucked it himself anyway
Can you count ?    Max waiting 20 seconds or so to let him pass in Brazil would still left him 3th as he screwed up any advantage Max would have given him in the last race .
Checo lost 2 points in Brazil and finished 3 behind Charles in the WDC. Sure, Max did Checo dirty in Brazil but Checo can't blame Max on not finishing 2nd in the WDC while having the best car.
[Link has audio if you go into it directly.](https://i.imgur.com/REUdWOn.mp4)  It's kind of interesting that Brundle straight up goes to Monaco after Max refuses to let Perez past in Brazil.
The telemetry data shows that he went on throttle (twice)* in the middle of Portier, which is either a catastrophic amateur mistake or done on purpose, considering he is the one that benefited from it the most.  So it's not jut hearsay.
>twitter guy  You mean Erik van Haren? He works for De Telegraaf, normally a more or less a tabloid. However they are accurate when it comes to sport.
If other drivers didnt crash out he'd have gotten p8/p9 (depending on if he could pass Albon, and seeing how long he was stuck behind Norris? Idk) at most, which is just not enough in a car like that
it's still very much a possibility that Checo can win this season. A lot can still happen, even though I think max is the better driver
Well, Max complains, a lot at that, but only when justifies, and doesnt blame the team for *his* mistakes
The kitchen thing was a joke. Sussie wolf csme out to defend him snd said they were friends.  It was in bsd taste but yeah
Worried about a grown man’s business, get a life
Seems unlikely, because Erik van Haren mentioned that talk with Checo and Marko in Baku. And Max, who is pretty much eyes and ears in the team to not know....would be impossible imo
It could also be that he was fine with Monaco as long as he wasn’t expected to help Checo
you’ve set your fastest lap, you’ve botched your last try, why wouldn’t you want others to have their final attempts canceled as well?  especially since at that point the points between your teammate meant you were both in contention for WDC?  it’s not a slam dunk in terms of motivation, but it is there, and the evidence is pretty hard to refute.
It was announced after Monaco, he was caught on camera saying joking about he should have asked for more or something of that nature after the Monaco win and Redbull announced his re-signing because it was caught on the cameras around the grid and all the journalists knew
I think the hype has mostly died down because there's nothing to talk about at the moment. There's no path to F1 open right now. I expect the hypetrain to return as soon as there's an option and I would rate him higher tham Sargeant.
The hype around Herta only died down because he wasn't allowed to be considered for an F1 seat.  Don't you think that will return when he's eligible? No reason it wouldn't.
Hamilton has issues in all four of the first. Pushed wide by Rosberg running deep into T1 dropping him to 6th in the Aus GP. Bahrain, Bottas dives at the apex and hits Ham into T1. Then the next two he has qualifying issues. Still impressive but not like Roseberg had any competition those first four races.
Ocon and Perez were the worst possible combination too. Ocon himself is guilty of fighting his teammates harder than anyone else. He almost put Alonso into the wall multiple times in Jeddah. And it took only 3 races for Gasly and him to crash into each other (with equal blame on both sides, but somehow Ocon is always involved in such things).
I think that everything you said is correct but that’s not the mentality of any top level competitor. In more true team sports it’s easier to understand roles, in something like f1 you have to believe you can outperform everyone else. After all their deeply held belief in themselves is the main reason they are there when other similarly talented people don’t make it
You don't take Max's car having issues in quali as an excuse for him not winning at jeddah but you think Checo's car having issues is the reason of him bottling it in quali at australia 💀 make it make sense before jumping to defend checo.
[removed]
you're so valid for this. also same 🧡
Ah f**k.. admittedly I did not see that last sentence. I’m on mobile, so the pop up ads had blocked it unfortunately, I apologize.
That statement is completely wrong. Redbull did not have "a top 3 most dominant car in f1 history" in 2022. That might be true for 2023, but that is not true for 2022. Redbull and Ferrari were closely matched in 2022. Ferrari faster in the first half, Red Bull in the second.   Using this information, Perez performed on par with Leclerc in 2022. If anything, last year's results indicate that Sainz, not Perez, is the bad driver. He lost to both Perez, in a close car, and Russell, in a significantly slower car. This completely contradicts the previous comment saying both Ferrari drivers are better than Perez.  Addressing your point about Perez and Latifi. Of course, they would not win the WCC against Leclerc  and Sainz. You are putting a C tier (Perez) and F (Latifi) against a S tier (Leclerc) and B (Carlos). Red Bull won because of Max, not the car.
Thank you, that’s much clearer and closer to what I understood.
True, most ex-f1 drivers end up doing other racing series.  If you already get an adrenaline boost on sim-racing I can't imagine how exciting the real thing is
I would keep going just to avoid the soul crushing lifestyle change of driver to irrelevant old geezer the media always asks to speak about how amazing a current driver is.
A lot of former racing drivers have said it's hard to get used to life after, they're so used to having all that adrenaline pumping through them.
Family, activism, business interests, etc.
Fair enough. I didn't read it that way but cause I'm dense lol.but very true! And honestly good for checo.
Oh I agree 100. But can't count it yet.
>an average driver  Average drivers don't have the career Sergio Perez has had
Congratulation, you understood my comment about current situation. :)
Is that based on the publicly availably telemetry or has that been corroborated by anything more specific? I remember reading back then that the publicly available telemetry doesn't have a small enough interval to accurately display when Perez accelerated.   I'm just wondering if I missed a development in the story since then.
I just remember that nobody trusted what he said because he had a reputation for being biased towards Max, but he wasnt the only source of the story. Normally the BBC wouldnt say they had sources if those sources were not people who could reasonably be expected to have that information, or offered some kind of evidence.  Because of that, as well as the telemetry data (watch when Checo applies full throttle, that would spin every driver out on every lower speed corner and was either some kind of spasm or an intentional movement), Im inclined to believe that it was intentional.
Tbf as much as I dislike De Telegraaf, calling them a tabbloid is going a bit too far imo. They are the largest(as in, most readers) newspaper in The Netherlands.
I thought the same.  Also, I didnt understand why he didnt pit with around 20 to 25 to go. If he could put in times similar to max, he could have made those 20 seconds back only a few laps. He had nothing to lose at that stage. I think it would have led to many pitstops and he would undercut them all probably.
Also, im not counting out Mercedes. I still think that if Lewis and Russell suddenly get a car thats competitive with RB, things could get tight after a DNF.
It still shows who he is and how he sees women.
As a woman myself, kindly no.   His misogyny cannot be excused with "grown man's business", men like Checo have no business in women's life as well and I'm free to dislike his personality for it.
Travelling professional athletes cheating on their SO?!?!? This never happens, better clutch my pearls...
We need anathor journalist to make a 10 year deal with Max to write a book perhaps
This is it imo, he was never going to help Checo after that.
Because it’s fraught with risk and far from a certainty it would guarantee anything. I struggle to believe any driver in his position would do it for any less than pole (or at least beating all WC rivals, not 1 of 2)
Herta is losing the 20 points on his super licence from his third place in 2020 at the end of this season though. He only has 12 points  meaning he probably needs to at least get 2nd place in Indycar this season to get up to 40. Which frankly seems unlikely based on the first 2 races.
Is he going to be eligible though?   Herta is losing the 20 points on his super licence from his third place in 2020 at the end of the season. He only has 12 points meaning he probably needs to at least get 2nd place in Indycar this season to get up to 40. Which frankly seems unlikely based on the first 2 races.
Fair point I didn’t remember both of the T1 incidents too. Maybe if that happened to Max four times in a row this season we might get a half decent championship fight.
Lewis also barely out qualified Nico over their careers together. 42-36.  Checo will never get that close to Max. Nico brought the fight to Lewis. But that’s relatively common with Lewis’s teammates.
It’s so obvious that if you put just a little bit of thought into it you wouldn’t be jumping to defend Max. First of all, I was clearly talking about Max’s “issues” during the race, not quali. Let me address that first. Max’s car was great during the race he was easily overtaking people and never reported one issue. Then in lap 25 he overtook Alonso and was now P2. After overtaking Alonso he was not closing the gap to Checo and he didn’t report his “issues” I believe until 10 laps later. Even after reporting his supposed issues even the commentators noted how it didn’t seem to affect his pace since his pace was still the same.   Now, about Max’s quali issue. It was an issue that only affected him in q2, not the whole weekend, and the team was able to identify the issue and fix it for the race. On the other hand, Checo started the weekend off great. He was faster on Mediums than almost everyone else on softs and he made pretty much zeros mistakes. Then in p2, if you watched it you would’ve seen that Checo was in the garage for around 15 minutes. If nothing was wrong with his car then why would they be working on it for so long? As soon as he came out of the garage and did his first flying lap the braking balance issue that he had most of the weekend began. Do you really think after having a perfect p1, Checo would suddenly forget how to drive and keep making the same mistake over and over? If you’re not ignorant you would clearly see that his car clearly had braking balance issues. He didn’t “bottle” it in quali as you claim.
🧡🦁
It's at least 18% more exciting than sim racing, possibly even higher...
You could always become a Monaco-based YouTuber
tbh there's a lot of things you can do after retirement in F1. You can get involved in a team to try and make it grow, you can get involved into color commentary, pursue a position at FIA, mentor young talent, etc. It depends on what you like to do aside from driving the cars in a race.
While those things are certainly important, you’re comparing effectively doing like 50 lines of cocaine to smoking some weed.  One is fun and exhilarating, the other is purposeful and fulfilling.  (Not saying any of those things are exclusive to each other)  If i like doing it and I’m having fun why would I stop lol
Depends where you draw the line between good and average. I believe that he is currently the 7th or 8th best driver on the grid.
The data is from the F1 API, and I never heard claims that it might not be accurate enough to show throttle trace.  From the onboard sound you can clearly hear the engine RPM rising as he stomps the throttle.
Yes, he is indeed close to the Verstappens as source. Although I have never seen tweets or publication's with his own opinions and thus biasness to a specific driver.
The Daily Mail is the most read paper in the UK doesn't make them any more reputable
They are very prone to overdramatised tabloid style headlines though.
Making jokes does not reflect how you see anyone. Definitely not worth being this offended over.
I agree
You think he’s the only f1 pilot who has cheated on his wife? Are you that naive? And I wouldn’t call that misogyny if he’s joking with a close friend.
Max was light-years ahead after that point to so wasn't really a chance to "get even" either.
He probably had the idea that leaving Monaco with more points than Max would lead to Checo being prioritized in the WDC.   But considering that Max had at that point won 4 and retired from 2, while Checo had won 0 and retired from 1, it was eminently clear that Max was the best hope of the team to close the gap to Leclerc.
> Which frankly seems unlikely based on the first 2 races.  he wrecked in St Pete and struggles with ovals so I wouldn't put too much stock in the results of those races
Indy is not like F1, Herta could be points lead in 3 races, so could about half the field.
Well it almost happened last weekend.
I actually think that Checo is able to make the same mistake over and over and over again.  Also the way you are talking about their cars and the issues is like? Are you their mechanic? How are you able to claim your own ideas as facts. So weird to read what you are saying right now, anyways, still waiting for Checo to beat Max fair and clear, like even once is enough.
You are just factually wrong. Max was catching checo by a thenth a lap until these issues arrived. Where he stagnated and later fully dropped off.  Practice is irrelevant we don't know the fuel and different . Stupid little point you are making.   Checo was consistently slower in race pace anywhere from 2-5 thenths in clean air.
> at least 18% more exciting  I'm sure Max could give you the exact percentage, to within one one-hundred-thousandth of a percent.
And occasional F,1 talking head, specialising in your old team.
>While those things are certainly important, you’re comparing effectively doing like 50 lines of cocaine to smoking some weed.   >   >One is fun and exhilarating, the other is purposeful and fulfilling.  Lol no shade, but were you on drugs when you wrote this?  Smoking weed is "purposeful and fulfilling?"  Long time pot smoker, and really not an anti-drug guy...but the metaphor is lost on me.
Not everyone is like Max/Alonso/Lebron/Brady. Athletes have lives outside of the sport and after a while, it's common to see them move on to other things. It's a partial reason Kobe's sudden death was so impactful, we never got to see his post-NBA career and life really take place
> you’re comparing effectively doing like 50 lines of cocaine to smoking some weed.  > One is fun and exhilarating, the other is purposeful and fulfilling.  Well to each their own but I'd be a bit worried if you see any drug as "purposeful and fulfilling".
Yeah, I remember reading that the data available through the API wasn't accurate enough to make those assertions with a high degree of certainty. Found a different link: https://f1pace.com/p/2022-monaco-gp-telemetry-geniuses/  The sound was pretty damning but that also could have been caused by something else.   Initially I found the telemetry and sound pretty conclusive but I'm not so sure because reliability of the data. I hope we get a conclusive answer one day. Just to clarify: I agree it was all pretty suspect but also inconclusive in ruling out driver error completely.
I mean, the other evidence that corroborates the timing of the F1 API data is the footage of Perez showing him completely out of control in a manner that could probably only have been caused by flooring it haha.  The other thing is, they never go to full throttle instantly like that in low speed corners, even at the Apex he would have eased into it, if you watch everyone else taking that corner.
Fair enough
Fair enough
Good for you but, you don't get to decide that for me.
Here comes the excusers. Every f1 driver could cheat on their wifes and it would still make no difference about Checo. You do not get to decide what is misogyny, especially when you are so ready to find excuses for cheating. I'm not here to fight with males in reddit, you are free to call me naive.
I’m not a big fan of Checo, but he’s not got the IQ of a potato - which you’d have to have to think they would favour him over Max if he led after Monaco. Stretches credulity somewhat, given he didn’t lead him going in to it, and he was the current WC
And his results have gotten worse every year since 2020. I just don't think he is going to get there.
Sure, but his results haven't exactly been pointing at that in the last 2 years. Considering he needs to place better than he has ever done in Indycar to have enough super license points, I'll remain sceptical.  It is just very hard to get enough points through Indycar. Realistically you either need to win or get in the top 3 several years in a row.
Yeah Max had a poor and very cautious start and went a bit wide in T3 after Hamilton went down his inside. But Checo was all the way at the back of the field instead of being up there at the front to potentially capitalize on it so it didn’t count for me.   And if Checo was on the front row I wonder if Max would have been so risk averse on the start. He knew he could get both Mercedes cars later in the race. Maybe him and Checo will have a lap 1 collision somewhere later on in the season if it’s a situation where neither want to yield.
Watch the race highlights since you clearly didn’t watch the race. Max overtook Alonso lap 25, like I said already. He reported his “issues” in lap 37. When he overtook Alonso he was 5.3s behind Checo. In lap 37 he was 4.5s behind Checo. If he was lapping a tenth a lap faster than Checo like you claim he would’ve been 4.1s behind in lap 37. After reporting his issues Max’s gap to Checo increased back to 5.3s. His engineer told him that they were happy with the car and there was nothing wrong. Then in lap 39 the gap was back down to 4.5s. Now tell me is that an indicator of Max having an issue? Most likely he backed off after believing he had an issue that’s why he lost 8 tenths in a single lap and then quickly made up that lost time after being told he had no issues. He didn’t “fully drop off” like you claim.   When I said that Checo was lapping faster than most drivers in p1 in Australia it’s not because I was making the point that he was faster than anyone else, it’s because it’s proof that his car was having zero issues and he felt happy with the car. If his car was perfectly fine why was it being worked on for the first 15 minutes of p2 and the first lap he did the car was completely the opposite of how it was in p1? Stupid little points you made that make no sense. Also, learn how to spell “thenths” before you go at someone.
He would say that at least the real world servers are more stable.
Wouldn't be surprised if Max said 0%.
Was saying one is highly addicting and intense and the other is mellow lol
I'm smoking as I write, he could've used other examples lol
This isn’t an explanation for why people quit, it’s an explanation for why people stay longer than they “should have”.  Your point is valid but it’s also irrelevant.
Disagree on Kobe. His death was impactful because he was just a healthy guy that we were seeing on TV weekly just a few years earlier. If he had died in 2026 it'd be a lot less impactful, because he'd be just a distant memory for all of us.
Unless he writes a book in 10 years admitting it, don't think we will ever get a conclusive answer.  And while the telemetry data and the engine sound might not stand in court. I think it's pretty likely that he did do it on purpose.  And I'm not trying to indict him or accuse him of committing some sort of cardinal sin. It's a competition and he isn't the first or the last driver who did something a bit naughty to win.
The problem is we have 20 things indicating he crashed on purpose, and only one thing as a counter argument 'he didn't have that much to gain' which is only so so true given his main priority at the time was beating max, not Ferrari.  The moment we had drivers like carlos saying that it certainly happens that drivers crash on purpose and hinting at perez, bbc commentators immediately knowing  from inside sources max was hinting at monaco, the telemetry, etc etc, nah you just cant get around it. It will never be proven or admitted, but its an open secret at this point.
The only other explanation for flooring it would be something being wrong with the car, which we would have been revealed by now or him having a seizure of some sort making him press the pedal, twice, which doesn't seem that likely.  Unless you believe the Alonso 2015 testing crash [theories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpqffgak7To&ab_channel=ChrisBurns)
You can think what you want but don't put out garbage like "that's how he sees women" when you really have no fucking clue.

Guenther has had the stress of motorsport bearing down on him his entire adult life.
🤯
What 8 years of Haas does to a mf.
If Keanu plays Toto, who plays Guenther?
He's the unnamed background character that got a whole spinoff show
At least drive to survive
Having held off from watching drive to survive for so long... I regret it immensely. Between him and Danny Ric that show was great. It also highlights how much of an ass binotto is lol
Nah. Top 5, maybe
Lmao Ralf is so mean in German, the translate button has showed me a whole world of German hateraid
Same here. Happy Birthday!
Happy birthday!
Jesus Christ lol
Who the fuck starts a conversation like that?!
Happy birthday!
Hygiene.
Then I'm gonna fuck everyone in the paddock.
> Felonies   He's bad at tax evasion
I think because we can imagine him saying it. I can hear it in his voice in my head lol.
I think a good part of that is his thicc accent?
“I said ‘huck’…. What?”
Guenther looks great for 58. Your expectations have been warped
Okay?
Better call Gene
Me and my wife always laugh at how Binotto CAN speak English and just refuses to for the cameras  He's not obligated to, of course.  I just get a kick out of it.
Go on.....
Happy Birthday.   This won’t mean anything to you, but Boomer Sooner!
Thank you!
You can't really compare team principal and vampire.
Yeah I'd agree, just joking around.
He's explaining why your mind has been blown lol
Gene Steinovic
Yeah it really highlights his commitment to Ferrari. They have an ego problem for no reason lol. They aren't even the best supercars anymore!
That's hilarious 😂  What a pretentious platypus
I'm a Browns fan. It used to mean something to me. ;)
My mind was blown because I also found out earlier this morning that Keanu was 58 on a podcast, I'm not surprised that Guenther is 58.  Edit: It was on the Smartless Podcast for anyone wondering
>It was on the Smartless Podcast for anyone wondering  Okay?
Keanu on a podcast for an hour with Jason Bateman, Will Arnett and Sean Hayes is pretty fucking sweet.
Okay?
Okay?
Are we okay, question.
When I watch old F1 videos and such, whenever I see the cars lined up on the starting grid, [but a group of cars towards the back have to be on a turn/approaching a turn](https://youtu.be/fVMM0Jucg80?t=7447), I always found that quite interesting and unique. Because nowadays cars are always in a straight position on the grid.
Rewatching old F1 archived footage and thought it was funny that the first one that I watched after the Australian GP was Canadian GP 1998.   Almost as equal of a chaotic start, DNF cars, and leader domination in Schumacher as Max did.  Also, I miss Murray's commentary.
Watched highlights of the Aussie GP, and remembered something   Man, they fucked up with those two consecutive DRS zones based off of one detection point. Way too overpowered, let the detection zone be in the middle of the chicane to allow for some battles. Otherwise it allows a car to immediately gap a car that it overtook. That's just not racing, it requires no racecraft to do so if you have even a slight pace advantage. It's even worse because these cars aren't as easy to follow in as 2022. All around worse racing this year is probably going to be masked by the field being much more bunched up.
Have a good Easter weekend from Australia 🦘
How will the new sprint format affect grid penalties? Can teams choose whether to take them in the sprint or the race?
Does anyone know when we will be receiving some news about the budget cap for 2022? We're already in April and IIRC they wanted to finish it up earlier this year as opposed to last year when things were done only in October..
Does anybody know where I can get/ read this book: Scandalous: The Real Story Behind F1 by Jason Currill? I can’t seem to find it anywhere
Lately, I have been rewatching a couple of races from the early/mid-2000s and back then, as many of you probably know, the teams were allowed to refuel during the race.  They had to decide how much fuel they're putting in the cars before their final run in Qualifying and were not allowed to change the amount before the race any more.  What do you think, how would things change nowadays if they were allowed to refuel again?   Of course it's just a thought experiment, so let's leave out safety measures and everything that could go wrong during a pitstop for this one.  In my opinion, qualy would be improved a bit because it would shake things up a bit more. Let's say cars like today's McLaren or the Alpines only have enough fuel onboard to do an outlap, fastlap and come back into the pits and voilà, front row spot or even P1; whereas teams like RB, Merc and Ferrari are looking to have a more reliable strategy for the race, so they would add more fuel to go longer in their first stints on Sunday's race.   Consequently, the race would also be improved, wouldn't it? All in all, I think refueling would raise the probability for a mixed up grid, at least from time to time.  It would also allow the drivers to really "go for it" some more, without having to watch fuel loads as much in order to make it to the chequered flag.  Just to clarify, I'm not saying they should reimplement refueling right away but watching some older races made me think about how it would change today's F1 and I'm curious about other people's opinions on this.
Who can possibly beat Verstappen over a season with a similar cars? I‘d argue Hamilton as we saw in 2021 and Alonso but other than I don’t really see someone. Russell has amazing talent but he really needs a better car than max.  Leclerc still makes too much mistakes when it matters. Perez and Sainz are simply too slow. My Wildcard would be Norris as we never saw him in a close to the top machinery.
Does anyone know what would've happened if manor didn't return to the grid in 2015? Would their prize money be spread out to the other teams or would sauber have gotten it?
Why do fastest cars sometimes use a harder compound only on Q2 and not in Q1?
Hi I got slightly interested because my dad lives in a state where a racer for Williams is from now? Either way I’m kinda using that as an excuse to watch since I’ve always been curious but idk how anything works car wise or people wise. Is F1 22 manager and the ea sports one good intros to how the cars and people work and the feel?
If they call a safety car and then a red flag right after, how is it fair that the people that pit under the safety car lose their place on the grid? Basically what happened to George on Sunday. Sorry if this is obvious, I’m relatively new to f1
Why is there a full month break just as the season is getting started?
This is a question about F2/F3 but because they use the same track, I thought someone might know the answer.   F2 and F3 obviously have more cars on the grid, how do they line up the excess amount of cars at the start when there’s only like 20 grid boxes?
Why don't drivers get to keep the trophies they win when they podium? It always goes back to shiny cabinets in team's home base. Or are those replicas?
*New to F1 so spare the downvotes.*  Why is so much praise given to drivers if the cars they drive are at such different levels of performance?   I would think that most drivers in the current Red Bull could place in the top ten most races. I’m new, so I suppose I’ve only ever see Max Verstappen drive the RB and then George Russell moving up into Mercedes (another top car) from Williams.   Obviously, drivers should receive credit for the driving, but they all should receive credit. How does one tell when a driver is actually better than the other?
Even with the new changes in the sprint race format, people don't seem to want anything to do with sprints.  I mean i would prefer watching a sprint over a practice session, now that it does not affect the Main Race Grid. Why so much hate for Sprints?
So I was taking to a girl about F1 recently, I don't know much about F1. Please help me out     I really don't have much info of all the drivers.I recently started having interest in F1. I have so many queries to ask. However, I am slowly learning about this sport.  Talking about Schumacher, he's not mentioned often when its about winning majority race. Hamilton comes first instead.   What do I reply to this?
Curious Question: Is there a significant difference between the Williams FW13 and the FW13b, or are the differences very miniscule?
I'm getting a little tired of the Mercedes "in-fighting" (for want of a better way of putting it) over Lewis' "the team didn't listen to me" comments. Sure, he knows what feels good in a car, and can give feedback to highlight areas of improvement, but the media spin on it seems to be that he had an epic design in hand and no one bothered to pay him any attention, which I find even more irksome given how well he and George did in Australia.  I'm hoping it dies down soon enough though, but with the best part of a month to go until Baku, my hopes aren't high.
Given the status of Red Bull's dominance (and general dominance over the years for various teams). I had a thought that perhaps F1 should just lean in to it being an engineering competition and just drop new regulations every year.  Teams would have no insight as to what the regs will be and you get a couple months to build a car and the rest of the season to develop (no developing next year's car with this year's budget).  Changes could be major or minor depending.   Main advantage would be that you can't develop a dominant car where your dominance lasts until the next regulation changes  Downside is that I'm probably significantly underestimating how much time you need to develop a new car (but perhaps having more "unsolved" cars is better and really puts value in the development).   Possible other downside is that you end up with a dominant team each season (although the team could change) because you only get one chance.  Obviously, the idea is that CFD time reduction is supposed to allow for catch-up and we haven't seen the effect of that - but my guess is that by the time the teams catch RBR, we'll have the 2026 regs around the corner
I seriously don’t see the people’s love for Lando Norris other than being British and promoted by the UK pundits. He’s above average at best but not even close to WC contender.
A review of the Race. Still can't believe what happened Sunday in Australia.  https://youtu.be/ZXrXw6o\_gXc
I was super in to F1 during the Raikkonen years when McLaren were doing pretty well.  I started to grow less interested after that time.  However I really want my boys to experience the love I had.  Is it worth it these days?  It seems more geared towards dramas than actual racing?
Is there anywhere on the Vegas strip to get any f1 merch?  I walked the entire main strip yesterday And saw no mention of the coming f1 race anywhere.  No merch.  No signs.  No ads.
Rank the following in order from most titles to least titles by the time they retire:  Leclerc   Norris   Piastri   Russell   Verstappen     You can put the predicted number of titles by each one to spice things up
I asked a website that uses ChatGPT to answer the trolly problem, Formula 1 vs NASCAR.  https://imgur.com/a/sU2SLP3
**F1 Sprint Race Format Idea**  We all want to see more overtaking in sprint races. However, the reverse grid format is controversial because it appears to penalize the leaders. A simple alternative could involve a random starting order that evens out across the entire season. But this approach is not perfect, as it's easier to overtake on some tracks than on others.  My idea:  At the beginning of the season, each team receives 1000 points per driver. They can allocate these points across all sprint races to bid on starting positions. Teams can strategize by bidding more on tracks where overtaking is more difficult. The sprint starting grid is simply determined by the amount of points that was bid for this race with a coin flip tiebreaker. This method ensures fairness and eliminates the need for sprint race qualifying, as required by the current rules.  Does anybody see any issues with this?
Clicked on YouTube recommendation of Russian Grand Prix that Norris+McLaren screwed up the W when it started raining kind of funny people on comments said he will win titles in 5 years lol .it's been 2 years and they're moving backwards even lando
I
I feel like F1 could miss the opportunity to get more teams on the grid. The current hype makes F1 very attractive to new entries but it seems like FOM and current teams get greedy and gamble on even more growth in the future and that the new teams would pay even more in a few years than they would now.  If the hype falls of in the next few years (what will happen in FIA doesn't do something about the lame rb dominace), we will still have only 10 teams of which only two have a realistic chance of winning wcc. Not because there was no interest in other teams joining but because the bar was set too high and the potential wasn't used out of pure greed.  Now don't get me wrong. I don't want another wave of Marussia/HRT/Caterham. The sustainability of the teams should be checked in advance. But   with the current budget cap and the already high entry fee this is an easy task.
Is having Adrian Newey on your team "cheating"?  It is no secret that Adrian Newey is without a doubt a genius within his craft which is why I find myself wondering if it's "fair" for him to continue on as an engineer within a single team?  I personally feel as though a fairer way of utilizing a man of his knowledge and experience would be as an FIA executive helping keep the grid close together through technical innovations that benefits all the teams rather than finding ways to keep a singular one ahead. I'm interested to see what some of you think on this.
How can you even call it an race when the drivers aren’t even driving the same car?  I don’t get, it would be like playing football with different sized goals. Not fair at all.
I wasn't able to watch the Australia GP live. Is there a way for me to watch the race in full now?
Has there ever been any consideration or discussion for rubberized asphalt on racing circuits? Suposedly it has more grip and is also good for sustainability.
What's everyone's favorite driver from this season so far?
I’m high af. And here’s a conspiracy theory I have which might not be fully false.   RB’s driver lineup in a couple of years will be volatile given both Perez and Ricciardo are not young anymore. The current crop of RB young drivers, even the ones in F2 and F3 don’t seem great.   What if Webber masterminds a move for Piastri to RB? He’s considered highly by the grid, and would’ve some experience in a (lower) midfield team as well. This would be a great move also if Verstappen leaves the team for whatever reason.
I've been doing the same, watched some 98 and 99 and am now most of the way through 2000.
As a new watcher, I couldn’t believe that they would have that system. To allow a car to use the DRS to pass another, and then for that car to get free DRS while in clean air for an entire second stretch to leave the other in the dust is insane. Especially when it was a red bull car doing the double DRS dipping.   Since DRS exists solely to increase the amount of passes wouldn’t it make more sense to have a second detection zone and then we actually could get a battle?
They'll have to update the rules if they want anything different to how it currently works, which is that the penalty can only be taken in the race.
The deadline for teams to submit their 2022 Cost Cap Submission was 31st of March, the rest depends on how quickly the FIA are able to process these documents and how much further investigation is required.
Iirc the FIA tries to clear everyone before 1 july
End date is end of March to hand in the final paper work for 2022 - as we saw last year it was evaluated between that and September, it's the evaluation part that they wanted to speed up.
Last year the FIA published the budget inquiry at the beginning of October.
Many times, all of mixed grid lasted until first pit stop ;)  Yeah, i completely agree, at least it would be interesting to watch how it would work nowadays
I think that races from back then were a bit more boring. Overcut was way stronger than an undercut, and overtaking was done in the pits more often than not.
Might depend on the car though.   For example: a car with oversteer? Maybe Alonso, Hamilton, Leclerc, possibly Russell. Crazy oversteer ? *Maybe* Alonso or Hamilton, depending on the steering system and seat feeling they have, possibly no one.   Cars that tend to understeer? I think both Alonso and Hamilton would edge Max. Crazy car that does whatever? No idea lol. He Renault 2005 or the rb with the ebd required very peculiar driving styles, often deemed unnatural and not instinctive iirc, which could mix things up.  Teams and luck would also have an effect, margins would probably be so small that a strategy mistake (e.g. pitting them behind a Renault they can't overtake...) or a bit of luck (e.g. a car suddenly going slowly into the last corner of the last race... ) could be enough to decide things...
Charles qualifying is actually too good to discount him that easily. Also, Max himself is actually kind of an iffy driver if he knows he has to fight for it. It's not that hard to frustrate him on track as Hamilton showed in 2021. If Ferrari don't fuck up as much as they did in 22, Leclerc would've really taken the fight to Max
Hamilton and Alonso for sure. Russell, Norris and Leclerc all fairly likely.   But who knows, the sport doesn’t always work out that way.
>Who can possibly beat Verstappen over a season with a similar cars?  With equal luck - nobody.  >I‘d argue Hamilton as we saw in 2021  What we saw in 2021 was Hamilton coming into the last GP with equal points despite at least equal cars and much better fortune. With equal luck Verstappen wraps it up before the last race. And Max got only better since and Lewis likely worse.  >and Alonso  I don't see it. While Alonso is very good, his margins over Ocon indicate he would be some way behind Verstappen, especially in qualy.  >Leclerc still makes too much mistakes when it matters.  I see this comment quite often but he doesn't make more mistakes than Hamilton of the past years. On pure pace he would be the closest to Verstappen but would still be behind over the course of the season.
Norris?... one hell of a wild card bud in that car
I swear to God people are really overrating Max relative to the rest of the grid, he would have close fights with Lewis, Alonso, Russell, Leclerc, and maybe Norris. He isn't head and shoulders above the grid
Max was better than Hamilton in 2021. Yes barring AD Lewis would’ve won but that season should’ve been wrapped up before that. Baku blowout and Silverstone cost Max 40-50 points. Objectively he made less mistakes and was better driver that season.
Are you watching qualifying from older seasons? There used to be a rule that if you made it into Q3 you had to start the race on the tyres you set your fastest lap on in Q2, but that got removed in 2022 IIRC.
Q1, lots of cars on track. Higher chance of issues or flags so it’s import to get a lap in first chance. Equally between P3 and Q1 there are other events and so dirt, marbles and dust end up on the track so there’s an element of the track ramping up.
i guess being out in q1 ruins the race, but if out in q2 that is still manageable for points
Senna, Prost, Hamilton, Schumacher, Verstappen, Clark, Fangio, Alonso, Lauda... I like Kimi, not putting him above any of those guys. Hell, wouldn't have him above Vettel who I think is just outside that list.
All time you mean including non-F1 drivers like A.J. Foyt or Nivola?
F1 manager is good but it has a lot of bugs, F1 22 sucks. Get F1 2020 or 21 if you’re gonna buy an F1 video game.
It's not fair. Pitting under SC is a gamble, either it goes well and you climb 3/4 positions, or it goes bad and you're stuck behind everyone in a standing start.
It's an inherent risk - the same way that someone pits under regular race conditions and looses their place to someone who pits under safety car (which is faster, as cars go slower around the circuit, but your pit stop time stays the same).      A (V)SC can also become a red flag, as it's up to the race director to evaluate correct measures.
Fair doesn't matter with safety. There's been a lot of people debating racing vs. entertainment after the Aus GP, but in my mind it's a hierarchy: 1. Safety 2. Racing 3. Entertainment. I'd rather they risk a potentially unwarranted red flag than risk the lives of volunteer marshals who want more time/space to clear the track. Who pitted or who didn't isn't a factor.
shit happens, sometimes it goes your way, sometimes it doesn't
Chinese GP was originally scheduled for April 16th, but was cancelled back in January because of Covid and the quarantine requirements that existed at the time.
There’s more than 20 grid boxes
There are way more than 20 boxes, considering that major circuits like Monza, Silverstone etc host a variety of categories (Rally, Endurance, Touring) and each of them has a wider or smaller grid than the other, the circuits need to be able to house them.
There’s more than 20 (Silverstone, for example, has more than 30 than extend beyond the final turn). I’m sure they could also just paint more if on needed.
not always, depends on the driver's contract
Most of the people who earned this trophy do not sit in the cockpit.
Without Max, even in a dominant car like this year’s Red Bull, it would be difficult for Perez to win the championship (this can be controversial, I know).  Surely the car is the most important factor overall, but to win a championship you need much more and season after season you can appreciate the difference a driver can make.   First, comparison can be between teammates, then drivers in the same points range in the standings. Also, consistency and behavior in certain circumstances like overtakes or rain can give good hints.
The teams have way more data than us and can actually abstract the performance of a driver from the car he's driving.  We can draw some comparison as well, the easiest way is to compare teammates.
Teammates can be compared pretty confidently. Anything else depends on a healthy dose of speculation.
There are a lot of data points that teams can analyze, both during a race weekend and in the simulator. Right now, according to the media, Yuki is being lauded for his races thus far this year. He's in a back of the grid car, but is still driving competitively.  Also, there's a lot of "meet them where they're at." Comparing cars with like cars. Or comparing teammates.   So, to answer your question, they do receive credit when they're producing, even in a crap car.
I'm not a "more is more" type of guy. While I'll still watch every competitive session, that doesn't necessarily improve my experience of the racing weekend. With qualifying and the race at least there is a difference between the two formats, sprint races are just shorter races that doesn't feed into the experience of the main race.  That said, I'm not wholly opposed to the idea, I'm more in the "I don't really care" camp.
1. It cheapens the Grand Prix 2. Practise sessions are important, the new sprint format will have only one. The old sprint format had 2 but the second was in Parc Fermé IIRC so it was useless, so that's a good change. 3. 6 Sprint races run at 100km = 2 more GPs, when there are already too many in the season. 4. It doesn't even work on a full calendar so they have to change the rules for some weekends than get back to normal.
1. Dilutes the product 2. Gives spoilers as to who has what kind of race pace for the actual GP 3. It means you have to keep more days clear if you want to fully follow the narrative of the championship as they give points.  4. Makes things even harder for young drivers as it gives less time for practice.   I'm not to bothered by the sprint but the above are reasonable objections.
The thing I don't like about sprints is that they don't have pit stops to spice things up once things start settling. The only tyre strategy during sprints is choosing whether to do the whole thing on softs or mediums.
People on this sub tend to be more long-term fans, and that means in general we skew more towards "purist" when it comes to rules and regulations, which is why you get a lot of complaints about new ideas.  I know plenty of people who enjoy the Sprint format, and the viewership numbers show that more people tune in on Fridays and Saturdays of Sprint weekends, so clearly there is an audience out there.
> people don't seem to want anything to do with sprin  I promise you vast majority of people do. The hardcore fanbase that spends all day talking and debating F1 is not what FOM is primarily appealing to. Most people are happy to see more action instead of just practices.
The only reasonable argument against Sprint is still the same: it's overstretching the team in a budget cap 23 race era where people are already being over worked.   Any other argument is people pretending to be purist for the sake of it. For some very weird reason, there's a lot of high brow behaviour towards what is essentially a pay to win engineering contest.
My problems are fully subjective. The weekend now has a nice flow to it with practices first, then the qualy and the race, building up excitement over the weekend, plus as i tend to work on friday afternoons, missing a practice is usually not a huge deal, and sometimes i can watch them in the background. With the sprint format, the whole thing gets distrupted for me, the flow of the weekend changes, and watching a qualy at work is usually harder. But if it becomes the norm i can adjust to it, it just does not feel good at the moment for me.
Because I almost always miss them in the schedule when the weekend happens 😅
If I've got your question correctly, yes, Hamilton is the driver who has won the most Grand Prix in history with 103 victories, 12 more than Schumacher's 91.  But I mean, when talking about dominance, drivers who have won majority of races etc, Schumacher is in the discussion indeed since ha had years of dominance.
As far as I recall, the sidepods were reshaped and the Renault engine was upgraded, but nothing drastic yes.
It’s clear that Angela had an epic car design and bolted when they didn’t listen to her.
>I'm getting a little tired of the Mercedes "in-fighting" (for want of a better way of putting it) over Lewis' "the team didn't listen to me" comments.  And George is sticking with the team. He said that he and Lewis had both knew the car concept and had believed it was right. It looks to me like George slowly wants to take over the team and be the man at Merc. Media sees it, sniffs possible drama and will blow things out of proportion and grift on the topic like there is no tomorrow.  >I'm hoping it dies down soon enough though, but with the best part of a month to go until Baku, my hopes aren't high.  I'm pleased to meet a fellow realist.
One of the biggest draw of F1 is that the cars are the fastest around a circuit, and every time a new set of regs roll around the cars slow down quite significantly unless by design (2017). When 2014 rolled around the sport actually did take quite a hit from the much slower cars, Merc dominance and "vacuum cleaner" sound of the cars.  Another thing is that new regs means opening up a new box of potential loopholes and unforeseen consequences. A new set of regs does not stop a team from finding a loophole that puts them head and shoulders above the rest, and also could lead to a porpoising situation that embarrasses the sport, again.  Finally, I think you'd find that new regs don't really bring teams closer together. I would argue that Red Bull had a clearly better concept that put them a league ahead after the summer break last season, and no one will argue about Mercedes in 2014. On the flipside, the closest the teams came together usually came around the last season of regulations like 2021 and 2008.
I'd say more like 2-3 years per reg change is better. Every year would just be a middle finger to the manufacturers' egos, they'd run away immediately.
>Given the status of Red Bull's dominance (and general dominance over the years for various teams). I had a thought that perhaps F1 should just lean in to it being an engineering competition and just drop new regulations every year.  >Teams would have no insight as to what the regs will be and you get a couple months to build a car and the rest of the season to develop (no developing next year's car with this year's budget).  >Changes could be major or minor depending.   That's not F1 though. Changing the Formula every year is just trying artifically to fuck up the teams.  Also few months alone aren't sufficient to build a good car that's totally different than the previous year one.  >Main advantage would be that you can't develop a dominant car where your dominance lasts until the next regulation changes  Advantage? Forget about teams like Ferrari, Mercedes, RBR, Audi, Toyota etc.   >Downside is that I'm probably significantly underestimating how much time you need to develop a new car (but perhaps having more "unsolved" cars is better and really puts value in the development).   Having more unsolved cars isn't really coherent with the image of the sport of being the world's top class for motor racing though.  >Possible other downside is that you end up with a dominant team each season (although the team could change) because you only get one chance.  Yep, but does it change a lot if every year a team dominates? Is it really better? Their victories would be quite meaningless imo.
Eh, put his driving performance aside, which I still think is exceptional, he is a very large social media personality who streams regularly and does all the Gen Z influencer stuff.
How can you say he's above average at best? I don't think it's easy to accurately measure his skill level. But he's shown enough these last few years that at the very least you have to entertain the possibility that he's up there on the current grid.
Considering he's not had a championship contender car, ever, in F1, its impossible to say what he's actually made of. I think most people base their judgement on him the same way they did for Russell. Evaluating his performance in context of the car's capabilities
Absolutely shocking take, I assume you didn't watch 2021 then.
Sorry, I strongly disagree. If you look at his performances in a weaker car over the previous 3 seasons, he's very consistently made the most of almost every weekend.  Close to what verstappen was doing in the Merc era. Look at Max now in the best car
I do.  He's a very capable driver, even though the car might not show it, maybe not quite Max or Alonso level, but i think he'd definitely wouldn't get lost at the front of the field. At least on par with Russell, Bottas, Perez etc.
It took Sergio 20 laps to catch up with him. And we all know the difference between RB and McLaren this year.
Of course it's worth it. If you're not a fan of the new marketing side of it (Drive to Survive, social media presence...) you can very well still just follow the GP weekends and read about it on specialized sites. The 2021 season was so good with the fight between Lewis and Max (regardless of the Abu Dhabi finale), and now the new regulations have allowed for better and closer racing. I'd say the midfield battles are becoming pretty good. You and your boys will enjoy it for sure.
> It seems more geared towards dramas than actual racing?  If you only enjoy the racing, then there's still enough there to get a fair bit out of it. These days there aren't a hundred overtakes per race, but part of the fun is watching the drivers set up an overtake laps in advance.
Oof. F1 merch is expensive as is. Can’t imagine the Vegas markup on top of that. Sorry I didn’t answer your question in any way, shape, or form.
I was in Vegas last weekend and saw frequent ads for it on a few of the video boards above the hotels (Caesars & MGM mainly) not sure where you’re looking. I did not see any F1 merch for sale but as it gets closer it probably will be sold at shops on the strip.
Verstappen (all the titles)  Russell, Norris, Leclerc, Piastri (0)  A bit more seriously: It's impossible to tell who will be in the right place at the right time. I believe they're all talented enough to win championships if they have car for it
Honestly giving grid positions by bidding is too similar to the lotteries that were done pre-war to determine the starting grid of Grands Prix.   I think it should involve racing more and not some external aspects like this.
>Does anybody see any issues with this?  Without extending this to you personally, this sounds like a stupid idea.  Let's just treat it like a sport.
To be fair, the "lame rb dominance" is no different to the lame Mercedes dominance that we had to suffer since 2014.  To your underlying point though, I do agree with what you're saying. I feel the shitstorm around the Andretti entry has exposed F1 for the greedy self-interested sport that it really is, and has probably put off potential competitors. They really should be doing what they can to capitalise on their popularity.
let me guess, you had none of these bright ideas during the mercedes dominance
I mean he’s nothing to do with Merc and  that team obliterated the competition for 8 years.
While I would like this to be a closer championship and his expertise to be used to make everyone have amazing and fast cars, but this would be like asking if the Chicago Bulls were cheating when they had Michael Jordan.
Let it also be Red Bulls problem when he leaves/retires and the succession doesn’t yield as much performance. Ferrari also had a similar success streak in the 2000s that was credited with similarly key members that left at a certain point.
Simple answer is that it's both a constructors and drivers competition. Teams are competing against each other to produce the best-performing car, and they need the most talented drivers to get it to the finish line.
That's right, Manchester City vs Southampton isn't a football match because the resources behind them to create the product on pitch is vastly different.
Because F1 is not a sport of driver vs driver.  It's Driver + team + car against driver + team + car (and all of them against external conditions, such as weather, problems etc).  What you're suggesting is spec series, there are a good numbers existing that you can follow, F2 being an example. That focuses on the capability of drivers and teams to set up the same car rather than building the best package.  Without competition between manufacturers, F1 wouldn't be the pinnacle of Motorsport today, just another serie that can disappear on a few years.
Most motorsports aren't 'spec series'.      In fact, I'd say full spec series are very rare compared with motorsports that allow multiple manufacturers, engine providers, parts providers ect.
Football teams aren’t all equal. A rich team can spend much more to get better players than a smaller club. They might play with the same sized goal but in that analogy F1 cars all race on the same track.
The competition between constructors is what drives the kind of innovation that allows this sport to be the most technologically advanced motorsport in the world. I also questioned the merits of this system when I first started watching it, but gradually, over the past couple of years, I began to understand and appreciate its merits.
Because the best car doesn’t win every race.  Every team has the same general design, has to follow the same regulations and has $145,000,000 to spend. There are ways to tweak those designs and regulations to gain a competitive advantage by hiring the right people. Yes they are very different cars and some teams have advantages, but it doesn’t last forever.
if you have f1tv. or sail the high seas.
Just look up racereplay
If you have YouTubeTv, ESPN has coverage in the states and it should be accessible in the library for some time.
I see Lando getting a RB seat in your scenario
Thoughts? I miss the sound mostly. Rule differences. I still find it hilarious that if they junked the car on the opening lap, they could run back to the pits to get the spare car.
Thanks! Seems like we still have to wait a bit if the deadline was the last day of March.
The way Alonso drove that 2005 Renault was insane. Nothing about it looks right. It wouldn't have been a surprise if he spun off in every corner, but he just didn't. However insane it looked though, it clearly worked!
Hamilton, Alonso, Charles and maybe George could take it to him in similar machinery. It's amazing within the elite 20 drivers that drive in F1, there's an even more elite subset.  Disagree re: Hamilton proving it's not hard to frustrate him in 2021. He also did it in Brazil 2022 and Australia 2023 :P
I didn’t meant to discredit Leclercs speed, he certainly has it but for me it his mistakes, and Ferraris ofc, like imola and France.
Where does the much better fortune come from? I mean yes Verstappen got unlucky in silverstone, Hungary and Baku. But at the same time he got lucky in spa, Brazil, Jeddah, Russia and and not at last AD. So it’s not like he got unlucky all the time, a lot of things came in his favor.
It is odd considering we've seen him have close battles with both Leclerc and Hamilton in the last two years - some where he came out ahead and some where he lost out.
Why do you say F1 22 is so bad? (I've never played it, the last one I played was F1 21)
That should be the hierarchy but it isn't. If safety was the priority we wouldn't keep bunching the field up and certainly would never using a standing start for a restart.   It would take very little effort, if a red flag is required after first throwing a SC, to take the order as it was when the SC was first thrown. No more dangerous either.
what would your chinese gp prediction be. since that track has been for better or worse abandoned since covid
I think I'm with you there - I'll watch it with a ton more interest than I would a practice session, but I don't really think they add anything to the overall race weekend, as they mostly play out like the first phase of a race.
> The only reasonable argument  It's always a bit rich to consider oneself the judge of what's reasonable.  My argument against it is quite a common one that I absolutely consider reasonable. It devalues both Qualifying and the main race.   It devalues qualifying because it basically doesn't matter much anymore, anyone who finished out of position will be able to correct that for the race.   It devalues the race because we already know the rough race pace of most cars and we'll also most likely have fewer drivers out of position due to poor one-lap pace.   If you disagree with that, fine, but you're not the judge of what I or anyone finds more entertaining or better for the sport.
Thank you.
I knew it! Cullen-Hamilton team as a surprising entrant for 2026, calling it now.
Watching all seasons since 2003, mate!
>maybe not quite Max or Alonso level  Today's Alonso or peak Alonso? Because he is on the same level as Fernando is now, and last season was a pretty good indication.  >At least on par with Russell, Bottas, Perez etc.  Russell and Norris are considerably better than Bottas and Perez
Yeah i just did the strip twice and didn’t see any ads.   Walked through pretty much every hotel and the only one i saw that had anything was the wynn.  Was hoping to see a lil f1 merch shop somewhere but no dice.   There’s so much happening in Vegas though so it’s possible I’m just missing ads as they switch on the screens
>A bit more seriously: It's impossible to tell who will be in the right place at the right time. I believe they're all talented enough to win championships if they have car for it  Absolutely, I mean no one would've guessed that Alonso and Kimi would *only* have 3 WDCs between them after their breakthrough year in 2003 when all was said and done. Just thought it would be fun to see people's hypotheticals
I understand, but over the entire season, my system would even things out quite well. With a lottery, it might not. I don't think it adds much randomness, but it would significantly increase overtaking.
I must admit I've only been a fan for the past 2-3 years so outside of the controversial DAS system I'm not too sure what made the Mercedes such a good car.
Interesting, I would have considered Max to be MJ in this scenario. This does make me ask how are engineer contracts structured within F1 and how come we don't hear of other teams approaching Newey? What's tied him to RB for seemingly so long?
But nobody knows the engineers behind the cars, everybody just knows the drivers. The best car seems to pretty much always win, so wouldn’t it make sense to to drive en the same car and let the better driver actually win and not being held back?
Thank you!
fullraces.com as well
Interesting to see both the differences and how much is still the same. It's amazing to see marshalls scurry about clearing cars under just a waved yellow, especially given the last race. Go back a bit further to 96/97 and it's much easier to see how hard people are driving, the movement of the cars and the noise really does add a lot that we don't see today.  A big difference is something you mentioned, getting to hear Murray Walker again. I'm sure a lot of it is nostalgia having grown up listening to him but he could encapsulate the drama and convey his own excitement in just a handful of words. An incredible communicator.
i think max was just being cautious with the 4 strong DRS that he can use anytime to get lewis. It's not the spicy engine Mercedes we came to fear anymore.
> It's amazing within the elite 20 drivers that drive in F1, there's an even more elite subset.  One of the most humbling lessons I learned from F1 is how much a tenth of a second actually matters.
Max:  Lucky in Spa? He could've gotten a bigger gap here. Brazil? They should've given him 5 seconds penalty, he could've created a bigger gap towards Bottas. But okay, that's +3 points. Jeddah...Lewis could've passed him repeatedly. Shitshow from race control. Russia: Lewis benefited just about as much. Leaves Abu Dhabi.  Now, let's look at Lewis. Imola he got lucky with the red flag right as he yeeted himself off which allowed him to cancel his error. Bahrain is arguable, another stewarding shitshow which ended in his favor. Baku he threw away himself, he was lucky with Max's DNF. Silverstone; ignoring the crash itself, Wolff did mention that car wouldn't have made it to the finish without the red flag period to fix it, AND he only won because Leclerc got issues. Hungary: Avoiding Bottas Bowling, and then gaining 3 free points at the end (against Max's 1) with the Vettel DSQ. Russia: Same as Max. Tho I'd rather put this on both of them being great with rain. Qatar: Max getting a ridiculous quali penalty robbing us of a race.  Lewis's bad luck: Monza and Abu Dhabi, that's literally it.  So yeah, luck was heavily in Lewis's favor.
While Max had shit luck in Baku, he perhaps got *really* lucky that Lewis locked up during the restart. That mistake above all others cost him the championship.
The handling is terrible and unrealistic, even if you apply throttle at the same and correct time as previous games you’ll spin half the time. It’s incredibly inconsistent.
Exactly, if safety is paramount, a standing start has more risk than a que behind the SC as the mess gets cleaned up, like the Albon crash. The question is how many laps under the SB the job takes. 10 laps behind a SC sucks for the car, driver and fans
> It devalues the race because we already know the rough race pace of most cars and we'll also most likely have fewer drivers out of position due to poor one-lap pace.  Oh no, the guys who were going to get overtaken on Sunday got overtaken on Saturday
I have to disagree, I have never seen Norris pull moves like Alonso did in Bahrain or be so smart on the radio about rules and strategy.
either, alonso just has something special to his driving imo
Absolutely superior engine. The token system locked in that advantage and made it extremely difficult for competition to catch up.  Fact that Red Bull was “up there” is a testimony to Newey’s and whole RB aero department’s ingenuity though. Their chassis and aero was always top of the field but they just couldn’t seriously challenge Merc with such big engine deficit.
Yeah it's not a 1:1 comparison, but most other sports don't have such an insane degree of equipment disparity, so you want the MJ of aero and driving ability. But I could see Mercedes backing up a dump truck of money for him to jump ship. But I'm also new to following the sport so I'd have no idea why that might not work. Aston Martin has seemed to poach engineers from Red Bull, though.
The engineers are pretty famous, though of course not nearly as famous as the drivers (except for Adrian Newey). As the teams are also incredibly difficult to manage, team principals are pretty well-known as well.  Formula 1 has always been a constructors/engineering competition, and I'd say that might be one of the main reasons why it has become the most popular autosport in the world. If you follow F1 news you'll see that a very large proportion of them are focused on the technical aspects of the cars, what has been innovative, what isn't working, where there's room for upgrades, anything.  I can understand you might not like this, and that's why spec series exist (F2 is one of those). In these competitions all cars are basically the same, as they're required to run on the same chassis and engine. The competition is then focused on the drivers and how well a team can set up the car.
It's hard yo list the 500+ employees who contribute to building the car, F1 is a team championship first.      But it also takes a good driver to be constantly able to get close to the potential of the car. It's common to see difference between drivers results from the same car.
Absolutely agreed. I wish the F1TV archive went back into the 70s & 80s with their full race footage. Having Murray and James Hunt in the booth was awesome.   Yes. Being able to hear and see how hard the drivers were pushing the cars. Everything seems a little smoother these days but hearing the screaming V10s, you can hear every little blip of the throttle as they saw away at the wheel to find the grip.
I was more referring to his comments that the overtake was unfair. Seemed a bit out of character for him and seems to only be riled up like that when it's comes to Lewis. Especially strange because he's not really fighting him last or this year.
Hamilton didn't benefit as much as Verstappen in Russia. Hamilton was running 2nd and won one place and 7 points thanks to the rain. Verstappen was running 7th, after he was overtaken by Alonso (plus Leclerc behind him was gaining on him too), and gained 5 places plus 12 points thanks to the rain although it has to be said that he wouldn't be in the position without the grid penalty anyway. So it evens out.   Hamilton also lost out 18 points vs Verstappen thanks to the penalty in Turkey plus 14 points in France because Mercedes squandered his lead due to strategy, he also lost 6 points in Austria II thanks to floor damage and 3 points in the Brazilian sprint race because he had to start from last (although it was also the best weekend to get a grid penalty thanks to the same sprint race)   Still, overall Hamilton was the luckier driver in that season but there were certainly more than two races where Hamilton was unlucky.
What a reasonable take.
Hi /u/doublejohnnie -- Please make sure to add a DeepL translation in the comment section if the article you're sharing isn't written in English.
Nope. Not hoping. Reserving it for 2024.
well for one thing I like this honest Fred, he admitted the mishap of Saturday.
Are these the same guys, who said SF-23 is one second faster than F1-75 in the simulator?
Translation?
So updates in Baku, Imola, Miami and Barcelona.   Hopefully enough to bring Ferrari back into regular contention for best of the rest.
#Ferrari SF-23: no B-car but early news and intensive development   Ferrari undoubtedly took a step forward in performance in Australia, even if the Grand Prix ended with zero points for the Scuderia. The standings here certainly don't reflect the value of the Ferrari SF-23, which, although far from what its creators thought the car should be, was taking a podium in Bahrain with Charles Leclerc and a fourth place in Australia with Carlos Sainz. *"In Australia we took a step forward, but we didn't realise the potential of the car. There was a strange feeling at the end of the race because of that,'* explained team principal, Frederic Vasseur. Carlos Sainz's Ferrari was the fastest car on the track **and for the first time the SF23 was faster than the AMR23 in the race**, showing that the work carried out in Maranello in recent weeks is starting to bear fruit. It should be noted, however, that **Sainz's comeback was countered by a containment race by the Hamilton-Alonso duo**, so the SF-23's progress against the AMR23 in particular will certainly have to be re-evaluated.  ##The 'new development line' introduced in Australia gave the hoped-for answers.   The former Alfa Romeo-Sauber team boss had spoken of a development programme that would include new features in all races. On paper, however, **in Melbourne the team showed up with the same Ferrari SF-23 that raced in Jeddah**, on a circuit not so different (both front limited) but with a completely different performance result. *"**In Melbourne we took a different route for development** and it seems to have worked. However, we did not exploit the potential of the car especially in qualifying,"* said Vasseur.  *"On Saturday we mismanaged. Charles didn't get a chance to do the preparation lap and Carlos made a mistake at the first corner otherwise we were on the front row. It was a mistake of the whole team, there is nothing between the drivers or individual mistakes. **In the race, however, the car was more balanced**, less peaky, and this allowed Carlos - unfortunately not Charles - to push harder and show a performance closer to Red Bull”.* However, there is no time - and no desire - to stop at these improvements, which are still not enough to turn the season around, but above all Vasseur has a clear idea of what Ferrari will need now. *“**I think we are on the right track**, but in Baku we will have to confirm the progress made in Australia”.* **The Australian race was slow and without any noticeable wear on any car.**  In Australia, **the only change that affected the Ferrari SF-23 related to the underbody**, a part that always has a major influence on the performance of this new generation of cars. In Arabia, a new underfloor specification had made its debut on the Italian car, recognisable by the end section near the rear wheels which has an upward flap. **But the changes don't end there, as there are further novelties on the outer kerb and especially on the underside. New specification that**, once correlated in the second free practice session of the season, **was taken to the track for the entire weekend in Australia, giving the SF-23 a greater load than the old specification**, but above all it allowed the engineers to better understand the car's behaviour, with more linear work over the weekend, without porpoising or set-up problems. Certainly, the asphalt in Melbourne benefited the Italian car, which, similar to the Mercedes W14, ran with a wider operating window. In this way, it is easier for the engineers to frame the optimal setup, which guarantees the car's peak performance.  ##Vasseur: no Spec-B but the evolution programme will be brought forward and will remain intense and divided into steps.  One of the topics that is holding court at the moment is the question of **Ferrari's aerodynamic concept**. Right or wrong? Will Maranello follow the path of Mercedes, which has 'condemned' its own philosophy, ready to marry another, or will it continue on its own path? Frederic Vasseur replied confidently. *”The one that will arrive in the next GPs **I don't think we can talk about a B-car** because it won't have such different shapes,”* explained Ferrari's Team Principal, then going into a little more detail about what will be the next evolutionary steps of the SF-23 and confirming what we had anticipated before Jeddah.  *"Before the start of the season there was a programme of developments, which then has to be adapted to what happens on track, to the problems and the behaviour of the car, and that cannot be thrown away completely. It is also not possible because of the budget cap and the limit of hours in the wind tunnel. **What we are doing is investing resources and time to anticipate certain components.** For example, what was planned for Barcelona will arrive at Imola and so on, trying to get ahead of schedule,”* the Frenchman pointed out. Updates that will already arrive in Baku, as anticipated on these pages, and then continue in the following rounds. As far as the next round of the season is concerned, Ferrari will have 'only' *"aerodynamic adaptations, because it is a complicated track to bring updates to, also because of the format of the Sprint Race,"* which they are **preparing in Maranello in its new guise**, i.e. with the Sprint Race completely disconnected from the Main Race. *"**Then we will have new things at Miami, Imola and Barcelona, but not at Monaco**."*
I don't really understand teams bringing updates in Baku when you have just FP1 to dial in your car before qualifying and the sprint. Am I missing something?
If the intense development produces updates of the quality we've seen in the last few years, it'll be more likely Ferrari will end up fifth in the WCC rather than move up to third.
cmon ferrari let leclerc finish a race
Whatever they bring its gonna be absolute shit , like their car and like their team

This sounds familiar
Novelties like confetti instead of fire?
My hopium stocks are low I'm just gonna save it and wait for the next year quota.
Ferrari now the Chicago Cubs of Formula 1 , Always next year and just 108 years between titles
It would take 1 good FP1 to jump back on the train, let’s not kid ourselfs.
Don‘t you mean 2026?
Next year is our our year.
Can't be faster if the engine doesn't last 10 laps when it's turned up
Turns out it is 1 second faster in Melbourne, although we don’t have a chicane there anymore.
The guys said what simulation said to engineers
Novelty = engine that can do more than say 25 laps.
Pack it in, all hope is lost.  They have no alternative versions of the car but they promise they'll do good and develop  the car
UPGRADE THE WHOLE 2023 SO WE CAN WIN IN 2024!
its because they have one month to develop new upgrades
They’re desperate
he fucked himself over at melbourne
Tis true. 😂
*Ferrari 1-2 by being the first out in a rain-soaked practice session*  # Did somebody say This Year™?!
Just first five min in FP1 when it is a Ferrari 1-2 when they are the only cars on soft tyres will bring back the hype train!
It really is. I'm so sure™
Where did you get this from lol
We never had a chicane even in 2022.
Hey maybe merc can get there one day
Novelty = steering wheel directly connected to the throttle
Hell, even a 1-3 would make people (myself included) act the same lol

If only we knew the secret deal Ferrari got, then we could compare if RB one was too light or not 🙄
Rich coming from Ferrari
Then breach it in a same way and reap the rewards. Should be worth it right?
Meet the new boss. Same as the old boss.   Don't get fooled again!
I guess if you can’t compete on the track, you compete in the paddock
I expect Ferrari to lead the charge in revising the penalties in the regs then. Surely that could never go wrong for them.
Distract and deflect.
Then why did all the teams agreed on this ruling in the first place?
Team principals talk so much garbage.    They all agreed to the idea of there being a difference in the penalty for minor overspending versus major overspending.  I guarantee the punishment they feel that would be fitting for red bull would fall into the major penalty.    If they truly believe the penalty was so small, then they should feel free to overspend by the same amount as red bull did if they truly think that $ extra they got was worth the loss of wind tunnel hours and CFD hours.... oh they won't do that, because of course that is not worth losing, it is a penalty
If the penalty is so light, go over the cap yourself then Freddie.
Let’s compare it to the penalty for the engine a couple years back.
Fred, we want fight on track not trash talking! You guys are the only team who "ruined" a perfect fast car in just a few months. 2022 was a car that was in a fight for P1, 2023 is a car fighting for P3-4. Like what the actual funk!!
400k extra to spend or 840 vs 756 hours of wind tunnel time, 672 vs 605 runs and 168 vs 151 hours wind on time.  Which of those has the biggest impact on car performance? No one here knows. And anyone here who claims that 'certainly X or Y' is full of shit. But I can imagine that FIA chose the penalty in a way that it does not  incentivise more breaches.  But I'm quite certain that the severity of the penalty did not cause AM and merc to catch up / jump Ferrari in performance.
I'd perhaps concentrate on the reason for Ferrari being the most overfunded yet underdelivering team on the grid.
You gotta at least be in the same stratosphere as Red Bull before you can start complaining about something as insignificant as that.
Something about Ferrari rocket ship and penalties not being harsh.
He sounds so salty right now. Must be realizing how massive of a challenge is in front of them and already setting up excuses for the higher ups.
Ferrari should be punished just for being so incompetent at this point.
Right because $400k is responsible for the vast gulf between RBR and Ferrari.
You got a problem change your f*** car !!
You mean the punishment they all agreed on for a minor breach a few years ago?
British Media tabloids since RBR showed their 2023 dominance:  "Helmut Marco leaving / Horner comments on leaving / How long does Newey have left? / Max leaving due to sprint races / Perez leaving due to friction with Max? / Who will replace Perez? / RBR climate no longer friendly claims Helmut.M / Max shows weak attitude after outburst / Max Verstappen angry at Red Bull after Sergio Perez win / Red Bull have sewn up title after one race / RBR Dominance sucking the sport out of F1 / Daniel Ricciardo told he will never race in F1 / Sergio Perez deletes tweet after declaring war on Max.  I can go on and on, this is just the first 2-3 pages of google results. But lets not act oblivious about what they are trying to do.
I see the track battles are over
Redbull proceeds to win 2024 season with the RB18.
Surely you can spend 400k as well Fred and make a car just as fast as RedBull then. Should be no problem. Just take the penalty after since it's so "light".
It was a 0.2% overspend, if anything I think they went harder than makes actual sense to make an example of RBR and dissuade other teams from doing it in the future.  $400k covers a *single* front wing + nose cone. Is anyone seriously going to claim that *that's* the advantage that's made RBR more successful? It's idiotic.  Meanwhile Ferrari literally cheats with their PU and gets a secret agreement as a result because the FIA was too stupid to figure out exactly how on their own. Lol.
Change your f#ck¡ng car!
Well at least we know what the excuse will be if Ferrari doesn't catch up with Red Bull this season. Not that the penalty will have had much effect at this stage. As said by Red Bull themselves, the car we see right now was mostly finalized before the penalty. From now on we'll *maybe* start seeing the penalty kick in. I'm saying maybe because seeing that kick in, is dependent on the other teams catching up. We can't actually *see* the effects if their opponents don't do their own jobs properly.   I've said it before but right now Red Bull is incredibly lucky that the other two frontrunners screwed up. Both Ferrari and Mercedes have admitted that they'll have to switch concepts. In other words, whatever development time they spend on their current concepts will have been for nothing (expect for general knowledge gained). They are behind and need to play catch up. It's simply the best case scenario for Red Bull.   Here's my prediction for this year. At the end of the season Aston, Merc and Ferrari will have caught up with Red Bull. They'll all be fighting for wins. But Red Bull will have switched to 2024 early and pull away at the start of next season again. This time with more windtunnel time.
I appreciate the Guardian for adding such a derp picture at the top of their article.
If RB's performance was similar to AM, Merc, and Ferrari the penalties would have had a meaningful role. It only looks light because RB's car is so much better than everyone else's that the penalties will have zero impact.
Too light? didn't they get penalized to 63% development time?  That's significant.
Let's ban Ferrari an entire season for their engine sensor cheat then, shall we? Because 'we divided our overall catering costs per rata for the F1 employees but can't prove that's how much they actually ate of it' and 'we fucked up our tax credit paperwork' are nothing compared to 'we directly cheated the system to get an illegal advantage'
Ferrari as the only team having a veto in modern F1 is insane, says redditor endichrome
Some people fight on the track others fight in the media.
Pretty easy to say, now knowing that red bull is still the fastest. Had they not been as fast this year, it probably would have been a fine punishment.
Someone find him a good copium supplier, before he loses his mind. Oh yeah let's not forget they got a slap on the wrist 4 years ago for cheating
lol, stop embarrassing yourself and focus on your shit team.
A little too late for that, no? Time to focus on building a car that can actually finish a race.
Dear Ferrari,   YOU were a part of the original process and wanted the penalties to be light in case you missed it.  Now that you haven't you don't get to decide its not good enough.   stop being such hypocrites  sincerely a sane f1 fan
Maybe unpopular opinion: but i disagree. Red bull only overspend with 400k with new regulations (unclear what is precisely is deductable or not) --> and got a massove fine + reduced development. Because they were already at 70%.
Let's not look at our problems but point our finger at other teams! That will make Ferrari less shit...
Personally think there should have been a secret agreement, but that's just me
Says the team that deliberately broke the engine rules
They're P4 in the standings I feel like someone closer to RB should be saying this instead 😭
Honestly I get it. It's part of his job to say stuff like that and try to distract others from his team's abysmal results.
Ferrari bungles both!
Maybe Ferrari should focus on getting their car in the points instead of shit stirring in the media.
Cheating on purpose is bad. This is just a stupid mistake. It shouldn't be punished in extreme ways as Red Bull would gladly have fixed it had they known about it and they didn't try to cover it up. The stuff teams regulary did 10 years ago was full-blown cheating. That should be punished harshly.
Ehem, *burning oil*, ehem...
I found restricted aero is a weird punishment. Breaching a hard cost cap should cause a reduction of x time the amount you overspend. Otherwise you can just weigh off aero time and more money for personal and development
Wait I thought per the contract that they signed anything less than 10 mill was consider a minor infraction and not so big old deal like they are making?   I know teams are putting on a show to complain. But cmon you all agreed to these rules and the margin or error
Fred should know that he needs to step up his shit stirring game as a team principal of a top tier team, rehashing old drama that went stale 6 months ago isn't going to cut it.  He must be desperate to divert attention away from the fact that Ferrari didn't improve at all *compared to their own car 12 months ago*, never mind relative to the rest of the field.
So make it harsher when they end up being over for 2022 as well
Geezz get it over with
Focus on your own car first lmao
It's actually extremely simple to tell whether he's right: if the penalty was indeed too light, every team would be exceeding the budget cap, since it would give them an advantage. So are they?
FIA needs to shoot Max and Checo in the foot
So the narrative for excuses for lac of performance have begun  "If you've got a problem, change your fluffing Car"
That's so last season
When your ship is shit easy to distract by pointing fingers
Oh we doing this again? Do better Ferrari, mind your business
What a joke.
Your priority is to fix your damn cars first Freddie.
Doesn't ferrari still receive a heritage bonus that is significantly bigger than the other team's bonusses?   Wasn't Ferrari caught multiple times cheating?  I mean I could go on about the pot and the kettle but you get the idea.
Something, something, illegal 2019 engine secret settlement.
What a salty motherfucker. We have a saying in my language that goes like: clean the shit of your porch first then complain about the neighbors
"they're miles faster than us so it is unfair"
How about solve the reliability issues and make it not like a tractor?
Never understand why Ferrari wants him as a TP, he couldn’t even sort out Alfa lmao
We know, Fred. But all yall just went with it
*Liked by Zak Brown*
lol, people bringing up the Ferrari engine penalty like Vasseur had anything to do with that.
Until two years ago fifty to a hundred million more didn't have that much of an impact between the first three and now suddenly a couple of hundred grand aka peanuts suppose to have made a world of difference .   I don't buy it .
Coming from Ferrari?? lmfao
Gee whiz this guy really is the bees knees.
Right. 'We suck - so penalize those guys instead' Not going to help Ferrari one bit I'm afraid, Freddie.
why’s everyone so angry here 😂
Breaching the cost cap by a few dollars isn't what made Red Bull so good, its the behind the scenes R&D on the RB17 hypercar that was mostly just research on the new F1 regulations.
Change your fucking car ,Fred. Development limitations will reflect more in the latter half , though.
Well it clearly hasn’t impacted their competitiveness this year
Look, Ferrari might not be the best ones to raise this - but at this point they appear to be right. What I'm seeing if I am another team principal is that I can overspend, develop a winning car, and be punished lightly while running away with a championship the following year.   Sure we might see some teams get closer to Red Bull this year due to the wind tunnel time, but we surely aren't going to see anyone on Red Bull's level. They are just too far ahead.
shut the F up and get your car going ..dont complain for what you couldn't achieve also try to accept that some one is way faster than you but not to point the finger at them ..bloody looser
Because it was the first year of the full cap, I think the penalty was fair.  Something that was absolutely disgusting was the secret engine agreement Ferrari worked out with the FIA. This is something that has no place in sport. I understand the reason for the agreement was that the FIA obtained the information from stolen IP, but that shouldn't create a secret penalty.
The issue is, we all ask for penaltys to be applied instantly, so we know the outcome. This penalty is long term and we will never really see the effects of it, since RBR is so far in front.  I know this is controversial, but I'd prefered a penalty like a deduction of points for both drivers and team from the season the budget breach actually occured. This way the penalty would have been done with.
The punishment should be negative wind tunnel time for Ferrari to catch up with RB.
As did most of the world but this is the FIA we're talking about here. Would you honestly expect any competent decisions from them?
When you’re doing so bad that you just need to go back a year and bring up the same garbage to feel good about your shit performance.   The more I watch over the years, the media, drive to survive and everything around it, it’s just throwing stones at each other just to make yourself feel a little better or make the other team seem to be a little less good compared to yourself.   Shit throwing parties weekly..
That's because it was.  Break the cost cap, win 2x years championship (year of breach 2021, and 2022). Then have a baked in advantage basically granting 2023 too.
We all knew it would be too light. The punishment was more like a slightly uncomfortable massacre to the wrist than a light slap. The only real punishment the big teams will care about is DSQ.
Yep, proves you can just break the cap to get ahead of everyone else, and then just maintain your advantage while staying within the cap thereafter.
"This is Toto's fault somehow" - F1 Fandom rn
They should have just allowed all the other teams to overspend this year what RB overspent last year, to allow them to catch up.
I’m still amazed at how little everyone seems to care that Red bull blatantly cheated like that. I wonder how people would react if it was another team. Maybe one that started in M. Just seems like the kind of thing people would be up in arms about, but apparently not
I mean, he’s bang on  I don’t know why people are so keen to defend it
He's probably saying it because he's salty but he's not wrong. Cost cap penalties should be stiff.
He needs to worry about his own team. Enough to worry about there.
What a loser lol. Fix your fucking car.
Of course it was too light. But if the FIA levied a real punishment against them, then it would have jeopardized their favored team of the era and that’s a massive no-no. You don’t literally sacrifice the integrity of the sport by changing rules in the final lap of the 2021 season to give said team their first championship of the new era and then turn around a full year later after the violation occurs and actually risk taking away a shot at a 2nd or 3rd title. Silly stuff. The FIA is smarter than that. Some wind tunnel time it is. Then if someone breaches it this year they will hammer them blaming everyone who said that the RB punishment wasn’t severe enough.
Oh so THAT is what they were talking about.... [https://twitter.com/askolatte/status/1642434754925457408](https://twitter.com/askolatte/status/1642434754925457408)   (Toto and Fred during 3rd red flag (or maybe 2nd, not sure any more)
loser mentality shit
Agreed it. Breaching the cqp should result in having to sit out a race/races
Well, yeah? No shit.
No shit
Hence, RB is yet to win any legitimate championships in the turbo era
Or the FIA can just ban RB tech (like whatever innovation they have for their straight line speed) like they did Merc's FRIC in 2014 to try to cut them down a bit.
Such a weird comment section. Everyone seems ready to burn Vasseur over this. As if he's had much of an influence yet after 3 races. He's just doing his job as a TP. Toto does this, Christian does this. Everyone knows they're full of shit, but a good tp will fight every inch. When will people stop burning the Ferrari TP's and realize there are other more severe problems at Ferrari.
Didn't someone come out to say the rules of the agreement were along the lines of FIA knew Ferrari exceeded fuel flow, but couldn't figure out how, and without being able to prove it they wouldn't be able to police it, and then simply asked Ferrari how they did it to not get punished for it.  Apparently Ferrari found a very specific timing of the fuel flow sensor, like fractions of a second timing, where it wouldn't record. And timed their fuel flow to have more in that fraction of a second, and therefore it never reported additional fuel was being burnt. It didn't have anything Todo with burning engine oil.  Or that might all be speculation.
well they couldn't prove that one so.
It's just embarassing. Like, yeh, RB should have been punished (and were) for that overspend. However, the effect of the overspend on performance this season or last was minimal to zero.  Ferrari can't use it as an excuse, especially when they are having such a poor season.  What they are doing to Charles makes me angrier every week. It doesn't matter even whether Charles is at fault for some of the incidents now. They got into his head. They have created an issue for him that he didn't have before the start of last season.
But don't you understand that good faith mistakes in a first year where everyone agreed leniency should apply that result in a half million overspend are so much worse than deliberately exploiting a bug to have a faster engine!?!?!  Anyway supposedly they had to drive with a bit less fuel as punishment.
No need. Red Bull's was too light, no further investigation required.
Well if the situation was FIA knew RB breached budget but just don't know how, then yeah.
I was wondering when Crazy Frog was going to bring up Red Bull to deflect how shit Ferrari are….2 races it took haha….
I think McLaren's spygate penalty is a reasonable comparison. $100m fine and suspended from the constructor's championship.
Well tbf it neutered them for 2 years so whatever it was worked well. Rb on the other hand only got stronger....  I think they should've started with  15kg weight penalty and 15hp reduction in ers per million over they spent
Good pun, intended or not.
Let's all cheat, would make for awesome entertainment!
Except they'll be penalized harder because last year was the first time.  Besides the effects of the wind tunnel penalty will be known over the course of this whole season, not just after 3 races. So it's hard to judge for now how servere it will be.
Honestly I don't know what he's getting at. He was Team Principal at Alpha when he agreed and signed the budget cap, including all three grades of penalties with rough guidelines.  As a minor overspent, because that's how it's called in the regulations, the reduction in wind tunnel time was already pretty much the harshest most effective punishment and the a pretty big fine on top of that.  Edit, yes I meant Alfa Romeo not Alpha Tauri. My bad.
I’ve seriously wondered why more teams don’t attempt to cheat. I’m guessing it’s because the consequences if found out _could_ be too dire but if I were Ferrari or Merc, I’d do it
Ah, the good ol' [Bush tactic](https://youtu.be/rQ6N-sb7SVQ)
Seriously. At least Binotto had some charisma, Vasseur just seems like a curmudgeon
They sure find a new excuse to divert attention from how they're probably a few months away from losing their star driver and their entire campaign is in tatters
Laughs in Zack Brown
This is what they all do, part of the sport is trying to use the regulations and the FIA to gain an advantage - Ferrari aren’t the only ones paddock wrestling.
Literally every TP does this. Toto and Horner as well.
I was thinking about the same thing. It’s easier to be boss at Sauber. It’s more difficult to be Ferrari principal.   RB broke the rule but it doesn’t explain why Ferrari is such a shit. They were clearly second last year. Not to mention I am impressed with AM power play about being last.
Laughs in Horner cos he wrote the playbook.
Aerodynamics are for people who can't ~~build engines~~ *call for more penalties on other teams*.
If the reason for not being able to compete on track is cheating, you are entitled to make those comments, imo.
Because if they were the ones to go over they didn't want a harsh punishment that would significantly impact them.  When someone else goes over they want a harsh punishment
It’s part of the job I think
The severe penalty of not being allowed to use an illegal engine anymore with no other punishment hmmm
The weak part was that they never publicly were announced as cheating as well
Was FIA supposed to allow them to use an illegal engine mate, is this what you’re implying. They dug the whole for themselves on that. They should’ve been disqualified from 2019, probably including the drivers too. And I’m saying this as a Seb fan.
Ferrari weren't allowed to use that engine afterwards, and were horrendous in 2020, and subpar (by their standards) in 2021.  The punishment wasn't as weak as people make it out to be.
They didn't ruin it, the new floor regulations doing the season did. That was what really put Ferrari behind.  They don't have a lot of excuses for not being better this year though.
I would love to see us get a podium at this point. We're fighting for 6th-8th :(
Mercedes lobbying and the FIA ruined it.  Ferrari still did an absolute shit job to come back but the most likely thing to have happened is that they had a great car, started working on next year's car before the summer break, got absolutely fucked by the TD, and basically had development started on an outdated concept.
If RB drove on two wheels I still think Ferrari would be behind them somehow…
Last year Ferrari wasn't a championship car.  It was fast only in qualified.
Certainly X or Y
Additionally, the first year was supposed to be more lenient and good faith mattered. If a team does a deliberate 5m overspend in this year, I expect the FIA to go on a murder spree.
You forgot to define X and Y 😂
There's a budget cap now so they can't be overfunded unless they breach it
So when they asked him the question about the budget cap vasseur shouldn’t have replied, noted
not even that, but just let it go. It happened, rb got punished, they all had their say about the penalty at the time. Now let it go
Or behind him. Dude's not gonna last 2 seasons.
He is providing cover for his next role on another team. They’re going to lose Charles and have no need for Fred.
Love me some ferrari drama
Dude is not salty. I didn't get that vibe from the article. He literally complemented them and said he doesn't see it as an excuse. It's just an opinion:
The Guardian are about the furthest you can get from a tabloid I believe
Exactly this, the hypocrisy of Ferrari shows once again. They had an illegal PU for 1 or 2 years and thanks to their special position within the F1 they were allowed to keep their transgressions a secret and make a secret agreement with the FIA.  I think Ferrari's punishment was way too light, because nothing became public which allowed them to avoid public scrutiny, something that Red Bull did have to deal with.
I don't know about catching up tbh. It's a large gap, they might get closer sure. But the gap seems immense, especially for Ferrari. They won't be close anytime soon as Merc and AM are vastly superior to the red circus.
From 70 to 63%. The amount of wind tunnel / CFD time is already scaled by finishing positioning, they then got an extra 10% deducted from the scaled figure
Horner is literally the master of fighting off track.
[removed]
The irony being Horner is usually first to point fingers and stir shit up.
Facts.
This.  The actual overspend was $400K and the rest was a tax deduction they should have made but didn’t.
Be a mL short on petrol after the race, the car is disqualified. Have your DRS wing 50 nanometers too wide, the car is disqualified. I don’t really care if it’s just a little over. The rules are pretty cut and dry all over the place.
Toto/Merc saying this would be so unoriginal though🫠 where’s fun in that?
If someone closer said it, they'd be accused of trying to gain an advantage over a direct rival in the championship.
A team full of cowards and excuses, enzo would roll in his grave
how do you know RBR didn’t cheat on purpose? bc they said so?
They did get fined in addition to aero penalties, if I recall correctly  the actual overspend was to the tune of $250k ($2 million if you want to be pedantic, but as the FIA report outlined, the vast majority of that was essentially a procedural error) and they received a fine for $7 million, a hefty multiple of the overspend regardless.
Also if the penalty was too light, then the whole aero sliding scale rules are pointless as they won't make a difference
"What we lost in foot function we gained in weightloss" - Horner.
Daniel Ricciardo race win incoming. He would probably help them with the shooting.
Might only help for a race or two, maybe consider cutting off their big toes?
I mean I'm far more concerned about teams "outsourcing" staff and stuff as a method to bypass the budget cap then about a miscalculated tax procedure and some catering
[removed]
Because it is management 101: blame others for your own incompetence. And we all hate that
Because people are more focused on attacking the messager than his argument.
The sanctions and penalties available were agreed to by all the teams so Fred can’t really complain about it now retrospectively
Teams had the chance to have that written in the code but they all preferred the distinction between minor and mayor breach and some leniency the first full season under cost cap. Plus RBR was found to make a legitimate error and they didn’t intentionally overspent. That was taken in consideration when handing out punishment.
Points deductions are a pretty bad penalty, since their impact is entirely reliant on a team's position in the standings. If that were the penalty, a team with a big gap behind it could ignore the budget cap an not get amy penalty.
The implications of these sorts of comment are honestly hilarious. So not only did $250k win them 2021, it also won them 2022 and 2023 ... and I'm sure if other teams don't step up, there's going to be the same argument made in 2024 and 2025 as well.  How do you square this with the fact that RB started out as clear 2nd best in 2022 and only took a clear lead in 2nd half of the season? The overspend happened in 2021, so unless they also overspent in 2022 then surely that can't be the reason for their current dominance?  I'm also curious about your thoughts about what this means for the "authenticity" of not just Hamilton's titles in the 2014-2021 era, but historically?  After all, one time expense of $250k is *supposedly* what makes all the difference and Mercedes have (on average) spent dozens of millions more than their closest rivals during that era. The obvious implications of your comment would severely devalue Hamilton's position as one of the GOATs if your position is that anyone could win, given an extra $250k.  *Replace $250k with $2M if you'd like to be pedantic about what was by FIA's own admission, a procedural error. The argument is essentially the same given the gaps in spending before the budget cap*
When you haven't played the victim for 5 seconds
You’re the one dragging him in mate. Bit of a victim complex
insert *"but it actually is"*
What Mercedes did with gaming the engine limit rules in '21 is pretty analogous to the RB budget cap issue. Both broke the rules, both were punished according to the rules, except i would argue that using Bottas as a test mule to determine exactly how far they could turn up their engine had a larger impact on their on-track pace than a $400k/1.8m overspend  Would you call that blatantly cheating? It is the team that starts with an M, after all  That's not to even mention the illegal tire test that directly preceded their run of 8 constructors championships, the penalty for which was missing one year of young driver tests lol
Ferrari literally cheated with their engine in 2019.
>I mean, he’s bang on  why is he bang on?  RB got a penalty that imo reflects the breach. Even for a "minor breach" the brach was still not big, so seems like a fair penalty to me, as it is definitely not worth it.
His current team were spending 500 mil a season, like 40% more then second biggest spender and had nothing to show for it still.
Reminder, Lauda wanted nothing to do with his awful old team
> Cost cap penalties should be stiff.  They should be if a team is sneakily moving money around to circumvent the cost cap. If a team was using other programs not under the cost cap to work on F1 stuff that should result in harsh penalties.  In this case there were misinterpretations, leading to a very minor overspend. No willful overspend, fraud, or attempt to conceal what they were doing.
Ferrari can’t really talk about light punishments. 😂
Too light and literally all the TPs signed off on it lol. What a smooth brain take.
Lol. What about the fuel flow or illegal engine ban ? The RB punishment fits the crime, which is a minor overspend with no bad intentions.
Holy shit the amount of copium here.
Preach. You want a tinfoil hat too? Only 5$!
So you want to ban physics, competent management,  reliable strategy and talented drivers?
Last time they brought in a solution that was supposed to nerf RB, Max went on to laugh his way to the title.
That's the neat thing about the RB19, it doesn't rely on cheap tricks, it is just fundamentally better than all other cars lol.
They don't have anything like it, it's just fundamentally a good car.
If he really is 100% right, and if he truly believes what he's saying is true, then wouldn't it almost be gross malfeasance for him and Ferrari to *not* breach the cost cap also?  I mean, if he *really* thinks a $400k overspend (or hell, go on up to the like $1.5 million it was without the tax credit removed) is enough to gain the pace advantage RB has, and that the wind tunnel time reduction is such a light punishment, then as a competent TP shouldn't he do the same?
Let’s compare it to the penalty Ferrari got for their engine!  Oh wait
RB suspected what they were doing, made a device of their own, ask FIA if that was legal, and FIA issued TDs saying it wasn't. And Ferrari's performance suddenly dropped .   Connect the dots
We actually know exactly what they did and how they did it because Red Bull engineered a device and presented it to the FIA which caused the FIA to ban the device and Ferrari suddenly losing engine power.
>Apparently Ferrari found a very specific timing of the fuel flow sensor, like fractions of a second timing, where it wouldn't record.   Which is fucking genius from an engineering perspective.  #Nyquist theorem GONE WRONG [GONE SEXUAL]
Somewhat off-topic, but I always thought the idea of metering fuel flow to be somewhat poor. There’s already a built-in flow limit (130-145L fuel per race distance), so let teams figure out how to most effectively deploy the fuel they have. If F1 is concerned that teams are using the fuel they have inefficiently, then drop the total fuel load and make those deployment decisions harder.
I think you’re right but I have trouble coming to terms with the fact that Ferrari are that clever
It wasn't fuel, they were dumping oil into the fuel, which made it burn at a higher temp and give them more power. Total amount of fuel used is measured by the FIA, oil is/was not.
I thought this was all speculation and it turned out that Ferrari was burning engine coolant (not oil)?
I'm still not clear how beating the test can be penalized. It happens all the time with the flex tests.
We have no idea what the agreement was. Maybe they’re still suffering the penalty of that decision today. I think they did say Ferrari would help the fia police auch loop holes since whatever they did was so ingenious, even with red Bull showing them they still couldn’t prove Ferrari had the same device.
The thing is we don't know the effect of the punishment. Without it they might have been even faster.
What's embarassing? Ferrari was punished with the two worst years for the team in the last 4 decades lol. Seems harsh enough to me
How was overspending impact on recent sessions minimal to zero? I don't remember how much they over spent, and don't remember the details, but all the overspent budget went towards upgrading the car. Even if they claim they spent it on pizza, or whatever, that's the money they didn't have to spent on the pizza from their actual budget, so that money went on upgrading the cars.  And the 2023 cars are obvious development from previous cars, so the overspent budget has affect on current standings as well.
It's hard for us to say how harsh the punishment for RB was because the average joe can't figure out how much development you'd get from the overspend.   The only oversight I think they had in the cost cap rules was that at a minimum, if you had a 2 million overspend this year, you should have 2 million less the next year. Currently, you can overspend this year and have the maximum allowed budget next year too. Personally, I think overspend should reduce your budget for the next year by a multiple of the overspend.
How can you say it has little effect? The other teams dropped the ball. What if they could possibly have been way faster
"A bit less' *Ferrari finishing 6th*
in all fairness Ferrari's cheat was pretty clever - and much more interesting than just going over budget
You know they had a practice year for the budget cap before it went live, right? There’s no excuse that last year was the first year.
Are you really comparing winning a few races in 2019 and winning the 2021 championship by a very thin margin (Masi’s intervention aside) ALSO because you went over the budget cap?
there's a rather huge difference between a minor less than 1% overspend and stealing data from a competitor.
that's not even a possibility in the freaking rules....are you guys on crack?
Like cycling in the years of Lance Armstrong
PRIDE RULES
THEY CANT BAN US ALL!
This is the way.  With the rules drama the way it is every weekend what’s a little more going to do? More entertainment
Are you new here? Sneaking around rules is part of the sport.
I don't think we will know how penalty affected them. Like, if a gap stays the same then how will "penalty was too small" and "RB did a great job" be distinguished?
Has a team as dominant as RB ever taken a penalty like this and been overtaken by other teams throughout the season?
> Except they'll be penalized harder because last year was the first time.  It wasn't. It was the first year it was policed, but they ran under the budget cap the year before, and had ample time to ask questions and figure out how it worked, so oopsie is not an excuse.
Yeah it’s like in a track race, the first false start isn’t penalized but the second is a disqualification, even if they didn’t cause the first one.  Red Bull being the first to break the rule means they got a more lenient penalty than anyone else would get moving forward.
It was also on the very lowest end of a minor overspend. Minor is up to 5% or something and Red Bull was penalised for a 0.3% overspend. If a team goes up to a 2% overspend or something, the penalty will probably be more severe, at least with much more windtunnel time reduction.   I think the 10% was good for the 0.3% overspend. It's more than significant enough to push other teams to avoid the overspend and especially to ensure they don't overspend much more.
Fred was never TP at Alpha.
Binomio charismatic? Man he was so tight, like for what reason he never speaks english i know its for looks or something or a power play because he understands and can probably speak english, for me it was just weird
After failing on both he's trying to compete on the ring.
Has he apologized to Redbull?
It's called TD39 (and it's subsequent integration in the full regs for this year). Like, it's very very simple.  The Ferrari concept worked with how the cars were set up before TD39. Clearly they had already decided to keep the concept for this year before TD39 was official and/or they thought they could make up the gap. Also clearly, they couldn't and they probably maximized this concept.  Oh well, god forbid we have somewhat different looking cars in F1 that are competitive right?
Meanwhile AM broke almost all of the same financial guidelines that RBR did, and they showed *far* more improvement this year than RBR.
But that's clearly not the case, so he's not.
So Red Bull breaching the cost cap is the reason that Ferrari implodes on pretty much any strategical decision durin a race and also got overtaken in the development race by both Aston Martin and Mercedes?
That would be acceptable if they had the 2nd fastest car still. They are at best 4th fastest (while getting hustled by Gasly's Alpine all race long), and still crying as if they're competing against RB for the best car. They aren't, not anymore.  Even podiums for Ferrari come at a premium this season. All the while Aston made the jump from 7th fastest car to 2nd fastest.   At what point do these teams stop blaming RB for their own incompetence in terms of building a car?
As if that 400k in 2021 is the train for the performance gap between RB and the rest of the field today. Ferrari and Mercedes dropped the ball.
I now want the Donald to become a TP cause that would be hilarious.
They were "lucky" their car turned into a shitbox, so people didn't go guns blazing on that bullshit.
That's what /u/Madforce2k2 is saying. Ferrari is being hypocrites by saying the penalty Red Bull got was too light, while getting away of cheating for a full season, getting caught, and not getting a penalty at all.
There was no punishment, being told to stop breaking the rules is not a punishment. If they were slow in 2020 it was because they couldn’t build a good legal engine.
Lol what. “You can’t use that illegal engine anymore!”  “Not a weak penalty”  Right
It wasn't a punishment.   Their only punishment was being told to stop using an illegal engine.
I mean, I would not call not being able to use an illegal engine a penalty. It's like saying is you use DRS for the entire race while not being in DRS range and winning and then not being able to use that for the next race but keeping the race win
Wow, what a punishment. Let Ferrari get away with using an illegal engine and their ONLY punishment is that they can't cheat anymore. That just means they were shit during all that time and their illegal engine covered the cracks.
Not allowing Ferrari to use an illegal engine isn't a punishment at all. That's just enforcing established rules. Ferrari just completely shat the bed at that time.
probably also the reliability plays a role in their current situation. How many Ferrari engine running teams had to replace something? It wouldn't surprise me that the have once again reduced the power due to the reliability worries.
They do because this year's car was designed with that floor in mind.
The new floor regulations because they were porpoising like crazy. They should have found a solution like other teams...
In Bahrain Charles was going for a likely podium. In Jeddah they both had to catch up due to bad luck with the SC. In Australia, Sainz had the pace to compete for top 3 but got shafted by the red flag negating his strategy completely and again turned it into a recovery race.  Chill, they are fighting for podiums, #2 WCC is still within reach. They’ve had extremely bad luck these first races.
Its almost like Ferrari and Mercedes swapped places
I just want to see a Ferrari cross the finish line
Only after the second half. They saw the tournament was too far already and didn't upgraded the car as much as they could. We need to also keep in mind all the internal problems and power disputes happening there.
I disagree! Without reliability problems they would fight for title. Fight not win! It's hard to fight Max...
yeah because it totally didn't dominate in Australia and it totally wasn't as fast or faster than the RB on certain other tracks at the start
But it WASN'T the first year.
X = 6  Trust me, I'm a Williams engineer.
Haha that's hilarious haha
The budget cap has nothing to do with Ferrari's income streams, hence my comment.
I wouldn’t be surprised if he doesn’t even last this season, to be honest…
Wonder if we’re heading back to the good old days of the early 1990’s?
>punished more harshly,  it wasn't punished at all  \+ catering wasn't nonsense. RB didn't include it so they didn't do a detailed calculation between F1-RB and non F1-RB staff. So because there was no detailed information they had to include everything, even though some (catering from RBPT and non F1 stuff) could have been excluded.  Seems like you are the one parroting nonsense
https://the-race.com/formula-1/food-parts-and-sick-pay-key-areas-of-fia-red-bull-dispute/
Ain't reading all that. Ferrari got away with fucking around the engines in a "secret settlement with fia"  Who does that lmao
Dude, you have a red bull sized chip on your shoulder. To type all this out in a buried comment lol
> Yikes, your comment is full of bias, bad comparisons and misinformation.  Yikes, your comment is full of bias as well.
Have your forgotten about Toto and Otmar?
The thing I respect about Horner is that unlike many other team principles who say stuff (*cough* Toto), Horner owns being a shit-stirrer off the track. He doesn't try to pretend like it's backed up by some principles or that he is holier-than-thou. He stirs shit and he knows exactly what he's doing.
and on it.
I mean, he used to be a pretty decent driver back in the day too.
Given Red Bull's success on track he's a pretty good master on it too.
Except they didn’t cheat and weren’t found to have cheated
How many more salty comments are you going to leave about Horner , did the man hurt you
At least he does that AND manage his team at highest level. Maybe latter should be achieved first by whoever is Ferrari TP at the moment, then feel free to shit on others lol.
And Aston is too much happy right now to complain
You don't hand over all the evidence of the cheating as you are cheating.
Actually, the FIA said so as well
Connor Moore right now  WRITE THAT DOWN, WRITE THAT DOWN!
Cyborg Verstappen just won the 2123 WDC!
Which they got to keep in 2020, don't act like it was banned instantly.
Fred can't but last time I checked I wasn't Fred, so I can actually complain about it. :3
If I overspent I can put more resources into the current car, or the future car, or both. Having a blanket points deduction for the season the overspending occured would be a consistent penalty. A penalty with a 2 - 3 year delay that the average fan will not fully understand seems absolutely ridiculous.  The way it currently looks is that RBR is miles ahead and found a gold mine with their car concept. The impact of less development time is far less than it would be if the field was closer to RBR. But it isn't.
But Ferrari is not the sole competitor impacted by the benefits RB got in being able to breach the cap virtually scott free. So to focus on the messenger alone is myopic.
Minor breach after they supposedly fiddled with the figures
What was the cost cap in those days?
If there's one interpretation that should be completely irrelevant in this case, it's the interpretation of intent, and I'm disappointed that people are falling for the trap of assigning whether it was "willful" or not, on a sport where everyone is a politician. Not a single second should be spent trying to figure out if it was intentional or not… if they breached the cap, it should be punished to the fullest extent.
This is true. But karma is punishing them every single subsequent year since their last scandal.
I highly doubt /u/2wenty-3hree ever got the opportunity to vote on what the punishment should be, so I'm not sure what you're on about him voicing his take on it.
Let’s be honest. If this minor overspend was done by anyone else the community would be up in arms.
I have plenty lol I love the downvotes on my post lol 😂 got ‘em
No just the aero device that stalls the rear wing. Perhaps a bit of flooring.
FIA forced them to turn it down to a level that was way below the competition. I think most people being critical of the perceived light penalty would have been happy if the same punishment was handed out to Red Bull.
Pretty smart by RB too
It’s amazing how smart these guys are. Not only did the Ferrari engineers figure it out to “cheat” in the first place, but the Red Bull engineers managed to figure out what they were doing and rebuild it sight unseen.
When did that happen? Ferrari was still fast in Singapore, 6 races before the end of the season. And they were fast in Brazil, until they crashed into each other.   The drop in performance happened between 19 and 20.
It wasn’t even the FIA banning it, they just clarified that under the rules already in place, such a trick would be illegal. So Ferrari immediately lost pace
I still have to see the evidence of that massive drop in power. They got 2 front rows in Austin and Brazil, and were still the fastest in sector 2 in Abu Dhabi, where they lost 1 second in sector 3 know to be very power dominant right?
Just double the sampling time, ez fix.
It's genius to the point of nearly being unbelievable.  Syncing and aliasing a mechanical fluid system to out-do the 2.2 kHz flow meter's sample rate is just so out there. In a controlled lab, difficult but maybe believable, out on track with thousands of other variables in play, constantly keeping it perfectly in phase? That's damn near magic.  F1 engineers are obviously some of the best in the world, but I've always found it hard to believe Ferrari did it messing with the flow itself instead of the signaling.
Agreed. They already check the fuel at the end of the race. Why police the fuel flow
Ferrari have good engineers, they're just organisationally very poor.
The current punishment will definitely have a significant effect on RB’s development. It is however unlikely to be significant enough for Ferrari to out-develop RB.  The overspend they were punished for likely had a negligible impact on their development though.
>Ferrari was punished with the two worst years for the team in the last 4 decades lo  that wasn't a punishement for whatever they did with the engine
it was 400k, and the FIA determined it was an accidental overspend without intention of cheating the system. In the grand scheme of things with a budget of 145 million it is very marginal regarding what impact it could have on the 2021 or 2022 season.  Regardless of that the FIA did give red bull a penalty of 10% less CFD and windtunnel time which was already the lowest because of their constructors position. AND a 7 million penalty which does not come out of the cost cap.  Whatever one might think seeing the advantage Red Bull currently enjoys, the punishment suits the crime.
Without comparing all the teams budgets, you can’t know if they spent more on development or catering. That said, it doesn’t really matter, as *any* money spent ultimately goes towards getting the best performance, whether it’s from the car or the team.   This article does give some insights to the type of disagreements about what is part of the budget cap: https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/how-catering-costs-contributed-to-red-bulls-f1-budget-cap-overspend/10392037/amp/    However, the total overspend seems to be around 0.5-1% of the total budget cap. Question is: how much performance can you gain by spending 0,5-1% more?
It was $400k in the end, enough to cover the cost of a *single* front wing + nose cone. That surely is why they are dominating now...   Come on man, wake up and step out of the bullshit narrative already.
The logic makes no sense. The issue is from them actually just spending more than other teams on catering because they decided to provide it for all staff.
No no. We don’t use logic here
Im not saying the penalty has no effect.
If they were doing clever shit but by following the rules, they could’ve been more successful. Being clever at finding ways to cheat isn’t actually being clever, it’s cheating.
If that was true, the FIA would have called it deliberate.   So what's Ferrari's excuse for cheating the fuel flow rules? Practice?
>Are you really comparing winning a few races in 2019 and winning the 2021 championship by a very thin margin  that doesn't make any sense. If Ferrari had won the WDC in 2019 would you also say that they only won a few races?   And how do you know that the overspend went towards the 2021 car and not the 2022, so you can't say that they won in 2021 because of the overspend.  And we know that some of overspend went towards catering for non F1 people and RBPT people.
Obviously not... you're taking it way too seriously
Yeah they for sure ended after Lance was caught for sure .... /s
The whole top 20 was juicing, Lance was just better of the juicers than the rest. Did the race organizers pay back all the money they were raking in during the years? Did they return their yahts?
This sounds interesting. Can I get a context/story?
In the years of Armstrong?
It feels bad to say, but stuff like this does add to the entertainment whether people want to admit it or not.
>how will "penalty was too small" and "RB did a great job" be distinguished?  exactly, we would basically need a alternative reality where they didn't get a penalty to compare it.  But you can't the penalty wasn't harsh enough because they are doing well, it doesn't work like that
It was decided in October when most (at least the major part) of the windtunnel work on the current year car was probably already done.  And it's 10% less over a year, so towards the end of the season they're most likely going to start noticing it.
It also wasn't intentional overspend by RB. It was a combination of interpreting rules differently and some unexpected tax things, iirc. I know I'm biased by I think the penalty was pretty harsh given all that.  And anyway, just a couple of years ago Ferrari cheated with their engines and got no penalty at all, so it's a bit rich for Ferrari to complain about it.
Being able to spend 5% on performance alone is a huuuuge advantage though.
Let's not be that dense, he clearly meant Alfa Romeo
🙄
And will fail miserably... again
Thank Mercedes for being historically good whiners. So much for a "tradition of racing" when they spent their first 10 or so years being flag flying full fledged Nazis, then they killed a bunch of innocent French people 10 years after they were supposed to stop, quit racing for half a century, and then came back with defective aircraft before deciding to just stick to engines. If only they had stuck to engines...
The power and reach that RB has is just insane. All the teams are in their pocket. Clearly, they must be nerfed. /s
The point very clearly isn't about Ferrari imploding, that's not really relevant with the current gap. The gap is the topic here
It’s like they hit a wall in a development and are like: “now what?”
I'd wager good money it was more than just one season.
FIA couldn't prove that Ferrari doing anything illegal, and they were still punished for it.   I'm not on Ferrari's side or trying to say that they were innocent, but they didn't get away with a slap on the wrist. They lost two entire seasons to the engine fisaco
Ferrari did not have a big porposing problem though. The drivers were saying it was fine and they even tried to combat the regulations.
Charles had the same amount of mechanical DNF's as Max though, so the reliability wasn't even the issue.
Dominant in a race makes you a championship car?  RB was dominant in a season not just a race.
Then what year it was?
They could have 100 billions and still be limited by the cap so what's your point
Supposedly they had to run less fuel and so did their customer teams as punishment. But it's all secret so we don't know.
Writing “Ain’t reading all that” and finishing with “lmao” doesn’t make you look cool, this isn’t Twitter.  Furthermore, the comment is actually a very balanced look at the facts that goes past the usual “urr durr Ferrari/RB are cheaters”
Wow, sounds like a real piece of shit.
not hard to “fight” with the fastest car by a mile
Was he tho?  https://twitter.com/PaddockMemes/status/1618611015771381763?t=FndVjupuOCFfiEem9NKJgA&s=19
He really wasn't, even with all the help his Daddys money gave him.
He is salty spice tho 😜
Aston keeping quiet because the fact the overspend by 40 million last year is yet to be revealed ^/jk
>after they supposedly fiddled with the figures  so we now punish people based on rumors and not facts? I mean, you see how ridiculous you sound? Or do you have a credible source for that because it just seems like you hate RB and are now making stuff up.
It’s funny how absolutely upset people get. Especially when it’s not Pro RedBull. The funny thing is. Even though what I said was somewhat tongue in cheek, it’s not all that far fetched if you really know the inner workings of the FIA and the business end of things. It’s not like they haven’t made decisions based on outcomes before. Everyone swears their decisions are always based on an equal and fair balance.
Be careful what you wish for. We might get TD39 2 - Electric  Bullaloo.
You got a source for that?  Because data suggests they weren’t down on power that much in 2020, but build a brick of a car, because it was planned with their illegal engine surplus in mind.  [And I do have a source for that](https://the-race.com/formula-1/how-ferraris-2020-design-has-caused-a-perfect-storm/)  They also lost almost all straight line speed in 2019 already after the TD clarified tricking the fuel flow sensor would be illegal. So that’s before any deal was even made
RB presented 3 different methods that Ferrari could be tripping the fuel flow rate sensor. They came in with the intention to mess with Ferrari for sure
More likely is RB was trying to find a similar performance gain, did Ferraris trick, found out it didn't work as well for them and then brought it to the FIA.
They worked it out before the 2020 season.
This is why it gets me so much when RB is accused of ‘cheating’ with the budget cap thing. Like yes they went over due to differences of interpretation of the rules (some of which, like the sick pay, are absolutely ridiculous in my opinion, but I digress)…. NOWHERE did they act in bad faith or ‘intend to deceive’ (as confirmed by FIA) which is what cheating requires, by definition.   Unlike teams like Ferrari (and I’m sure some others) who SPECIFICALLY design things intended to covertly circumvent the rules.
[This should help](https://youtu.be/nNCQ_MDeVFE).  *Misunderstood the comment I replied too lol
Holy shit, it's 2.2kHz we're talking about? Good point then.
chain bear made a video about this a while ago, if you had unlimited fuel flow there would be a lot more lifting and coasting
Yeah let's not forget they made the fastest car last year before TD39... And obviously the concept is still heavily harmed by the changes that happened to the actual regulations after TD39.  It's funny how Toto and Merc complain there's no competition and RB is too far ahead when they are responsible for pushing the TD that essentially killed competition by Ferrari... then again, it wasn't them fighting for wins and WDC so it may as well not matter to them lol "if i can't have it, no one else can!"
Ferrari couldn't even out-develop AM.
It was though. We don't know if it was intended to be like that or if it was just a byproduct of having a very underpowered engine and having already designed the 2020 (and 2021 by consequence) car with the super engine in mind, but it essentially was the punishment regardless.
Didn't the FIA also say RB wouldn't have overspent if they properly applied for a tax credit they were eligible for? I can't remember the specifics.
It was £1.8M / $2.2M per the ABA.
It was £2m not 400k. (https://www.cbc.ca/sports/formula-1-budget-cap-red-bull-fine-1.6632815)  A front wing? Costs £200,000.   When it comes down to tenths of seconds, even a better front wing can make or break performance. They absolutely had an unfair advantage which was held up with the FIA investigation.
The tax credit was not applied for and HMRC may not have accepted it even it it was. The potential value of that credit cannot be deducted from the overspend because the tax authority did not approve it.  That the FIA even mentioned it in the ABA (although it still states the breach as £1.8M or 1.6%) was to minimise it and make the punishment seem fitting when it was not.
>as any money spent ultimately goes towards getting the best performance, whether it’s from the car or the team.  that really isn't true, if you are looking at some of the reasons why RB went over. Especially with the catering where they had to include catering costs from people that weren't involved with F1 stuff, according to Horner.  For the penalty, it obviously doesn't matter. But saying that if you overspend by x that 100% of x will go towards the car is a bit wrong, because of what I said and the fact that they could have cut down costs in various ways and not only car development  [no detailed accounting of what catering costs applied to F1 and non-F1 staff, the cost cap administration therefore counted all such costs.](https://the-race.com/formula-1/food-parts-and-sick-pay-key-areas-of-fia-red-bull-dispute/)
That's.... Terrible reasoning.......
ABA states it was £1.8M. The Tax credit bit is just nonsense. HMRC never approved it because RB did not apply for it so we don't know if it is valid to use to modify the budget.
Even if it was $400k, which is not, as the FIA documents clearly say it was 1.8m, 400k is enough money to hire 2 to 4 aerodynamics engineers for a year. Or 40 engineers for a month.   Are you trying to tell me that 40 aerodynamics engineers working on a car for a month wouldn't have any impact on the performance?
Including non-team staff but they couldn't prove the split ratio so the entire catering bill was charged to the budget. I recall it being 1.4m with 400k over the cap ignoring the tax credit snafu, so if they had had two different canteens, only the tax credit would have been over the cap.
>	If that was true, the FIA would have called it deliberate.  It **is** true - are you trying to argue that they didn’t have a practice year? Something that’s an indisputable fact..? Weird.    >	So what’s Ferrari’s excuse for cheating the fuel flow rules? Practice  Why are you bringing whataboutism into the mix? Literally has fuck all to do with what I said.
I mean doping is still around and riders get caught every year but to assume its on the level it was in the 90's and 2000's is a bit absurd.
Did Armstrong pay back al the money he made while doping? I don't think so.  The fact that he was doping can easily be forgiven by fans, they have done so for numerous other riders. The fact that he was behaving like a sort of mob boss in cycling is however inexcusable.
Its not that hard to look it up. But summery, Armstrong won a lot, got caught cheating but almost everyone in that field did the same. He just had the best stuff.
Lance Armstrong went on to win a record breaking 7 Tour de France yellow jerseys (most is 5 and they all happened some way back). Later on he admitted to doping on Oprah and got stripped of all his wins.
That's not what I'm asking, though. What I'm asking is, given that the RB19 has absolutely demolished the rest of the field, will this wind tunnel penalty actually have any meaningful effect on their dominance?
Can't be that huge, or the teams that were spending an extra 200% on performance alone for the decade prior would have been lapping 3x faster than the midfield.  5% is certainly at the point where it's *significant* (even if still ostensibly "minor"), but keep in mind that we're talking about single digit millions in a sport where a gap of triple digit millions was common-place until just a year prior. I'd like to see any breach punished pretty heavily going forwards now that some of the early instalment weirdness is sorted out, but that doesn't mean we need to overstate the effect that those breaches actually have.  It's just like speeding in the pit lane. We don't need to pretend that going 0.1km/h over the limit during the race gains you 5 seconds, it clearly doesn't. We can still give a 5 second penalty for it anyway.
The Totonator would destroy him
I respect having the balls to issue a challenge to someone who can *clearly* kick the shit out of you though.
This is idiotic nonsense that has nothing to do with the subject. Be better.
Jesus Christ
> and they were still punished for it.  Again, they were not punished. They were told to stop using an illegal engine.   They fucked themselves by using and developing it in the first place.
Were we watching the same sport last year?
Strategy and inchidents played a big role
After the TD was introduced in spa. Before then Ferrari was faster in Bahrain, Australia, Spain, Monaco, Canada and Austria. They were about equal to RB at Jeddah, Azerbaijan, Britain, Hungary (on correct tires) and France. That's 11 out of 13 races where Ferrari should have won or had a chance to fight for a win. They fucked up all but 3 of them.
>RB was dominant in a season not just a race.  no RB was dominant until SPA, before Hungary Ferrari was competetive or even better than RB.  So yeah before Spa, Ferrari had championship car
My point is they've been overfunded for decades and could have attracted the best staff and built the best infrastructure in F1 and therefore perhaps have had better chances at championships. That they haven't is embarrassing. Again, hence my original comment. Really isn't hard to understand.
After the fact and without scraping the past results from the books
Just because someone fluffs up their comment with formatting and a couple sources does not mean that it is a “very balanced look at the facts”. If you actually read it, it’s clear that it is reeking with bias as well (just merely masquerading as “factual”).  [Here](https://racingnews365.com/red-bulls-budget-cap-breach-the-full-timeline/amp) is a link that goes into minute details with all that happened with the Red Bull cost cap breach. Relevant excerpts:  > However, the FIA found that certain errors were incurred due to differing interpretations of the regulations. Crucially, it found the team "had not acted in bad faith or in a dishonest or fraudulent manner, nor wilfully concealed information from the Cost Cap Administration or gained or sought to gain any advantage from inaccurate exclusions or adjustments of certain costs." >  > After adjustments for interpretations Red Bull incurred an overspend of $400,000, or 0.37% of the cap.  Now tell me, would a 0.37% breach of the cost cap (less than 1%) really have aided Red Bull enough to build the car that they did in 2022? Important note: reread the quote I included from the FIA itself which stated that *Red Bull did not act in a fraudulent manner or sought to gain any advantage*.  It’s a gross misrepresentation to pass off what Ferrari did with their illegal engines as being less worse than what Red Bull overspent by. There’s a reason he conveniently didn’t include the timeline/details of Red Bull’s overspend like he did for Ferrari.
Still ain't reading all that nonsense.
At least he does not pretend not to be like other TPs. You almost can't be a non piece of shit in politics.
>real piece of shit.  just like Toto, who has even admitted to being friends with a criminal
They won 2021 and seasons before Hybrid era. Horner is a great principal no matter if you like it or not.
Those who can't play, coach.
Shows what you know, Horner probably fought harder than almost anyone to get and keep his seats, all the while managing a racing team as well, on a borderline shoestring budget.
Op seems to believe in supposition and whataboutery more that facts, don't waste time arguing
[removed]
We already saw it from 2014 to 2016 with Mercedes. No matter how much the FIA tried to hamper them they were still undisputed kings.  Mid era regulation tweaks to end dominance are hard to pull off.
thanks for linking the article, good read! in the comments Mark Hughes also confirms my point, saying Mercedes was 15hp off the pack with the other top teams closely matched, and Ferrari is 20hp behind the pack (so 35hp off Mercedes). so their engine was cut down from one that was the best (and illegal) in the field to way below what even midfield teams averaged. the aero configurations made things even worse.
 >More likely is RB was trying to find a similar performance gain  RB was the first team to try this, in the first ever race of the Turbo hybrid era, and they got penalised for it. Australia 2014.
This is the correct answer, I think. If it wasn’t illegal at the time and RB figured out how to do it, they’d also definitely use it if it gave them an advantage
No. This is how teams need to operate if they suspect another team is bending the rules or cheating on a technical matter.  It's complicated, but they can't 'file charges' so they have to force the FIA to make a decision on a specific interpretation of a rule.
What Red Bull did was possit several possible ideas (three in this case, I think) of what Ferrari may have been doing, took them to the FIA to ask for "clarification."  It was expressly to peg back Ferrari.  It happens a lot in this sport.
Spirit of the rules.  Both fall under the same category. Both should have had penalties imposed. Ferrari were able to pull a "so prove it" card which got them off. The actual breaking of the rule doesn't matter, what matters is if FIA can prove it. If FIA imposed a penalty on Ferrari without being able to prove it, Ferrari sues. And wins. Because FIA cannot prove it.  This is the one time I will defend the FIA. Their hands were tied. They could not prove anything, but they could gain an understanding of how to police it in the future. It's the best of a bad situation for them.
Exactly, it's more similar to using to many engines ( Wich is also against the rules) then it is to cheating.
RedBull went over overall budget, so their excuse of sick pay and catering is bullshit. I agree that what Ferrari did was worse, but let's not try to sugarcoat RedBull.   If your monthly budget is 1000€ and you spend 950 of it on blackjack and hookers, you cant say that you went over budget just because you also bought 100€ of groceries. It sounds better, sure, but the problem is somewhere else.
This shows they had great engine, it doesn't show their alleged drop in performance from Mexico going forward, when the sensor was introduced. This also doesn't take in account of different setups, look at Leclerc and Hamilton wing in 2019, Ferrari was almost on Monza spec while Mercedes had a standard one.
That video is about how good the 2019 engine was before the drop. u/Captain_Omage is asking for evidence of the drop in peformance after the TD.
Along with cars going drastically different speeds, to the point there would likely be safety concerns.
Faster, and arguably the most beautiful vehicle to ever race on track. That's some damm good engineering. Too bad their strategy department robbed us of what could have been a repeat of max vs Hamilton 2021
Toto was embarrassing in that instance…
Mika Salo, who has been a steward for a while now and knows a thing or two, claims that the FIA hit the 2020 Ferrari engine with a capped fuel flow at peak RPMs, essentially meaning it had a hard power limiter and was intentionally made to be ass as punishment. He says Kimi knew because he wouldn't shift up into 8th occasionally and just leave the car in 7th gear because there was no difference in performance.
I've seen LegendRazgriz comment but taking yours at face value, how would that be a punishment if they were breaking the rules and made to follow the rules?
I think it was still 400k with the tax credit properly added, but i'm not entirely sure about that. previously the paddock was talking about several million of overspend and that was without the tax credit applied.  EDIT:I looked it up. There was a change in june about a change in status about the spending. And R[ed Bull claimed that if they were able to resubmit, they would be able to reduce it with an additional 1.2 million](https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/how-catering-costs-contributed-to-red-bulls-f1-budget-cap-overspend/10392037/). So yea...
They still would by something like 0.5% or whatever
>When it comes down to tenths of seconds, even a better front wing can make or break performance.  200k for the production or for the development and production?  And in 2022 even if they had been a tenth slower they would have easily won anyway.  Furthermore the messing up the tax credit didn't give them a competetive advantage, so yeah.
How much has Ferrari, maclaren, Mercedes spent this year and they're still slow. You can't equate dollars to speed sorry. I know toto and Lewis were trying to push this narrative but it doesn't work that way.
You're missing the finer details.  It was 1.8m which if the right tax credit was applied with admission would have been around 432k overspend. As can be seen on [page 3 of the real FIA document](https://i.imgur.com/hvGZh3d.jpg) instead of a regurgitation of a news outlet.  [Source](https://www.fia.com/news/accepted-breach-agreement-between-red-bull-racing-team-and-fia-breach-2021-fia-formula-one)
If you read the rest of my post, I do link an article detailing how RB explains the overspend.  Still leaves ~400k spent on catering. Let’s assume that that is “free food” for staff where staff of other teams has to pay for it themselves. Possible benefits of that are: team morale, healthier food and thus healthier staff, team bonding through eating together, less time wasted getting/making their own food.   In the grand scheme of things, probably negligible effect on car/race performance, but still. Question is: if RB had known this would count towards the cap, would they still have done it (and saved money elsewhere), or would they have chosen to spend this money on the car.
You have absolutely no evidence that the extra money was used for aero development though, and the FIA does have the evidence and determined it was an honest mistake not nefarious in nature.  People like you keep resorting to the absolute worst case possibility without any evidence that reality matches it. Like I said, that money could just as easily just paid for a couple spare parts and that's it, or something even more benign. We're talking about 0.2% of the budget if you take the tax break issue into account, which the FIA did in their ruling.
So why did FIA come to the conclusion that it wasn't deliberate?
So why did FIA come to the conclusion that it wasn't deliberate?
Honey we already brought that into the mix up-thread, it's not my fault you can't read so take everything out of context.
90s and early 2000s was the wild west in doping for athletes. Technology hadn’t caught up yet to catch them so everybody was using it. This goes for pretty much every physical sport. Would not be surprised if some of the drivers in 90s used PEDs to enhance their endurance. But nobody was caught/didn’t use it.
No need for almost. The slowest guy in those years still was faster than current champions.
Important to add here that pretty much EVERYONE else during the Tour the France also used doping
probably (and my source for this ate the voices inside my head) it might make a difference later down the road, but not enough to change the championship order. They are so much faster than everyone else that, even without any RB development at all, it could take the other teams almost the entire season to bring their cars any closer to the red bulls, an issue made even worse by the budget cap and the limited simulations
I like the idea that Toto beats the shit out of Zak in Vegas then uses his massive fortune to buy part of McLaren just to fire Zak.
He'll smash him into a pumpernickel
People really think he was issuing a challenge and not just making a joke in reference to all of the bogus Vegas boxing matches?
But no one was able prove that the engine was in fact illegal.
That is what Ferrari said and did themselves. They weren't the ones struggling to get out of the car or saying this would result in permanent injures. It was only Mercedes that was ridding that train hard.
Ah yes, engineers that now work on the totally F1 related project, the 499P
The Ferrari part is factual, the Red Bull one… yeah I agree that the breach isn’t that significant to explain their performance. Still they fucked up and basically got no penalty
Exactly my point. All the TPs are like Horner. They just pretend they aren't. Horner owns it.
That's too many negatives.
[removed]
>You don ‘t agree and that’s fine.  i could agree if you gave a reasonable explanation. But you are just making facts up to justify your opinion or your are basing that opinion on some rumors that have not been confirmed.  You can't punish people based on opinions and rumors that is thankfully not how most countries operate. Maybe it is different where you are from
Thats the point of a discussion though? U cant just tap out? Like m not gonna listen to ur valid arguments because i dont want to.
But they already lost that at the end of 2019. It wasn’t a penalty, that was just their engine without the trick
Link?
It was illegal. If it was true, Ferrari clearly cheated. The sensor detected the fuel flow, and they injected fuel between it's sampling timings.   Was it ingenious, yes. Was it wrong and against the rules of limited fuel flow, 100 percent  yes.
>Spirit of the rules.  >Both fall under the same category.   *This is just in response to this part.*  There is spirit of the rules and there is breaking the rules.   And no they don't both fall under that first category.   If you're not allowed to use more fuel per second then finding a way to trick the sensor into not noticing that you are using more fuel not breaking the spirit, it's breaking the rules. The fuel flow sensor reading isn't the rule, it the way to check wether the rule is being followed.   Tricking the fuel flow sensor is a team trying to hide that you are breaking the rules. That's why it's cheating.   This is not what RB did. They didn't hide anything.   The rest of what you said is accurate.  Edit: this is just to point out the difference between what is rumored Ferrari did and what RB did. I'm not here saying this *is* what Ferrari did.
I never said that both shouldn’t have had penalties and fully agree that it would have been difficult for FIA to prove without pressuring the engineers. I just said that in my opinion what Ferrari did was cheating, what RB did was not. :)
Did you not read my comment? I specifically said that yes, RedBull did go over budget, but they didn’t CHEAT as so many people like to say (as opposed to Ferrari in this case). Your ‘hookers and blow’ example isn’t even close to the situation with Red Bull so why make the analogy in bad faith?   Btw, as an example, one of the areas they ‘excluded’ that FIA said should have been included was sick pay for an employee who was in VERY bad shape and could have died. Luckily he didn’t. But you know that if he HAD died, THEN his sick pay would have been excluded? It’s ridiculous. That engineer didn’t work on the car because he was busy trying to stay alive, and the company supported him even though he did no work for them. No other team had that situation to my knowledge. And there are several more examples like that.   Additionally, in over 70,000 line items minutely examined one by one, FIA found 13 errors amounting to a £400k overage. You think no other team made any errors? Maybe, but doubtful. It’s just that no other team had their submission reviewed with a fine tooth comb.
I don't think it ever would've been that close, even if they won all the DNF/strategy fuckup races.  The pace after TD39 was nowhere close Red Bull, especially because of tyre deg. So it would've been a very unbalanced second half of the season
Absolutely valid argument. I'd say it's more a matter of perspective in underatanding how the two following season were compromised by this, even if you don't consider the actual action a pure "punishment"
That's what they were with the 400k overspend.
The tax credit was not applied for though and there is no guarantee HMRC would have accepted it even if it was.  To claim the breach was £400K when the ABA clearly states £1.8M is incorrect.
> You have absolutely no evidence that the extra money was used for aero development though  It's out of the same budget cap. If they did their finances correctly it would have meant less funds to spend in other areas.
Whether it was deliberate or not, we know the FIA is very averse to controversy; we KNOW they've chosen to ignore or minimize certain incidents, setting road blocks for anyone looking to question any decision they make, so making the most tame determination that closes the book on the matter as quickly as possible, would be par for the course.
~~Answer the actual question and what I actually said - are you telling me there wasn’t a practice year?~~  ~~Hint:~~ [There was a practice year](https://amp.formula1.com/en/latest/article.what-is-the-2021-f1-cost-cap-and-how-will-it-be-enforced.4l0LPbfFgBhDxjccMseCHO.html).   >	“As preparation for the cost cap’s introduction, F1 will work with teams to operate a soft implantation period – or dummy run – in 2020.”

Not sure about PED’s but a few drivers were happily shoving white powder up their noses, ,,,cough cough Coulthard.
["Our roided up guy was better than your roided up guy!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9YL04v-J5U)
Which means exactly zero in the case of Lance Armstrong. When the others in the peloton were admitting using PED's Armstrong was using is extreme influence in cycling to literally destroy the bussines of others who were implicating him in systemic doping abuse as well.  Lance Armstrong is not just a doping cheater, the man is an absolute piece of shit.
Absolutely, doping has a long history in cycling and Lance’s time was probably the peak of it. He was kind of mate to be a scapegoat
The problem wasn't that Armstrong was using PED's. Most riders at the time did, and probably most do it to this day. Other riders from that age are still well-liked, despite their use of PED's. For example, Alberto Contador, who had his 2010 Tour de France win stripped for the use of Clenbuterol, a banned substance, is still beloved by cycling fans.   It's his behaviour towards other riders. Filippo Simeoni testified that he used PED's. Armstrong didn't like that. He didn't like Christophe Bassons either, who was the only rider on the Festina team that did not take PED's. He helped ruin both of their carreers.
So then they didn't get punished at all and downgraded their car for the hell of it after the TD?
[https://www.planetf1.com/news/carlos-sainz-porpoising-damage-long-term-health/](https://www.planetf1.com/news/carlos-sainz-porpoising-damage-long-term-health/)  Which team did Sainz drove for?
He's not wrong though. Years of tons of money has allowed top teams like Mercedes, Red Bull and Ferrari to develop state of the art facilities and those are resources they can still benefit from. Explains why even though there is a cap, the traditional top teams are still at the front. Exception here I guess is McLaren though.
10% wind tunnel time is alot for 500k, what are you on about. The car rn was created when the penalty didn't hit, later this year and next year is when you'll see the actual results. Stop being so naive
Jos
Okay? Show some source about why they're wrong?
Mate, whether they fiddled with the figures or not is irrelevant.  They still breached the cap and that’s the fact of the matter.  We were told before that a breach would come with significant punishments.  That hasn’t happened.
Why does it need to be discussed?
they didn't, and you can see this in the results they still got. a car 20hp off the pack could have the best aero configurations in the world, it would not be able to reliably be the second or third fastest car on the track. The engine being further stunted by the deal with the FIA and bad aero configuration was what made them fall off so massively in 2020.
[This is what they’re talking about I think.](https://www.racefans.net/2014/03/16/ricciardo-faces-investigation-fuel-limit-breach/)
Yeah. Much better move to tip the FIA than risk being caught themselves. There's definitely a parallel universe where RB did the cheat too, but got caught and not Ferrari.
That’s a bold statement considering all of the teams are constantly trying to find gaps and weaknesses in the rules to exploit
Oh how do you know that? Do you have some insiders at FIA?  Please let us know!
Exactly
Yeah RB just flat out broke the rules and cheated, while they lied through their teeth about it to try and get the PR on their side before their cheating was officially announced. Ferrari never broke any rules and you can prove to me otherwise.
That's exactly my point, they spent orders of magnitude more on R&D but they claim that sick pay and catering were to blame for overspending. Had they spent a few milions less on R&D then they could have easily afforded those expenses.  The statement that RedBull was over budget because of R&D on car is just as true as what they tried to sell to the public. Unless you think that other teams don't do sick pay as well.  Again, I don't think it's comparable to Ferrari's cheating, but there is no need to sugarcoat what they did.
Yes, they had total overspent of 1.8mln, if they would apply for the Tax Deduction correctly the procentage of overspend would be 0.37% instead of 1.6%
You're mixing me up with the other guy now lol.
Booger Sugar!
Main issue i had with Lance was not his dope, more people did that. It was his power and that he used it to destroy the lives of others
I really struggle to see how the man who used doping to win a record number of tours is being made a scapegoat.  Seems rather obvious to me that the most successful cheater gets the most attention.  The man had built an empire based on his cycling success, all based on lies. He deserved every bit of negative attention.
Nah , his team and he took it to the extreme .  Lance was the one handling the stuff , paying off people , force other riders in their team to take loads or take a walk .  Armstrong terrorized and threatened people,  ruined their careers .
Again, Ferrari was almost certainly doing illegal things, I'm just talking about the investigations and what officially happened.  Ferrari became a brick in 2020. They had low top speed in the first race after the TD in COTA 2019, and that's what everyone points to as damning evidence of Ferrari cheating, but they were back to being the fastest in straightline in Abu Dhabi & Brazil.  This great analysis by [f1bythenumbers](https://f1bythenumbers.com/2019-f1-season-ferraris-straight-line-speed/) shows Ferrari top speed compared to the rest in 2019, and whether they made a leap after the summer break, and if they were drastically slower after the TD.
And Leclerc said the opposite, but what is actually important here is what Ferrari did as a team and they were against the rule changes: https://www.gpblog.com/en/amp/119875/ferrari-is-prepared-to-protest-against-fia-porpoising-rules.html
Actually the FIA took into account that the breach was not deliberate, so your claim about fiddling actually is relevant for the punishment.
> whether they fiddled with the figures or not is irrelevant.  but you literally accused them of it. So not that is not irrelevant. Because if they fiddled with the numbers the actual breach would be higher than the reported one and should result in a different penalty.
>We were told before that a breach would come with significant punishments.  >That hasn’t happened.  That's on the teams for voting on the rules that had different tiers of punishment based on amount of overspend, then. Can't blame the FIA for that
Cause it is a healthy way to create opinions? Sure you are allowed to have your opinion, but then also be open to having it changed (and be prepared to eleborate on your own). Otherwise what is the point in replying to other comments?
No lol, Ferrari didn’t have less power in 2020 than Ferrari customer teams for instance. The FIA isn’t gonna punish those teams (that didn’t benefit from the 2019 trick) by punishing all Ferrari powered teams.  You also have 0 sources about this conspiracy.
So they weren’t penalized? The frequency change aspect probably points to similar aliasing tricks but I’d guess that Ferraris big innovation was reading the sensor and using that for feedback to trick the system instead of using static values. That’s probably why the FIA couldn’t just change the frequency or detect it as they did before.
I dint think Honda would allow such shenanigans
The rules are clear regarding how much fuel you could use per second. There was nothing to exploit. They exploited the limitations of the sensor used, not rules themselves
I am not fully updated on the Ferrari engine cheat, but there is a difference in finding exploits in the wording of the rules and finding exploits in the policing of the rules. Every team is and should be free and to some extent encouraged to innovate within and around the prevailing rules without it being cheating. It is however just cheating if you can find a way to trick the testing. That is why Volkswagen got a massive fine with their emissions cheating, that is also why/how we got into the flexi wing shenanigans a couple of seasons back. The policing, I.E. the weight put onto the wings to measure deflection under load was not sufficient to test the actual performance of the wings. It is only fair that those exploits are promptly dealt with. If no engine is allowed to burn more than x amount of fuel and one team manages to trick the sensor/testing in a way that allows them to exceed the allowance that is just illegal and not exploiting a loophole.
Good try!
Awwww buddy… critical thinking skills are hard huh. It’s ok, maybe one day you’ll get there.
 This isn’t sugarcoating it’s just reality. It sounds like neither of us are saying that they didn’t fuck up (because they did - at minimum they should have done the trial run). And it sounds like you agree that they didn’t cheat (which was all that my original comment said), like Ferrari did.   ‘spent orders of magnitude more on R&D’ - more than who? Certainly not any of their closest competitors. All of the top teams spent pretty much up to the cap. $400k mistaken overspend of a $145M cap is 0.27% (0.0027) overspend. I’m not sure you understand what order of magnitude means. It’s more akin to the fact that Mercedes up to 2019 was spending $10s of millions more than the next closest team (Ferrari) and was outspending the richest midfield team (Renault) by $200M. THATS an order of magnitude.   Also what is your logic? You think that if RB KNEW those catering and sick pay costs couldn’t be excluded they would have chosen to spend the funds there and not on the car? Do you think for one second that they didn’t cut down the catering this year? They obviously prioritize spending on the car. It’s not like if they understood the rules they would have still spent the ‘extra’ on food. No - they would have cut it and still spent the money on the CAR like they’re doing this year.   Also that employee that the majority of the sick pay went to was basically near death for months and they kept paying him the whole time PAST WHEN IT WAS LEGALLY REQUIRED and after even while he did 0 work on the car, so yes, RBs sick pay costs in 2021 were FAR higher than any other team, at least as far as I’ve seen or heard. Feel free to correct me if you have evidence to the contrary.  So I don’t understand why you’re arguing here, and using entirely irrelevant examples (hookers and blackjack) and terms (‘orders of magnitude’).
Sorry, my bad, but yes they did actually have a practice year so it’s surprising they were given leeway by the FIA. Can only imagine that the mistakes they made were genuinely in error.
What is with people with one testicle and ruining people's lives?
How did he destroy the lives of others?
It wasn't because he was doping. It was because he was acting like a sort of mob boss.
 >Again, Ferrari was almost certainly doing illegal things, I'm just talking about the investigations and what officially happened.  Some people just can't wrap their heads around it. Yes, Ferrari was definitely cheating, but we don't know exactly how. You cannot punish someone on speculations.  I'd wager the deal between the FIA and Ferrari was to get them to confess privately, and tell them how they were cheating so that they could prevent it in the future.
How do you know it wasn’t deliberate?
But it’s clear none of us are willing to have our opinions changed  What’s the point in going for a tit for tat argument for the sake of it?  I expressed my opinion, people didn’t like it, that’s fine.
Ya pretty clever
The weird thing about comparing the engine to the flexi wings is that the engine’s fuel flow is strictly defined, while the acceptable flexibility of the wing is *defined* by the test.
Aw another dude who can’t prove otherwise. It’s okay, Red Bull cheated. Just because you cheer for cheaters doesn’t mean you should let that effect your personal life when they get caught cheating :(
Not the best source but he sued and made sure his former teammates (Tyler hamilton and Floyd landis and the wife of one betsy andreu) where shunned from cycling.  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1516420-lance-armstrong-is-the-dirtiest-cheater-in-sports-history
> "... there is no accusation or evidence that RBR has sought at any time to act in bad faith, dishonestly or in a fraudulent manner, nor has it wilfully concealed any information from the Cost Cap Administration."
Assumption of innocence?
Fair i guess, not really how having a discussion works but i cant force you to do it. Hope you have a pleasant day!

Captions didn’t come out… 1. Alonso car pre-qualifying  2. Stroll car pre-race 3. Alonso helmets 4. Stroll crew watching the race 5. Pano from back of the garage 6. Alonso crew (and others) watching the race 7. Alonso heading out 8. Viewing gallery   9,10,11,12,13: Some of the team members
That’s incredible man! What an unforgettable experience!!
Must’ve been difficult to get into the AM garage after your stint sponsoring Haas in 2019
Dude, incredible access -- I'd have cut off my left some body part or another to trade places.  In the second pic, what is that black thing between the two helmets that says Alonso on it?
Did you get the access through a team sponsor?
Ya you did
That's awesome! But did you have a good time? Your face is the exact same in every photo. I don't think I've ever seen someone *not* smile so much. Lol.
What was it like being amongst the team during the race? Did you learn anything new?
I see some familiar faces, but who is the bearded guy I see in most of the pics?
First shot just amazes me how insane the engineering of a formula 1 car is. And that isn’t even close to the most complex part of the car
Looks like a once in a lifetime opportunity and a fun one too. Great pics
Had a couple drinks, saw a couple things
Fantastic shots...and fantastic beard!
I guess you met with Jessica C. from Hospitality, she’s great!
Great pictures, also great beard!
And you found My Crack!
Jessica Hawkins was definitely highlight of that trip bud
As long as you didn't put anything in Mike Krack.
Fairdinkum
Aw that’s too cool!!! Nice
The “team members” : Fernando Alonso, Mike Krack, Stoffel Vandoorne, Jessica Hawkins, Lance’s AMR23… o__o  What a day you had…
Stoffel is just another team member. Oof. I'm glad he's still in F1 but I feel for the guy.
Very cool, man
Just a little off the top and no one recognised me ✂️
Looks like the stand that holds Alonso's helmet  if you look at the helmet above you can see the bottom of the same type of stand
It’s a heater to dry out the helmet and gloves after the sessions.
Yeah through NetApp.  There were also people from the other sponsors too, Cognizant, Juniper, and JBC were the ones I saw.
The man owns Rich Energy, show some respect!
Haha! Yeah I don’t like my smile so try to “smile with the eyes” instead.  I promise I had a most excellent time
That man's eyes are smiling
I was surprised how relaxed everyone seemed!    The radio talk for the part of the race I was listening to was mostly just relaying the gaps to the car in front and car behind.   I got to listen to some of Strolls radio  during qualifying, he’d come in for a tyre change close to the end and he didn’t sound too happy about it.  They said they’d send him back out for one last lap but would abort the lap if it wasn’t needed. I guess to save the tyres.  Also, that there’s a person in the team who shaves the tyres (like shaving a wheel of Parmesan) so they can be re-used if they haven’t worn down too much
that is op
I thought it was my crack?!
What's Hawkins role?
He might be a team member, but at least he's a world champion team member.
Awesome -- thank you for the reply.  My first reaction was that it looked like an XBOX controller, but obviously that wouldn't be it.  Thank you for both knowing the answer and sharing it!
That's my hope too that when I'll work for a team sponsor I'll get one😁
👍😂
Oh I feel you, I've never been able to properly smile on photos
Was it surreal listening to radio? I love radio and to be able to hear the real person you see on tv say it in real time must have been awesome
Were you in only on Saturday?
Oh didnt know the tyre shaving, interesting
Racing driver, competed in W series in 2022.
I believe for PR work and racing in the W series.
I was a guest of NetApp, I don’t work for them but my company uses some of their products - and there were a bunch of different people who were in a similar situation to me. Although I don’t have much insight into how they “picked” who to invite - definitely nothing special in my case.   Hopefully my boss doesn’t read this (👋) but I set up a job alert on linked in in case anything pops up at the team as it really spiked my interest in working for them, especially as it made me realise that they have plenty of “normal” jobs  It’s a small ratio of the team that actually work trackside but even just working for the team at hq would be great.    E.g I spoke with the trackside IT systems engineer who said that there are 5 in his team, only 2 do each race and they rotate every 3 weeks (I think that’s right) - so don’t necessarily have to be a mechanic to work at the track too.   Maybe it’s not the case but I’d like to think that if you worked for the team and you went to a race in another country (maybe on holiday) then you’d be allowed into the paddock area? I imagine the amount of people at HQ would be too many to let them all in at Silverstone!
I do wonder how many NetApp employees actually get to visit a race. Usually a major point of sponsoring such events is to invite clients to them, not your own employees.
Saturday and Sunday, but not in the garage for the whole qualifying and race period so I missed out on any radio for the red flags or when Alonso got spun
I think she has another role within the team as well, but it's not as cool as actually racing even F3 spec cars
When I worked for one company which was unrelated to F1 they had VIP tickets to many events they sponsored and usually it works similarly in other companies. Even if client for which I work now would invite me (they sponsor one team) my company wouldn't allow me to accept 😔 they even rejected free football tickets which I was offered.  Yeah working for one of the teams on backend would be good too but they don't hire remote (what I saw so far) so I usually cross-check the employees if they sponsor a team in a hope to get similar tickets which I had to other non F1 events.
Teams are limited on the number of personnel allowed in the garage and paddock at each weekend, even if it’s a home race for the team. It’s probably why only 2 IT folks go to race weekends and they swap them off.
I guess it depends on the relationship with the right people but yeah that too.

>“At least we would like to be heard and have a constructive discussion. We certainly go there to overturn the decision, but we also want to speak for the sake of sport and to try to eliminate this inconsistency. In the same curve there were three accidents (Sainz-Alonso, Gasly-Ocon, Sargeant-De Vries) judged differently,” said Vasseur.  This is absolutely fair.
Valid point on Sargeant, honestly. That was more egregious than Sainz's move, even, and went totally unpunished. I know Williams are at the lower part of the grid, but come on.
>	What Carlos is most sorry for is that they didn’t even listen to him. True, we always ask for penalties during the race and not after, but this was a particular situation, with red flags and restarts and the race was over. It was a case that could be treated differently,”  I think we all can agree with this sentiment. The FIA is still all over the place when it comes to penalizing.   In Melbourne, during the same period we had three incidents: Sainz - Alonso, Gasly - Ocon and Sargeant and De Vries. Of those three, only two were noted and investigated. From those two, only one got an immediate penalty, +5s to Carlos Sainz.   The point Vasseur (and Sainz) is trying to make is completely fair. The stewards, who often delay the penalties to hear all of the parties involved, didn’t wait for Sainz and Alonso. At the same time, the incident between the Alpines was investigated after the race. Granted, both Alpines were out meaning the investigation could wait. Why apply different criteria?  Whether the penalty was fair or unfair is irrelevant here. The FIA is seemingly changing the way they approach each incident, all and everything seems to be judged differently. This must change and they need to decide which way is the one going forward.
For the right of review appeal, Ferrari needs to give the stewards a new evidence regarding the whole thing so that they approve the hearing in the first place. Not sure how they'll surpass that requirement so that their appeal isn't thrown out immediately. They are totally right about the inconsistency with Gasly and Sargeant, but is that really new?  I was surprised they didn't try to do anything after the race. Almost a week later, I doubt they have much of a shot.
The biggest joke here is the other drivers not getting penalties. Gasly should have a race ban(due to penalty points), Sargeant should have penalty points as well. Gasly literally took Ocon OUT of the race, same with Sargeant. Sainz didnt even take alonso out but got a penalty, makes no sense.
If the Sainz incident results in a penalty then so do gasly-ocon and Sargeant-de vries too.
The only thing that needs to be changed here is Gasly getting a race ban and Sargeant some penalty points as well. Sainz' penalty was just.
It’s just especially frustrating that it’s one of the easiest things to police, yet doesn’t get consistency.
We need a permanent panel of race stewards. If not absolutely permanent, at least two-thirds of the panel should be permanent.
Aye. I don’t think the penalty will get reversed. It’s far more likely that the other two incidents get penalties…as deserved.   But the real thing they’re gonna talk about is that the penalty was applied in such a way that it punished Sainz’s infraction far more harshly than anyone thinks is proper. I mean, moving from 4th to last…it’s the almost effect of a disqualification for going slightly too deep, on a lap where half the field went too deep on one corner or another.   I think we’d all like to see penalties given at the end races assessed as position drops instead of seconds. I’d be fine with them assessing any penalty that happened either without green flag racing prior to the end, or just blanket any infraction that happened within 10 laps of the end. That way penalties can have their intended effects.
I was waiting for this! After both Gasly and Sargent got nothing it only made sense for Ferrari did this. The annoying thing is it means the FIA will have changed the results twice out of 3 races if they go through with it.
This should at least achieve a penalty for Gasly and Seargant then. Which they deserve.
Did Sainz deserve the penalty? Yes. So did Gasly and Sargeant. They didn't even bother reviewing Sargeant and Nyck's case. I feel like Ferrari and the other teams should appeal to the FIA to just be consistent with penalties. Now if something similar happens in the upcoming races, teams will use Sainz's penalty, Gasly and Sargeant's lack of penalty as a reference. Also people commenting saying both Gasly and Sargeant were out either ways and a 5s/10s wouldn't have made a different. Don't they give a grid penalty or 5s/10s penalty added to the next race? I mean Carlos also got 2 penalty points on top of the 5s penalty, which the other two did not. I am just confused! Correct me if I am wrong. This entire thing is just a shitshow.
Other drivers probably should have gotten penalties for their respective incidents, even if it was technically a "first lap" with some odd circumstances like cold tires and the glare of the sun.   Here's the thing though, it's okay for Sainz's penalty to be both just and the saddest shit I've ever seen. In any other race, this 5 second penalty would have meant that he still earned even a few points for the championship. Getting knocked all the way down to 12th from 4th for a 5 second penalty doesn't usually happen. It doesn't matter if he deserved the penalty (which he really did), it's still some pretty sad shit.
They were checking until now.
The way the rules were applied was capricious at best.
When the outcome of a corner is as bad as that you have to take into account, as Max said, with a late red flag that all those cars were struggling with really cold tires... I think I'd honestly give everyone a pass.
They didn't seem mind when Russell got a penalty when Sainz got yeeted @ COTA.
There's no overturning  Sainz penalty, Sainz himself said the penalty wasn't harsh itself when he was the one getting taken out by Russell for almost the exact same incident  It's penalties for those who didn't get it
While I believe he deserved the penalty for his actions, Logan was let go for an even worse mistake, Gasly's still in a weird place so I can understand why he wouldn't be given a penalty but you either give both Sainz and Logan a penalty or neither.
Seems fair given neither Gasly or Sargeant got anything for their crashes
As Palmer has pointed out, Sainz penalty is practically the same case as George's penalty in 2022 US Grand Prix. And ironically, Sainz considered that penalty to be "too light". So no, I absolute think that Sainz penalty is fair.  That said, it doesn't excuse Sargeant's lack of penalty.
I can see why Ferrari is furious over that penalty - the outcome of ALO-SAI incident was completely overturned, but the penalty was granted.  On the other hand, GAS-OCO and DEV-SAR incidents were impossible to overturn, because in the first one both cars got terminal damage and cannot continue, and in the latter both cars were beached. And yet, those collisions were not penalized, despite the fact that aftermath of that incident stays in the results.  So I can see the reason for this appeal, but hey - let's be serious, it's the FIA.
Let Yuki keep his single point, abeg
This isn't going to go anywhere. We only need to go back to George Russell spinning out Carlos in a almost identical situation and Carlos demanding a more serious punishment than the 5s penalty he was awarded.  Other penalties and rulings have nothing to do with his actions that spun Fernando. I don't expect the stewards to love the suggestion that they suck at their job. I don't expect it to go anywhere.  Life is a two way street, Carlos Sainz. Shit don't roll uphill.
Sainz's penalty was just. Ferrari be wasting money trying to get it overturned.
Damn, if only Ferrari was this loyal to Charles.
The penalty was legit.   I'll laugh if this results in Gasly and Sargaent getting penalties too, however.
How does this happen now. Why wait so long?
Took their sweet time to do it!
As a reminder, a Right of Review is only granted if the team can bring  >”a significant and relevant new element… which was unavailable to the parties seeking the review at the time of the decision concerned”  It’s hard to see what Ferrari can bring that meets these criteria that would also overturn the original decision. The decision was made using data and video, and I don’t believe the steward’s subsequent rulings on the other incident would be considered “significant and relevant” to the Sainz incident, since they’re all separate incidents with their own context and specific details.
As Ted Kravitz said on the Sky Sports podcast; if you are giving Alonso back his position then technically you are saying this didn’t happen so it seems inconsistent to penalise Sainz for something that didn’t end up hurting Fernando
Incident was basically the same as Charles and Stroll but that wasn’t punished
I’m not sure what Sainz was thinking. That kind of Kamakazi move can seriously cause consequences…  He’s lucky he only got the minimum 5 second penalty. But I guess the stewards after further review decided on the 2 points on the license …causing a collision … It’s fair and there is precedent…so it sucks for Sainz but he knows now he can’t barrel his opponents out of the way.
There is also the argument that Sainz got penalised for a section of the race that was ultimately void as all the cars went back to their positions from the previous restart. And the person supposedly most affected by his actions, Alonso, got to keep his position. Obviously there were significant consequences for some teams however.
It was bullshit penalty, if nobody else was penalized, and alonso even kept his place.
Aren't they a bit late for the whole thing?
Tsunoda at the market buying a punching bag rn
Stupid question. Does magnussen get penalized?
Sainz penalty is correct. The issue is that the others weren’t penalized, not that Sainz was.
It's hard to judge Gasly-Ocon because it seems that that only spawned because of Sainz spinning Alonso.  But I hear it from the Sargeant-De Vries situation. Sargeant should have gotten a grid penalty for Baku.
Makes sense. Sainz 's one is very much more weighted heavily on Sainz in the grand scheme of lap 1, turn 1 incidents in general on my opinion  I think of Turkey 2021 with Gasly at the initial race start, Sainz 's  2023 Australia looked even worse than that  https://youtu.be/ZGRpHy0qoN4  Go to 00:42
Well, Sainz was given a time penalty. There's no point in giving a time penalty to a driver that already DNFed. Neither of Sargeant and De Vries were in the points anyway, but I suspect it's more of the first thing. If it wasn't bad enough to get license points... what could they do? He already DNFed. Whereas Sainz could receive the time penalty. Ocon and Gasly also couldn't receive time penalties. As to harsher punishment like points, Ocon assumed partial blame. Did he do that because it was his teammate? Oh, absolutely. However... if a driver assumes fault... I can see weighing that in the decision making process. I'm also not an expert.
Dishonest comparison. Sainz made an entirely unforced error all on his own. The other errors were as a direct result of the chaos.
This is : I got a ticket for crosswalking but others were also crosswalking and did not get a ticket.   Just because someone else got away with breaking the rules because the regulator did not notice it ( they should have judged it and it was ridiculous it was not.)  it does not mean you should get away with it.   So second part is certainly something to adress, the first part is a fools errand and certainly if they attempt to bring in those who did not get punished as an argument.  Edit -21
The difference is that Sainz was racing while Sargeant and Gasly were kamikazes..  Sainz was penalised because Alonso spun.
What's the point of giving a 5 second penalty to a car that's crashed out of the race?
Imagine a post race penalty for Sainz that would change half of the grid. We would be here asking the FIA to give the penalty immediately because it was clear. The FIA should have investigated Sargent and penalize him and Gasly.
The new evidence might be the resolution of the Ocon-Gasly investigation being treated differently than Sainz's incident.
The new evidence could be a folder of videos showing how similar situations have been treated differently in the past and in the very same race. That is exactly what AM did last race.
New evidence like George spinning Sainz on lap 1 of the US GP and getting away with it?
inb4 they pull a Canada 2019 and provide Chandhok’s analysis as “evidence”
Yeah this doesn’t feel like the right avenue for Ferrari to have this (valid) discussion.  The stewards won’t provide any more justification or explanation for their decisions, they’ll just say that there is no new relevant information and deny the review.
Yep, I'm not going to argue that Sainz shouldn't have got a penalty, he did make a mistake and cause a collision.      But so did two other drivers, who will walk away with absolutely no punishment for the incidents they caused.
And probably Stroll too at the start of the race. The stewards listed it as a racing incident which is normal because the race starts are hectic with a lot of cars around. And accidents in the first corner are given more grace than incidents mid race. Sainz and Stroll were both first corner incidents but were treated completely differently. And I can understand Ferrari's disappointment. Two very similar incidents with Ferrari on opposite sides in both. But inconsistency in decision making led to Ferrari coming off worse in both incidents despite their similarity.
Devries was wayyy outside his grid box at the restart and that's not even being mentioned.. More inconsistency
There's no way FIA will handle a race ban to Gasly, he'd probably need to Bottas 2020 Hungary half the grid before they gave him the last points and even then I'm not convinced he'd get a race ban
The issue would become biases. "*X* always gives *Y* leeway"
The NBA has an officiating headquarters where refs assist on court refs with reviews. After an accident it should be sent to a core team that treats it like a science.
The problem with that is they will start playing favorites. It will always be favorable to a particular driver over other.
You cant judge Ocon-Gasly a "first lap racing incident" and then judge Sainz-Alonso as anything other than a "first-lap racing incident" imo.   Let alone the Williams bowling with cars in the back.
Yeah, but that's not really going to get them anything. The penalty was the same as with similar infractions in the past, e.g., Russelt crashing into Sainz in Austin T1 last year. The stewards are expected to look at the action itself and give a penalty based on the rules and any precedents without regard to whether it's convenient for the driver to serve the penalty.  This is a reasonable discussion to be had with the FIA about how to handle time penalties on the event of a SC finish, but there's nothing here that merits the penalty getting overturned.
or they just give Gasly and Sargent the penalties they deserve.  Stop pussyfooting around FIA and just dole out a race ban already, rip off the bandaid and then get drunk on the drama and viewership it generates.
That isn't possible, Ferrari is very likely asking to undo Sainz 5 second time penalty and 2 penalty points for something what should been seen as a "lap 1" incident.  Also Logan can't get a penalty at all also because he was never investigated.
It was also a different incident entirely. George locked up and ploughed right into the side of Sainz. Sainz did not lock up. He just took a different line than Alonso into the corner and ended up making contact.
I think that a lot of people forgetting to see the bigger picture about that incident between Gasly and Ocon.  First of all, Gasly was solely investigated for the moment between him and Ocon and not about re-enter the track unsafely, and the issue with the Gasly/Ocon incident is that both drivers could avoiding the outcome of the incident and therefore it could be written off as a "both drivers made a mistake" plus unlike what official is claimed often the outcome of an incident counts in terms of giving a penalty or not.  I can understand that it all feels odd and unfair (imo Sainz was a "lap 1" incident mainly but well I'm not the stewards or the RD) but I don't see how Ferrari would win this, there is no significant and relevant new element in general.
They can yeet his point if they give him P5 back instead, idc.
Only reasonable response I've read so far in this thread .
Laugh because you don't think they should get penalties? I'm genuinely just asking for clarification
And then they appeal... just to fill the void until the next race. Meanwhile, Max drives his Harley into the living room just for lols
They have up to 14 days
They have 14 days after the decision/race to appeal. And this is their second appeal after I am guessing the first one was right after the race.
Yes, but if alonse would not have been able to return to the pits he would have lost all his points. If anything it's crazy sergeant hasn't gotten a penalty
It wasn't voided. The lap counts and everything that happened counts. You just need an order to put the cars in after a red flag. And if they don't make it out of S1 there is no new order. So they go back to the last one they had.   The same thing happened in Silverstone. It doesn't mean that lap didn't happen. The just need an order to put the cars in and take the last one that they had.
That argument makes no sense. The same rules apply under red flag. Or do you think you can just spin someone when the race is nullified? You'd probably be disqualified if you did that.
If it get overturned that will mean that he ties the record for most consecutive non-first finishes: 11th.
Most likely not. He caused his own crash.
On what ground would he be penalized? Or as Kimi would say: "FOR WHAT!?"
Not entirely…  The issue here is how the three incidents were treated differently. Not that the others weren’t penalized, that’s not the point Vasseur is making. There’s an inconsistency on the procedure and which can be investigated at the time and after the race.
what was Sainz supposed to do? Disappear?
Gasly actually nearly smashed Alonso before Sainz. Palmer covered this in his analysis but while the sainz thing did cause the slowdown, Gasly was on his own wrecking mission
Eh Gasly was off track so it’s up to him to come on safely.
No it didn’t. Gasly locked up and went wide (pushed Checo onto grass too), and then rejoined dangerously.
It didnt, Gasly almost hit alonso on his way to turn 1 because he did the same as sainz and braked a bit too late. Went on the grass by his own mistake and came back to track and caused the crash with ocon. Sainz-Alonso crash played no role.
Mm, no. Gasly locked up before anything else transpired, went wide and rejoined after some of the chaos with Alonso and Sainz. His rejoining had absolutely zilch to do with the Alo-Sai incident
Sainz-Alonzo incident caused Gasly to cross the whole track from side to side? Not even Alpine argued that.
Well no matter what you should not impede racers who are already on the line when you are off track and looking to reenter. So in my view Gasly was at fault there. Which is brutal, by the way, because he had a brilliant race and was forced off track by another car, so not his fault at all for that (Or maybe it was? Not sure if he locked up or something). In this case, taking a penalty of 5 or 10 sec would have been a far better outcome for him than waiting for all the cars to go by and avoid the penalty.
that is irrelevant, ocon was outside of the track, returned unsafely, and put ocon into the wall.
No it really isn't hard to judge at all.  He rejoined and crashed into another driver. Ocon did not move into him it was a clear cut penalty and the fact he didn't get one is absolutely corrupt.
There certainly is a point to it, though. Not only did Sainz get 5 seconds, he got 2 penalty points on his license. Just because the other two DNF'd, they should not receive the same punishment to deter them from dangerous driving in the future?  Someone DNF'ing can never be a factor in determining the punishment.
>There's no point in giving a time penalty to a driver that already DNFed.  They'd get a grid penalty for the next race instead.  > If it wasn't bad enough to get license points...  They're tied to penalties. No penalty is no penalty points.
>Well, Sainz was given a time penalty. There's no point in giving a time penalty to a driver that already DNFed. Neither of Sargeant and De Vries were in the points anyway, but I suspect it's more of the first thing.  When a driver is out of the race they can still be pubished. They get a 5 place gridpenalty for the next race. So the factor of beeing out of the race does not prevent a punishment.   Neither cars beeing in the points is also not an argument to not punish as the punishment is not to force the offender to lose points, but to prevent from others to do the same a next time.   Ferrari having a talk about the Stewards noy investigating that is a correct thing to do and other teams should support that.   But it can not be used as an argument to reevaluate Sainz penalty.
It wouldn't be the first time there is a X positions penalty on the grid for the next race...
The outcome does not determine the penalty- that’s what was explicitly said after Silverstone 2021 when there was such an uproar about people believing Lewis’s penalty wasn’t sever enough.
Sargeant just straight crashed into DV. That had nothing to do with the other crashes. He even said he braked at the same point but didn’t have the grip. So he misjudged it and fucked it
Also what are the "significant and relevant new element(s)" Ferrari would come up? If they would point towards Gasly vs Ocon and/or Sargeant vs De Vries then I don't see how that would be considered as a "significant and relevant new element".
Poor analogy. Unless there were stewards and officials sitting around watching everyone crossing the road and you were the only one given a ticket for jaywalking.
This is literally what AM argued about with their penalty in the previous race and got their penalty taken off
It’s always “outcomes don’t decide penalty” until they do. smh
>Sainz was penalised because Alonso spun.  Isn't it always that "The outcome does not matter, the action does"?
Yeah, if Alonso didn't spin he wouldn't have a penalty, which isn't really fair.
Hilarious wording to imply it was alonsos fault. Alonso didn't spin, he WAS spun by sainz
It would be a grid penalty for the next race.
Penalty points + grid penalty next race. That's how they did it before.
I don’t think so. The penalty is fair, that’s not the issue.   If Sainz was able to give his thoughts to the stewards and then receive a penalty, we wouldn’t be here waiting for a right to review.
> We would be here asking the FIA to give the penalty immediately because it was clear.   I wouldn't. I care about penalties being served on time when drivers can accomodate to them (e.g. Alonso in Jeddah, who could easily make a >10 s gap if he wanted), and there's nothing the driver has to say anyway. I don't care when drivers cannot do anything (Sainz cannot make a 5 s gap in a formation lap) and the incident is so grey.
This is what I’d be arguing, how can one incident be a Turn 1/first lap incident and another merit a 5 second penalty
"Someone else got away with it" has nothing to do with how Sainz had contact with Alonso.   The new evidence can only talk about the reasons that Sainz got in contact with Alonso.   And to avoid the penalty for Sainz they should have to provide evidence that it was either Alonso's fault the contact happened or that Alonso had failed to do something that could have avoided the crash so both were equal at fault.  And as it happened I see no avenue that Sainz is going to prove that.
AMs main argument was the video footage of the meeting which showed that there was no agreement as to touching consitituting working on a car. They then used previous precident to strengthen that point.
It's Ferrari so I wouldn't be shocked if they doing the same now with Sainz
They are 100% completely different incidents. First of all, Stroll and Leclerc's incident was in turn 3, as opposed to Sainz and Alonso being in turn 1/2. Sainz hit Alonso on the exit of turn 1 because Alonso was trying to switch back on Hamilton and Sainz carried way too much speed into the exit of the corner and hit the back right tyre of Fernando's car.   Stroll had Leclerc on the outside and Alonso kind of on the inside and took a somewhat normal line into turn 3 when Leclerc turned into him on corner entry. Stroll and Leclerc was definitely a racing incident, Stroll could have backed out a bit to be behind Fernando and had more room on the inside, Leclerc could have taken a wider line and honestly would have still been able to get the move done. Kind of a classic 3 wide into a corner.   They are incomparable
How on earth did he manage that. The grid boxes in Melbourne were giant
This already happens. Warwick hasnt stewarded a race properly in years
Have FOM contribute to salaries of the Stewards, so the dont directly pay them.  Have a review panel to review the stewards decisions during and after the race, have a representative from FOM and the GPDA sit on the review panel.
ESPECIALLY when they explicitly discussed the "first lap incident" treatment as part of the judgement on the Sainz incident.  And if Vettel gets a penalty for an unsafe rejoin vs Hamilton where they didn't crash, how does Gasly get away with it when he did crash?
Honestly that makes it worse because Sainz just drove into Alonso. He  came from way behind and left no space and didn't even lock up. That's worse.
Locking up gives a driver an excuse as to why the incident occurred because they were not able to control the car.  When you're completely in control of the car and turn another driver it appears much worse
How did they not investigate as an unsafe rejoin... madness
Someone pointed out that if the original order hadn't been reversed, Nico would have fallen back with engine trouble, Carlow would have had the pnelaty and we potentially lost a Yuki P4 or P3....kill me
Yeah but that didn’t happen. You can’t judge a penalty on a what if
Looking at his mobile phone while driving
Teammates wiping each other out is almost always judged differently, as there is already plenty of incentive to avoid a recurrence and the hurt is internal to the team.
yes and no, because there are no objective measures to enact a penalty, just reasons they should, you can ask them to be more consistent the next time, but you have no right to ask them to overturn a clear penalty when the wording is clear (albeit vague) and agreed upon on what constitutes "causing a collision"
The Gasly penalty was a maybe at best because it was his teammate he crashed into. If it was Leclerc Sainz crashed into he wouldn't have got one either, just like Stroll got nothing in Bahrain for pretty much doing exactly what Sainz did. So they are at least consistent with that specifically.
You cant be serious lol
I think everything stemmed from half of the drivers starting on the part of the track that was covered with marbles. Gasly got massive understeer going into that turn when he hit Ocon.  All this chaos happened because you have an entire race worth of debris off the racing line, and then you tell half of the cars to perform a standing start on top of it with coldish tyres. It's a recipe for disaster.  With this in mind, I think that Sainz should absolutely not have been given a penalty, and I bet anything this is why he was upset. The car was likely extraordinarily difficult to control in these circumstances. He didn't do anything dangerous to lose control of the car.
The universe sensed something wrong these last few weeks with Alonso scoring so high and had everything ready to correct its mistakes. Luckily, F1 hero Stefano Domenicali himself reverted the situation.
Same applies to Perez. An even more dangerous rejoin than Gasly.
While we're at it Perez rejoined dangerously as well, he was just lucky that no cars were in his way
He locked up and was already heading off of the track independently of Sainz's contact.
Ocon crashed into Ocon? ;-)
right, if we’re taking consequences into account, sainz’s crash had less impact than both gasly’s and sargeants
Considering that theyre hesitant with Gaslys raceban, penalty points dont really matter
Fair. I googled before typing but I guess only read headlines. I knew about the time penalty, but not the license points. (I'm not in a good timezone for Australia, so I watched the race but not a lot of extra coverage and mostly skipped through time delays.) Yeah, Sargeant could get license points too. I think Gasly escapes because Ocon taking partial blame. I'm sure Carlos is upset about the time penalty not the license points though. They are his only two penalty points at the moment, so those two points don't really hurt him at all. Sargeant should be careful as a rookie if he gets them, but I think he'd be totally fine. Obviously, it would be a disaster for Gasly if he got two more. But, like I said, I think it's quite unlikely he'd get them.
Thanks for explaining how that works.
I wonder if the FiA won’t issue time penalties or license points if the other teams don’t argue it.  Aston argued , Alfa Tauri (DeVries) did not, and neither did alpine . Not sure if RB argued right away or if they were going to … but it appears that Sainz too out not only Alonso but also place Perez out of position…so does he deserve a penalty ? I would say yes.
3 places grid penalty*  But besides the number you are right
This is where the penalties get stupid. If a penalty doesn't hurt you, is it really a penalty? I would love the change to an or/or penalty. Like 5s penalty with a maximum of 3 and a minimum of 1 place penalty. Then it always hurts someone.  Also, I hate the stop-and-go. Why not just calculate it at the end?
Outcomes decide a penalty, it's how it often works in F1 yet it isn't politic correct to say it openly.
and ironically, at the end, the outcome didn't even matter, as they turned back the time and resetted the grid with Alonso on P3.
Gasly and Sargeant already got the biggest penalty there is: a DNF
People's view on whether it's fair or not changes depending on who is affected.   * Hamilton got a 10 second penalty for missing the apex and understeering into Max in Silverstone and [the general sentiment was that the FIA is biased because he should've gotten a Stop/Go penalty and a race ban.](https://old.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/oms89r/motorsport_week_horner_on_hamiltons_penalty/h5myvop/)  * Sainz gets a 5 second penalty for missing the apex and understeering into Alonso and Alonso spins out of a points position, yet the sentiment in this is case is that the penalty is too harsh.
He clearly meant that the stewards gave the punishment based on the outcome, not the action. Which they shouldn’t have.
It would be a race ban for the next race, and a grid pen for the race after actually lol
In that case, the stewards should never give in-race penalties, since the drivers don’t get to tell their side of the story.
I prefer to wait now than to wait for results post race.
Should they do this with all penalties then? Or is this one different, and if so, how?
I don’t think it’s a turn 1 issue, I think it’s because both said it was their fault and historically team crashes aren’t penalized the same
There's no new evidence in that. The stewards had no less relevant information than now when they decided to penalise Sainz but not Gasly.
> "Someone else got away with it" has nothing to do with how Sainz had contact with Alonso.    It absolutely does in terms of an appeal. Aston Martin literally did that in the previous race when they appealed with precedence. The FIA looked at three separate-but-similar incidents and judged all three differently. For an entity which says penalties are applied irrespective of outcome of the incident, that is a big deviation.
Aston literally did that in Jeddah though.
He drove forward past the line kind of like max didn't.
Nah Russell's is much worse lol. Even completely took him out of the race.   Doesn't mean Sainz' penalty wasn't deserved
I would love to know if he did lock up or not.  I've just watched Lando's twitch stream where he analysed the accident and while he says Carlos is to blame he insists he locked up. He freeze frames the action to show Carlos on a hard right lock but the car going straight ahead.   I don't know, but I'm inclined to put more faith in a racing driver's opinion than us random guys on Reddit.
Exactly, and he outbreaked himself and hit Alonso from behind. That is causing a collision which is 5 second. Exactly the same thing happened to Sainz by Russell in America which in my opinion was less worse because sainz then cut in very sharp. Russell got 5s penalty and Sainz complained it wasn't harsh enough...
Gasly's penalty really shouldn't have anything to do with who he collided with. He rejoined the track in an unsafe manner, regardless of if he had caused a collision or not.
I agree this is what the FIA does, but I don't agree with them doing it.  If Checo is still in WDC contention with two races to go and Max collides with him, taking him out of the race... No penalty? It'd be pure BS, just as Sargent not getting penalised is.
I am serious, it’s pointless laughing
Alonso is not afraid of the universe. The universe always leaves Alonso space.
I don’t recall how he came on - did he cause an accident?
> While we're at it Perez rejoined dangerously as well  More dangerously than Gasly in the initial phase, I'd even say.
Ericsson hit us
Which is stupid, the system is there for a reason, not for them them to suddenly have a change of heart. Unsafely rejoined the track, slam dunk penalty, points, ban. Get it over and done with.
Thanks for the correction. I was not sure if it was 3 or 5.
If it is true, then why did sainz get a penalty? Alonso got his place back
No there is bigger, there is next race penalties that can be applied.
Nope, Gasly's penalty would likely have been a race ban, due to his current penalty points.
DNF is not a penalty if you were the one that is causing it.
Wut? The difference is not "people hate Hamilton and love Sainz", the difference is that Sainz was on old cold tires, with strongly reduced visibility, on a track with virtually no grip, in effectively a L1 incident at very slow speeds with ultimately no consequences for the victim whereas Hamilton was none of those things and simply knocked his main rival out in one of the fastest corners on the calender with potentially massive consequences for the championship. It is absurd to pretend these are in any reasonable way identical incidents.  Hell, even Alonso, the victim here, said the penalty was too harsh. He didnt say that because he loves Sainz so much but because the penalty was too harsh. For reasons Alonso, Verstappen, Perez, Sainz and Leclerc all explained perfectly well.  I seriously don't get these 'spicy hot takes'.
I think the problem lies in that people take into account both the cause AND the effect, while the FIA only looks at the cause (with great inconsistency). With Silverstone the effect was that Verstappen was out of the race and Hamilton won even with the penalty.  With Nando vs. Sainz the cause was the same as Silverstone but the effect was eliminated by reverting to the starting grid before the incident, thus reducing the perception of people regarding the incident.
I think a lot of this comes from how time penalties are vastly different severities based on circumstances. Sainz basically got a race ban for this L1 incident, because a 5 second time penalty put him in last. Hamilton's 10 second penalty had absolutely no change on the outcome of the race, so it felt severely lacking. Time penalties are probably just the wrong way to go about issuing penalties, hard to say what it should be instead though.
Might have more to do with the actual, extremely predictable, impact of the penalty. Did those 10 sec Hamilton got effectively DQ him? Or did it have absolutely no impact on his race results whatsoever?  Note that I dont think Sainz' penalty was unfair. Just that it's obviously not about *who* is affected, and instead about the actual impact of the penalty. If they had 20 more laps with no SC, I guarantee that absolutely noone would argue that a 5 sec penalty was too harsh. People would probably say it was too light instead.
They always do. Tbh they should just remove this part from the rules. Punishment should always take in outcome as well as the action itself.
Well they were talking about Sargeant. But yeah, that would be the case in Gasly's situation.
I think the difference is the timing. If stewards give a 5  second penalty it is a minor punishment compared with others they could have given. They are giving the driver essentially 5 seconds to remake the place, in other words a punishment light enough that the driver has the ability to recover (at least some places) from.  Because the race finished with a lap under a safety car it was physically impossible for Sainz to recover any places and the effect of that was to give Sainz a far harder punishment than the 5 seconds the stewards thought he deserved.   Sainz's action deserved the five seconds punishment as it was  his fault.  What he didn't deserve was, in effect, to be booted to the back of the field. They might as well have disqualified him.  I imagine this is what Ferrari's protest is mostly about.  It's another case, like Abu Dhabi, where interventions at the arse end of a race need to be looked at differently.
Those two things should be irrelevant.
That's even worse, judging needs to be objective and impartial.
Aston pointed out that the interpretation of the rule was inconsistent with previous rulings. There are previous decisions where the FIA took the time that work started to be when the car was lifted by the jack, not in contact with it.  Punting someone off who is ahead of you in the first corner is a penalty. The fact that the stewards missed another backmarker collision doesn't change that.
If he had done then I think the sensors should have automatically picked it up, so it's possible (probable?) he wasn't, unless the sensors weren't working/activated for the restart but only applied at the original start.
It's pretty much the same move, just one was in control the whole time and the other has a slight excuse for going that wide.  There was no space for Alonso, Carlos barely managed to stay on track. And the outcome shouldn't influence the penalty that's what everyone always wants and now we don't?
Perez did the same, he was just lucky the drivers he pushed aside were more cautious of their surroundings.
Maybe not hit Alonso
Did they not penalize Sianz before announcing that Alonso was getting his place back?
> Hell, even Alonso, the victim here, said the penalty was too harsh. He didnt say that because he loves Sainz so much but because the penalty was too harsh.   I agree that the penalty was too harsh, but Sainz got quite a lot of hate in Spain after that incident, Alonso would've said that anyway to try and ease the tension.
> Punishment should always take in outcome as well as the action itself.  Why? The outcome is beyond your control - only the action is. We punish actions that are dangerous even if the outcome is nothing important, and we don't punish actions that are reasonable and safe even if something goes terribly wrong and the outcome is disastrous.
So he deserved the penalty but not the consequences. It is also the risk of ' elbows out ' in a two lap sprint race. It is harsh, but fair to the one he kicked out of the race. That is was red flagged, was lucky for Alonso but not something Sainz knew would happen at the start.
Precedents are literally the strongest form of evidence. Alonso got reinstated to P3 in the Saudi GP because they showed previous pitstops not being penalized the same way he did.
Completely disagree. Rulings should take into account exactly what happened, looking into all the circumstances, and should include recent precedents.
Please read what I wrote, this time slowly. Nowhere did I argue that Sainz's wasn't a penalty. I'm pointing out that Ferrari are challenging the inconsistency of the stewards decisions regarding the other 2 decisions - the same point you are also trying to make
But Perez was going at similar speeds relative to the cars around him whereas Pierre Gasly was much slower.
How? It’s a race incident like many others. Everyone else would hit alonso in this space and circumstance. How many penalty i should have seen in the last 25 years?
No they can receive a grid drop the next race. One example was Hungary 2021 for Bottas and Stroll.
Yes, you can. 3 places grid penalty next race is the equivalent for 5s time penalty in the race
Sure can. In fact a precedent was already at USA 2023 when Stroll took out Alonso in a similar fashion, receiving a direct 3 place grid penalty for the next race. These types of penalties do exist, its just the FIA's choice to use and enforce them or not.
Well the penalty points is key in this situation. Gasly has 10 out of 12 points. Had he been investigated and found he was mostly at fault for the accident in Australia, he would have also been given 2 more penalty points and been banned for the next race in Baku.  I think this is the reason Gasly wasn't investigated because they knew the investigation would result in a race ban for Gasly.
In an ideal world that is true. Punishment is also about justice though. And you need to make sure it isn’t rewarded. A driver can make a minor movement and hit someone slightly who then DNFs. Net win if the driver only gets a 5 second penalty for example. Outcome will always be factored in. In reality it already is that way, they just pretend they don’t do that.
Precedents are all over the place though
What you said is completely unrelated to what I said. The outcome is incidents is already disconnected from penalty rulings, and precedent is only used as a crutch for unclear and gray area rules. If the rules weren't ancient and applied arbitrarily, there would be no need to contest every penalty.
>It absolutely does in terms of an appeal. Aston Martin literally did that in the previous race  Reading your comment slower doesn't make it correct. The stewards/race director missing another incident isn't grounds for appeal, and that isn't what Aston Martin argued in theirs.
Aston Martin argued that the FIA gave a different decision to previous similar incidents. Ferrari can argue the FIA gave a different decision to a similar incident in the same race. The FIA didn't miss the Gasly incident, it was noted and dismissed.
Aston Martin argued that the information that had been provided to the stewards (That any touching of the car was work) was incorrect. They provided minutes of a recent meeting, and footage of previous incidents where the penalty time of the car had been calculated based on when it was lifted off the ground.  Both Alpine drivers claimed to be at fault/that it was a "racing incident". >Both cars recognised and accepted this as such.  I don't think that Alonso would claim he was at fault for Sainz hitting him.
Technically, what the drivers think for an incident should mean fuckall when it comes to a rule. The FIA didn't give a penalty purely because Gasly might get a race ban, there's no other reason for it. In any other situation, Gasly gets 2 points and no one bats an eye.

Teams are not going to want to have Parc Ferme during FP sessions, that kind of negates the entire idea of FREE practice.    And people think Sprint races are silly 😂😂😂
I can count the amount of fans who want the format of free practice to change on one hand. More specifically one fist. Because it's zero. Zero.
Practice is for the teams. It’s not meant to be and doesn’t need to be exciting.   No one turns up to a any other sports training sessions and expects to be entertained. Imagine if someone said let’s give a premier league team an extra point for players doing skills in training. Or let’s knock a shot off a golfer’s round for playing the best trick shot on the driving range. Anyone proposing these ideas would be laughed out of town.   Why does F1 and some F1 fans think we need any of this?
God no. No points for practice and especially no park ferme making fp2 pointless
I cringed reading this.
It's very unclear what problem this would address? It adds a lot of organizational complexity, is probably difficult to follow especially for newer fans, impairs the normal procedure and purpose of a free practice session (setting up the car), so given all the costs I would expect it to correct some issue. What's wrong with just giving points for the race, as has long been done?
Stop inventing.
Slowest teams would risk everything get get points from mini sectors then. Completely sacrificing the turn at the start and the end of the sector they focus on. Sounds very dull and damgerous to me.
It’s not even been a week since the last race. I look forward to the posts coming at the end of this break
This is the worst thing I've ever read.
no, we are good we fake stuff
Or a simple solution instead could be that FP1 is a mandated Junior driver session. This reduces time for the teams to hone their set ups and do race sims. They can get the junior drivers to do it but the feedback and learning just won't be the same as the race drivers so their runs plans will be somewhat compromised regardless. This also makes it potentially easier for younger new talents to break into F1 since they actually get more seat time and a chance to impress. In particular im thinking those that would do well in F1 but dont have the funding to pay for private tests or end up in the best F2/F3 seats in order to break into F1. A young driver could get over 20 outings in a season to show what they can do to the teams, and the fans. And then these Young drivers come into the sport well prepared. Remember when unlimited testing was allowed, drivers came into the sport and hit the ground running (Hamilton is a good example) and then the big teams may be more inclined to take a punt on a rookie. This seems like a real simple solution, we still get the same amount of track running for the fans (and sponsors etc) at the track. It reduces some of the prep time for the teams so introducing a little more unpredictability for the races and F1 becomes more accessible to potential new drivers.
How about FP1 on Friday, followed by qualifying for the Sunday GP.  Saturday you have a qualifying for sprint instead of FP3, followed by a sprint race.  This keeps something important in each session/day.
Points for punctuality
As someone who has F1TV pro and listens to their commentary, Free Practice is perfect as is.      Gives the commentators time to talk about other stuff, have some banter, do some technical insights, discuss the week, etc. It's really fun to watch/listen to! (personal opinion, don't hate me, I know it's not for everyone)     If they make that into something competitive, we'd lose that!      I will agree that some commentators in other languages are ehm "way less interesting" lets say.   (F1TV lets you switch languages/commentaries, and some are so boring, or even plain wrong a lot of the time)      edit: And as you said in one of your negatives, Top teams will pick up the points, and a team like Red Bull will be world champion even sooner than before (and have a greater lead sooner too), how does that make it more interesting to watch the races? - Imho, it doesn't.
Why is it that in f1 people think the rules have to change all the time. Why aren't there posts like the on the soccer sub? Like: I think it would be a good idea to give the audience at soccer matches a button to vote with which player has to leave the field every ten minutes. That would make soccer much more exciting for the people!! Good idea, right?  Or tennis: let's make the tennis ball a different size every game. That's much more exciting. Especially because the opponent does 't know what size ball the other will use. Such great ideas I have, haven't I?!! Or every player gets a chance to invite someone from the audience to play one point instead of the player himself. Good for audience engagement and exciting! More exciting than just watching the game with their lame rules.  At baseball I have the idea to introduce points for balls that are in the air longer than 5 seconds. And give points when a ball hits the ground before the other team grabs and throws it. And I suggest to put some baskets between each base and if the attacking team manages to hit the ball near a teammate he can grab that ball while running to the next base and throw it in the basket. If he does so the defending team gets a point deducted. Very very exciting!!! I've got some more ideas for other pretty boring sports if you guys are interested. Cause I am hyper intelligent, thought a lot about these rules and stuff and I am not afraid at all to be called out as a dumb mf that should just go and piss off. I have been told any times my ideas are dumb, but I don't care. I still making them public, because I just know it's the best thing for the particular sport. Like OP.
I don't get it. Why does Free Practice need to be "saved"? I don't want more fake drama pumped into my sports. NHL hockey has already put in so many dumb rules for Americans to make it feel more exciting and I really don't want to see f1 go more down this path than it already has
Right, it's basically a lesser of two evils compared to a sprint weekend where they are going to remove a free practice session anyway with the new weekend rules.   Or, we don't need to have parce ferme for FP2, who knows.
I was looking at this in terms of a sprint weekend (saving Friday practice) vs. a plan like I proposed. We're probably not that far away from half the weekends in F1 having just one free practice.
I'm working under the assumption F1 most definitely wants something on Friday's.   I realize a lot of fans don't agree (and to me I'm mostly in this camp too, I'm fine with FP1 and FP2 as is) and if so that's fine.
No points for practice, points for the minisector battle after practice.
Why?
The "problem" in this case would be my boy Stefano pushing for fewer free practices in favor of something else on Friday's, with many drivers on the grid, including the president of the GPDA, admitting they don't really need more than one practice.   It was a solution to acquiesce both sides in a pretty simple and straight forward manner.
Sounds like a really interesting layer of strategy to a weekend!
And surprisingly the bar is going into the ground more and more. The amount of shit I have seen here is just unbelievable.
Hot laps = fake
Interesting idea!
This is the format that will be used at each sprint weekend starting at Baku when they return from this break.
I personally love free practice.  But it seems like a lot of people don’t realize how much change the sprint weekends are doing to practices on weekends or aren’t paying attention F1’s push to get rid of practice in general.
F1 rules change all the time! It’s quite literally one of the things that has defined F1 during its entire existence. Every single year the rules change.  In fact, over the course of 4 days they just changed the rules and wiped out 6 more sessions of free practice for this season.
Sorry, correction they're removing 2 free practices during sprint weekends\*
Ah so something even more pointless.
That was my point.
Sigh...sure buddy, you know it all and I am wrong. Nice of you to point out to me that rule changes are part of the sport. You know what...I'll give you the only answer you want to hear: Your idea is fantastic! It will surely be picked up by the FIA when you tell them. Go ahead man. Tell the Fia about your fantastic new idea to spice things up. I am sure they'll see you're an expert on this sport. Probably you have seen at least 3 races and two including the practice sessions, so you're really qualified to propose genius ideas. Yes, I am wrong. You are the one with the best rule changing ideas. Here you go.
Even more pointless than what?
Okay, but many don’t want to get rid of so many free practices which was the point of my proposal.   The new sprint weekend format is better than last year, I agree about that.
Sitting in the garage running simulations figuring out a setup to use for fp2 and instead  be locked into some random ass setup for some random ass lap hoping to get mini sector points.
But if you are awarding points, it's no longer free practice.  So if you are effectively scraping free practice, why not add an extra qualifying session and race.
Okay. So take away parc ferme so teams can run those sweet sweet FP2 simulations. Not a deal breaker in the least to me.
It’s not effectively scrapping free practice though. Substituting a qualifying session is scrapping free practice.  Again, the goal is *not* to scrap free practice. Only to offer something worthwhile and quick *after* practice on a Friday.
What is the point of this thing? Fast cars are faster than slow cars, so we end up giving more points to fast cars.
But if points are on offer, it's not "free" practice. Free implies that teams are free to use it however they want without penalty, if you are going to make points available it's suddenly not free practice anymore.
Maybe, maybe not.
At no point during free practice 2 would points be available.
>Why not reduce FP2 to 45 minutes then each driver gets one out lap and one hot lap only for a chance at some points.  That's a complete contradiction to your very first sentence of the original post.  It clearly states that during FP2 (i.e. **Free Practice 2**) a chance at some **points**.
Maybe I wasn’t clear.   At the conclusion of FP2 the cars return to the pits. We can have a small break. Afterward, teams bolt on soft tires and the hot lap session begins.   Not randomly putting soft tires on cars during FP2 and asking them to do a hot lap for some points.
Love these videos but they gotta upload to YouTube. No one is going to their site to watch these videos.
Yup they've abandoned their YouTube channel and I can't figure out a logical reason why they would do that
i know nothing but I’m guessing they moved it to their site since YouTube currently gets very low views for them. Vowles seems to be beefing up the marketing department and I’d guess they’d go back when the fan base builds back
I have no idea I think it's to claim more traffic to come to their site but I never watch any of their content unless it's on Instagram or someone has uploaded it to Twitter.
YouTube is one of the best advertisers out there and the common idea has historically been to market on other platforms then transition them into your website, not the other way around.

What happens if two drivers want to serve their penalty on the same lap?
Teams already have an incentive to not let their eagerness spill over into not serving the pentalty correctly. This is a solution in search of a problem.
Or they just don't touch the car while it's in the pit box. Seems pretty easy to me.
Why? What’s wrong with the current system?
Something similar happened when electronically monitored jump-start stop-go penalties were first issued in 1995: the cars would queue right at the end of the pit lane with a countdown timer, instead of in their team's pitbox.  I believe that penalties were also served this way beforehand, but they were less common.  Edit: This video includes footage of Barrichello and Panis trying to serve such a penalty on the same lap: https://youtu.be/a2O_qw6Y-3s.
Ridiculous
If two drivers have to serve it in the same lap it's a mess though, the one that comes in the puts behind must wait according to this system.
My first thought is the weight bridge is probably not designed to stand up to full beans launches off of it.
Nope
No.
Whatever happened to drive through penalties?
And what if someone stalls their car?
Interesting idea, bit it's not necessary and the current system works fine.
Just draw a line right at the exit of the garage. All mechanics stand behind it, and when 5 seconds go, serve the car. Like WEC pitstops
The point of receiving a penalty is that you assume all responsibility. It is not up to the FIA to enforce, apply and provide the tools for you.   An F1 team should be able to handle and serve a penalty by themselves.
Why not just have a time clock or light attached to the pit box rig?
Another idea: All time penalties will simply be added to the final time at the end of the race and the positions adjusted accordingly. It's a time penalty, add it to the final time and be done with it.
But then your gonna have to allow someone to be near the car with cooling fans to blow cool air so that brakes etc don't catch fire (they can do this now in the pit box just as long as they don't touch the car). The problem then still remains because what if a mechanic with a fan touches the car in this penalty box?
I can see this working but only for stop and go penalty where teams aren't allowed to touch the car
On one side it’s stupid because it doesn’t allow for drivers that are close to each other serve the penalty at the same time (especially after first laps probable) and on the other side it is also stupid because the weighbridge would get fucked if a running car were to roll onto it. If teams are incapable of not touching a car for exactly 5 seconds, then they deserve another penalty, case closed.
What about letting the teams serve the penalty after they've done work on the car?
No, you can’t post an obvious problem that takes all of 10 seconds to find. OP just wants a start a “discussion.”
We are checking.
First come first served.
>What happens if two drivers want to serve their penalty on the same lap?  Stop inventing!
That's a non-issue, the team would/should radio to the driver if it is occupied so they can just pit 1 lap later.
Fair point! I guess double stacking!
Those are more severe because it is a guaranteed 18-20s time loss vs a 5 second penalty usually being allowed at a pit stop OR tacked on to race time at the end
So you've now made a five second penalty into a 10 second one.  How long will it take the mechanics that are working on the far side of the car to start their work?  If you have to serve it while pitting you'll be penalized twice as much as if it gets tacked on at the end of the race.
This is my fave suggestion so far.
This is such an incorrect take. You are trolling right?
…..if that penalty is served during the race, 5 seconds still pass. It usually doesn’t make a difference and is usually worse due to lost track position than just adding it at the end of the race. Unless you get a lucky Safety Car but that’s just luck
We're talking 5-second penalties here. By the time someone starts talking their penalty, the driver behind them will be in the pit stop entry with no chance to get out.
"Stay out, stay out, stay out." Yeah, we've never seen how that message can still come too late for a driver:)  And pitting 1 lap later could further mess up their strategy, which makes the penalty harsher for one driver than the other.
What if there's a Safety Car and multiple cars with penalties only have 1 lap where they can pit?
Essentially doubling the second driver's penalty. Genius!
That is actually a reasonable take and you're just being rude.
You're talking to F1 here, where almost every rule is up for interpretation and can be bent depending on how good of friends you are with the FIA, how much you suck up to them, if it was an accident or not, and whether or not the FIA failed to enforce the rules in the past meaning they don't enforce the rules in the present.  F1 has the most inconsistent enforcing of rules out of any sport ever invented.    I laughed so hard when Ocon got 15 seconds worth of penalties for the exact same thing Alonso did, but Alonso pointed out that the FIA failed to penalize others for breaking the rule, so he shouldn't be penalized for breaking the rule either 😂
If they really want to increase the impact of penalties increase it to 10s or whatever. But there should be a fucking common standard of such measurement rather than each team out there timing it and then the FIA monitoring. Where's the transparency to us as an audience if a penalty was served correctly or not?  We are supposed to trust the nincompoops at the FIA with this timing? Don't think so, seeing the shambolic officiating at Melbourne and other races too.
Not that I want to defend this idea but teams would know beforehand which drivers have penalties and could tell their driver to stay out as soon as the other comes in. Same situation as a 'box opposite'.
Yeah, if the team messes up, it goes bad. Who would've thought... I'm not saying this is a good idea, i'm against this, but this is not a good argument against it.   A real argument would be the inevitable unsafe releases that would happen, because the weighbridge box doesn't have a lollipop guy that can look if the track is clear.
Don't pit
Sucks if you slow car lol
How is it NOT the responsibility of the governing body to enforce penalties?  In hockey, a player doesn't goto the bench when they get a penalty, they got to the penalty box. And the team doesn't time them and release them, the officials do.
So, the second car that has a penalty now also gets fucked by the fact they can't pit under SC? Seems reasonable, yea.
Or fast car behind someone you were about to lap on the track
They do enforce it. If a team doesn’t serve it correctly, they get another penalty. This is not difficult to understand.
With no judgement of OPs solution....Does FIFA or the EPL allow teams to enforce penalty kicks judged against them?? "Ahhh shoot, it's a penalty? We'll be sure to allow them to take it against us at a time of our choosing. Wink wink"
People always get fucked by safety cars. The leader can lose a 30sec lead due to safety car. There are plenty of good arguments against this idea, but this ain't one, stop inventing
Yes. It's the player's responsibility to make sure the ball is in the penalty spot.
> People always get fucked by safety cars. The leader can lose a 30sec lead due to safety car.  That's not a reason to add more things that will fuck people...  What the fuck's that logic, mate?

Its easy to forget just how rich Toto is.
The Wolff of Wall Street
How did Toto first get initially rich? Before buying the Mercedes f1 team
Good for him. I have about €52 in my account so you could say Toto and I are prettyyyy similar
So, he'll try to deny it—but I just found out that Toto Wolff **is** my *real* dad. **(Raises hand)** I have the papers, I have them printed out!
Weird to realise Toto is the more successful clone between him and Arnold.
And it would be $1,000,000,386  had he not broken that headset.
3 comma club, nice.
When Toto told Horner that he had it printed out he was talking about his heavy stacks. Call him the Federal Reserve, he prints money.
So much pumpernickel
Tres comas!
TIL I’m in a different tax bracket than Toto
I think becoming a millionaire would be cool.   I can’t imaging becoming a billionaire.   Congratulations is all I can say  Now add 1/5 second and get this year going.
That’s the difference between being an owner vs an employee like Horner, although I’m sure Christian sleeps just fine at night with his tens of millions, plus all those spice girls royalty checks🤷🏻‍♂️
He can finally hang in Briatores club for billionaires
That’s 1000 million. A million one thousand times over. Fuck
Toto was in private equity before he fully committed to F1. So I'd say he knows a thing or two about making money.
You gotta be a real sicko to keep going to work after you hit $1B
Susie a lucky lady for many reasons
Well, time to eat him I suppose
Thats a lot of Pumpernickel
Aw man…. I guess that means Toto is in line for the guillotine.
Must be nice
Jeebus
What a fever dream.
Is Toto one of the hardest working billionaires? He's traveling almost everywhere around the world with the team, he's got long hours, he has to answer for the teams performance and the scrutineering from the media. Sure, he doesn't actually do physical labor, but compared to what other billionaires do, he's gotta be one of the most active. It's kinda surprising to see someone have a job that's not that glamorous to be as rich as he is.
He should buy me a merc
I thought he was already a billionaire😅.
what the rich guy sport has a bunch of rich guys in it? surprised Pikachu face
if they are reporting it now, probably cracked it long ago in reality
This means he can afford to smash as many headsets as he wants! My card got declined when I tried to buy a pack of socks.
jesus, a billion is so much fucking money
Clearly the result of the cost cap. Can't dump money into the team so he had to stack it in his own bank account. /s
I wanna be a team principle.
I’m surprised it took him this long, I would’ve assumed he already was one, considering he owns so much of the racing team.
"No Michael No... that's sooo cheap ...I am TOOOTALLY balling out"...
I guess he can afford good catering now.
Pretty sure he can thank DTS (in part) for this. The "fights" between him and Horner are hilarious.
The real reason Horner is salty.
Are we supposed to be happy about this?
Man in F1 is rich??? No way!
Good for him. With some luck I’ll maybe crack 10k euros on my bank account next 27th of the month.
Too much money for one man. Atleast in a world where people are starving. That is unless you are planning use the funds to make the world a better place.
This is why Toto and I don’t get along. Not comfortable at all with wealth hoarding
Disgusting. 🤮
I have a strong dislike for all billionaires. You don't become a billionaire by being a nice thoughtful person.
Even with all das pümpernickel?
Thought he had multiple billions. Hopefully he gets out of the middle class soon enough.
And here am I needing 3 jobs to barely make ends meet fml
And this is the guy who is most vocal about no new teams in F1, because he owns a decent chunk of Merc.   Teams shouldn't have any say in the matter given they signed the Concorde agreement. It should solely be up to the FIA and F1 to figure out.
jail
Gross
From family not being able to afford his school to billionaire.
Yeah where did the budget cap go?
self-made to boot (AFAIK) - pretty damn impressive!
Guy never loses
No wonder the car sucks.
How do you run an F1 team and have time to become a billionaire?   Guessing it's just from his previous investment company just ticking over?
Somewhere Horner is fuming.
Nice.
I am tired of Arnold Spock
I thought he was under investigation for insider trading?! Maybe I am wrong or maybe he has been found not guilty of it. I have not kept up with it.
That’s so exciting
Toilets. He makes the toilets. They sing, and if you’re good they will spray a nice refreshing stream of water up your butt hole.
1 billion mark? Or 1 billion Deutche mark? Ey? Ey? 🤣
Makes sense, he worked at the bank in Warsaw
Looks like Cost Cap is working
Wtf I had no idea he was that rich.
On Gunther’s birthday
Yeah, but was Forbes in touch with him to put him on the billionaires list?
What do you even do with all that money...
Guess that AMR share got a good boost
Damn
Considering he got into F1 by buying enough shares in Williams, when they were publicly traded, that he got a seat at the board, i wouldn't say so. He was worth close to half a billion back then and looking at Mercedes, the team, profitability with his 33% stake
TIL Toto Wolf is ultra wealthy. I had no idea he's that rich
is it really?
Yet yours and my net worth is closer to Toto's than Toto's is to the net worth of Musk, Bezos, Gates, etc of the world. It's beyond imagination how rich those people are.
Err, in what way?
lol, really... hes 1/3 owner of the mercedes works team, hes not an employee.
Why?
Wolff of Pit Lane?
Working in finance, hedge fonds management I think
Watch the Nico Rosberg interview with him. He goes in great detail how he build his wealth.
investment banker, venture capitalists for Austrian IT companies since before dot-com bubble (if you played games in early 2000s, he funded the company that published the Gothic series, JoWood) - he also had majority ownership of HWG which ran Mercedes DTM entries before buying into Williams and later moving to Mercedes besides also as running a driver management company together with Häkkinen.
He has a hit song about the rains down in Africa.
He was an investor before joining F1.
He usually leaves out the part where he got born into considerable wealth.
He once had to dress up as the ~~chicken guy for a fast food chain~~ It was actually an electronics chain and he had to wear a costume with a cape!
Apparently he straight up stole and muscled out a Startup founder and rode the profits all the way to the bank iirc
He bought like a 50% share in Williams when they were publically traded and it went up
He underwent training as a banker and was able to invest his own money in the dotcom bubble. His fund was called marchfifteen and marchsixteen i think.
Before buying the F1 team I guess he tapped Susie
I remember his dad died when Toto was still in school and he already needed to make his own money to pay university (and his racing hobby).
You, me and him combined are worth 1 billion+
I am closer to having 10 million dollars in my bank acc compared to him
i’ve been reading this same joke in reddit for 12 fucking years
Yeah you and toto are really close in wealth when you compare toto to bezos or musk, for example.
I’m sorry this is Reddit. Billionaires are leeches and nothing else.
If you round up to the nearest billion I too have a billion dollars
Fix your current ****** father
yeah dude, I recall you saying something like that on Team radio.
He doesn't like papers, but prefers emails. Did you get my email dad?
Arnold's apparently worth half a bill.  Not too shabby.
From Romanian Father and Polish mother ;) He was born in Austria.
He drives cars with doors that open like _this_ or like _this_ but not like **this**
Tres Comas!!!
He can finally buy a n orange McLaren!!
Lmao damn that’s savage
My tequila brand is tres comas!, it can’t be dos comas!
Yes, you pay a higher percentage 😋
Once you become a millionaire you only have roughly a billion to go!
Horner is part owner of RBPT though.
My word is that a disgusting scene to imagine...   Flavio naked... Shudders
the first mil is always the hardest /s
a million seconds are 11 days, a billion seconds are 31 years…
I think most people, myself included, can't actually get our heads around this. We often through millionaires and billionaires into the same category. But it's just insanely more.
I said the same thing to my girl. I'm like how can you travel 250 days a year for work, and grind. When you're worth $500M+?  Then I thought, these guys, sitting on a beach or a yacht is like punishment. They need to be IN it. Involved. Contributing. They're just a different breed. And you have to be to be successful in F1 as well as all the other successful businesses he's involved in.
I’m convinced Toto got Vowles the Williams gig and is using it to test/train Vowles to takeover Merc starting 2026, with Toto stepping back into the chairman roll and Lewis retiring
No, not really. Half the reason a lot of these more or less self made men are where they’re at is because of their passion for whatever they’re focusing on. You may dislike working, but to a lot of these guys it is their hobby, it’s what they live for. You’ll likely never see people like Toto ever stop, and when they do, they tend to die pretty fast. Just a different perspective on life. Even if he wasn’t drowning in money he’d still probably have the same tendencies.
For me just staying doing nothing is actually pretty boring i need to work or push myself to learn new things to enjoy the world, probably it’s the same for him he has to get involved in something and not just stay still. But i am no near a billion net worth
Nah. I’m not a billionaire, nowhere close, but I could stop working today and probably live alright until I die. No way I’ll do it. I love my job, why stop doing it? Vacations are fun but I’ll go crazy if I do that more than a week or two at a time.  Wolff seems like one of those guys made for their job. Do you think he’ll be content sitting at home building wooden chairs, or going fishing every weekend? No way.
Not to go all Socialist in the F1 sub. But, this is what people miss in the conversations about things like UBI. They say, "If people get UBI/welfare they won't work!" But, really, it would just make people less likely to do degrading shit work. People would instead want to do work they found fulfilling and happiness in doing.   People want to do work they find joy in, not many people will find any fulfillment in sitting around and doing nothing for years on end.
I’d imagine he enjoys the competitiveness and exposure of being a high profile F1 team principle. Most rich people buy into F1 for that reason. I’d imagine he also has a feeling of responsibility, wary about the fortunes of the team and it’s employees if he just gave up and let someone else who might not be as good run it
Or you know enjoy your work?
Was probably easier to justify when Merc were dominating
He ain't "working-working" like us. He's just living or retired. It just happens that his passion project has insane value due to the recent F1 boom. Like if I ever opened up a brewery and became a multi-millionaire, I wouldn't really be working. But you bet youre ass I'm going to be on the floor and just having fun at that point.
Most self made rich folks can’t sit still.
Running an entire f1 team doesn't seem like a job you do only to make money. You could work a whole less stressful job with the knowledge and experience you have if being an f1 boss was an option , by doing something else. Given he's raced, he's been doing it so long, hes been involved with multiple teams, and his wife is even involved is pretty telling that this is more than just an "ugh, I don't wanna go to work! My 9-5 sucks, why do I need to have a job?" kind of job
There's guys out there. If you gave them an axe in a forest, they would keep working until they had chopped down every last tree.
So many rich guys buy into F1 teams for fun. Toto has gotten to do that while making money. Win win.  I know rich people who don’t work and unfortunately they’re pretty miserable. Not having a purpose isn’t as great as it sounds
He probably does it because he likes it, not for money.
Susie is great though, it's what she deserves. Plenty of people want to marry rich, most end up with gross older partners that don't respect them and the relationship is transactional. To marry a person that respects her, he's hot, tall, nice and he's a billionaire apparently? Yeah that's rare.
He got that Austrian hog
He definitely pumps her nickel
🤣🤣🤣
[Mmmm](https://streamable.com/e/2apm9)
no generational wealth/nepotism, although being a billionaire is still unethical this is like one of the only times they’ve actually just succeeded from working hard
I don't think it's possible to become a billionaire and not be hard working, despite what us poor people like to think about them
As much as reddit hatee him elon probably is
A job that’s not glamorous… lol wtf you on?
Toto wasn’t dumping any of his own money into the team. His wealth is based on the worth of his share in the company. Pretty sure Mercedes have always been able to fund the team through the parent company and sponsorship.
Team principle isn't where he's made the majority of his money.  But me too, I want to be a principle too lolol
He owns 1/3 of the Mercedes racing team
Principal not principle. Knowing the difference is the first step toward that $billion.
CEO
Never understood this argument. What is he supposed to do? Sell his shares in Mercedes F1? You don’t become a billionaire by hoarding wealth. You do by creating something very successful and having an ownership in it.
You also don't become Formula 1 WDC by being nice.  To be successful, you need to be aggressive.
And??
Bro his mother was a doctor and while doctors are not rich rich but still comfortable enough to send their children to proper school and shit
Except in formula 1 for 3 seasons in a row
He's not even close
Horner is an employee, toto is the boss
His wife maybe. Horner aint that loaded.
Horner became a billionaire 3 tenths faster.  -Helmut Marko
Ginger herself is worth about $600M. So putting them together, I would say they are atleast close.
He's also got shares in Aston Martin that massively went up from Bahrein on out.   I think that's questionable but he's definitely real good with money
Paging /u/commaHorror
But it's easy to forget about that because it's rarely mentioned, so saying it's easy to forget how rich he is makes perfect sense....
How did he get enough money to buy a board seat (through shares).  Does he come from money or sell a business?
Basically anyone who is named in the F1 teams are really wealthy in their own right. Toto just has made some particularly smart moves. In fact, I feel like it surprises people more that he once raced too.
He owns 1/3 of PETRONAS Mercedes Benz AMG Formula 1 team, he was always rich.   The ownership breakdown is in the title PETRONAS, Malaysian Oil company, Mercedes, enormous Mega corporation and Formula 1, that's Toto. Sharing 1/3 of your major asset with an oil company makes a man rich rich let alone his savvy investments.   He was smart enough to get into a lot of things on the ground level. It's why Lance Armstrong whilst a disgrace is quietly living and not giving a fuck he invested in Uber in the opening stages and he's stupidly rich.
not at all. he always has a boss vibe compared other team leads, who are quite apparently just managers hired by the team
I'd say it's easy to forget just how much one billion is.  People remember that Stroll Sr is a billionaire for example, big fucking deal, he's rich so what. Verstappen for example is also rich, no? After all, he can afford a private jet, so they must be comparable!  Well, Verstappen is reported to make $55M a year right now, and Stroll Sr. has a net worth of ~$3.6B.  It would take Max over **65 YEARS** of continuously earning that salary to catch up with Stroll Sr (if you disregard any kind of investment gains, which also work in favour of the billionaire).
no.
Depends if you’re looking at it from an orders of magnitude, or an absolute value point of view. Orders of magnitude, Toto is about as far from the top ten billionaires than a person with a net worth of 10M, which is still 10x what a well off middle class person might have mid career.
No it isn't.
Probably because the other team principals are nowhere near as wealthy.
Before that it was selling candles
The Wolff of Wall Strasse?
Private equity actually. Tech focused PE funds during the dot com boom and his second fund launched during the bottom of the market in 2001 to be more specific.
It's a bit peculiar, he wasn't very wealthy or even schooled in finance and then all of a sudden when he is like 25 he comes into a boatload of money and creates two finance institutions.  It's a bit weird....
No, start-ups. He was just starting his career in finance at the beginning of first dot com rising, smart enough to recognize opportunity. Then invested that money in F1 team (Williams). Somebody below linked the interview where he explains in detail
Rosberg is also one of the richest ex drivers, he negotiated stupidly good contracts and he invests in random shit now days.
Any link
tldr?
Holly shit Toto was the one that took away so many hours of my life playing Ghotic.
Take my upvote and get outta here.
They all do.
They might have been rich for his early years but he was kicked out of private school at 14 for not being able to pay school fees. His father being unable to work for 10 years due to brain cancer greatly affected their finances.
That's usually how private equity sharks operate. Seen it so many times it's disgusting.
You gotta research waiter Susie she stole it all
Kind of like when Kobe Bryant scored 81 points and Kwame Brown had that quote “Yeah me and Kobe dropped 82 combined.”
Add me to that list as well.
In absolute terms, yes. In relative terms, there’s 7-8 orders of magnitude between you and Toto, and two orders of magnitude between him and Bezos/Musk
No, no..that was so not right, **(slams budget PC headset)** he needs to reinstate himself as my father!
Pretty sure his father was ethnic German from Romania - Transylvania (during the communism most Germans left/ran away or were sent to gulags), cause Wolff doesn't sound anywhere remotely Romanian. Am from Romania
🤲🏻 not like this 🫲🏻🫱🏻

These ARE the doors of a billionaire, Richard!!
Came looking for this one
This guy
Heidi Klum of all people had a baby with him, that he denied from birth. She was raised and adopted by Seal. She was doing him charity work and he decided to deny his own kid
Puts shit into perspective
And then, even between billionaires. I remember seeing an interview with Marc Cuban at some point talking about this, and how Steve Ballmer (Clippers owner) was worth 20x more than him.
Running an F1 team is a passion. If any of them ever wake up and dread going to work it's time to move on
I thought you were saying your girl has 500M😬
Yeah, the guys like Toto are ridiculously hypercompetitive.   It's frankly probably better for everyone that he works out those competitive urges on the race track rather than becoming someone like Musk, Zuck, Gates, etc. who are pretty much monsters (maybe rehabbing their image in retirement, if applicable).  He's not working because he has to. He's working because he wants to and it gives him a bigger high than he got being a finance guy.   He said early on he didn't plan to stay long, and yet here we are, 10+ years later and he's still the guy in charge. He's 100% addicted to F1. And he's probably done way less harm (and made way less money) than if he'd kept on as a businessman.
Yeah you don’t go to work for the money at $1B+ lol.   I’d imagine you love what you’re doing and/or just live to compete, and would be bored lying on a beach somewhere.
I think you're right, easy to imagine that there would be a big, cavernous emptiness on the otherside of quitting for these guys. Probably need something important to replace the F1 lifestyle with, more time with family or a new project.
These people are addicted to the feeling of success and they pursue greatee kicks all the time.
Apparently Newey came up with the double diffuser on the beach in Dubai
Toto has talked about his depression struggles and burnout. he nearly quit in 2020 but he’s worked to form healthier relationships with working. Toto was the main push for the winter shutdown period they introduced
Yeah, he made money by working, he isn't necessarily working to make money.
They're worth a lot because they created companies that the world values a lot.
Yeah. I have that itch. If it’s something I’m passionate about, I literally can’t stop. I feel terrible when I’m not productive.      I’m not wealthy like these guys, but I have tried to slow down for my wife and kids. It’s really damn hard.      I re-directed to a career path instead of entrepreneurship, 31 now, became a Director at 27, Senior Director at 29.
Y'all are a pretty serious crowd in here.  I just came to call Toto a sicko like I always do.  My apologies, I'll take it elsewhere.
Why would you find it that hard? Seriously asking.   I’m someone who’s work their ass off for a number of years and sadly I will have to for a long while. I’d love for that not to be the case. There’s so much of life and the world you give up on when you spend most of your time and energy on work. E.g. I love music and would love to learn more instruments, music production, maybe form a band and play some gigs. Or just not having time to read. Travel. Learn languages. Learn a gazillion new things. There’s enough to the world for many lifetimes, why do you think you’d hate it?
Not to go all political, but unfulfilling jobs are still needed. I’d love to be a musician, but I don’t have the talent of the greats, so I had to do something else. I don’t hate it, but it’s not my source of happiness. Society still needs plumbers, waiters, office jobs, whatever you don’t find particularly romantic, and for a big chunk of them it won’t be fulfilling.
If you read up on it all you’d realize you’re entirely wrong, he struggled with depression for years. he’s been in treatment for awhile and nearly quit in 2020 as a result. He was struggling to keep going and planned to quit when his contract expired.
Uh what? He’s definitely working. He travels half the year at minimum. And he’s away from his kid.
You think a team principal isn’t working? Interesting take
They type of people who are the reason why we're doomed.
A person that can't find a purpose without working is just very dull.
Yeah I’m absolutely all for it! He’s just as lucky to have her as well
(also Ms Stoddart was already rich when she met Toto)
Got a hog on em, b
( ͡⁠°⁠ ͜⁠ʖ⁠ ͡⁠°⁠)
I’m going to imagine a heavy dose of exploitation went into Wolff’s billion as well
Elon runs around Twitter chewing on wires, he absolutely is not hardworking
the guy spends all his time tweeting
Lol no, elon is just the "idea guy", he doesnt do actual work outside of doing a bad job as twitter CEO
Eh, maybe. I was thinking that, he does own quite a few large companies. But I don't think he puts too much stress on himself with travel and meetings and the general public. He kinda just fucks around and sees what he can do with all his dough. Now, Elon is worth 190 Billion, compared to just cracking 1 billion, so proportionally dollars to work, he might do more work per billion.   And now I'm sad seeing how rich some people are.
>	What is he supposed to do? Sell his shares in Mercedes F1?  Sure  Why are you booing me I’m right
[There were some years my father barely made 100 grand. Well maybe 100 grand but the maid only came twice a week...at 1:20 LOFL](https://youtu.be/wh_eO2QoeCM)
Bro, he literally said his mother couldn’t afford school fees.  But when he was 12 and his sister was nine, they were removed from the school. "We were taken out of class because the school fee wasn’t paid," he said. "Unfortunately, your school fees haven’t been paid for a long time so please pack your bags and go home.  "So, I needed to go back to class to pick up my bags and the humiliation of packing your bag because your school fees weren’t paid.  [Interview Link](https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/16974841/toto-wolff-hamilton-grand-prix-mercedes-f1/amp/)  Yes his mother was a doctor but she was a widow and had to raise them alone.
3? They won the 2021 constructor's title thats where the money is.
Press F for doubt
As far as I remember, the shares he has in Aston are the road car company not the racing team company. So separate entities.
> I think that's questionable  I don't see how. The restructuring of Aston is WAY deeper than just renaming the Racing Point F1 team.   It would be unethical to sandbag Merc so Aston had more chances (And jesus, the "x-gate" that could be), but I think Lewis pretty much said everything that needed to be said on the track last week.
Massively went up? They're 25% down this month alone. 32% over 1 year... 95% down over 5 years...
The shares are down not up lol
He was in finance before f1
The car company, not the race team.
>I think that's questionable but he's definitely real good with money  Last I heard he and stroll are under investigation for insider trading. Something about a phone call about Mercedes investing in Aston Martin, toto bought in and Merc I think did as well.   Iirc it was 2020 or 2021 when it happened.
It’s not bad though?  Take it sentence by sentence.   >Considering he got into F1 by buying enough shares in Williams, when they were publicly traded, that he got a seat at the board, i wouldn’t say so.  “When they were publicly traded” is a nonessential clause, and thus is properly delineated with commas. “Considering he got into F1 by buying enough shares in Williams that he got a seat at the board, i wouldn’t say so.” is a perfectly fine sentence.   >He was worth close to half a billion back then and looking at Mercedes, the team, profitability with his 33% stake  Again, “the team” is a nonessential clause. The only problem with this sentence is that possessives are weird with clauses like this, so instead of choosing between “Mercedes’s, the team,” and “Mercedes’s, the team’s,” the author decided to omit the possessive entirely.   If you’re gonna criticize grammar, at least know what you’re talking about first.
That was all grammatically correct though…
[See my other reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/12dw068/-/jf8jd1z). He worked as an investment banker and after that worked as a venture capitalist before moving to motorsports.
Toto Wolff is in an entirely different class to the rest of them. He's a business man and an investor first and foremost, rather than a (albeit very well paid) employee like the other team principals. He is the owner and boss at Mercedes, rather than just being the guy in charge
> raced  *briefly*
Most raced at some point - just depends on the level they got to
Petronas doesn't own any shares though.  Ineos has 1/3, Toto has 1/3 and Mercedes has 1/3.
Wow i had no idea. I remember hearing he was a part owner of the team but didn't realize it was actually 1/3. That's unbelievable, no wonder he's so rich
Horner still bullies him sometimes
>which also work in favour of the billionaire).  Which work even more in favour for the billionaire.
Sure it is. My net worth is about 0% of Musk's, and Toto's is about 0.5% of Musk's. Only half a percent!!  Unless you're a secret billionaire with a worth far exceeding Toto's.
Lawrence Stroll is worth 3.6 bn USD  Edit: but he's not a team principal
Zak brown has many dollar
Toto Wick
Loved that episode. The man is the definition of business
You mean profiteering off of anti-racism movements
Lmao
Source on that?
No you’re right, it’s super weird. What kids first job is to run a VC fund in 1998?    Like I kind of see a story where it’s tech bubble, he has all these rich connections from racing, and he suckers some money out of them. But that’s a super far-fetched tale.
Being the son of an F1 Champion did not hurt either
It comes as the first result if you search their names together on YT mate  https://youtu.be/os9AZsCAZ1k
Especially Leclerc. He's done a good job at making people forget that his grandparents were billionaires.
I mean the school fee's were probs $250,000 per year or something I don't think they were scrapping around for money.
PE firms typically invest in mature companies, rarely startups.
Or when lando norris said he and max had 27 race wins between them
/u/TxBatnado, it's called a genetic test. We went paternity testing.
Wolff sounds Austrian and I am Austrian.
i mean he dosent have a polish accent but he speaks it
Pssh, my dad’s Opel Meriva does that
This guy fucks!
This guy fucks!
The example is being made quite often because it is supposed to be impressive, but its actually the dumbest way to compare the difference between millions and billions. Millions and billions are linear, but due to the way we measure time it is actually not really linear.  Edit: If you want to make it impressive, take the height difference: If you stack a million dollar bills, they would be 109 meter high. A billion of them would be 109 kilometer high.
Crazy thing is Toto isntt satisfied with just running the biggest team in F1, he has loads of other stuff he does as well.
> If any of them ever wake up and dread going to work it's time to move on  This actually applies to us all as well
I wish that was what I was saying... Lol
If my girl had 500M I'd tell her to do whatever makes her happy lol.
Same! My envy was sky high for 5 seconds 😂
You don't make 1 billion by working
Well, I was unemployed for about a year during covid. Hardest year of my life. First 2-3 months were similar to what you described. I taught myself music production, read books, played games, went out for coffee and cake in the sun middle of the day, did many things that I didn’t have time for when I was working.  At some point, it lost its appeal to me. It wasn’t financial pressure, we were doing ok with one salary, not great but definitely not suffering. Things just started to look pointless. I started missing work, missing people, missing generating value for others. I started thinking that when I just have fun, I’m only generating value for myself.  Not to sound too philosophical, but I started realizing that what drives me is influencing other people and businesses. Leaving a mark. Making things better every day. Just enjoying myself was simply not satisfying.  Granted, I was lucky enough to be able to pivot my career to allow me to do that. I get that many people aren’t so lucky, and their job is a mundane grind. I was able to find a new path that’s sort of a combination of what I do well, what I like doing and what companies are willing to pay decently to get done.  And I got better at balance. I don’t let work creep into my personal life, I take time outs and time off when needed, and still find a bit of time for music, hobbies and travel. That balance is important. Again, I’m lucky that I can afford to do that, I know.
> There’s enough to the world for many lifetimes, why do you think you’d hate it?  Probably because a lot of the accessible fun and relaxation gets old after a while. Sure it'd be nice to laze around and watch shows but you can only do that for so long before it gets old. Same for video games, practicing your instrument, etc. Imagine having 24 hours a day to just practice your music; you'd get what, 4 or 5 hours tops?  Also, relaxation feels good because it's a release from having to work. I wouldn't mind work as much if I just did it on my own terms instead of having to work to live.
In a world where there was true income security office jobs would be a lot more fun because managers that made employees miserable wouldn't last because they'd lose all their employees. I think waiting tables would be cool as well, I love talking to strangers, extroverts wouldn't mind that role at all.  And in a world like this, with less emphasis on needing income it would allow more time to be a musician even if just in increased free time and for fun.
Damn that’s unfortunate, I’m glad he’s doing better now. Regardless of Merc’s recent performance he’s still a legendary team principal and has a lot to be proud of.
It’s not that it’s not working, it’s just his passion. For example, I’m a musician and there are tons of parts of that are ‘work’ but the overall activity brings me joy so I keep at it.
Not in the sense that any regular person would consider work. The majority of his time will be meetings an schmoozing, he isn't putting in a hard day's Graff.
I agree but I've seen it a lot. You can travel, work for a non profit, do sports. A lot of people need work for a greater purpose.
r/formula1 is the last place I’d ever think to see a Brendan Schaub reference lmao
Also a beast of a dad
Hmm, doesn't look like a typical Harley rider
You can't become this wealthy without heavy exploitation of people.
Undisputed, undefeated, never lost a race
100k like what, 40 years ago? Not too shabby money.
So he wasn't rich enough to afford a private school...that is not poor by any standard. Private schooling is a luxury.
This. Also the previous CEO came from AMG.. Aston and Merc have had close ties for ages due to the road cars using AMG engines.
Aston Martin Lagonda more than doubled in share price over the last three months. What the OP above does not mention is that it still about 80% down from when Toto was reported to have bought in.
Isn't Aston pretty far down stock wise? I thought Toto has owned stock in Aston since 2020. I could've sworn I just saw an article on CNBC or something about how the stock is down significantly since the IPO.
Racing team is a subsidiary. Stroll serves as executive chairman for the road car company  I’m not sure there are specific publicly traded stock in just the racing team.
They do have cause and affect though, but nothing wrong with knowing your subject matter and investing
You don’t need to sandbag, if you know the Merc is fast the Aston should follow. Flip it around, if Toto sold his 0.95% in Aston then said “were no longer supplying Aston Martin with any parts in f1” then people would be concerned.   In fact, people were concerned, Wolff and Stroll were investigated for this for insider trading.    Both the F1 teams and car companies have significant connections.
Merc thinks good performance was track specific, so I wouldn't expect them to keep this for long if I were you.
Somebody at Aston could think "let's not screw Mercedes up, because Toto owns many shares and he can screw us up". Although, I don't think that Toto owns that many shares for it to matter, otherwise there'd have been drama already lol
It's a conflict of interest in the sport imo.  And also questionable because he personally knows Lawrence Stroll, so you'd think there'd be insider info suspicions.
r/hedidthegrammar
As an English major, holding a decade long obsession over grammar while working as editor at several large publications, and having been driven mad by SMS and Twitter's encouragement of shortening a word in any way possible, it is people like you that leave me with a tiny bit of hope. Godspeed, grammar nerd. Godspeed.
Yeah I see what you're saying. Irregardless it threw me off a bit so I thought I'd make a cheeky lil comment
The last sentence is not even close.
Thanks.   As I get older I feel more and more like the product or just part of a mass of people to extract money from.   And, while capitalism and greed works, it may also signal a flaw in the human species - one I am guilty of as well.
The sun reports that Christian Horner and Gerri Halliwell are worth half a billion pounds collectively. So he’s not that out of whack in terms of familial wealth. These guys have money.
> He is the owner and boss at Mercedes  that's wrong, he's only the owner and boss of the F1 team not the entirety of Mercedes-Benz/Daimler-Mercedes
Wait you're right, Im getting the weirdly names corporations I'm not overly certain what they do mixed up
> That's unbelievable, no wonder he's so rich  He was a very successful investment banker before F1. He already had hundreds of millions.
Lauda owned the other 1/3 before selling out to PETRONAS, well his widow did.   Bruv is Scrooge McDuck rich
That's Christian, he's obsessed with Toto, got a Pinterest and everything * he probably doesn't but we can't rule it out
Even if we're generous and your net worth is 1 million, then your net worth is 1/1000th of Toto's. His is 1/200th of Musk's. I fail to see how 1/1000 > 1/200.  Half a percent is far, *far* more than... what is it, 0.000005%? Might be off by a couple of 0's, but it wont change anything one way or the other
Is he a team principal?
But not a team principal
Not team principal though
He's not their TP
Stroll is the owner/CEO,  not the TP.   Toto is unusual in that he's both
Zac brown is actually the CEO, not the principal. He’s just one who likes to be the face of the team and do all the media.
Also not team principal
Why would I buy "this candle smells like Toto Wolf"
Don't kill his dog
Toto-lly awesome.
“I once saw him kill ~~three men~~ Max Verstappen in the paddock... with a pencil, with a fucking pencil”
What episode of what?
His funds names were Marchfifteen and Marchsixteen. First launched in ‘98. Second I was wrong about, he spun that up in 2004.  https://www.weforum.org/people/toto-wolff
That's the thing about being born into privilege you aren't afraid to put your hands out for more.
F1 champion during the 80's, its not like Keke was earning 50m a year during that era. Of course, Nico did grow up in a rich family, but not otherworldly rich like other drivers have done.
That's the thing. He had to make good choices, yes, but most of us don't have choices to make.
The monegasque flag next to his name makes it kind of hard to forget
Hows so? Leclerc is born in Monaco, during his show and tell tour of Monaco with Carlos they stop at one point and he points at his mom's beauty salon (hair salon?) in the middle of Monte Carlo, lol. You don't get to have business in that place as working class.  So while he's not flaunting it, I also don't think he's hiding anything.
Wow I had no idea. I expected they were well off like probably most people in Monaco, but I didn't expect billionaire level!
Source?
Didn’t they refuse to fund him?
Lando just nicked that joke from Danny Ricc who made it about championships in a post-race with Lewis and Seb. (or something like that, I can't remember exactly)
Hey, Latifi, Mazepin and Hamilton have a combined 7 titles between them. Not too shabby may i say.
An order of magnitude is the number of zeros, so from billion to ten billion. Bezos is in the hundreds of billions, so from Toto’s billion to that, there is two orders of magnitude.
SCHWAAAG
I was looking around to see who does all the fucking around here… it’s this guy!
When you rely on your current job to get food on the table no, not really
> I'd tell her to do whatever makes her happy lol.  I hope that's still you bro
For Toto that’s running Mercedes. You clearly can see how passionate he is about it.
That is pretty fucking ridiculous. Horner even applauded him for his efforts and for talking about mental health issues publicly. Something the team principles already knew he struggled with by the way. Also, he started pushing for it heavily last season when Mercedes was never ahead of anyone so it doesn’t even make sense.
It’s 2023. I know we like to lump all billionaires into the same bucket on Reddit but he is still worth less than 1% of Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos. You can work your ass off and get lucky and end up a billionaire. He’s not a trust fund/heir kid. He almost got kicked out of school as a boy because his family couldn’t afford the tuition.
Well, yeah... He worked early on and invested in companies he was a part of, right?   But you're right, once you start that train, you don't have to drive it at some point
huh?
I guess that also makes sense. Might be me romanticising what I don’t have as I’ve been burnt out for a while. Perhaps the same could happen; I actually enjoy being productive. I’m gonna need to find a rich sponsor to run the experiment 🤔
You can be passionate about something but it still sucks or is Uber stressful. I thoroughly enjoy my job, it's basically my dream. Sometimes I get super stressed out, worried about something, or downright frustrated and wish I could retire. Ask any touring musician, that it's not all the glitz and glamor of travel. Some musician/comedian, i forgot who, answered the question "what was it like being in xyz city?" they gestured to the tiny interview room they were in and said it was just like that. They get up, are on the road/in the plane for hours, get to the city and do interviews, and vip ticket shit. Try to get a quiet hour to write new music, more interviews, then setup, sound check, rehearsal, go on stage, get off back in the bus all to do it again the next day. I'm sure most wouldn't trade it for the world because it's their dream, but that doesn't mean it's not an incredibly grueling, exhausting process.  Just because someone likes what they do, doesn't mean its not an absolute walk in the park
its tuf b
never meddum
Absolutely
Let’s be conservative and say 30 years ago, that’s 236k today.
No one is saying his parents were poor. They were middle class. The point is, he didn't inherit any of his money.
Still easily considered self made though.
Nothing more British than having non - British engines in all your cars lol.
Also Aston interiors were the previous gen Merc interiors
Yeah.. up 37% in the last 3 months, but that's still down 94% overall since 2018 ☠️
Racing team is exclusively owned by stroll and consortium, unlike the road car company. The naming rights were given for free to the f1 team in a mutually beneficial deal - no money goes from one to the other. Stroll mentioned this when he announced it
I would expect them to stay behind a non factory team for very long either if i were you
Aston Martin the car company is not the f1 team, they have a sponsorship deal. Toto has no shares in the f1 team
I think if you find the idea of Wolff owning a stake in Aston Martin questionable, that's perfectly reasonable, but I would point you towards Alpha Tauri as being much further on that particular spectrum.
That’s not how share ownership works but ok
> suspicions  I'm not arguing for it, please understand. But as long as we're down this path...  Unless he had some "miraculous epiphany one day" and dump a bunch of stock only to "find out soon after"* that Aston is missing financial targets and crumbles like a cookie -- It's not really an issue.
I’m sorry but it’s *regardless*.
It 100% is. You might need to head back to 5th grade.  Fortunately someone already explained it.  https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/12dw068/mercedes_boss_toto_wolff_reportedly_cracks_the_1/jf8r3es/
Yeah buddy I'm in the club, if it helps to know Toto also came from a pretty wealthy Austrian family so he had a head start lol.
The Geri Halliwell side of that equation is doing some very heavy lifting there. But you are right in saying that they very much have money as well. My point is just that Toto Wolff is far closer to say, Lawrence Stroll than people seem to think. Toto entered the sport by buying his way into teams rather than being hired for his competence
But the sun reports Horner's worth at around £41.4 million as does pretty much every other source. Geri is valued at between £30 and £40 million. They're very wealthy but not close to Toto wealth.
Iirc Horner went to fee paying school for his whole education, while Wolff only went for part because his family couldn’t afford it. Wolff is rich from working in finance, Horner is probably a profit participant of the team, he hasn’t held a significant role elsewhere?
Petronas is the Malaysian equivalent to Shell or PetroBras, big national oil company.   Ineos is a much broader chemicals company, through an infinite list of subsidiaries and joint ventures they do all sorts of things from refining oil to plastics and biofuels.
No.  Lauda owned 10 %. His share was returned to Mercedes after his death.  Petronas does not own or has never owned a share in Mercedes F1.
>Lauda owned the other 1/3  Nikki only owned 10%
I mean have you seen Toto in a white button up?
I fail to see how $999 million > $199 billion. In absolute terms I am closer to Toto in wealth than Toto is to Musk. The value of things in everyday life is mostly measured in absolute terms, not relative ones. As the other commenter pointed out, you can look at it both ways and still be correct, but most of the time it is far more useful and informative to think in absolute terms, since it gives a clearer picture of how obscenely rich the Musks of the world are (though Toto is still also obscenely rich).
Edit: apparently I was wrong, read below  ~~Not officially, but he's the one calling shots at AM. That's why Otmar left (or at least that's what he said)~~

Earning massive amounts of money requires to hit the bulls eye. Rich people can afford a lot of darts, most people never afford one to begin with.
>That's the thing about being born into privilege you aren't afraid to put your hands out for more.  I was a big fan of Nico but lately he is just flaunting his fabulous wealth. Personally I find it disgusting. There were two videos that did it for me, he got some sort of super car and then another one where he was on a super yacht. Add in he was a covidiot and refused to get the vaccine and was reporting from home. How much was he getting to sit at home and talk on skype for 10 minutes?
Most people have some privilege. It just depends who you want to compare yourself with.
>That's the thing. He had to make good choices  That is opposite. All of us have to make good choices because we basically have one chance. Someone who grew up wealthy has plenty of chances to make mistakes. Nico Rosberg had the chance to do what he wanted and if it did not work out he would just go to college or something. He started carting seriously when he was 11 and when he was like 15 his father used his connections to get him sponsorship and a seat at a team. Unless you are the child of an F1 driver, it would be difficult to have those opportunities.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico\_Rosberg
To know this you’d have to have watched the tour of Monaco with him, and have a knowledge that to work in a hair salon (usually a modest earning) you’d have to be more than working class. This just isn’t something that’s obvious
"hey what's up Al Qaeda"
Damn that's wholesome
If Toto was my girlfriend, I'd tell Toto to do what makes Toto happy.
He went to the most elite school in Austria, he didn’t have it tough. Sure, he made that money, but he didn’t start off in a worse position then the likes of Gates or Bezos.
Nothing wrong with being wealthy. Being a billionaire however, that's more money than you could ever spend.  A billionaire is worth 1000 millionaires. For him to be a billionaire, he has had to make over 30 million every year for his adult life. Someone who works 60 hours a week in healthcare (you know, actual hard workers) will make 50k a year if they're lucky. Does Toto work 600 times as hard as them?  Maybe you think 50k a year is too low. Sure, fuck it, 100k a year. Then he'd still work 300 times hard.  If Toto's wealth is supposed to be the payoff of hard work, then there should be a fuckton of billionaires or at least millionaires around. I don't see them.
Grass is always greener. I'm not that original guy replying to you but I absolutely love my job. I don't make enough that I could basically retire immediately, I mean I'm in my 20's lol. But it's so ridiculously easy to me, comes very natural, I've been doing it so long and have mostly good people I work with, some amazing so bad people. I work with a lot of customers on a pretty short term basis and meet the coolest people. One guy used to race gt40's, Lola's and McLaren all over the country and his son has a few vintage f1 cars he races at the f1 historic circuit. Id never give up on the chance to meet these people, the only thing that would make it better is being so set that I'm not obligated to be there on a certain schedule
Yeah, to each their own, it really depends on the job too. I can totally appreciate that many people have jobs that they dislike or don’t give them the same enjoyment that mine gives me. Age might have something to do with it too. I’m at that age where in almost every work meeting I’m the oldest in the room (and not the most senior position either). That definitely gets you thinking…
Some say the tuffest
pretty much everything is exploitation under capitalism, so it’s basically a non factor.
Yes, i don't doubt that. He is self made. It's just that it was presented like he was going to miss out on education.
We'll they're owned by a Canadian and a Kuwaiti Investment firms.. so they ownership isnt even British.
According to Al Murray, that‘s British Thinking
Aston, Bentley, Rolls... checks out.
What about how the British king is actually German?
AM gets previous gen merc infotainment
No they aren't.
They can't overspend now, like they used to.
The problem is that they can't throw half a billion dollars worth of parts at the car like they could before the cost cap, they have to be much more selective about their upgrade paths.
Laurence Stroll and his partners bought a controllimg interest in Aston Martin the car company shortly after buying rscing point.  So technically it's like my right hand sponsoring my left hand.
Yeah, the whole "junior" or "feeder" team thing has always been suspicious to me. Even some of the engine supplier relationships are questionable imo
I don't personally care, because as you said we have Alpha Tauri, I was just giving the argument against Owner of team A owns part of team B.  I think that all teams should be independent from each other, but there's no way that happens lmao I have accepted that's not how F1 works
My bad, could of worded my comment better
Well that seems needlessly rude.
Half a billion dollars doesn’t just fall into your lap 😂
That last line seems to imply Toto lacks competence, but ignores the fact that he got to the position of being able to buy into F1 teams by showing exceptionally high business competence. Mercedes also invited him into the fold as a business partner and CEO due to the relationship with him that him and Norbert Haug had for years.   So your statement is accurate only in that he did purchase a stake in the team as part of his entry. But to frame it that he’s like Lawrence Stroll in that he was a rich dude who just bought into it with little to no racing experience or background is a false equivalence.
Does being a 90s popstar really net hundreds of millions ?
Horner got this gig because he was the founder of Arden International and was good at it. And through this he got to know Helmut Marko in the late 90s.
God he's poor than.   Lmao at myself for getting so much wrong in this thread from Ineos to Nikki's ownership stake. I'm a dummy
Oh I've seen it 💦💦💦💦💦
>That's why Otmar left (or at least that's what he said)  No he didn't. He left coz a "second Pope" aka Martin Whitmarsh was hired when the roles of TP and CEO were split. He said this is in the interview he gave to F1 in March last year. The interview was on the F1 app/site.
The answer is no, he’s not a team principle.
Not sure what you're getting at. The parent comment said  >"the other team principals are nowhere near as wealthy"  Zak Brown isn't tp, he's CEO and it wouldn't exactly be odd to have more money when you're at higher stage in your career
Yeah as much as Nico Rosberg YouTube content is generally corny and overdone, this was really really great. It was fascinating hearing Toto’s story and philosophy about life, success, as well as his comments on mental health and all that. They had a really great rapport and Nico also had some valuable insights instead of his usual conceited content where he basically fellates himself the entire video
His arm looks huge there.
why are you aiming for the bull rather than the triple twenty
Same here. And the one with Nadal was pretty sad. He was trying to compare his yacht to Nadal’s, his watch. It was something like “I have one too! I have one too!”. I felt pretty desperate.
There is something hilarious with our modern condition that many people will pay money (via ad revenue) to an extremely rich guy to show off his wealth to them
Let's say you're born in Stevenage, your dad drives a station wagon and the other guy is born in Europe, to wealthy parents, one of whom has experience as a professional athlete and you live in wealth, in Monaco most of your life, get the best education.   Yes Nico was primed to never under estimate his value. He never did.
I feel like you have completely misunderstood my comment. Or you're deliberately misrepresenting it.    I really think your representation of 'choice' among the poor, working and middle classes is highly distorted, too. As if starving to death or dying of exposure should be considered viable options.
I’m not saying he did. My comparison to them was only to illustrate how much different $1B is than $100B.
You either don’t understand how being a billionaire works or you’re being intentionally obtuse. No one becomes a billionaire by taking home $30M a year for 30 years. They become a billionaire by investing in assets that increase dramatically in value. The vast majority of the obscenely wealth hold very little of it in cash; it’s largely in investments.  So no, you can’t become a billionaire just by working hard (in fact, no one ever said you did), but unless you are an heir, it is hard work to become one.
Yanking a kid out of school midway through the year is disruptive and humiliating. It's not about being excluded from education it's the loss of stability
In that case:  Nothing more British than having foreign firms owning your local manufacturers
And before that they were owned by Ford. The older Vantage V12s famously used 2 Ford Taurus V6 blocks stuck together.
Second biggest investor in AML is an investment fund controlled by Saudi crown prince
That’s true, but Legally it’s like there’s a wall between your left and right hands though and they can only touch when you make public statements about it. Stroll controls both but they are forced to operate separately. If he did try to merge them which has been discussed, the UK would likely force Toto and Mercedes AG to sell
> I think that all teams should be independent from each other, but there's no way that happens lmao I have accepted that's not how F1 works  That is a relatively recent development in the grand scheme of things.   More engine suppliers in 2026 will help.
This will be the first and last time i'll ever upvote a "could of" moment.
Tell me I’m being woooshed
As is claiming something “is not even close” when it’s objectively correct.
I dont think they implied that at all. It's just true that it wasn't like Williams headhunted Toto for his precious team principal experience or anything like that. He had the money _and_ brought skill too.    He basically did a Stroll. Lance is a good driver, but it's unlikely he would've got his seat since 2017 without a shitload of money.
If the career was well managed absolutely. That said Geri's net worth is estimated at around 40-45 million while Victoris Beckham's is estimated at 450 million.
Yeah man her royalties for those albums and singles must be insane, one of the most successful girl groups ever and she had a solo career. Then you add in all their merchandise, the moves and books etc. Geri Halliwell would have absolutely cleaned up back in the day like Taylor swift or Beyonce does now. She probs invested lots of that money and still makes over a half mill per year in royalties and other payments.
This is a great watch for anyone that wants to know that story https://youtu.be/eqDcX4tB8io
Welcome to Reddit. Where dummies repeatedly spread misinformation, you fit right in. Lol
TIL, I thought the second pope he was talking about was papa Stroll
Toto and Horner act as both CEO and TP so this is already an unfair comparison
That's Nico he's always desperate to one up people, it's why many ex drivers don't kick it with him. He was and always be a dork
Too bad he can never be compared with Nadal lol
The thing about Nico and Lance Stroll is that they never had to worry about failing. You have to look at Maslow's hierarchy of needs. They never had to worry about where they would live or where a meal would come from. If they failed they would just be the sons of wealthy families. Imagine what you could do if you never had to worry about anything. I am not saying the two of them are not talented, I am saying it is easier to achieve high goals if you do not have to worry about anything. Bill Gates dropped out of Harvard. If Microsoft did not work out, he would have just gone back and finished his degree.
Ah ok, I could’ve misinterpreted what you said. A lot of self-made billionaires are criticised for using that title since they often come from relatively wealthy families. I thought you were saying Toto wasn’t like that and I was just pointing out that he was. He went to the most prestigious (or at least one of) schools in Austria, and his mother was late for a payment that she eventually made. They were certainly upper middle class by euro standards, which is still multi-millionaires.
You're just repeating what I said. You are explaining how passive income or assets that passively increase in value can make you a billionaire. Passive income is not work.
Karma                          - A Guy from India
Yeah I'm just doing a little trollin hahah
It’s not rude to be wrong. People are allowed to be wrong.
I'm with my sheeple, I mean people
That's a tiny car
> Won’t you meet my sexy wife? Heheh  His wife is very normal looking really, just rich. Then there's KMag whose wife looks like a plastic surgery victim.
No he is definitely privileged. My primary point is he’s not a billionaire who got that way by manipulating and exploiting the economy. While $1B is obviously a ridiculous amount of money, it’s not what it was even 20 years ago. There a probably hundreds more billionaires than we realize but there’s no public record of the value of their assets because they’re in real estate or privately owned companies, etc.
You got me 😅
Thank you. I recently discovered Kmag's wife (I was looking for f1 wags) and wow. In some pics she looks fine, in others she looks like she had too much plastic surgery.
>Then there's KMag whose wife looks like a plastic surgery victim.  I could not find a good picture. Maybe just botox?

I can think of Alonso/Button in the fucking McHonda an amazing lineup in arguably the worst team in the entire grid.  It wasn’t a front runner but was clearly a great car the Maldonado/B.Senna line up in 2012, the Williams was clearly much better than the finishing position suggested finished 8th in a car that some weekends could clearly fight for podiums
Button and Alonso at the Mclaren Honda was literally one of the best driver pairings ever wasted in a backmarker team.
2015 where McLaren finished ninth despite having two world champions driving for them
McHonda wasting the Alonso/Button partnership for sure.  Not a teammate pairing as such as one replaced the other but Walter Wolf had Hunt and then Keke Rosberg in 1979 and their car that year made McHonda look reliable and was a complete waste of two big talents.  Also as others have already said, Brabham with Lauda & Piquet in 79 as well.  Currently would have to be McLaren with Norris & Piastri, though McLaren potentially have time to get their act together still.  Worst line up in a great car that I can think of was probably the year Schumacher broke his leg and Ferrari ended up fielding Irvine & Mika Salo for part of the season.  Also, not a bad line up as such, but Ralf Schumacher & Montoya could have got so much more out of that Williams without their petty infighting.  Edited for spelling
Trulli/Glock in the 2009 Toyota. Great drivers, but that car was clearly capable of race wins that those two never achieved.
Williams had Webber and Rosberg in '06, but didn't have an engine that could last.  Lots of teams in the early 90s had stupendous driving talent but failed to prequalify.  Too long a list.
Best drivers in a crap car: Scheckter and Villeneuve, who finished 1-2 in the championship the previous year, in the 1980 Ferrari 312T5 has to be up there.  Obviously Alonso and Button at McLaren as many have mentioned  Prost and Watson in McLaren at pretty much its lowest ebb (until 2015) in 1980 is probably another  Worst in a great car: Calling them "worst" is probably quite harsh because they were both solid journeymen (and I quite like both of them as drivers), but Boutsen and Patrese in the Williams FW13 is probably a shout. Mansell famously went much quicker than either had managed in his first test of the car back at Williams after changing the setup somewhat.
Vettel and Leclerc in Ferrari 2020 can be one recent example as well.
Brabham in 79 with Lauda and Piquet
Button and Barrichello in those utterly dire 2007 and 2008 Hondas stand out, and at the other end of the scale the 2011 Renault lineup of a somewhat past-it Heidfeld and two pay drivers in Petrov and Senna was worse than the car deserved. Just imagine what pre-injury Kubica could've done with it.
Mansell and Hakkinen for two races in the 1995 McLaren has to be up there.   I think the 2012 Lotus could have been a championship contender but was driven by a rookie Grosjean and Raikkonen after a two year hiatus.   The Ferrari in 08 should have caked walked to the title but Kimi was bang off form by then and Massa was never a top level driver.   Scheckter and Giles Villeneuve in the terrible 1980 Ferrari.   Maybe a controversial one as it did actually win the title but Jacques Villeneuve and HH Frentzen made very heavy work of 97  The 96 Benetton would probably have been a championship contending car with Schumacher in it.   The 1997 Jordan was let down at times by having two rookies who both made a lot of errors.
To add a couple I've not seen yet  1. Alesi and Heidfeld, Prost 2000.  2. Trulli and Frentzen, Jordan 2000  3. Apparently the Sauber engineers in 2012 felt they had a much better car than their drivers showed.
2015 McLaren with Nando and JB, unforgivable how their talents were wasted with that dog of a car, still remember being in the crowd at Silverstone that year and being shocked how different and crap the Honda engine sounded.
I don't think the late-stage 2011 Renault was so bad that bruno senna was supposed to be finishing outside the top-15 in most races. Heidfeld in a somewhat weak year was still beating petrov.  Additionally, grosjean who got owned by raikkonen during their two seasons together, drove the 2015 Lotus with maldonado. I thought that car was capable of beating the FI and matching the williams that year.  Finally, the 2000 arrows was a decent car with an ageing engine, and one wonders what could've been done without two error prone drivers at the wheel.  2007 Honda with Button and Barrichello was the only 'opposite' example to come to mind immediately - wtaf was that car
Stroll and Perez in the 2020 Racing Point seemed a waste. I'm convinced that car would've been regularly on the podium with a driver of Verstappen/Alonso/Hamilton's calibre
D.Hill and Coulthard in the 1995 Williams. Any other driver would have walked out with the championship. Schumacher shat all over them with an inferior Benetton.
Here's a few either way off the top of my head    Even as a Perez fan, Perez-Stroll in 2020 was quite a weak lineup for the 3rd fastest car on the grid.   Ricciardo-Verstappen 2016-18 was a lineup definitely deserving of a car that could contend for titles.   Button and Alonso in the fucking McHonda was a crime against motorsport itself.   There is no way in hell Kovaleinen (probably butchered that spelling) was good enough to be in that 2008 McLaren.    Leclerc-Vettel in 2020 was a tragedy.   Hamilton-Russell last year, almost unarguably the strongest lineup on the grid in the 3rd fastest car.   As you said, Piastri and Norris this year are being held back big time.
Lauda and Piquet in the 1979 Brabham shitbox is up there
Piastri and Norris are 2 superb drivers stuck with a shitbox at the minute. I don't think the McLaren team is particularly bad, though, they just made some serious cockups in the car design department.
The obvious answer this year is mclaren. Two phenomenal drivers in a car that can’t score points without half the field crashing. Best cars with worst drivers doesn’t typically happen because skill tends to rise.
Worst car/ Great drivers Villeneuve/Scheckter Ferrari 1980 Alonso/Button Mclaren 2015-2016 Prost/Alesi Ferrari 1991   Great car/Mediocre drivers Williams 89/90 Patrese/Boutsen Ferrari 1983 Arnoux/Tambay  2007-2008 Ferrari have clearly fastest car but drivers underperformed.
Brundle and Bellof in the Tyrrell. That car was a dog that fell apart almost every race. Underpowered as you do not believe. Yet they had really good results if they finished. Many may have forgotten that Brundle was a great talent who battled for the F3 title with Senna. Unfortunately hindered by a bad accident early in his F1 career. Bellof needs no introduction either. One of the most gifted racers the planet has seen. Remember that infamous Monaco GP where a young Senna was catching Prost with a Toleman?  Bellof was closing in too. But sadly he didn't hear the warning shots and took the path that seemed to be paved for him. Death in a racecar.
I'd say Ferrari and McLaren would be two teams wasting their drivers' potential, mainly because of Leclerc and Norris. I don't think there's an example for the other way around (there's no fast car being wasted on underperforming drivers).
Unbiased Id love to see Alpha Tauri boys in a good car. Nyck has won Formula E and Yuki is outdoing him this year and clearly learning as he stays in the sport.
1999 Jordan with better drivers could've won both championships
this year? stroll in a big 3 car sticks out like a sore thumb. meanwhile norris and piastri wonderkids are on the strugglebus
Historically, I think there's no greater example of the former than Ferrari in 1983 with Patrick Tambay and Rene Arnoux.  In 1983, Ferrari won the constructors championship by 10 points over Renault - a not insignificant margin when a race win only awarded nine points (and the maximum a team could score on a race weekend was 15, if they got a 1-2 finish, which was a bit rare in this era). Now, the fact that the winning constructor didn't field the driver's champion isn't that unusual, but the fact that despite being constructors champions their drivers were only 3rd and 4th in the championship, tells me that with a different driver Ferrari could have had the WDC that year too.   Now, neither were what I'd call *bad* drivers, but not WDC-caliber either, really. It was sort of a team with two number 2 drivers, imo. This was actually a bit of a contrast with their main rivals, Brabham and Renault, who had such massive gaps between their drivers that it was practically comical - while Piquet and Prost battled for the title, their teammates were 9th and 7th in the championship respectively...
Toulo de Graffenried drove the wheels off that Maserati in 1953, but ended up only eighth in the championship.
Here’s a controversial one, Ferrari in 2017 and 2018 for best car/ worst lineup.    Sure statistically Vettel/ Raikkonen was incredible but in reality both were way past their primes. Raikkonen was inconsistent and just not fast enough a lot of the time. Vettel made way too many mistakes.  Imo if you had Hamilton, Ricciardo, Verstappen or Alonso in either the 2017 or 2018 Ferrari’s they’d have won both championships.   For best car/ worst lineup I’d say Jordan 1997 or 1999.   The 97’ Jordan was definitely capable of wins but was held back by Fisichella and Ralph Schumacher being too inexperienced.  The 99’ Jordan was a shock championship contender but Hill and Frentzen never really took advantage of the pace properly, even the team made mistakes like forgetting to send a message to Frentzen in the European GP leading to a DNF.
Mclaren or Haas for best drivers worst car; Aston Martin Lance Stroll for best car worst driver
Worst team with best driver: Williams with Goatifi
Lando has to be close to the top of best driver/worst team at the moment right?  Perhaps Charles as well?    Maybe just by default Checo is worst driver/best car, since the car is so good.
Robert Kubica and Nick Heidfeld in that dog shit 2009 BMW
Man we’ve gotta make a petition, after Abu Dhabi is finished the world champion has to do one quali lap in every team’s car with the same general setup
So pretty much this is just a shit on McLaren thread now, and with good reason.     Since the Mika days they've done a stunning job of recruiting talent and then giving them tractors.  Likes seriously they can pull some talent on the driving side, but the design and engine supplier side - well let's just not talk about that.
Scheckter/Villeneueve in the 1980 Ferrari is a classic example of two top-tier drivers in a car that was about as much use as a bucket of mouldy onions.
Wonder how good 2012 Lotus would have been. Kimi was one my favorite athletes but his 2nd Ferrari stint wasn't that good. Would be very curious to see Alonso in that car
Might get to the end of the season and be wishing Stroll was someone else at Aston…
Worst team with the best drivers? Ferrari!
Lance Stroll is basically a wasted seat in that fast Aston Martin. I can't take anything Lawrence Stroll says seriously when it's all about giving his son nice toys and not about building a good team.
Hulk/KMag feels like the worst team with the best drivers. I feel like they are absolutely extracting as much as they can out of a still suspect Haas car. Certainly both are by far better drivers than Mick or Mazepin. Easy runner up for this season is Mercedes, you have arguably the greatest driver ever and one of the best young drivers we've seen since Max and they are struggling because of a shitbox.  Best team with worst drivers feels a little more tough. AM has great cars and of course Alonso is a legend but Stroll is below average IMO and is just doing well because of that car. Maybe Alpine with Gasly and Ocon. I feel personally like Gasly is vastly overrated and Ocon I feel indifferent about, but the car seems pretty decent.
Been mentioned plenty but in my time of watching F1 it was the McLaren Honda with best drivers and worst car and 2020 Racing point with Stroll and Perez for best car worst drivers. McLaren Honda had drivers capable of fighting for championships in the right car, but they finished 9th. 2020 Racing Point should have been in a WCC for 2nd and probably were 2nd quickest overall, but Stroll and Perez is a way weaker pairing than Max and Albon. Personally I'd put Albon closer to Perez than Stroll and Max in a different league.  This season as you say McLaren have excellent drivers but a dreadful car, not sure what fits for best car and worst drivers. It's kind of the case that every car has at least 1 see driver good enough for it not to be considered a particularly weak lineup
I’d say ferrari have the best drivers at the worst team. Maybe not the best drivers on the grid but relatively at least: they have the car, the engine, the drivers, the pit crew, the fan support, the most money by far, the longest history, and yet their strategists apparently do whippets before every race. They somehow manage to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory on an extremely consistent basis.  The way they wrecked Leclerc from winning his home race in Monaco last year still hurts.
the answer to both questions is 2023 Ferrari
Checho is probably the worst driver to car ratio and Norris or albon are probably the best driver to car ratio not calling checho bad just worse than the other 7 front runners
Going to get some flak for this, but best team with worst drivers. Aston Martin - Lance Stroll: Below average 18 races per season.  Weirdly well above average for the other 2.  - Fernando Alonso: Obviously a very good driver but he isn't as quick as he once was.  His racecraft is still top tier, he is a great asset and very intelligent, but the Alonso of 2010-2012 would have destroyed Ocon and Stroll would be even further behind.  I like the guy and I hope he sticks around but he's 42, he's past his prime.  Compared with the other top 4 teams, I think this is the weakest lineup.  Best drivers for the weakest team.  Mclaren - Car is shit  Norris - Highly rated Piastri - Also very highly rated and already on the pace.
Vettel/Charles in 2020
kobayashi and perez
The worst probably Aston just because of Stroll, he hasn't been bad at all but when considering the other big 4 lineups Stroll is clearly the odd man out of the 8. Best, I would say Haas.
A bit unrelated, but I'm sure that any of the drivers on the grid would win the chapionship in a RedBull this season, given that his teammate would be worse than him.
Ferrari drivers more interested in their fun modeling on IG.  Car is bad but Max would demand more.
Best drivers relative to car = McLaren  Worst drivers relative to car = Aston
Mclaren worst team best drivers. Aston Martin best team worst driver.... singular
Ferrari hand down wins the second contest.
If you're only as good as your last race, then Ferrari is the best team with the worst driver.
Is it too early to say Ferrari with Leclerc and Sainz in 2023 :(
I think the 2017 Williams with Bottas and not Massa/ Stroll may hav challenged the Force India's for 4th that year. Massa, who was pummeled by Bottas, crushed Stroll in qualifying and  most of the races. They were almost caught by Hulkenberg F1 team (Renault) for 5th.
2014 Williams is similar to 2020 Racing Point where it was probably the second best car but not seen that way due to drivers and team strategy/pitstops.  Both times Red Bull punching above 3rd.
[removed]
1995 Williams and Ferrari should have challenged Schumacher way more than they did
Ferrari currently is worst team with one worst driver as sainz
Shoutout to all the world champions who drove for privateer teams in the 50s, 60s and 70s...
McLaren is the obvious team at the moment. Arguably the worst car on the grid this season with two of the most talented young drivers.  As far as good teams with bad drivers right now I don't think there is any.   Ferrari in 92 might qualify but the car wasn't the greatest either.
Historically speaking:  1979 - **Brabham.** Lauda and Piquet are sharing 6 titles in between, but the car just was not up to their standards. **Mclaren.** The car was awful. Tambay and Watson barely shared any notable results.  1980 - **Ferrari.** Scheckter and Villeneuve could not get better than 5th in races, a pity.   **Mclaren**. Watson and Prost suffered a lot, though Prost made an impression. **Lotus**. Andretti and De Angelis had one of the most beautiful but disastrous car.  1981 - **Fittipaldi.** Rosberg had a pointless season even if he pushed to the maximum. Next year he was a champion in Williams.  1982 - **Lotus.** De Angelis and Mansell deserved a better car which was a midfielder only.  The list can go on and on.
Perez/Stroll in 2020 was a terrible pairing relative to the car that they had. They (and Racing Point strategies) wasted that car's potential.
"Mostly for the 2023 lineup, but if there's such a drastic past example that's cool too."  Seems most people don't follow this point which I think would be the most interesting.  So for 2023:  Worst teams with best drivers: McLaren, Haas or even Ferrari if you consider Ferrari to be bad (according to their results so far they kind of are)  Best team with worst drivers: I'd say Aston Martin because of Stroll. Alonso is good too but I doubt he's at the standard he was before. Maybe the Astons are actually faster than what they seem so far?  Disclaimer: it's impossible to know for sure how good a team is, so at the end of the day this question will have a lot of speculation in it.
LeClerc in that Ferrari??? Giving hope and slaughtering it later, piece by piece..!!
Damon Hill driving for Arrows springs to mind.
I know that one of them was a rookie and the other one was way past his prime, but russell and kubica in that god awful williams in 2019 has to be up there for the best driver lineup/worst car combination.
I think you pretty much have the two best answers. The 2012 Williams was capable of so much more.
I was about to post 2012 Williams but you beat me to it. That was a great car that should have won more races with the right driver. I would also suggest that the 2005, 2008, and 2009 Toyota's (Especially 2009) were capable of winning races with an upper echelon driver on board.
A car that can qualify on the front row (Spain 2012) must definitely be a top midfield car. Since 2012 was quite tight in terms of pace difference of different cars, it was the driver who made the difference.
Barrichello in that Williams would have outscored both Saubers and Force Indias easily IMO
maldonado was genuinely rapid in that 2012 williams ngl, just a shame he couldn’t keep it out of the barriers
……this!
Clearly
Might be first time with 2 WDCs ( and great WDCs there) stuck in a backmarker.
Alonso admitted later on he pretty much phoned that season in.
True, I think JPM and Ralf Schumacher was an incredibly strong pairing wasted in the Micheal dominance era as a second choice
9th ….ouch
Mclaren have been a joke for so long now
Toyota's run was mind boggling, I read a tweet yesterday that adjusted for inflation and they spend 600 million on the project and got nothing
The car also fell off quickly after the first couple of races. I think this was in part due to the management of the team being such a mess. I believe they had upgrades ready to go part way through the season which were just scrapped for no good reason, decisions took forever to be made. The car was a rocket in the early stages though, they finished P3 and P4 in Melbourne after starting from the pit lane. The team threw away a 1-2 start in Bahrain by loading the cars heavily with fuel, finishing 3rd and 7th :/
I'd say Kubica/Heidfeld/Rosberg could have won race in the 2009 Toyota
To be fair 06 Webber and Rosberg were pretty green.
To think Webber was in with a chance at winning monaco on merit until the engine blew up...
The car was bad (although not outright terrible and sometimes showed promising speed when it was not breaking down), but in terms of driver lineups that year, the only team had a better car and clearly worse limeup was RBR. Toyota and Sauber were roughly similar and the top-4 teams had stronger pairings.  I think a better example would be Alesi and Heidfeld in that awful Prost-00. Potentially 4th best driver lineup in the worst car on the grid.
> Lots of teams in the early 90s had stupendous driving talent but failed to prequalify.  Possibly none more so than the 1991 Lambo with Larini and van de Poele. Very rarely does official F1 material say something akin to "the team made their talented drivers look unworthy".
To be fair. Mansell is somewhere on par with Kimi and should've had more than one Championship, but circumstances prevented it. Not to mention he had to right Senna, Prost and Piquet during his years in a contending car.
Leclerc made miracles with that shitbox
Introducing a third axis: Leclerc and Sainz get special mention for 2022 having the best car, great drivers, and an absolute ham sandwich of a team.
Vettel checked out in 2020.
I disagree.Vettel had completely lost it by then. Leclerc almost managed to bag best of the rest with that car. Vettel was absolutely nowhere.
The 1997 ones are great calls.
There was a reason as to why Kimi was off the pace in 08.Ferrari went in the complete opposite direction when it comes to Kimi's car preference.They did this intentionally because they wanted to fire Raikkonen stating poor performance as the reason.  Alonso wanted in at Ferrari and was bringing big money with Santander but he didn't want be paired with a top level driver like Kimi after what happened in 2007.Kimi had a contract till the end of 2010 but Ferrari wanted him out before that.  Massa was never a top level driver.He was a Bottas at best in his peak.
I don't think 1997 is controversial tbh. Because every time we have a discussion about the season, the opinion is generally held that Villeneuve should have won it sooner and Newey plus Head believed it as well.   But 1997 is truly a year of wasted opportunities, isn't it? McLaren and Benetton could and should have won more races plus Jordan and Ligier probably should have won a race or so.
The 90s in particular are fascinating because the cars were pretty reliable, and you could clearly see the driver making a big difference. Schumi singlehandedly could bring you almost a second of the pace himself, something that is impossible in the modern F1.  It was also a period of non-star drivers in the best cars (mostly due to Williams philosophy on focusing on the car rather than the driver), resulting in title battles that never should've happened (94, 97, perhaps also 99)
> Apparently the Sauber engineers in 2012 felt they had a much better car than their drivers showed.  Not only their engineers. I think it was the general belief in the paddock. Alonso also said that someone like Michael Schumacher could have won a race or two with the car.
Gp 2 engine as a matter of fact
TBF Perez would have podiumed something like the last 4 races had he not kept getting unlucky.   But yeah, A top driver in Stroll's seat would have won Monza for sure and likely bagged up to half a dozen podiums.
Brown said later that McLaren owed P3 in the 2020 standings to the fact they had two drivers scoring points. Really absurd McLaren nicked that in retrospect.
Crazy how people underestimate 2020 Racing Point it was faster than Red Bull on several tracks but no Max there obviously.
They didn’t call it the Pink Mercedes for nothing.
It’s stupid to realize how low Racing point ended up finishing in constructors even after points deduction that year. It was better than even RB at many tracks yet none of the drivers were remotely close to Verstappen all year and they even finished behind Mclaren in constructors.
Honestly, I think that car may not have been that far off the Red Bull. Switch Verstappen and Stroll and that car is P2 in the constructors championship. Looking at the drivers other than Max, you have Checo with 125 points with 2 DNFs and 2 DNS due to covid. Albon at 105 with 2 DNFs. Stroll at 75 points with 5 DNFs and 1 DNS. So that's at least 2 fewer chances to score points for both Racing Point drivers.  That car would probably be considered second fastest if Max wasn't in the Red Bull and it was another midfield level driver.
It definitely would've been interesting to see a generational talent in that car, and whether it would've matched the RBs every weekend
People never bring this up. Knowing how big the gap is from Perez to Verstappen, imagine what verstappen to do in that car
Finally a good, recent answer to the “bad pair/good car” part of the question.
Definitely agree
I also believe that this was the case.RP would've benefited from a more consistent driver lineup.
>I'm convinced that car would've been regularly on the podium with a driver of Verstappen/Alonso/Hamilton's calibre  Well you can say that about literally any car though. For instance, I think Alpine drivers aren't getting the max out of their package. Put Verstappen in that Alpine and he'd be 7-8 tenths clear of both their drivers and will consistently finish P3-P5 every race.
Yeah I think this is the winner for good car that should have finished higher.  I don't dislike Damon or David and they have definitely shown in their careers they deserve to be in F1 but they gave Frank a very good reason to get rid of them after 1995/96.   Then again Williams was run so atrociously (at least according to quite a lot of the drivers like Webber and Button) that it surely must have played a role in their underperformance.
I honestly wonder if the 2020 Racing Point would be considered 2nd fastest if the driver lineups were different. Albon did worse than both Racing Point drivers, he beat Stroll by 30 championship points, but it was also 2 DNFs for Albon compared to 6 for Stroll.   Swap Verstappen and Stroll between the teams and I honestly think that with Verstappen/Perez the Racing Point would be considered 2nd fastest compared to 3rd fastest Red Bull with Albon/Stroll.  Drivers matter a lot in the perception of speed of a car.
I think folk felt Kovalainen had done enough to warrant a go. But yeah he didn't deliver.  Apparently they passed over Button for that season and obviously gave him a ring 2 years later.
Ricciardo-Verstappen was a scalding hot lineup for a while there, shame they never got to fight at the very front.
In hindsight of the better part of the 80s to come - sure. But on the other hand, it was only Piquet's first full season, and Lauda had already spent a season in a clearly non-championship contending car, slowly driving him to retirement.
Norris said that the he should've and could've scored points in all 3 of the races so far.Drivers errors and reliability issues are what held them back.The car is decent.Its the 6th fastest car after Alpine, a good deal quicker than the cars like the Haas.  Norris is great but we don't know how good  Piastri is just yet.There are plenty of GP2/F2 champs who failed in F1.
Too early to say what Piastri is. He got points in Australia largely due to penalties and crashes. Norris is also a very good driver, but think he's an A tier driver rather than an S tier one.
1 driver champion and the other one 1 point away (might be 2 DWC if Massa gets his way lol).  Sure maybe they should have won more clearly but the Ferrari was arguably faster than the mclarens
The Bellof Monaco experience was unique in that he was in the best car for the conditions, the turbo delivery is nothing like how it is today, anything but smooth, and the tyrrell was naturally aspirated which gave him more consistent delivery in the wet conditions
That rb is kinda wasted on perez tbh
Hill completely wasted that car, I also wonder what Ralf can do with that Jordan had he stayed.
Sure the Jordan competed against the McLaren and Ferrari on some tracks, but I don't think it could've posed a sustained challenge for the titles that year.
I'd disagree.  Whilst I won't contest that Frentzen's legacy is massively overstated thanks to that season, he was already very fortunate to be where he was between Mika's frequent mistakes and Schumacher's injury. But I mean, if you fluke your way into 2 wins via your main rival messing up and you still end up being 20 points down on Irvine whilst gathering a grand total of 3 front row starts all year, that's not all your fault.  Maybe if, as you've said it's Schumacher in the Jordan and he has no opposition. But that would have required Ferrari to not have a top driver and I'd say if Ralf was in the Ferrari that year he'd still have taken it over anyone in the Jordan.
>stroll in a big 3 car sticks out like a sore thumb  May I suggest you look at his quali and race pace gap to Alonso. He's not nearly as behind as people thought he'd be before the season began.
Stroll's not doing too bad, honestly. The quali and race pace data shows him and Alonso to be one of the closest pairings on the grid.  If we're talking about the midfield (outside of the front runners) I'd rate Norris higher but not sure who else. Piastri's only done 3 races and imho he only looked good in Jeddah. Gasly/Ocon? Still debatable.
'Strugglebus'. Never heard that saying before but perfectly sums up the car so far.  Brilliant!
He is a decent enough midfield driver but he definitely doesn't have what it takes to go up against guys like Max, Alonso, Lewis, Leclerc and George.  On his good days(which are rare) he should be capable of fighting the likes of Perez and Sainz.
Tell me you only read Reddit without telling me you only read reddit
Prost and Piquet's team mates had awful reliability though. Patrese had 10 mechanical failures. Cheever had 8. Both actually did well enough when their cars weren't breaking down.
I would agree with you, as not Mercedes had used lower engine modes those years to hide their real potential.
I like Perez but there’s at least four drivers on the grid (maybe six if you’re being generous/mean) who would have handily brought home #2 in the WDC last year. It’s odd to me that RB is potentially gambling the WCC on if there’s a close season or not.
-00 cars weren't really tractors but god damn did they manage to fail in some way. I mean sure, some cars weren't cars you could challenge for championships but they were still up there.
i think kimi was getting close to the maximum out of those 2012-2013 lotus cars, he only ever finished outside the points three times (china 2012, spa 2013, monza 2013) and those were due to botched strategy, reliability, and monza t1 chaos
Is Merce struggling?? They’re not at the RB pace but uhh P2 P3 not a struggle
I really wouldn’t say stroll is below averag
I’m a bit disapointed by this pair:Hulk have fantastic qualy pace but bad starts where he lost the benefit and KMag seems to bad qualify and start too far for good results with his race pace.
Stroll had the pace to battle Ferrari and would have easily been up to third or 4th in Saudi before his engine went. He’s not been bad this year tbf.
I agree, especially since we don't have any Mazepin/Latifi level drivers in F1 anymore. But I legitimately think Alonso in the Aston could give De Vries and Sargeant (rookies) in a Red Bull a run for their money.
I don’t see how you can mention ferrari and not Mercedes. Lewis and george are a far better lineup in a worse car
Same for benetton in 1996, I don't believe the car was actually that bad, just alesi couldn't extract the most out of it. Probably not the best car with the worst drivers, since there are a ton of worse drivers than them both
This kind of take should honestly get you banned lol.
No
Are you joking or not? I can’t tell
Trulli had pace in that Toyota, fucking Trulli man.
Toyota could have won races even with Trulli and Glock tbf (both of whom I think are underrated) but self-sabotaged on several occasions. Bahrain 2009 is probably the best example where they locked out the front row (even fuel adjusted) but then were the only frontrunners to go for the alternate strategy for some reason which made them an absolute sitting duck in the middle stint.
2012 was crazy.  Over half the grid had a car capable of winning on any given weekend.  The six different teams that did win, plus the Sauber that would have if Checo didn't screw up at Sepang.
The thing about 2012 is that car performance in the first half of the season was very limited by the tyres. Hence the seven different winners in the first seven races. The tyres were unpredictable so if a team got them in the right window they had a massive advantage, which is what Williams managed in Spain that year.
Barrichello had been barely better than Maldanado the season before. His time had passed by 2012.
I have no brakes, no tires, we are out of the points, we can try for whatever but i don’t care too much
I remember Button on Rosberg's podcast or something talking about how Alonso would just fake a mechanical issue and retire if he was running behind him. Wasn't there a race at Spa where the mechanics said there was nothing wrong with the car or something?
So did Button too due to the loss of his father
Source?
Wasted? They won races and JPM challenged for the title in 2003.
If anything they left wasted potential in the Williams. They were too focused on fighting with each other both on & off track & not enough on working to try & help the team take on Ferrari.
They were until recently competing for fourth place though???
Their problem was managing a racing team as if it was a car company, every decision had to go through too many hands. By the time they upgraded a part, Ferrari and McLaren had gone by 5 or 6 upgrades already.
Webber had been offered a Renault and McLaren drive in late '04.  Hardly green.  Rosberg was at least as good as Gasly's strong rookie year.
Webber not so much, he was already blooded in WEC and a factory Mercedes driver before moving to F1.   Rosberg though I'll 100% agree, rook as
Alesi and Heidfeld sounds like a solid midfield lineup.
It wasn’t the best car throughout the year. RB was dominant in the second half. But yeah I get your point. Ferrari as a team fucked up with a great car and drivers.  Another such example if you introduce such axis is Mclaren 2012 - that car was fast and it had a star double WDC pairing of Hamilton and Button but Mclaren screwed up itself with shit strategies, reliability and pitstops. It’s sad that Hamilton couldn’t contend for WDC till the end of the year against Vettel and Alonso could with slightly slower car.
The F1-75 was the better car in Bahrain, Australia, Monaco, Austria, maybe Barcelona and Silverstone, and that's about it. Rest of the year it was fast on saturday, but had awful tyre deg and couldn't even touch Red Bull.
Hahahahahaha
Yes he sucked that year but I don’t think he suddenly lost his talent. He did well in Aston 2 years after that. 2020 was a weird year for him. Ferrari dumped him and he got a bad treatment and terrible car in his last year at a team he loved whole heartedly.
Can't blame him "we are checking"
Can't blame him with the state of the team
Slight counterpoint for Stroll; he would've won Turkey had his car not get fucked up, and he did struggle after his COVID break. And he got hit with quite a bit of bad luck as well.
Tbf they finished behind mclaren because of the bullshit point deduction. They earned the third place
Yep. And look at the gap between Verstappen and Albon and between Verstappen and Pérez (in a much more forgiving car). Albon was routinely half a second off of Max, and Checo is routinely 3-5 tenths off of Max.   It’s hard to claim that Checo was significantly better than Alex, so it’s very difficult to say that Checo’s additional 20 points on two fewer starts and two fewer finishes is due to driver quality.
It certainly would. In fact, it did most of the time if you consider Albon vs the Racing Points. Swap Stroll and Verstappen and the conversation on which was the second and third fastest team would almost certainly be flipped.
Honestly believe that if the Racing Point & McLaren driver lineups had been in each other’s cars in 2020 then RP would have run away with third & McLaren would have finished 5th behind Renault.
Lauda would still win a championship in 1984 so he definitely didn’t lose any of his pace.  I can see what you mean with Piquet, but he matched Lauda with a 4th place finish in a race as a best race finish that season. Lauda had 4 points vs his 3.   Both had *11* dnf’s which is what killed their season completely.
I think the vast majority were not given fair shots. Namely, Vandoorne and Mick Schumacher. I believe if they were given longer both could have been phenomenal drivers, especially Vandoorne
Australia points were make up points from when Piastri qualified 8th in Saudi in his second ever quali only to be ruined by Gaslys run of crashing into and ruining races.
The 08 Ferrari had a big advantage on the McLaren that season. One of their drivers should have cruised to the title.
That is true tho.
Hill retired completely healthy cars on some occasions that season, absolute waste of a top seat
Frentzen was barely better than Trulli in 2000 and handily beaten by him year later. Alonso was permanently quicker than Trulli in races when they were teammates, and it wasn't even prime Alonso.   Driver of Schumacher calibre could have won title in Jordan, especially in rare circumstances in 1999 with Schumacher out and McLaren plagued with bad reliability and driver errors
Stroll faired well against Vettel, if inconsistent. He’s developed quite a lot as a driver from his meme era. He wouldn’t be anyone’s first option, but this year he’s surprised me a lot so far.
Let's not forget he was injured during testing and the first race. He gets way to much shit around here.
Strolls always been fast, he just needs bigger mirrors.
Stroll racecraft is average at best, basically a magnet for accidents
>Stroll's not doing too bad, honestly. The quali and race pace data shows him and Alonso to be one of the closest pairings on the grid.  Considering Stroll missed all of testing and has 2 broken wrist, he's been very impressive
It's convenient that they forget his teammate was a 4 time world champion and now a 2 time world champion (who has the talent to have more than 4). Those are hard teammates to look good against. He's done well for himself, he's always close.
Had Stroll made it through a race without hitting someone yet?
thats what im saying. he belongs in the midfield, its weird to see him up at the top when there's plenty more deserving drivers on the grid
I think 5 minimum is safe (Charles, Lewis, George, Lando, Fernando), I'd also say Sainz would have been 2nd, despite the poor form he had and the mistakes he has better raw pace and probably makes up for it
they are behind AM in the WCC standings, something they didn’t even manage last season. Only reason they are third is due to Ferrari shitting the bed worse than they are.
Yes, I agree. But as far as the top teams go, their lineup is probably the least good. Close though
Honestly, I wouldn't be too sure about that. But unfortunately we will never find out :D
But the Merc is faster than the Ferrari? Well there's not heaps in it so far but they can finish races at least. Fair shout though
Hey, Trulli was an underrated driver. He kept up with Alonso while they were teammates. Toyota wouldn’t have that many podiums in F1 without Trulli.
Hulkenburg winning at Brazil wasn't out of the question either.
While this is true, Maldonado qualified in the top 3 on 5 separate occasions in 2012. That's more than Alonso managed in the Ferrari.  The car was good, but Maldonado was crash prone and inconsistent (and on most of the occasions where he had pace and didn't crash out, reliability struck) and Senna was just plain slow which prevented it from being shown other than in Spain.
Alonso, inters or wets?  Mate, it's raining, you can put a rocketship on the back and we'll still be eleventh  (I think it was during a Q2)
Sad part is that this was in 2018. Full 4 seasons of accomplishing fuck all at the back.
That was at the start of 2014
Radio
Also curious to see this source lol
It still feels wasted the Ferrari dominance era was pretty bulletproof
Bloody hell ! And he chose to drive for teams like Jaguar and Williams ??
Button and Hamilton retired after every single one of their wins in 2012.   They won 7 times.
Maybe redbull have better drivers and leclerec just isn’t great on race pace.
Could the ferrari have kept up & developed the same was as Red Bull did, however. Would come down to better management
You've got to add Hungary(Leclerc was flying before he was given the hards) and Canada where both teams could have challenged for the win. Pre TD39 it was a competitive season between RB and Ferrari however blunders and reliability made it to be a one sides fight. TD39 killed any competitiveness before the summer break.
Canada as well
Swap Silverstone with Canada and France.  Max was going to run away with Silverstone until his issue.
Nah Silverstone the RB was faster, Max just had problems and Checo isn't a good benchmark
But if you remember he was also struggling just like in 2020 until probably Monaco where it finally clicked again. Stroll was crushing him at the start of 2021 on pace, while Seb was quite disappointing considering his track record
Hamilton finished 30s ahead of Perez, there's no way he's not getting past both Racing Points in that race
He would have won turkey if his team listens to him  He suggested the winning strategy, people shit talked him like he doesnt know what he's talking about, meanwhile hamilton went with the same strat and won easily
2022 Verstappen would crush 2020 Verstappen and eat him.
Disagree. I don't believe anyone is entitled to "a fair shot in at least an average car" (not saying this is your argument, but this is what I frequently see from Mick truthers). I think a good young driver should still be able to show enough in a bad car with more than a one season opportunity (I.e. Russell was already showing serious promise in an absolutely dreadful Williams halfway through his rookie year). I think Piastri has already shown an example of really good quali pace in Jeddah and good race pace in Melbourne just 3 races into his career.
Yeah I agree. It's unfair. His real test will begin race 4 (Baku?) onwards where he'd have fully recuperated and there'll be upgrades too I think. I do think that the gap will teeter around 2 tenths which is great if Lance sorts out his consistency issues.
He’s always going to get shit because he seat is only because daddy bought the team, and it’s deserved. He’s been in the field for how many years and is still only ‘decent’
He's had precisely one race where he got in an accident that was his fault and it was the first race of the season when he had just come back after no testing and a terrible injury. I get not liking him, but this comment is unwarranted.
Sainz has been disappointing so far
>Toyota wouldn't have that many pole positions in F1 without Trulli.  FIFY  Trulli was a very capable driver, yes. He shone way more in regards of one lap pace and defense rather than pure race pace, though. The Trulli Train came to be for a reason. Of course he earned his podiums in that car, just like some of his team mates, but let's be real, Toyotas cars were at times good enough to gain any good driver a few podiums.
I don't remember a race where he had any pace in the Renault. He was a qualifier, the guy was fast around a lap outqualifying Alonso and Kimi at times, but usually with lower fuel. When Kobayashi made his debut in the Toyota he outshone him right out. Having said that, he is definitely remembered unlike others.
I try three times already, so try yourself.
Two championships, a decade of shitboxes, back on the podium regularly 20 years on, Fernando’s resolve is legendary
But from his book, IIRC he said he started wondering if it was still all worth it from 2015 onwards
What?
He was offered Renault and Williams as options coming out of 2 years at jaguar (03 and 04). 02 was his rookie year in minardi. Flavio briatore tried to convince him that Renault was the best choice (it was - see alonso titles), but Williams was actually an ok choice then. In 03 it was a proven front runner and fighting with Ferrari, 2nd in constructors on the back of a 3rd, 3rd and 2nd before that. It was also a very competitive car throughout the 90s. Webber had wanted to drive for Williams since he was a kid, plus potentially didn’t want a friendship with alonso to be ruined being team mates.   Williams 2003 year was actually very good, albeit eclipsed by Ferrari and 2004 they scraped a win and a few podiums. Williams would have been see as a “top drive” compared to the jaguar which was awful. Unfortunately it was the relationship between BMW (who was producing the best engine at that point) and frank Williams that is said to have gotten in the way of car development.
Checo also got rammed by Carlos at the start, mind.
It seemed to me like he stopped trying. Just see the races after he announced his retirement and you'll see a massive difference.
Nah. 2022 Verstappen and 2020 Verstappen (and in general post-Monaco-2018 Verstappen) was the exact same driver. He was easily the best driver on the grid in 2019 and 2020.
Wasn’t he the one that tangled with Leclerc this weekend also? 90% sure he was.  Was it “his fault” maybe, maybe not, but that’s 2 or 3 races he’s been involved in contact with another driver.
Car feels good, much slower than before
He was on different planet after that, and had Stroll easily in his pocket. It felt like the old Vettel
Leclerc literally drove into the side of Stroll. It absolutely wasn't Lance's fault. Saying stuff like "he's been in accidents 2 out of 3 races" without looking at the proper context is pointless.
How is that admitting to phoning the season in?
It’s just “odd” that he always seems to find contact with other drivers.  Seldom in F1 is it “100%” one drivers fault. Was it 80% Leclerc fault? Probably. But put Hamilton on his side and I bet Hamilton avoids the contact.    Stroll has more talent than most Pay Drivers we’ve seen in recent times but he does not have the sheer talent to be on the grid if daddy doesn’t own the team.
Gasly nearly got a raceban this weekend, he only got lucky that he took out his teammate. Stroll didn't even have the worst contact this weekend, people just focus more on him because he's a pay driver.
Nice “whataboutism”. We aren’t talking about Gasly.    So far this year for Stroll.   Race 1, nearly takes himself and his teammate out.  Otherwise has a decent race and takes arguably the second or third best car to a 6th place finish. Grade: C   Race 2, mechanical DNF - Grade: I   Race 3, contact early with Leclerc, runs most the race around 5th or 6th.  Loses contact late with Ferrari and Alpine with DRS.  Avoids major contact on last standing restart but nearly has an unforced error in turn 3? And is lucky to get car back to pits where he is reset back into the points and finishes up from 6th to 4th because of a penalty and crash.  Grade: C+  For someone with 6 years on the grid and access to top level training, he is, at most, a “capable” driver.
Not really what aboutism because if you put everything into context stroll is doing pretty good. Good race and overtakes in Bahrain, pace almost matching alo in jeddah and in terms of pace australia was probably his worst weekend but he didn't really make any substantial mistakes compared to other around him and that's what got him a p4. Considering alonso is seen as a potential challenger to max, the same max who has demolished rather competent drivers like checo last year and gasly, stroll isn't doing too badly at all.

Never understood why Petronas is not more involved at Sepang. You'd think a massive Malaysian company that is already involved in F1, with 80b+ in yearly revenue, would be a bigger partner.   I know the govt owns Petronas, but it's still odd the company and the track don't have a closer relationship.
yea i cant afford the races either buddy
As a Malaysian who's in the sports industry, as much as I want Sepang to come back, our other sports are very very underfunded and not managed properly until Minister Hannah Yeoh took over the portfolio. I have friends who have played in multiple Olympic Games, Asian Games, Southeast Asian Games and etc that aren't earning enough to survive the rising living costs. Most of us have more than one part-time job (I certainly do..)  Locally, [Petronas has been investing more into our badminton team](https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/sports/2022/03/04/bam-ink-biggest-sponsorship-deal-with-petronas/) (badminton is arguably our number one sport asides football but I would wager more people from the general public watch badminton than football). Awhile ago [Petronas even did a fan event with our Men's Doubles World Champions Aaron Chia/Soh Wooi Yik with Lewis and George in KLCC](https://www.thestar.com.my/sport/others/2022/09/30/look-up-to-lewis). My friends in the badminton association met Lewis and all.  Petronas has been [going all out with the merchandise with modern designs & affordable working class prices](https://www.setel.com/PETRONAS-Shop/category/shuttlehearts?page=1&perPage=12&minPrice=0) (their designs are really good.. I bought a lot..). Nowadays when the public think of Petronas and sports, they associate it with badminton instead of MotoGP or Formula 1.  But I did notice an uptick in the youth following Formula 1 because of DtS. Some of them plan on figuring out a way to bring back Sepang eventually in our lifetime. How is another question haha. Maybe in 20 years? It won't be anytime soon bc we're still dealing with the fall out of 1MDB and Covid-19 lockdown debt (1MDB happened when I was applying for university and my batch all lost scholarships because of 1MDB).
I loved Sepang.   The newer fans are missing out on some great races on a great track.   I recommend going back and watching some if you're interested.
It's the reality. But man I would love to see that track on the calendar again.
1MDB really fucked things up for Malaysia.
Saudi should spend some of the F1 money on upgrading Sepang and buying the naming rights etc.  I mean, if they want to continue their sportswashing project, stuff like that is probably a decent idea even.
Malaysian here. i think currently, reviving SIC for F1 is REALLY not in our plan in the few years to come. our main sports are football and badminton. heck, we have grassroots for both sports. it’s easy to get into, and it’s not that expensive.  F1 however, has little market share here. gokart tracks are scarce and it’s so expensive to get into. when there’s little interest in motorsports locally, it all comes down to tourism. but Malaysia & Singapore is too close to each other, and most tourists can only afford to go to one of them. with better nightlife and unique night race, people tend to go for Singapore GP, for sure  fans are steadily rising, due to DtS, but it’s still not enough to generate the urge by the government to inject funds into SIC, since it’s better to put those money to improve our football stadiums and badminton courts
Damm, do those bikes look cool.
I went to my first race last year at COTA. Front row main grandstand was $650 per ticket for the weekend. Went to get the same seats this year, and the ticket price quite literally doubled. $1300 per ticket for the weekend. With the popularity in the states growing so much even just a year, I can’t even imagine what prices will be in the next few years.
Maybe if 1Malaysia wasn’t a financial black hole…
No shit
For some reason, I want a "TMJ" person with a lot of money just to fund for Sepang to be race on again. I know Johor already has a sport car team and doing great too.
Well yeah, its a giant commercial for Mercedes, Aston Martin, Ferrari, McLaren, etc...
Looking back at the origin with Toffs using abandoned airstrip as race tracks......you can deduce that iteration it has finally become, originated in privilege.
The cost of hosting an F1 race is an investment that eventually repays itself for the most part.  I'm guessing it's just a bad look for a politician to bring up spending loads of money on F1 in a relatively poor country.
The sky is blue
The way things are, we'd be lucky to be back in F1 as soon as 2030.  Not even the state-owned Petronas would be willing to throw so much cash for a GP and the return is low.
Agree. Well said.
> I mean, congrats to them for putting their citizens needs above the entertainment value of Formula 1.  A more cynical person would say they're making a populist decision to keep favour with the public.   F1 costs a lot on paper, but when you take everything into account it's not as expensive and it would be a big boost for the country.  I'm assuming a politician saying "hey lets spend tens of millions of dollars on F1" wouldn't do their career any favours.
Petronas scaled back from MotoGP as well which was weird to see coz that completely destroyed Razlan Razali’s team.
It is kind of weird because Petronas is like the biggest sponsor in F1. SIC however is a private company but still needing Government fund to work.
Well they are the new title sponsor for the Malaysian MotoGP Grand Prix, and the current Sepang CEO is formerly from Petronas. But in the end it's a complex web of what is the best for everyone.   Also Sepang was linked to the family of the former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad, who is not in the good books of mostly every other politician, the government AND the opposition included. Dato Razlan Razali, the former CEO and currently the head of the RNF MotoGP team is Mahathir's nephew, and up to a few years back, Mokhzani, Mahathir's son was Sepang's Chairman.   Also weirdly enough, Sepang Circuit is under the purview of the Malaysian Ministry of Finance, but receives funding from the Ministry of Sports.  In the end Petronas also has to answer to it's own boards of directors, and the covid years were not great to Petronas, which means they had to cut down on their MotoGP participation to keep their relationship with Mercedes/F1. Most of their profits from that time was diverted by the government to funding the Malaysians citizens with help during the pandemic. It was only recently that they were posting record profits again.
THIS. And we don't here a peep about them hollering from the rooftops when Merc was dominating the sport. Maybe they're afraid of the citizens' backlash if they know Petronas is a title sponsor for one of the biggest teams on the grid and yet didn't do much to help Sepang get a spot on the calendar.
>Never understood why Petronas is not more involved at Sepang. You'd think a massive Malaysian company that is already involved in F1, with 80b+ in yearly revenue, would be a bigger partner.   One word my friend, corruption.
This is the chance for the increase of outside tourists to come in Malaysia. That's the only benefits I think of other than Malaysia has more exposure.
WEC gives better spectacle
Reminds me of sometimes Lewis Hamilton came to Malaysia usually for Petronas related programs and always be seen with Malaysian fans. Remember last year Lewis Hamilton sitting on chair meme? I could say they are still Malaysian that knows F1 and Lewis Hamilton despite not having race on Sepang.
Beijing too. That snail turn 1 might be the best thing Tilke ever came up with - and I say that as somebody who loves Tilke and recognizes his enormous contributions to circuit design, especially with his early designs.
Me too
That probably minor thing.
Petronas could continue their own sportswashing project and invest into Sepang more so people forget about their Sudanese war crimes
Yeah, SIC should get outside sponsors more. More sponsors mean more money to the circuit. They can't only hope for Government fund only. I heard of discussion with Marina Bay circuit for collaboration and potentially can help Sepang on the calendar again but sacrifice Marina Bay instead. Maybe like 2 years of Marina Bay and 1 year of Sepang.
The reason a lot of tracks exist and go for races is that they are funded by the government to stimulate the economy. If Saudi wants to own a race they want a clear stand alone profit from it
Saudis are taking note
That wouldn't be a bad idea.
Huh?
And an energy drinks company
All brands that don't need to advertise lol
Imagine Sepang in Johor tho and see how the money flow. Johor has a sport car team that doing great and of course this is their chance to make a home circuit too.
Say that to when Germany made the decision to switch between hockenheim and Nurburgring and now don’t have a race, Spa, all tracks that don’t benefit that much from the race.
My guy, it wouldn’t be expensive if people actually watched.
>Maybe they're afraid of the citizens' backlash if they know Petronas is a title sponsor for one of the biggest teams on the grid and yet didn't do much to help Sepang get a spot on the calendar.  Believe me, people know that, and aren't that angry about(I live here). The fans here are educated enough to know that while it feels good to have a race here, the economy aren't that great here to do races for the expensive one like F1.  And car racing isn't that big here, so people doesn't notice the absence of F1 that much. Especially since MotoGP(which have a bigger fanbase here) is still here racing at Sepang.
I'm sure there's plenty of corruption, but that doesn't really play a role here. In fact with corruption it'd be more like giving track maintenance to some external company that happened to be friends with a board member, and asks 4 times as much as it would cost.
Malaysia is already among the top 20 most visited countries in the world. Only ASEAN country to beat it is Thailand.
All of south east Asia has a good tourism market, especially Malaysia.
Isn’t the tourism industry really strong in Malaysia? My view might be skewed as a Muslim because everyone I know loves Malaysia bc beautiful country + abundant Halal food.
Tilke created some boring tracks but I feel there’s a huge list of tracks that were also pretty good for racing. Off the top of my head: Istanbul, Korea, Sepang, Shanghai, Budh International etc. are very good. Sadly only Shanghai remains in calendar.
Not at all.  The 1MDB fallout has massively tarnished investor confidence. It’s not just they lost a boatload of money, some of those money were tied to investment/infrastructure projects that is getting abandoned or had to take on new debts to complete.   https://asia.nikkei.com/Opinion/1MDB-trial-shows-the-depths-of-Malaysia-s-economic-woes  https://www.aljazeera.com/amp/economy/2020/12/15/post-1mdb-scandal-indonesias-new-fund-to-highlight-transparency
I think he’s referring to the 1MDB scandal, massive scam  cost the Malaysian government heaps of money.
I guess the original is taking about [1MDB scandal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1Malaysia_Development_Berhad)
He’s referring to the Malaysian sovereign wealth fund. 1 billion dollar embezzled to be spent as personal slush fund by the previous prime minister and his cronies.
Basically rewind to 2010-2013.  1Malaysia (1mdb) was funding the Lotus(Caterham) team, Lotus cars buyout, Caterham cars buyout.  And now 💸 it’s all gone with not even a legacy.
Why not?
To have an F1 race you gotta pay a minimum amount of RM100 million per year which naturally translates to higher priced tickets.  Of course I'd be thrilled to have F1 back but at the moment it's not doable and profitable.  And our current government, they're trying to stabilise things first before looking at things like F1.
You make zero sense, F1 has higher average viewing figures than the Premier League, NBA etc
Actually, cancel the 2nd half of my statement, that's actually my personal beef with Petronas. Lol. I mean to say the citizens might be angry at Petronas for being a title sponsor quietly even though on the surface, everyone thought we have zero involvement in F1 now that Sepang is no longer hosting a race since 2018.
Interesting, I would’ve thought Indonesia would beat it. Good to know though.
Tourism is strong in Malaysia, but most of it aren't because of motorsports.  MotoGP is probably the only big international motorsports here atm because it's much cheaper to run and easy to enter competitively compared to car racing.   Any type of car racing(even in low tier) are barely alive here.
And Shanghai still hasn’t been raced since the pandemic started despite technically being on the calendar.   That said, Bahrain, COTA, and Jeddah are bangers. And so is Baku even though being a street circuit he had less impact on its design.
Blame the Government after that Government I guess. If Merdeka 118 not nearly finish, it would be cancelled too.
They're an oil company. There's oil in South Sudan. Petronas had/have operations there. South Sudan was/is at war with Sudan(the country it seceded from)
Because if you want any of those brands, you go get it.  Nobody is sitting on the couch watching a race and goes "Huh, I should go check out a Ferrari..." lol
Good move for Najib for stop funding for F1 for the time been. It is like he is predicting the future or something.
Did you ask every Malaysian? The ones who are supposed to buy the circuit tickets if Sepang actually returns?
Just want to ask, are you Malaysian?
Does size have anything to do with it? I feel like Indonesia might be too big, so it's not easy for people to experience stuff without splurging more money on transportation. Malaysia's map is much more petite, so a lot of tourists attractions are probably in closer vicinity, making it easier to get the full experience.
Marketing genius
Not cars. But thinking like you is like what messed up United colors of Benneton. Such a big brand in the 90s that now no one cares even though their clothes are high quality.   Marketing is always important. And all those big brands benefit from it. Otherwise they wouldn’t be doing it. everyone knows Coca Cola or McDonald’s and they still invest massively in marketing.
I mean, when the revenue is getting lower each year, that's the natural course of action.
The tickets aren't being sold to or targeted at "every Malaysian"
Yups.
Just go to popular places in Indonesia I guess
Ahh no no, they are working in a region with warcrimes, and I think they got accused by the international media for that   I'm just giving you the image in simple terms
You've never seen a Ferrari or Lamborghini commercial. Ever.   For a reason.  But sure, I'm the problem...
Please explain the declining Sepang ticket sales up until 2017 then.  Edit: Guy really just blocked me lmao.
Which state do you live in? I'm kinda curious because your perspective feels very different compared to mine, despite both of us living in the same country lol.
They don’t advertise to you, specifically. McLaren or Lamborghini isn’t gonna buy a Super Bowl spot, they’re gonna target their clientele.
Lamborghini advertises with sponsorships merchandise,concept cars, high profile events etc. you can Google this shit instead of being arrogant  https://luxuryviewer.com/why-doesnt-lamborghini-advertise-on-tv/
The 2017 Malaysian Grand Prix had a significantly higher attendance than the 2016 Malaysian Grand Prix, which had a bigger attendance than the 2015 Malaysian Grand Prix.  And since F1 is a lot bigger now than in 2017 it would be again much bigger than that if it were held now...  Bro, if you have no clue what you're talking about, it's ok to just not comment instead of making things up and embarrassing yourself.
Penang. People around me (even those who watches F1) don't like the gov to bring back F1. They say it's a waste of money. That's why I said Petronas tries to keep it hush-hush about their involvement with Merc for fear of backlash from the rakyat, we don't hear them promoting their 8-time WCC in those Petronas ads, right? Heck, I don't think non-f1 fans in Msia know we sponsored one of the most successful teams in recent F1 history. But the Gen Z/millennials online (esp F1twt and redditors) love F1 to be back. That's why I'm angry that why they can sponsor Merc but not SIC.
I agree with that.
So then I'm right, they don't have commercials... Got it.  Basically everything you mentioned, you don't have access to unless you're a client already... But carry on...
I mean you all make weird assumptions:  \- Having a F1 race has astronomical costs, a "good ROI" is impossible unless you're prepared to spend a lot of money for just exposure (Middle East)  \- The populist decision would always be hosting a F1 race. Because there is no good ROI how it reflects on politicians becomes valuable, hence populism.  \- Attendance is one of the least of cost/benefit issues, even with full attendance all weekend a GP would still not break even.  \- Viewership is even less of an issue, an extra 20 million Malaysian viewers compared to like 1 billion viewers worldwide would hardly give more media rights income.  So I'm glad for the Malaysian population that they don't spend anything on improving the track, and use taxpayer money to improve urgent issues. It's like a fresh breeze of air seeing a politician talking sense.
No. You’re just being sad at this point. Your original point was: “ All brands that don’t need to advertise lol”. They do need to advertise. Just not commercials.   Just because you move the goal posts doesn’t make you less wrong. But I guess you just win whatever virtually argument so go ahead. Take the cookie. 🍪
Not having commercials doesn't mean they don't still need to advertise. The point of the person you responded to was that their advertising just looks different than other commercial brands.
K
Publicity isn't advertising.  They don't advertise their cars. The cars advertise themselves. Period. Not sure why some are so Intent on arguing this.

> Through Albert Park's fastest speed trap – at the second intermediate timing point – he was 17th fastest, logging 314.2 km/h compared to the 339.9 km/h of the fastest car, the Red Bull of Sergio Perez.  kind reminder they run the same engine💀
I still can hear "them" saying it previous year: "Our car next year would be the best we made!".
All those Japanese fans with rear wing hats are going to be devastated to hear this.
You've heard of No Sidepods, now get ready for No Wing
Would drinking a Red Bull before a corner constitute a moveable aero device?
Incoming no wing at Monza
Go Peugeot HyperCar no wing style then
So who's leaving RB to go to AT on the engineering side?
Tsunoda suggesting f1 game strategies lmfao
So the Honda engine is not what gives the RB such a huge advantage :-)
Yuki, I'm afraid they can't run without a wing
That's why Tost doesn't trust his designers and engineers.
Red Bull gives you...
“Rear wings are for people who can build engines”  ~ Enzo Ferrari, probably
Red Bull gives you wings, why turn them down?
If I was a Redbull exec, I'd 100% force AT to use as many parts, as legally allowed, from the main team. This trying their own dumb shit is clearly not working, and AT engineers and management needs a kick to bring their egos down a notch.
If Aston Martin got "from zero to hero" by "stealing" RB number 2 aero guy, how come AlphaTauri is so bad?  Can't Adrian Newey just stop by on a Monday morning for some quick advise and give AlphaTauri some tenths on their pace?
I don't know about no rear wing but when I saw Albon with no front wing I kinda liked it, it reminded me of the late 70s, early 80s cars. In fact, the Arrows A2 looked like it has no rear wing from certain angles.
Baku is going to be fun for them…
Alpha Tarui need to sell the team.
Clearly they already tested this at Baku last year…
And also to people saying that RBPT is the most powerful by a bit.
Yep. And kind reminder they deliberatly chose for 2023 to not buy certain parts from Red Bull that they could legally, like Haas purchased from Ferrari, because they wanted to persue their own aero and they claimed that they could better design and integrate it into their car then last minute Red Bull designs.   They probably regret doing that.   https://www.racefans.net/2022/11/05/racefans-round-up-05-11-5/
Did Yuki run any DRS? Because I imagine Perez’s number is with DRS.
Top speed is mainly aero limited.Travelling at 300+  speeds you need a substantial amount of hp to gain atleast a few more kph over that.(around x4 times more than normal)  RB has the better engine and Ferrari has the better ERS but all the manufacturers are quite close in terms of raw power output.RBs secret is in its aero.
GP2 engine
jody egg-on-my-face
But too bad Yuki, Red Bull gives you wings
Peugeot did it first
Probably since it gives you wings...
That thing looks so weird
Sebring BoP was terrible, but Peugeot seemed quite shocking during the race...
Nobody but RB might forget to rub some stuff out on the whiteboard when AT is borrowing their wind tunnel
It’s the wings man
Did anyone really think that though? I think the only thing separating any of the 4 engines are reliability.  And I think F1 and the FIA knew this was gonna happen with how specific the regs are and the fact that they were fine with freezing the engines with the exception of reliability upgrades for 4 seasons
Honda in 2021 brought a 2022 spec engine because they thought this would be the last year. So you can argue that 2021 engine was a slight advantage. But comparing the Honda and Mercedes engine in 2021 they both seemed pretty equally matched. I’m not exactly sure how the engine freeze works so idk if the engines are exactly the same spec as they are then or if they can improve the engine.
Yup. While power is helpful, it hits more on acceleration. Top speed is more about aero efficiency / aerodynamics driven (see Williams vs AM, both Merc engines)
Having the best engine doesn't mean a lot, look about Williams vs Mercedes in 2020.
There's no weak engine on the grid at the moment. All are fairly equal. Aero efficiency is important now, and both AlphaTauri and McLaren are pretty bad. The Aston isn't great but produces loads of grip in return.
One thing RB and the disparity between Williams and the other teams is proving is that top speed has a lot less to do with the engine than people think.
I doubt there's more than ~15hp between all engines. Such a difference is aero-driven. RB probably has a very efficient car while AT has a very inefficient one.
Their hybrid engine is definitely fastest and Ferrari has the best ICE-Turbo
I think one of the key aspects why RBR is so strong is because both RBR and AM are running with a floor who is 10mm lower then everyone else.
Helmut recently talked about how he's not impressed with AT's performance especially since they don't get all the parts they can from RB.  Doesn't sound good for the higher ups at AT.
AT has more likely also a higher up ego issues, the AT04 is an evolution of the AT03 what was also a pure shitbox.
He did, but the cars in front had so much straight line speed that he barely had any time to spend in drs range.
Not really relevant in this case but Perez with DRS just flew by Piastri with DRS. That was funny to see.
Amazing.
At least Yuki scored a point, what would likely be a rare outcome for the team because the car is again one big shitbox.   Baku is likely going to be a disaster for the team if you look to speed.
I love it, looks aggressive as hell and massively different from the others
Eh, it's a ground effect car around the bumpiest track you'll come across  Their reliability is a bigger worry
Ah the ol’ Haas-Ferrari trick. Although they have people moving between the teams too
It's literally Newey. He fucking hates air. Racist against air.
HRC's F1 head did say at the beginning of this year that they had a ["clear advantage" in MGU-K deployment over the others.](https://www.racefans.net/2023/02/22/racefans-round-up-22-02-6/) Considering how F1 personnel are usually inclined to downplay their cars' performance, I'm inclined to believe it when someone actually does come out and say their car (or engine, in this case) has an advantage over the competition.
Iirc Williams usually have/had one of the highest speed traps tho? They had issues in corners
I think what /u/IWillKeepIt is saying is that this top speed is 17th due to their abysmal aero inefficiency despite having the best engine. Might not be 100% clear. It would be even worse if they had say a Renault PU.
https://imgur.com/EjxDBbd.jpg the Williams had similar top speeds though and have had the fastest top speed here and there ever since they've focused on being more "slippery". The alpha tauri is slow at top speed, slow on corners, slow at everything
It does if the gap is big enough.   The engine gaps are very small now, so engine supplier isn't that big of a deal anymore.   It was in 2014.
In fairness, Williams had great results in 2014-2016 with Bottas and Massa in large part to the dominant Mercedes engine. Once other manufacturers caught up somewhat they fell way down the order.
That's mostly because the engines are all so close now. The top speed difference between engines was pretty significant still in 2014-2016, but that gap has long since come down.  The few HP difference there is now, has almost no impact on top speed.
It's not. The car itself is just very efficient.
Shitbox + Shitbox = Not a much better shitbox
Haas "we have an office in the Ferrari space. It is one floor up and overlooks the Ferrari engineers... W floor to ceiling glass window. And a budget item for binoculars"
I agree with you.   What is important here is that Honda F1's chief himself said it in public.   It is not a “leaked by an engineer” or “said by a competitor” like the Ferrari PU related information.
As a general rule, more downforce in corners creates more drag on the straights. Efficiency is where you can get more downforce for a comparatively smaller increase in drag.   Williams haven’t had the resources to develop an efficient high downforce package for a while now. A lot of times they turn up with a car that isn’t producing all that much downforce, but is very good at also not making not much drag. Hence they are amazing on the straights, very difficult to overtake, but not great in corners. Hence Monza last year for example. Expect Baku to be pretty decent as well  Red Bull on other hand have a very very efficient package. Excellent in corners, and also excellent on straights. Just all round better car than most
Mostly. There's no best engine now though.
You’re saying they’re the poor man’s Mercedes?
Yeah, the overall difference between factory and customer engines is in the hundredths/low (.1/.2) tenths of a second. Which is acceptable IMO. Aero/car design, strategy, driver skill is more than enough to make that up and then some.  Edit: you were talking about engine manufacturers, oops. Either way just apply what I said to your point and it still stands in my opinion.
well it would if these cars were comparably aerodynamically efficient but they are not and not even close.
Yes, RB is the best at aero efficiency, but their energy storage/usage is much better than other engines.
Baku unfortunately has enough twisty bits to upset them, especially the castle section.   This year’s Williams is more efficient though so I don’t expect them both to go out in Q1 (especially not Alex). If Alex can get a decent Qualifying, he should be able to keep faster cars behind that are not named RB.
I think while there may be no best, the Renault is still definitely the worst, but not by much. And perhaps Ferrari close if they are not able to run the most performant engine mode due to reliability concerns, as they had to last year. But Ferrari in the right mode are very much up with Mercedes and Honda.  I think the Honda has a slight advantage in packaging, in that it's the smallest current engine. It's smaller than the "size zero" F1 engine they started with.
The gaps are still much smaller. I think it was estimated that the best and worst engines are within 10HP of eachother at ~1050HP overall.  Back in 2016, after the others caught up a little, Mercedes was around 950HP with the other manufacturers between 30 and 50HP behind. That is much more significant.   They probably had even more to give, but just ran lower settings.
I think Alex can make Q3 this year
I don’t trust these power numbers completely, you never know how they were measured and calculated and if that’s applicable to the race car. Like sure the Ferrari might be the most powerful if given full beans but doesn’t look like it would survive the race then so that mapping is only usable for quail at best. No one knows how much power they gave to drop for the race.
He already did last weekend
I dont think so. Low downforce is gonna cost so much through sector 2, but we'll see. They do seem to be a faster package this year compared to the field than any other year since 2017.

Asking a lot today aren’t we
The longest contract in Ferrari's history.
I’ll continue to support my man but I can’t lie, it’s been a rollercoaster lol
This will never get old with Leclerc...  https://imgur.com/mmXk8kQ
Hopefully Baku goes well for him, hmm let's see, how did ferrari do there in 2022?  ...  Oh dear
Oof
Look how they massacred my poor innocent beautiful boy
I want to drive for Ferrari   ~~I want to win the championship~~  ~~I want to win races~~  ~~I want to be in pole position~~  ~~I want to be on the podium, fastest lap maybe?~~  ~~I want to score points~~  *I just want to finish a race*
It was striking after Oz that noone even talks about Leclerc's title hopes. Just not in the conversation. An absolute dead-stop from their pre-2023 hopes and aims.  I don't think it's just Ferrari; noone but RBR is winning. As they said on The Race podcast; Ferrari, Merc and AM all had trouble-free winters and are nicely converged. There are no wild cock-ups. The issue is more that RBR are legitimately *bodyslamming* everyone.
This man could easily jump ship when 2024 rolls around  If Hamilton considers retiring, Merc would be all over him like a t-bone steak in a dog park.
One of the new guys.  It's still crazy to me they took steps backwards it seems in development or just didn't increase at all.  Like if the teams stayed the same and just switched cars it's scary to think especially what Merc would have developed or hell even AM because that car last year absolutely had the pace to keep up with RB before the famous "Ferrari doing Ferrari things" prophecy was fulfilled.  I don't know if they would have closed the gap all the way but there wouldn't a fight for 2nd place is all I can say if they improved that car
Lool they’ve got my man in the trenches. It can’t keep getting worse
From an early title contender, to having absolutely no hope in your team or car, all in the space of a year.  Fuck he was done dirty.
I remember max saying the same shit last year 👀
Ferrari have been such a joke and have been wasting his career
Maybe one day Charles.
charles feels like one of the brilliant drivers who is always in the wrong team at the wrong time and never really does anything great. hope i'm wrong.
How much pain can this man endure?
ngl but as a RB fan, it sucks seeing Ferrari and McLaren make progress the past 2 or so years then hit a this slump in performance again. I just hope the cars have inherent pace in them and these 3 races are just a rough patch and not indicative of what's in store this season  It just feels we're being robbed of a verstappen v Lewis v Alonso v leclerc season
Poor guy went  from wanted to become a champion to wanting to finish a race. Ferrari makes ur dreams come true
Jesus fucking Christ, how they massacred his spirit
According to the new boss, Ferrari is taking the positives that came out of the race. Which are?
Leclerc is well on his road to become the 21st century's Jean Alesi.
"I realized the goal for third place was to high"
Jesus wtf  Cmon sharls dont make me cry too
God the one thing I hate about F1, even though it's part of the fun, is watching good drivers get stuck at awful teams.
Things you can say as a Ferrari driver and as Adolf Hitler.
What he really means: "I just want an engine that's reliable for more than 5 kms"
Everybody in this comment section forgets Leclerc has as much mechanical dnf’s this season as Russell. He binned it in Australia, not Ferrari
How do the 3rd most valuable team on the grid get to this point
lower standards mean less likely to be disappointed, right?  Well unless you have to deal with the Ferrari ways
Finishing a race is a huge accomplishment for Ferrari, so maybe give the good stuff to Alfa Romeo to try to get a podium,no?
I just want him to win Monaco so badly. And I'm in the Red Bull camp.
Alexa, play Guts Theme
Latifi just asked Ferrari for a seat. He said he knows how to finish a race.
Things that you can say both at a Formula 1 interview and your weekly KKK meeting
Never thought Leclerc would reach this point. But now he has. I don't think he has lasting optimism and trust in Ferrari.
Well, it's important to keep your goals achievable.
Calm down Adolf!
>'I just want to finish a race'  Ferrari: ''best we can do is a Finnish race''
i want to see verstappen and carles both at red bull
I feel so bad for Charles 🥺💔.
This is what happens when you choose Ferrari, you could have learned from Seb and Fernando.   Those two are PRIME examples of putting too much faith in that clownshow.
And this is why Binotto's "Our plan this year is to win a few races" is so poor. When you have a potentially title challenging car you need to be ready to take it, because you don't know if the uptrend continues.
*Sad Charles noises*
The champion's mindset.
When your goals are lower in Ferrari than in Alfa
Ferrari broke the man... It's really sad to see
I wish he gets the Merc seat after Hamilton retires. There's no hope left at Ferrari for him.
Sounds like me in iRacing sometimes
New goal in a while: "I just want to finish a lap." On a serious note my heart breaks for him. Australia was his fault being over zealous so early on in the race but I'm inclined to give Checo and Charles more leeway than other drivers for some odd reason lol. Anyone else and I'd be like whelp that was on you.
I can't believe that the F1 rumour mill was saying that Lewis Hamilton was lining up a move to Ferrari less than a month ago.
as a max fan.... this is heartbreaking.... was looking forward to a title fight between them.
I was half-jokingly once compared his situation to Mbappe-PSG relationship... Now I reconsider the joking part..
It's getting to the point where I'm actually feeling angry at Ferrari for doing this to such a good person who clearly deserves better. I hope he gets a Mercedes seat once Lewis retires.
Charles "Jim Mora" Leclerc  "Playoffs?! Playoffs?! I just hope we finish a ~~game~~ race."
We are checking...
He needs to finish with this joke of a team.
He still doesn’t think they need to change the car concept after going backwards for a year?? He really is stuck in the denial stage of grief.
18 pole positions and 5 wins from them. That's gotta be the worst percentage of any multiple race winner in F1 history?  Yikes Ferrari
Ferrari, where careers go to die with "heritage."
Stop inventing
Then finish it. What more can be said here
Let’s stop pretending that Charles didn’t bin or mess up half of his Ferrari drives on his own volition. He is fast af, but I think he deserves Ferrari tbh. Let them figure it out, or not. He knew what he was signing up for
Its really bad watching Leclerc and Lando stuck with a team that can’t produce championship winning cars. I really thought last year after Australia he was in a correct trajectory to winning or contend in a championship. In some ways it’s applicable to Russell but Mercedes has a set realistic expectations from the start of last year unlike Ferrari just fell from the top.
It's impossible not to feel sorry for him.
Well, to be fair I do think he put himself in the situation that got him out the race. Lance had nowhere to go.  But I feel so hard for him, the rise and fall with Ferrari is a burden, I imagine.
Granted.  Monkey paw curls, you finish 7th.
A year will be our year
He is having a very similar season so far to what Sainz had last year. Unfortunate events and Ferrari's reliability issues ruined the seasons for 2 of the most likable drivers on the grid.
LOL
He's not good. I really like him but he just does not have the consistency to be a wdc. Ferrari is shit and I'm sure it doesn't help his morale but even seasons when he has a decent drive he be fucks it.
sounds like a head line written by the the Onion.......
I can't stand Charles so I find this hilarious.  The entire Ferrari team is just a comedy of errors now.
Kimi was the last great Ferrari driver.
Feel bad for the guy. He rarely makes mistakes. It's damm Ferrari. From bundling pit strategies to their car blowing up.  Give the man a competent car and hire someone who knows how to handle PIT/RACE STRATEGY!
Come on Charles!
Poor guy
Tags : Mind Break, Empty eyes
Swap him with Stroll please
Holy moly, that reads like a headline from a different subreddit!
To shreds you say?
With Ferrari luck you'll finish a race in points and end up with a penalty out of points at the last minute
Losing hope speedrun any%
Yikes that’s kinda a big ask there buddy
He should say some real wild shit on Insta to get Ferrari to release him lol.  Maybe do gas mask bong rip whole wearing some Pro Russia shit. That should do it
We are checking...
The Ferrari grief treatment in full swing. He's just bargaining now
He should just go slowly to help reliability. Remember, you don't need to do get the full number of laps in, 90% is enough.
At first I was making fun of the Ferrari fuck ups, but now I just feel bad for Charles and Carlos.
That would be good.
Oof
At this point he just wants to do his job😭
Sounds like my cousin after we've taken each other out on the 1st lap in Co-op career for the 5th race in a row.
Sounds like my cousin after we've taken each other out on the 1st lap in Co-op career for the 5th race in a row.
RB are doing what Merc did in the past. They have the car and it’s not going to change for the next 2-3 years at least. Leclerc should just move on. Ferrari doesn’t have the people to be great.
The races he retired this year are ironically 1st place he got last year. Incredible how 1 year changed.
Oh man that is painful to hear. He’s right but it’s still a big oof
I'm all in for an early Biopic with Charles being dramatically crushed by Ferraris incompetence, played by Timotheeee Chalameeeee
See you in twitch chat my man!
Heartbreaking...
Jesus this is depressing.
Going to be one to watch because hulkenberg retired after the finish off Australian gp with a failure of hybrid ancillary component. Ferrari are still looking the same and can be said they just wasted time last year
From hopes about winning a world championship to hopes about just finishing a race. Get this man out of ferrari before he loses interest in racing. He is the only guy right now who can take the fight to Max other than George.
Maybe don’t make mistakes, but I guess everything has to be Ferrari’s fault
Why would any prospective championship winner want to join Ferrari after this is don't know. If you're the best driver on the grid between what they have done with Vettel and Leclerc you would have to be dumb as rocks, or mid tier looking for an easy payday to follow this path now.
Charles must have really done something in his past life to deserve thi
I’m just sad for Charles at this point. Ferrari have killed the spirit of incredibly talented no. 1 drivers a couple of times in a row now, and I hate them for it. Charles, please escape while you still have many good years left in you.
Anyone named Charles (Chuck) gets an upvote in my mind. Chucks are awesome
He finished a race three weeks ago! Unfortunately it was in seventh place.
Whenever Charles broke up with his girlfriend, things went south. Towards end of 2019, Charles broke up with Giada Gianni, 2020 season was awful. Now he broke up with Charlotte, we have the amazing start to 2023.   So, please charles either dont date or just choose your final partner :)
Bro's down bad no cap
Should move to alfa romeo or Mclaren
Had to come and post the old cliche:  >To finish first, first you have to finish.
*monkey paw curls
They finally broke him...
The nerve!
Shoulda stayed at Alfa then instead of chasing $$$
Muthafucka is dying out there
Lmao tonight I dreamt about an F1 race and there was a big fire near the circuit so they had to suspend the race and Charels couldn't finish it (again)
/s Greedy bugger, he already has 6 points! That's more than Williams and Alpha Tauri Combined! What more does he want!
[removed]
Next race in Baku: A power circuit in warm conditions that tests engine reliability.
Get out of the Ferrari.
"In order to finish first, you must first finish."
Start from the pits on the last lap
I don't know who this arc is more brutal for, him or me  we're in this together, Charles
I’m on the verge of cancelling my subscription to watch F1 for this
Look how they massacred my boy ffs
You're still killing Leclerc's soul slow, Ferrari.
It's ridiculous. Where does it end? First it's "I just want to finish a race", before you know it i'm sure  it'll be "I just want to get in the points". Who TF does he think he is and what team does he think he drives for? Might as well ask for the moon while he's at it!!!
Tbf max didn’t finish 2 at the start of last season but at least we knew RB would eventually be reliable
At the beginning, that was an amazing thing, now 4 years on from when he signed it, it’s torture lol
Ferrari: "I'm not stuck with you. YOU are stuck with ME!"
Mind reminding me when it goes til?
I kinda feel sorry for him, but what other team could he have gone too? I mean maybe RB instead of Checo but then he would be in Max's domain and that hasn't work out well for younger drivers. Merc? But they had George line up for a long time and they are having there own pain at the moment. There hasn't been any other championships winning teams he could have gone too in the last two years that would have had him as the main driver.   Ferrari came 2nd last year and Fred's leadership and changes to the team won't start having an impact until the 6 month mark at a minimum and from there we will see if they have made the right choice in replacing Mattia Binotto. Until then Ferrari is in a season of change where the team is getting used to working with Fred and coming to terms with lossing Mattia Binotto who started working with the team in 1995.
A rollercoaster goes up and down right?...   I don't remember going up sitting in this rollercoaster :(
OMG, this is the first time I've seen this as a meme. Too funny. Poor Sharl
>Oh dear  Wait for Monaco.
"to pieces to you say?"
Juan Pablo it's like a horse with horns
Oh deer*
Big oof
Leclerc has to get away from Ferrari. They're just wasting his talent at this point.
“There are people coming and going at all hours of the night. My wife is crying. Now tell your godfather what it is everyone seems to know but him.”  “They shot the gearbox on the Staten Island Expressway. It’s dead.”
Even if god forgives them, fans of Seb, Alonso and ol' Chuck won't ever forgive Ferrari for how they strangled their dreams
Rip his hairline
Baron Harkonnen vibes right there 😶
>I want to drive for Ferrari   ~~I want to win the championship~~  ~~I want to win races~~  ~~I want to be in pole position~~  ~~I want to be on the podium, fastest lap maybe?~~  ~~I want to score points~~  ~~I just want to finish a race~~  \*I just want to start a race*
and RBR is doing it while downtuning the fucking car.
Yeah it‘s funny that with every bigger rule change one team emerges to absolutely dominate f1 for years when f1 wants to achieve the complete opposite.
hell I mostly forgot about Ferrari in Oz, I mean didn't help that LeClerc went out on the first lap on his mistake but equally in quali they weren't really there either  they're in that weird place where they're not fast enough to challenge AM/Merc/RB but too quick to be fighting in the midfield
Well, he’s got 6 points after 3 races. He’s car isn’t fast or reliable and he’s still making silly mistakes taking himself out of the race. Why would anyone talk about his title hopes. Even he doesn’t have at title hopes this year at this point.
Dude.... it's been 3 races. Also RBR is running away from everyone, not just Ferrari.
Yeah that is his only choice but if Lewis chooses to hang around longer he is gonna be losing time
I don't think mercedes wants to do another Rosberg Hamilton rivalry with Russel and Leclerc
Why would Merc want him when they have George?
I would wager that they put Mick in that seat before they even consider anyone else.  Shumacher in a German team with a team boss who has a lot of faith in Mick's abilities in a driver, so much in fact that he has talked smack about his previous employers.  Let's not forget if Merc got what they wanted, Hamilton might not be a 7 time world champion, and Hulkenberg might not have the record for most races entered without a podium. Though they have al all British team now, they do like German drivers. Shockingly only Vettel they havnt shown interest in, probably because he had a Red Bull seat and then Ferrari when they had a spare seat going
Hamilton said last year that Ferrari had a running start/6 months on everyone in 2022 which has only degraded with time.  I think he was very basically correct.
the concept of the car has been killed by the FIA with the floor changes and td39 even god cant save it.
Remember that time in Monaco they forgot to send him out for qualifying? Yep.
I mean it can still turn around however if i had to choose who can turn this around it feels more like Mercedes could rather than Ferrari but shit happens
They at least had pace tho.
So, Charles WDC ‘23 confirmed??
It's not rlly new. Ferrari had a 21 year title drought before Schumacher got his 5 titles. Additionally it took him like 4-5 years before he got his championship with Ferrari. I just think it takes time to reform a team under new management.   It's not fair to treat this team as the same before when core personnel have left it.
The Ferrari way.   Did it with Alonso and Seb too. They both had chances to fight for wins but let’s be honest, that’s not enough for drivers of this caliber.
Seb could have helped by not going to the gravel in Germany 2018.
Yes, agreed but he hasn’t made it easy for himself as well. He made some grave errors. Like last weekend or Imola last year. And I can name a few more. He can’t make mistakes like that if there is a weekend the strategists are awake and the car has no issues.
always at ferrari...
Ah yes, the Ricciardo syndrome
So your saying he a younger Alonso
Mf made a comparison with Ferrari and McLaren from 2020 to now and thinks their similar
Ferrari makes you adjust your dreams
Sainz finished the race!
Presumably that the race pace looked strong, which must be nice for a team worried that their pace isn’t even top 3 when they don’t fuck everything up or when they get shafted by safety cars and red flags.
It’s like watching Mbappe at PSG or Rashford at Man United, no champions league glory for either of them.   Mbappe needs to leave the farmers league for the Prem
Doesn’t help if you crash out by you own doing tbh
Best we can do is 3km
while being fast, right? Right?!
>Everybody in this comment section forgets Leclerc has as much mechanical dnf’s this season as Russell  But also took a grid penalty in SA.
he didnt bin it, was just typical lap 1 incident
Exactly. Leclerc is under performing Ferrari so far this year.
He didn't really bin it. He wasn't gonna cede the position, and neither was Stroll.
At this point, Bottas has a better shot at title contention then leclerc...
Last year was his chance.
Somebody give this man an award or something
Binotto was better than Vasseur
Half of it, so do you mean he caused the engine failure, start mistakes that were plenty last season on his own.
Are you on crack. Charles is so inconsistent. I still root for him because I like him but he needs stongo to another team and work on his skillset for a year and reset.
>“We’re already miles behind. I don’t even want to think about the championship fight at the moment, it’s more important just to finish races,” he said.  https://www.foxsports.com.au/motorsport/formula-one/f1-australian-grand-prix-2022-max-verstappen-dnf-result-points-charles-leclerc-what-happened-to-red-bull-car-news/news-story/aa3f1b5f85fb1456b800fa7da3fd155c
It ends when we circle back around to Monaco 2021 with “I just want to start a race”
Next thing you know, it will be "Im clearly winning the monaco GP. Can I get on the podium?" No Charles, no! You are a Ferrari driver!
"I just hope dad an jules....I can't " ❤️‍🩹
"we knew"?  There were lots of comments about the championship basically being over and threads about how long it had been since a championship winner overcame an X amount of points gap.  A loud minority of people were shitting on RB for making fragile cars and shitting on Honda for making poor reliability engines.
Reliable: at least that was a RB and Newey at the helm. Ferrari tho
Yes i'm sure he's regreting it. /s
Where else would he go? Outside of going to redbull, which max would never allow as Charles would embarrass him, there’s no chance of winning races unless Red Bull gets a double dnf
I think it's until the end of 2024.
We'll always have Monza
Let's see Leclerc's results in Monaco...  shiiiiiiiiiit
He should probably just stay away from that race at this point
Home field advantage, right?  ..r-right..?
In a season like this, podium in monaco would be fitting though
And Sainz, how is he holding up?
OOF
l'oof grand  or would be it grande
But to where? We don't know if Astons competitiveness is long lasting yet, Merc look like they are cleaning up but I doubt they are parting with either of their drivers anytime soon if its up to them, Red Bull he'd just be second fiddle. McLaren with a miracle would be nice but I honestly think Lando is close to a Charles level. He is at least a WDC winner in a good car, he's remarkably consistent and reliable and decently quick. So why would they need Charles if they figure the car out?
There’s nowhere for him to go. I’m sure Red Bull would take him in a heartbeat but then he has to play second fiddle to Max and I don’t see him doing that just to leave Ferrari. Mercedes could be a possibility next to George but we don’t know how long Hamilton is going to stick around. No one else offers him the chance to race at the front.
How was Melbourne Ferraris mistake ? Last year Carlos made same errors in qualifying and race and everybody blamed him. I like Charles but people fail to see his mistakes
Too late. He should have done so in 2020.
I’m not sure why he always gets a free pass. He is a great match for Ferrari because he’s good for a head scratching screw up a few times a year.
The godfather?
**Unfun fact:** Jules Bianchi was Charles Leclerc's godfather.
At least Nando and Seb got to be at the top at some point in their career before being beat down by Ferrari.
So, so true. literally crying in anguish after reading this.....
> strangled their dreams      McZak has entered the chat.
It's The Godfather.
And reliability issues every weekend, apparently they had problems with the brakes this weekend.  Which explains Perez going off all the time and Max being so careful on the brakes at the restarts
It’s still 3 races we have to wait atleast for the results of track like Barcelona which is always a “checkpoint” in the season to really have clearer idea where the rest of the season stands
> weird place where they're not fast enough to challenge AM/Merc/RB but too quick to be fighting in the midfield  This is incorrect though? In Australia the drivers said they fucked up in qualifying and if you [look at Sainz's race pace](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/129oxmn/australian_gp_race_pace_teammate_race_pace_gaps/), it was very competitive with Hamilton's. Maybe the deg is a bit worse on abrasive tracks, but the Ferrari's pace is on par with the Merc/Aston.
At this point maybe AM may be better...?
Aye and so far there is no indication Merc doesn't still see George as their golden goose for the future. Nor have they had a reason to. He's been performing well. Not to mention Charles would have an entire media machine working against him there, whereby now he benefits from being part of the Ferrari brand on giving him some protection there.
Do you really think that reason alone would stop them from signing Leclerc? Seems like an obvious move to me
You mean run away with constructors? And be 1 2 in drivers? Any team would take that 100 times out of 100
They need a Hamilton first.  Russell might be him, but it’s worth seeing if LeClerc is the superior talent.
they don’t want two super talented drivers to give them the best shot at winning? what?
Because they need 2 drivers and George is just one.
Well FIA helped to shrink that 6month by making them 0.4 slower per lap in race
Lewis knows Ferrari is stupid. Good on him for never choosing them.
It's not like Ferrari were ahead before Spa.
The Schumacher/Brawn/Byrne/Todt dream team was an anomaly and arguably never a representation of true Ferrari
I'd say there are other teams where Alonso's career was much more wasted. With Ferrari he fought for the championship until the last race twice
[removed]
I'm not quite sure about Alonso here but definitely agree with Seb.
Seb already has 4 titles. He’s etched his name into history.   Leclerc is just another race winner who’ll be forgotten after a few decades.
Ferrari could have helped by not leaving Seb out in the wet on dry tyres when his front wing was tearing itself to bits.   Ferrari could have helped by using Kimi to attack the Mercs behind Seb and help create a gap in which to pit.

He is only hyper aggressive when in a car that isn't good enough, or when it's a long shot that he'll win.  Latter parts of 2019 and early parts of 2022 he was very consistent, if Ferrari didn't intervene we're looking at a string of podiums, if not wins in both years.
I mean, that stage for Alonso came after his two world championships.
I said 2 years. Isn't that 2021 and 2022 or how's your calendar like?
Or Mike trout, one of the best baseball players in the world, who has played 3 post season games in his career lmao
Did you just compare Mbappe to fucking Rashford
But I don't think he crashed out of every race this year .
Tbh you can't really blame him for the crash, they can see little in those cars already, no realistic way he could have seen stroll not having room to take the apex because his front wing was barely alongside Alonso.  Just unfortunate set of circumstances, he did nothing wrong based on what he could see.
Yes, but that didn’t stop him from finishing the race? It did hamper him to get points, but that’s not what this thread is about
He didn’t leave room and could’ve known stroll was there. Leclerc was trying a bit too hard.   He binned it
That’s text book bottling it, he shouldn’t have turned into Stroll like that. Luckily he only took himself out.
P3. Before CE failure in Bahrain and resultant 10 palce grid penalty in saudi as a result. (Where he qualified P2 and could have atleast finished P3 at best with out the penalty)  Quali clownery from team in Australia and a racing incident at lap 1, where he is to be partially blamed  Yes he is underperforming Ferrari exactly.
I mean yeah many of his shortcomings with Ferrari so far were from driver errors; not saying Ferrari is innocent either. I just don’t see how this agenda suddenly exists when we’ve known Leclerc has made major mistakes. People seem to overlook this because he qualifies well.
Crack no but this Zaza htttin lol   Ferrari as a TEAM has made more mistakes than he as a driver.
Fairs. I guess because nobody was actually feeling bad for Max I kinda forgot about that
That was crazy haha   Anyone who had faith in Ferrari not blowing their early season advantage over red bull must have not been around long.
It's reddit. Everyone shits on everone and those become the top comments.
He must be miserable in his multi-million-dollar Monaco apartment      Hopefully he doesnt get any tears on his custom million-dollar+ Richard Mille
He is.
Charles and Max at red bull would be amazing to watch.
I don't think that Charles is better than Max. They are in the same material, Charles can one faster "one lapper" but he's more inconsistent.  Let's leave it, I wanted to focus on 2nd of your statement. You suggest that Ferrari at the moment is better than Aston or Merc? Or rather, is Charles better than Nando? Not so sure about that, Nando is a beast, I don't see Charles playing the same game with anyone like Fernando vs Lewis in Australia.
I think Charles has it marked on his calender "Freedom" circled five times with like 4 years of X'd off days so far..
Him and MJF going to embark on the bidding war of 2024.
Ah! That race highlight video always hits hard
He wins in SPA, He wins in Monza!
> Let's see Leclerc's results in Monaco...  He's qualified on pole twice. Once with a car that had no business anywhere near the front of the grid.  I actually think he gets his first Monaco win this year.
It's alright. I'm sure Charles can claw back some points in Hungary.  Oh...
DW bro Silverstone he is a beast at.  Let's check last year's.. oh dear
Look at that subtle off-black lettering. The tasteful thickness of it. Oh, my God. It even says "DNS".
Call in sick, watch it from his balcony.
To pieces you say?
^^^OOF
# Oof
I know it's grande in Portuguese
Le grand oof
His only option is if Lewis retires to quickly snatch that. RB i don’t think want to risk Rosberg-Hamilton situation. Aston maybe but they might take some time to build all the factories and the success might be gone by then. And rest of the teams are so far quite a lot behind
If I'm Charles, I'm talking hype to Lewis about all his non-motorsports endeavors every chance I get.
lando isn't close to charles what
I don’t think they would take him to risk in team battles in the first place
Only in the loosest sense that the drivers are probably overdriving to try and make up for Ferrari being unreliable, having weird strategies, dealing with media pressure and internal politics. But that's true for Carlos too.
The major mistake from Ferrari’s side was to only give Leclerc one warm up lap on the final qualy run because they thought it would start to rain. And then planning the lap so poorly that his team mate was in the way in corner 3-4, which put Leclerc in 7th position for the start.   Not the end of the world, but still a unnecessary mess that hurts Leclerc’s focus and race.
Yep:  > Don Vito Corleone: [sees Tom Hagen with a drink] Give me a drop. My wife is crying upstairs. I hear cars coming to the house. Consigliere of mine, I think you should tell your Don what everyone seems to know.  >Tom Hagen: I didn't tell Mama anything.

True.... WDC come to Ferrari to murder their career. Charles took a shortcut for that process 😂
basically they've invented warp drive but forgot about inertial dampers
He could be full of shit, but IIRC Peter Windsor said that he'd spoken to a few of the people around the Red Bull paddock and they claimed that there was nothing wrong with the car, Perez was just making excuses.
I disagree, unless Max DNFs the next 5 races he is winning the championship
We’ll find out if Verstappen will win every race this season he doesn’t DNF or not by Barcelona, based 😎
It‘s not like last year was even close and back then they had reliability issues and Ferrari as contestant for the first third of the season. F1 is doomed with RBR domination for years to come I fear.
Alonso and Stroll aren't going anywhere lol
What do you mean with media machine?
They’ll have a lead driver, why would they want another expensive lead driver that is the same age?
I personally never really believed that as an entire explanation.   It probably made a difference but fundamentally RBR had them down.
Lewis and Ferrari just wouldn’t have worked. Lewis needs a team to kinda be around him and fuel him while Ferrari is quite the opposite. And shitton of other politics.  Also Max in Ferrari would probably be a dumpster fire too even though he is different than Lewis.
Cars were pretty even before spa, yes Ferrari had multiple fuckups though but development wise before spa we were doing fine
This!  The reason they were doing so well back in the 2000s was because of that dream team.  Once Ferrari’s politics got in the way and decided to find ways to break up the team, it all fell apart starting in 09.  The culture in that team is imo seriously holding them back.
Why does nobody mention Barrichello? He was as much a part of that era of Ferrari dominance as the other 4.
I don't know. They managed to get the win in 2007 and should have probably gotten 2008 tbh. But yeah overall they never have been super consistent, but then again no team really has since Merc and RB who are relative newcomers to the fold.
With the hype Ferrari has around them they should be winning every other year.  They didn’t deserve the skill of Seb or Alonso and they don’t deserve Leclerc.
Seriously. He deserves better.
Maybe. That’s for time to decide.
> decide to jump ship to Renault  > Red Bull finally gets their shit together  > tfw
McLaren didn't make progress in 22' though, they built a slower car than Alpine, but McLaren just had better reliability than those Renault GP2 engines.
LMAO I wish the Reddit free awards still existed
No, but he only has 1 mechanical dnf. Same as Russell. So it’s a bit early to act like his car isn’t allowing him to finish any race.
I disagree, if you look at the top shot it wasn’t even an issue that Alonso was there, he just turned in too early.  Stroll wasn’t even close to having to steer yet, so it makes no sense. I honestly think Leclerc misjudged how far ahead he was of Stroll.  In the end it’s Leclerc that makes the misjudgment, so he is the one that binned it.
I suppose I took this thread to be more about Charles's general frustration than pure him finishing a race.  He hasn't had one clean race yet.
To be fair predicting Stroll's movements when racing for a position would probably be difficult even for Nostradamus himself.  He isnt really in a car that can afford to concede every lap1 duel like Max can nowadays. Especially not on a track like Albert Park
He gave stroll respect, stroll just accelerated again after initially braking and he as well ahead going into the corner.
He was a whole cars length ahead mate and stroll was braking. was it dumb to make a move on turn 1 with 3 cars wide yes, but stroll was already braking for the turn and charles was massively ahead stroll just accelerated and kept going in a straight line, he took the same line as sainz only difference is max actually turned for the corner.
Every top team got a DNF so far, Ferrari is not doing worse than RB, Mercedes or AM so far on that regard.  Qualy clownery?. Besides traffic suffered by every tean and him not being able to just make a quick lap, what do you mean with Qualy clownery?
Many of his shortcomings lol,   I will list down the number of wins that Ferrari cost him due to strat blunder or reliability issue.  -Bahrain 2019 -Singapore 2019 -Russia 2019  -Spain 2022 -Baku 2022 ( at best 2nd finish given rb pace) -Monaco 2022 -Mexico 2019  -Silverstone 2022 -Hungary 2022 ( at best 2nd) -Canada 2022 (penalty due to engine issue , given Ferrari superior pace there compared to red bull)  Number of wins Leclerc lost due to his mistakes :-  France 2022   Regarding other mistakes in 2022   Imola 2022 - he wasn't even in contention for win   Coming to Monaco 2021 , yes he crashed , the team look into the drive shaft issue , the gear box was fine. So you tell me how many drivers have crashed in quali and not gone on to start the race next day, heck Perez even won in Monaco 2022 thanks to Ferrari after crashing in quali.  Leclerc is not shielded from criticism, infact he is bombarded with it. Last race was racing incident with Leclerc more to blame.   He has only made 3 errors during quali and race over the past 2.5 season, Hamilton , Russell have made plenty of mistakes last season, Russell hit multiple drivers over the course of last season , yet they aren't labelled mistake prone.   It is also funny that people are absolving Sainz of the incident with Alonso cause he got a penalty and are out with pitch forks against Leclerc for a racing incident.
Beautiful.
"I've never seen anyone sad in a Ferrari"  *supercut of charles leclerc*
This always amazes me, be it in Formula 1, Football, Tennis, or shit pick whatever sport you want.  I'm sure there are shining beacons that clearly had a talent and abused it for money, but winning and doing well *clearly* matters to him.  He is a fucking shell of his former self, and as long as he's racing, no amount of Richard Mille gifts is going to solve that.
I guess all that money can’t replace that competitive spirit.
He worked his whole life for f1, for one championship. They all did. He lost his godfather and friend to this sport. Saying that he shouldn't care too much because he is rich is so ignorant.
Imagine thinking that everyone only does things for the money or that money makes these people happy.   To be in F1 or the top of ANYTHING - sport or otherwise - is due to ambition. And ambition doesn’t die when you have money.   For someone with passion, drive, and ambition, having no success will feel horrible.
Rich people can't be sad 😢😔
Pretty sure at least half the teams on the grid would be happy to make him a multi-millionaire... Saying this doesn't mean much... he just wants a team with a future that doesn't screw him over all the time
Most of the F1 drivers have been rich their whole lives. Money is not what they’re here for
Money doesn't inherently make you happy.  He has spent his whole life winning and wanting to win; to be world champion. Now that he's here he's been absolutely fucked over by his team time and time again. The money doesn't matter when your dreams are crushed.  These drivers take the money because they can. Their skills are valuable. But the drive to win is why they're here.
Takes like these are just so bone headed
Most f1 drivers don't care about the money, it's not always about money, he's wasting his talent in a team that doesn't have the same abitions as Leclerc
I mean he was already rich as absolute fuck. Believe it or not some people actually want fulfillment in other ways than adding more millions to their already hyper rich net worth lol   But no discussion around this can ever be made because there is always someone here discrediting the driver because "herr durr he makes so much money he shouldn't complain or want for anything more"
y’all are such cunts
Anyone would pay him that. Just because you’re making hella money doesn’t mean you don’t have ambitions for titles! He’s s millionaire either way but he’s also a competitor. Got feel for him from that perspective. Don’t think he’s struggling for food or company lol
Id bet tears are the last of his worries with his watch these days
I'd be pretty pissed off if I was contractually obliged to wear such a hideous watch tbh
You're right, he's rich and has a great life and nothing matters because he'll always have a good life with his wealth.  Which means that the only satisfaction he gets from earning something he works hard for in life is in Formula 1. Which is why it'll tear him apart if he can't achieve what he wants in it.
Well, you heard it here first boys, Charles Leclerc will not finish at Monaco this year
 >I actually think he gets his first Monaco win this year.  What have you done
Charles has a higher chance of 0 podiums this year than he does winning Monaco.
From your lips to Drive To Survive's ears (fingers crossed)
… you do know ferrari was the fastest car at monaco 2021?
Given his luck at that race, he is better off doing just that
LeOof
Leclerc should lobby for more sprint races and crazy formats so Max decides to retire early
Redbull would be insane not to grab Charles knowing hed push Max and Max's talking retirement
"Hey Lewis, I discovered this bomb ass musician last week! I think you should check him out!"  "Oh, for real?! What's their name Charles?"  "They are called XNDA!"  "........"  "What?! Have you heard of them before, why are you quiet Lewis?!"  "That's me Charles, I am XNDA..."  "WHAAAA?! You are AMAZING Lewis! You should *definitely* do it full time! Oh, and on an completely unrelated note, can you give me Toto's personal phone number? I just want to ask him a question about Pumpernickel toast..."
lando isn't close in the car he currently has  hard to say what their head to head would actually be
If in the same car I wouldn't be surprised if Lando was very close to Charles. He's quick, reliably so, and can drive a bit above where the car should be. Not Alonso levels but a bit. But mostly he's crazy consistent. If you can give him a good car he will get what its worth every single time.
It's hard to tell because he's never had a good car, but I think Lando would run with the top guys in a comparable car.
RB has tried 3 times iirc to sign Lando, so i think they don't care as much about avoiding intra-team battles as fans think they do
How do you overdrive on lap 1 ? Also Charles has not even been in a championship fight like Vettel was in 2018, 2017 so what would he be over diving for ?
A good driver will accept the state of the car, not overdrive it, and bag more points overall for it. Not coming last is more important than winning. Every mistake made from pushing for something that's not there can financially impact building a better car next year, keeping performance stagnant for another season.  Hamilton and George have been great examples of effectively doing what they can, remaining cool, and steadily bringing in the points they can, despite the clear frustrations for them personally. For that, they're much better drivers and the team steadily recovers.  Ferrari can be quite the shambles from everyone involved, making mistakes all over, and not acting as one. Leclerc can be a great driver, but he can also be just as bad for Ferrari scoring points as the engineers and strategists can be. His job is simple; don't do that.
I’m going to give him an engine he can’t reuse.
>Newey, beam me up(to first place)
As good as Alonso is, Aston Martin would be daft to pass up on a chance to sign Leclerc for 2025 onwards in favour of a driver who will be 44 at the end of that season.
Merc is an English team who primarily deals with the English media who have been known to…favour the English drivers over others. Not obvious now because both Merc drivers are Brits but if LeClerc was there it’d be obvious who the media roots for in Merc
Ummm... points and wins? Deny another team good talent?  Why wouldnt they snap up Leclerc?
They were well matched on pace before TD039. TD039 forced them to run much stiffer suspension and it completely killed their low speed rear grip and exacerbated their tyre deg issues.
Seems like you're narrowing down the problem if two of the greatest drivers couldn't work with a specific team...
Yeah honestly Ferrari did F1 a favor with fucking up so much early in the year.  Can you imagine how toxic everything would have been if Ferrari had the lead going into the summer break and TD39 completely swung the championship?
He did perform brilliantly in his role, but I do think the project could possibly have achieved similar success with other 2nd drivers - not something possible if any of the other named people had been missing.
The strengths from that era held over and Ferrari have, for the most part, always been a reasonably competent team. But even by 2006 we were seeing a return to the ruinous behaviours that plagued the team in the past, and would do again: political interference, blame culture, cutting star performers out on a whim, lack of strategy behind driver selection, denialism… or as someone called it… inventing.
They should have gotten 2008, but in all honesty they only got 2007 because Mclauren were taking points off each other.
They should have never gotten rid of Binotto, just change the race strategist and that’s it
That was two seasons after he jumped ship. He finished 2020 ahead of the second RB with a Renault.
they've come a long since 2018 but yes, last year they slumped
I mean who came up with that car even a normal person can tell that that aero won’t work… it just doesn’t look good looks like a mess as if the guy designing one bid didn’t even look over the shoulder what the other bit looks like
He also had a penalty the next race , maybe the comment was in reference to last year
Yeah I agree with you on this; Leclerc turned in way too early for some reason even though he was alongside Stroll and Stroll hadn't begun to turn in yet. That's entirely Charles' fault.
You mean Stroll driving in a straight line? Because that’s what he did when Leclerc hit him
Why is it so hard to accept Leclerc made the mistake there? It’s so obvious too this time
Not saying stroll isn’t partially to blame but if he left a little room it would have been fine and he would’ve been fully ahead the next turn as that was too the left   In short Ferrari is for once not to blame  Charles isn’t fully to blame but still a bit.
That’s because he braked too late and pinched Stroll in. There was a huge space to the left but Charles would’ve lost positions if he went that wide, he lost all positions as a result of his overeager move. The contact is completely Charles’ fault mate there is no other explanation.
Dude, how does Ferrari's reliability issue equate to Leclerc underperforming?? And a subsequent penalty for the same issue the other race equates chalres underperforming?   Quali clownery, Ferrari were slow to bring their tires upto temp and they needed two preparation laps, but Ferrari decided that rain was imminent and so fueled Charles only for one preparation lap and one flying lap, so he did the flying lap in not so best condition making him lose time, further Sainz was ahead of him during his flying lap in first sector which also cost him time. Ferrari even admitted it was strat and comm issue from their side.   You really out to watch races and quali, rather than Looking at results and points to understand what is actually going on.
Lol wtf you include non-wins in your example for Ferrari blunders but only limit to a few examples in 2022 for Leclerc 😂yeah let’s just forget 2019, 2020, and all the other instances he simply screwed up pace - those were all excused because he was so young and flashy.   For the record I don’t think Sainz is even Ferrari material himself. My point is that people need to stop pretending that Leclerc is some unicorn pegasus driver whose career is only being destroyed by dumb dumb Ferrari. He is fast, but he isn’t consistent.
Just like charles after every race this season. It's a Shakespeare tragedy in slow motion.
I’ve never seen anyone happy in a Ferrari, though I’ve only seen them in f1
 supercut of ~~charles leclerc~~ every primary Ferrari driver since Schumacher
Kimi and vettel and alonso flash backs. Ferrari really is the place to go to kill a carer in f1 atm.
That’s what I don’t get when people say “don’t feel bad, he makes money”. Most of the guys already *had* money. Raikonnen was once asked if his hunger for a second title was just as strong and he just sarcastically said “no, that’s why I’m leaving” because of course he wants it!
Anyone who has been racing in a comp at any level will tell you how much it sucks when you are unable to finish a race or get taken out at the first corner. You prepare yourself mentally for a race and then boom its over. Overwhelming sadness and dread takes over. If it happens few times in a row it literally piles up and messes you up mentally and you start questioning your talent and abilities. That is why you will see some athletes be on top of their game and then have this slump until they get professional help and then boom back at the top again.
Mate it's not just sport, there are plenty of people getting paid mega bucks and putting in mega hours, that still feel a deep sense of dissatisfaction because their project doesn't achieve the stated goals of becoming, or at least challenging the market leader.
Couldn’t have said it better myself. I don’t think people take the time to think about the level of drive that professional athletes have to compete & win - they wouldn’t have gotten close to the level they’re at otherwise.  Material possessions & fame might help to numb the pain, but it’s pain nonetheless. He wants to *win*
I agree. I know Charles is on the limit of the car most of the time, and he gains lots of critics because of this, but I see it as him wanted a WDC so badly he making careless mistakes. He has to compensate in some way to make up for the Ferraris lack of pace. Case in point, Australia turn 3. Essentially what I’m saying is, I think he’d forfeit a lot of that contract to compete for a WDC
>He is a fucking shell of his former self, and as long as he's racing, no amount of Richard Mille gifts is going to solve that.  We are checking.
Thank you.   Money can’t buy happiness or what have we preached for years? Sure, you don’t have to worry about paying bills and that’s at least more than a lot of us have…   But it’s unfair to pretend that these people aren’t human beings with feelings. And I’m pretty sure we all see just how frustrated he is at the moment.
Especially Leclerc was in a multimillion dollar apartment before F1. He grew up in Monaco and his dad had an industrial company. It’s not what drives him.
> He is a fucking shell of his former self  Why so melodramatic?
Sorry, but isnt that a bit overly dramatic? Are you his therapist?
Sad gurlz luv money
You don’t want to open up that Chester draws…
He's made his fair share of mistakes as well It is, but it isn't all about the car
these people don't have a competitive bone in their body
So many people do not realize just how competitive these dudes are, you do not make it to F1 without being obsessed with winning and being the best, no amount of money will ever replace the feeling of being a champion to them. If you asked Leclerc if he would rather have the money he has and no championship, or be on 100k/year and be a champion he would pick the latter 100%
> will not ~~finish~~ start at Monaco this year
Thats the least effort take I have ever seen lmao.
Oof. Sorry.
He'll have a front-row seat to watch Bobby Schwartman take his maiden win on his grand prix debut.
Mamaoof
4D chess
Does fia listen to someone competing with HAAS driver in WDC standings?      /s
This is the only way. Your comment made me laugh.
Lando is a solid driver, maybe a Jenson Button type, but on Charles level I highly doubt.
Well lando and carlos were similar in pace…and carlos is no where near Charles pace…therefore I doubt lando would be anywhere near Charles pace.  Charles is on the same level as Lewis, Max and Alonso. It’s unfortunate that he doesn’t have the car to show this.
not very hard to say
By being frustrated when you get into the car from bad experiences. And then doing stupid moves with 5% chance of success because you think if you don't, that there is no chance for a good result. And you need that good result really badly. Just human stuff. For that car to get the podiums he wants, he has to have good strategy, perfect reliability, drive his absolute best and still probably get lucky.  It's Ferrari in a nutshell. Having the attitude of the best team despite never being the best team. It's not healthy. When Alonso came back and sucked for a while, he was submissive and set his goals smaller to something realistic. That's a positive attitude to have.
He got tapped by Lance right? Is being yeeted first lap over driving?
Yeah lol, Charles makes tons of mistakes. Clearly talented and very good, but prone to getting in the way for himself - Melbourne this year, France last year are good examples.
I generally agree with you on principle although I will say specific to Ferrari, I'm not sure that's an organization (both the leadership and the culture) that will expect anything less than P1. Even if it's not realistic in the moment they are going to expect it. And I imagine that environment has to get into a drivers head.
Alonso to Ferrari confirmed. :(
Yeah I love alonso all my heart but I don't think he is faster than leclerc
Because he is expensive, he crashes a lot, he'll likely clash with Russell and there are other options out there that are none of those things.
Verstappen had an *80 point lead* before Spa.   I think very fundamentally, watching 2022 RBR had better racepace quite often and came on stronger as the season continued, as Newey later said had always been the plan.  RBR's big leap came at Spa, and as even Leclerc said himself: Ferrari's gap to Merc and the field wasn't very different after Spa. What changed was that RBR and particularly Verstappen pulled away as they unleashed more front-end.  Everything I've read about that TD was that yeah, it didn't help Ferrari...but it also wasn't *that* big a deal.
We’ve seen peak toxicity in F1 during 2021. It will take A LOT to top Silverstone 2021, Jeddah or Abu Dhabi 2021
I always did wonder would the spygate punishment have been any different had Hamilton or Alonso won 2007. Maybe not but McLaren docked all their points / disqualified in the constructors but nothing for their drivers always seemed odd to me, but I am bias.
Indeed its referring to ferrari's recent history of engine failures. Many of which were in the later stages of the race. Ferrari also exceeded the legal amount of ECU's for the season by the second race which further compounds the issue
You don't understand, Lance Stroll is incapable of driving an F1 car so him driving a completely normal line was actually a mistake so its his fault not Leclerc's.
> You mean Stroll driving in a straight line?  What kind of crazy strategy is that?
Because people don't want to admit their favorite driver is sometimes in the wrong.
How is it too obvious? Three wide into a tight turn on lap one is a racing incident.  Too obvious is his mistake in France or Imola last year. A racing incident on lap 1 isnt quite the same.
I agree. Leclerc should have taken a wide line like Carlos ahead and he would have been fine. 90% on Leclerc and maybe 10% on Stroll as Stroll has been pretty sloppy until now. He was injured so we can cut him some slack for that but he has no more excuses starting Baku.
He did leave room. Leclerc turned into Stroll...
Dude
Except maybe Raikkonen.
Hear me out. Verstappen clinches all titles until his contract ends in 2028. He quits RB and just for shits and giggles, joins Ferrari for a one year contract. Ferrari accidentally builds another F2004 and Verstappen takes his 9th title. The absolute scenes when that happens.
Kimi won and gave up himself. Nothing on Ferrari. He had championship winning car and couldn’t perform.
I mean only Vettel really “killed his career” with Ferrari. And even then he was still very good in 2021 and very solid in 2022, just had uncompetitive cars. Alonso had literal tractors and still pulled them into Q3 and the points after his Ferrari time, and has finished on the podium 3 consecutive times this year. Kimi himself checked out after 2007, and even then had a couple of great years with Lotus after his first Ferrari stint. In fact I would argue that Ferrari drivers usually have some of the best “shell lives” in F1. Barrichello went on to have another title challenge whilst almost being 40. Massa had some great drives at Williams, despite being a shell of his 2008 self. Irvine went on to become a very solid midfield driver. All the guys at Ferrari usually have long and prosperous careers after Ferrari.
*atm*.... What?
Unless you're Brazilian. In that case, you go to Williams.
Sad to say. It's starting to feel like MLS for soccer players. MLS is where top players go when their career is over.
eh. McLaren still beats them
Ten times? I think he would do that in a heartbeat. He is earning around $24 million a year at Ferrari so that would make his Williams contact $240 million a year.   But I get your point. For a reasonable amount more he won’t take a non competitive seat when top teams will still have him.
If he feels 1/10th of what I feel when that happens during a sim race and that happens it's still unbearable.
Leclerc wasn't particularly rich before F1. He was going to have to pull out of international karting because his dad couldn't afford it anymore (Jules Bianchi stepped in with a connection that funded Charles.) But Charles's brother never properly got to start international karting- only did a little here and there until Charles was able to help him get going. The Leclercs are native Monegasques. His mother is a hairdresser. His dad did have a company, but that clearly didn't make him that rich, or he would have been able to afford the karting. Native Monegasques have some governmental assistance in housing to combat the high costs of living. That doesn't make them multimillionaires. Charles is now, sure, and I'm sure. Though mentioning that watch company that got him jumped and the watch stolen from his wrist is an interesting example of privilege. I'd rather not have that kind of attention.
Its true though
If anything, it’s weird for you to ask him why he’s being hyperbolic when you used hyperbolic imagery yourself. Do you think it’s weirder to say he’s a shell of his former self or that he’s wiping tears away off his Richard Mille watches?    I’m presuming that the person you are responding to made his comment the way he did because it’s irritating to see the same shit in every thread about an athlete - boo boo, he’s so rich, who cares. When you spend your entire life devoted to a singular goal and constantly have that thwarted, the amount of money you make doesn’t make up for that dissatisfaction. Sure your life is easier than the average Redditor’s, but you’re still allowed to be sad when you’re rich.
No I've just spent years watching multiple sports, and it always tends to be "Now he can go wipe his tears with 100 dollar bills".  99% of people who play a sport post-high school are doing it for passion, not for money.
To finish first you first have to start. That's the quote right?
> will ~~not finish start~~ accidentally be sent to the Hockenheimring because Ferrari thought this was the next race instead of being at Monaco this year
But he's already checked that box off. This year has to be a whole new disaster.
Charles Leclerc will not at Monaco this year
And being his by some debris, which makes him lose his hair.
So a WDC caliber driver?
Id really love to be let in on the evidence you all seem to be privy to of Charles being some sort of transcendent generational talent because I just don't see see it. He's marginally quicker than Seinz most of the time, but solidly a tier below a Max/Lewis level from what I've seen.   I really think most of you just like his dreamy eyes and are frustrated by his shit team management and want him to be better than he is
Charles has been having this error prone days since the start of his career so its not a recent thing and shouldn't be blamed on overdriving.
Lance had no where to go while Charles had space on outside. It was his error but I won’t blame it on over driving and that’s what I am arguing
>tons  Might be an exaggeration
Yeah. When the day comes that they're doing well with the car and strat, it's going to be all on Leclerc to be performing high. They'll be upset if all his complaining now doesn't yield expected results when it's all fixed for him. Errors now are okay since everyone else is dropping the ball. Single errors will mean a lot when it's the only things ruining race weekends. So he needs to improve his control now—Sainz too—in preparation for that. Can't push limits that don't exist and drive off the edge in any car, especially if that car's a championship car.
What do you mean not faster than Leclerc? I think Leclerc may get good results at Quali but Alonso has the consistency and beat him over a season.
He is also the fastest driver they would be able to get their hands on, as there is too much bad blood for Max to ever think about going to them. When a talent of Leclerc's caliber is available you forget about those things and go for him, it would be dumb not to
How much is Hamilton worth again? He is definitely worth more than Leclerc yet here we are…
That's because Ferrari strategy was wonky ( ex Monaco) and Charles made devastating errors (ex France). Their race pace and quali pace was rather competitive. The team was not.
Ferrari were in touching distance on pace even at tracks that suited them less like Baku and France. They fell off very hard post-TD039, where they ended up being nowhere even at tracks that, on paper, should've suited them very well (Singapore, for example).  > Verstappen had an 80 point lead before Spa.  You can attribute somewhere between 50% and 75% of that Verstappen gap to DNFs (25 points in Spain, 15-18 points in Baku, 18 points in France), not to the RB being outright faster. The only tracks where the Red Bull was just out and out faster before Spa were Baku (kinda), France and Hungary. At other tracks the Ferrari was outright faster (Bahrain, Spain, Monaco, Austria, Australia) or it ended up being very finely poised between them.
Again when I was watching the races 80 points means nothing without context.  Ferrari was able to maintain a race pace that was close to RB but the first couple races let's be honest always favor a RB design with them being alot of straighline speed.   But are you trying to tell me that Ferrari wasn't close to RB? ( I don't think we ever got a good show from those guys outside of the first race)
Yeah it will never get worse than 2021.  But Max coming off the controversial 2021 win with a 2022 TD-inspired win (against a different fanbase) would have been abysmal.
You had me in the first half
Because he didn’t give any room to Stroll in a opening lap. Sainz took a much wider line and kept clear.  Leclerc did this in the past a lot and apparently he still hasn’t learned. Vettel often raged over the radio about this when having to jump out of his way to avoid an accident.
How you can spin this into Stroll being sloppy is amazing.  He still has one of the best overtakes of the season against Sainz.   He drove in a straight line and Leclerc turns into him  >nO mORe ExCUseS
> He did leave room. *Leclerc turned into Stroll*...  I *KNEW* Leclerc was a witch!  Sorry. Don't get up, I'll show myself out.
Leclerc, Sainz, Vettel, Alonso, Kimi, Hamilton: 🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿
> Ferrari accidentally builds another F2004 and Verstappen takes his 9th title.  It's true and hilarious how Ferrari's decent cars always seem to arrive by pure accident
F1 became a hobby to him the moment he became champion.
Yeah tbf that is a fair point. Kimi did kind of piss away the rest of his career at Ferrari.
> All the guys at Ferrari usually have long and prosperous careers after Ferrari.  Which could also indicate that they were even better drivers at their peak, which they wasted away at Ferrari.
These are not the only examples. Prost, Mansell, Alesi etc are very good examples as well.
> shell lives  **Shelf** life
Ass to mouth.
Not sure on what atm means or pinning out it has been like that for a while?
What? Ferrari have hired Sainz when he was 27, Leclerc in his 2nd year in F1 age 22, Seb after 4 WDCs at age 28, Alonso age 29 and Massa age 24. In no way does Ferrari hire anybody old for their team.
Dude if I dnf first turn of a race in iRacing I'm super tilted for a good bit. It's so frustrating when iR and SR are on the line so actual money and points being lost in F1 must be unbearable lol
Amen to that brother, I had a season in F1 league racing where I finished 1 or 2 out of 12 races. At the end of the season I was shell of myself compared to where it started.
No its not. His former self has been through plenty of real, lets call them existential, problems.   And im sure he has the perspective to be a hell of a lot less dramatic about his situation, so maybe you can too.   Theres a spectrum of reason thats fun to exist on. Join it.
Most people really fail to grasp how competitive professional athletes are. Most of the time it's all that separates them from other high level athletes. There's a lot of very athletic almost made it's walking around in the world but they just didn't have the same drive to make it to the highest level. The few I ever had the pleasure of spending time around or competing against treated winning and losing almost like it was a matter of life and death
Or was it - "To win, you have to finish first..." ?
Ferrari mechanics mount aero upside down, Sharl flies into France
Charles Leclerc will not be in F1 this year. He quits before Monaco and becomes Twitch Streamer
Yes given the right car and circumstances I think lando could be a world champion. Like button and hill and Nico rosberg. One their day they are quick but they needed everything to go right for the championships they won.   I don’t think he is on the same level as Schumacher, Verstappen, Lewis and Alonso. Those drivers are brutally fast, mercilessly consistent and hyper competitive. If they are given half a chance with a car that is competitive they will fight to very end.
Vettel believes he's one of the most talented drivers he's ever seen, if Seb believes it, I back that. It's not just because Charles Mollywhopped him Charles is a proper talent
Maybe look at last year when he had a competitive car? Lmao
I mean, the ferrari car and strategy team has fucked him a bunch, but he also has made a lot of personal mistakes that have had significant impacts on a number of his races as well.
More than Carlos yeah. It could have been an error. Looked more like bad judgement to me though, not a mistake on braking.
Alonso was further ahead at the time he was starting to overtake Lance so I think he expected it to only be 2 wide into the corner which means he took a fairly typical overtaking line for that. Definitely his mistake for being too hasty to turn but not as egregious as people have made it out to be. Just a little unlucky that Alonso had slowed down and he couldn't see it in time.
Lol he's reaching
you are comparing cars, he is comparing drivers
but Alonso's performance is not going to last, at least if we go by normative data of F1 drivers. Leclerc is developing still and he can be a George Russell if all goes well, I doubt leclerc has the guts to leave Ferrari though, Carlos will leave Ferrari voluntarily before leclerc does.
There was no way Ferrari was winning in Baku. They were eventually gonna get caught up. Although,  I think Ferrari was winning Hungary.
Keep in mind though that Verstappen himself had two mechanical DNFs while running second that cost him 36 points across the first three races of 2022 (Bahrain and Australia). If we’re going to account for LeClercs DNFs then it’s only be fair to factor in those points on top of the 80 points lead Verstappen actually achieved.  In the end Leclerc gets somewhat closer, but there’s still a large gap.
>You can attribute somewhere between 50% and 75% of that Verstappen gap to DNFs.  All those DNFs besides Leclerc binning it in France are part of the reason Red Bull simply had a superior car even pre-TD39. Pace means nothing if you don’t reach the finish line
Given the fact Verstappen DNF’d 2 of the first 3 races, that Leclerc also went ahead and won, it was pretty obvious by Miami that if RB’s car didn’t implode again that they were going to win the championship. This wasn’t even a controversial take last year after the Miami race, it’s just people making shit up a year after the fact and rewriting history.   I reject the idea that Ferrari wasn’t the “qualifying” car and Red Bull wasn’t your race car. Leclerc was known for being Mr. Saturday last season because Ferrari could never fucking convert it into a win because the RB was simply better in a race. Verstappen won more races with Leclerc on pole than he did when he got pole position, I’m not sure if that was across the whole season exactly but it was definitely the case for most of the season!
Lol it’s Leclerc’s first wheel to wheel crash since Austria 2021 and you throw out that “he still hasn’t learned”. Sounds like someone that has an agenda.  Leclerc definitely could’ve taken a wider line there, but [you could say the same that Alonso could’ve taken a tighter line on the inside and not squeezed Stroll](https://i.imgur.com/9toTGlE.jpg).   Not that it’s Alonso’s fault at all because it would’ve been difficult for him to see Charles there.   Of the three, Leclerc is definitely the one who could’ve avoided it the most, but it was still a racing incident given that it was three wide on a tight turn on lap one. It’s not glaringly obvious like you make it seem.
If leclerc was still title-less and max did that he may actually attempt suicide
Why add Kini.  He won with Ferrari.  Not that bad compared to Vettel and Alonso.
More power to him. Circumstances are strange in high level motorsport, Kimi has fun and will likely always find someone willing to give him a ride in a high level series.
That grinds my gears so much.
Kimi was never the same since Michelin went away. Even his championship year he was sub-par. He just has not been able to adjust to Bridgestone or Pirelli.
[Well, to be fair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jv7jcciKB_s)
Think he’s referring to them being a shell of their former self after Ferrari killing their mentality, not their shelf life
Yeah, my atm would be like this season or maybe past couple. Not freaking 15y
That's just age im talking about performance. If you go to Ferrari career goes nowhere. They haven't won since the pre-2010s. Top soccer players play in Europe when they can't cut it anymore in Europe then go to MLS and then their career ends. I wasn't; talking about the age of the drivers. As you pointed out they have hired young drivers.  &#x200B;  Ferrari can't get their performance right. year after year they lose the Drivers and Constructors title.
Its a tad overdramatized but if you look at him hes quite obviously sadder
This right here. It takes an insane amount of commitment, and almost an arrogant belief in your ability to truly "make it" to get to the top level of major sports. The number of talented people out there is high, the number of talented + driven + audacious enough to BELIEVE it's a possibility... that's a much smaller group.
We won't know until lando has a competitive car but Charles has binned it several times on unforced errors when pressure was mounting.  Charles is incredibly talented but I see him as a similar level to lando, he is not faultless.  It would be great if Ferrari could sort their car out and for McLaren to pull out a miracle and have a new car that isn't a truck to drive. We would have a very interesting set of races to watch for that outcome.
You mean last year when he was the only driver outside of the big three to get a podium?
I get that it doesnt mean the most but reality is our sport is not a very fair one so it'll just be a fair amount of subjectivity in the end. Rewind to the 2021 season though many experts had Lando ABOVE leclerc as "best driver". Like for example here:   https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.exclusive-the-top-10-f1-drivers-of-2021-as-chosen-by-the-drivers.6DWHaJ3vf5A3jc7hO9ivkz.html  https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.revealed-f1s-team-bosses-choose-their-top-10-drivers-of-2021.1sK8ysV0LK0MIbeNsHAkgY.html  https://the-race.com/formula-1/top-10-formula-1-drivers-of-2021-our-verdict/  I think when Norris has never had a chance in a competitive car while Leclerc has now had multiple seasons its pretty unfair to say theres a big difference in levels between them I would say.
Oh you mean last year when only one other team also had a competitive car lmao?  And yah unlike you guys who only remember 2022 Monaco, I also remember 2022 France and Spa
You can literally say the use the same excuse for Lando
Not sure if you can call it unlucky. Charles went deeper and if he kept the same line as Sainz into that corner instead of turning in earlier, he probably might have gotten Stroll still.
They weren't winning but they were in touching distance, which is the point. Ferrari didn't get that close even on tracks that should've suited them post-TD039.
It's still pretty tight between them even if you give RBR all the tracks where Ferrari DNF'd (which would be far too devoid of nuance, but this entire talking point is based on a lack of nuance anyways).  It wasn't tight at all post-Spa. TD039 unquestionably screwed Ferrari.
I have no agenda, relax. I’m just pointing out Leclerc made the mistake that led to his own dnf. Not Stroll or Ferrari.   And you can call it a racing incident, but it’s still his action that led to the crash, even without Alonso there he was still turning in on Stroll way before Stroll could turn for the apex.   And I think it’s fair to point out other examples of situational awareness when starting in the pack. It’s not like he started far back often in 2022, so 2021 isn’t that much of a stretch imo.
Man gonna have an inchident off the track.
Matty P1 will try and join him.
If max gets the next 4-5, Leclerc just quits.
Yeah, Kimi has done what no other Ferrari driver after him has been able to achieve: Win the title, even coming from behind against two top tier rivals at the very end.
He was pretty good in the Lotus though
Yeah true probably shouldn't have out atm at the end lol. It has been like it for a long time. Ferrari just find ways to self sabotage
I agree 100% with you here.   Charles arguable has the best 1 lap pace on the grid. But he is known for cracking under pressure. It also doesn’t help Ferrari car development is in a mess and their strategy department eats crayons for a living for the past few years.
I think you replied to the wrong comment
I was talking abt Charles not lando
I agree with that but I find it insane to say Leclerc's overrated and to rate Norris higher when he hasn't had any decent teammate. Sainz was mid at the time and Lando lost to him, Ricciardo is just washed and Leclerc had Ericsson but also Vettel and beat him pretty handely   He's also beat Max at the start of the season and they had great fights.  Norris is doing extremely well in the car he's in but I still don't rate him like Leclerc because we haven't seen him (and Leclerc tbf) in a competitive car for long enough
What did he do at Spa lmao? Is it his fault for getting a fucking tear off stuck into his car?
It wasn’t absolute domination like the rest of the season, but Max and Red Bull were still on pace to win both championships pretty comfortably even before TD39.  I just think people acting like we would have had a close title fight if it weren’t for TD39 are either giving Ferrari too much credit or Red Bull too little. There was already a clear difference by the time it came into effect
Don’t think anyone is blaming Stroll? He literally had nowhere to go but into Leclerc.   Leclerc can have fault in the crash and it still be a racing incident. Its not like Japan 2019 where Leclerc is 100% at fault.  Saying he hasn’t learned is harsh and just unfair. Everyone will be involved in a wheel to wheel crash where they’re at fault, doesn’t mean they havent learned.  Let’s take Max for example, since Leclerc’s last incident wheel to wheel in Austria 2021, he’s been involved incidents (where he’s at fault) with Lewis in Brazil 21, Saudi 21, Brazil 22. Does that mean he hasn’t learned?

You present podium percentages in the wins table.  Other than that, interesting read
I think part of the appeal of the earlier post was the easy interpretation of the visual graphic format. While using precise numbers technically conveys more information, it’s inherently harder to digest.
Your graph is incorrect. Blue is not starts, but "other".

Looks like Hamilton does not trust the car’s stability. Lifting early is putting the car into a “neutral” balance before breaking. Same with upshift to 8th. Seems he is not liking the feel of the car balance in some situations. Russel is more confident
Just an FYI - I wouldn’t put that much stock into time-relevant insights from FastF1. The refresh rate is only 5 Hz (so 5 data points a second). There are also distance syncing issues (which can be solved, they just aren’t included in the basic output from ff1) that also may make analysts see things in the data that aren’t real.
/edit - sorry I shoulda put the text from the image in here:      >**Turn 1:** Hamilton eases off the gas earlier. Russeli stays on the throttle longer and has to brake longer, but he's gained \~0.15s already   >   >**Turn 6:** Hamilton goes up to 8th gear whereas Russell actually downshifts and stays on the throttle this results in more speed   >   >**Final Turn**: They take the final turn differently but the gap ends up the same by the end  \---  Any other stats nerds here? I've been following F1 for a few years now and love bringing friends into the sport. One thing I feel like the sport is missing is storytelling around data and what were actually the critical moments. IDK if others feel the same.  I love things like "yards per carry" from American Football or "RBI" in Baseball. Things that give you a sense of their impact or strengths with respect to the sport. IDK if F1 really has that  I've been doing some short-form informative videos on [IG reels](https://www.instagram.com/turningpointf1/) and [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@turningpointf1) called turningpointF1 and would love feedback on what kind of stats you would want to see. More of the above? Different insights?
As a semantics nerd I must remark that it's data nerds you're looking for, not stats nerds.
T6 - for ham sounds like higher gear, less rotation of the rear
Why does the DRS have two different levels?
It's not a good look for Hamilton. The gap is huge. In some place it's 0.8 sec. Very smart from Russell to use lower gearing and lifting less in that corner.
Hamilton could also have been on a fuel saving strategy, tire management or brake temp cooling. There could be allot of reasons.
Id be curious if strategy was changed at all for race day
Is that a massive missshift on the straight between 2 and 3 or just a data issue?
Is this data correct? They were less than a tenth apart in final Q3 runs, with very similar sector times. Maybe the scaling of the graph is wrong?
George Russell: the Shitbox Whisperer
Yes this is what he has been saying about the seat position - he thinks it is too far forward, and being too far forward he can’t feel what the rear end is doing as much, leading to less confidence in the stability - was the first thing i thought of looking at the turn 6 data, upshifts to 8th gear to keep the rear end under control and not do what Albon did
Totally! Really cool to see this in the data :D
Might be an age thing. George is willing to take a risk where Lewis would rather bring the car back.
Rusell*
Which is exactly what he's been saying about the seating position.
Is there any way to solve it? Because ff1 pulls data from the official f1 livetiming APIs, so I would imagine that's the most accurate data we've got.  we should pay someone from every team to dump us all the raw telemetry data from the car :P
What is the refresh rate of the data that the teams use? 100?
This is cool thanks for putting it together. It looks like the brake data is filtered, don’t see any trail braking.   Is that a known feature of the data?  Edit: also it appears george is on the throttle the same or more than lewis over almost the entire lap. Residual plots might be useful too (george throttle - lewis throttle)
This is awesome! Do you have a Kaggle account? Would love to play with telemetry and other F1 data like this
Fair point, this is why we need semantics nerds! 😄
He didn't lose all this performance overnight, out qualifies Russell last year so I do think their is merit to him not fully trusting the car balance meaning he can't fully push.
To be fair to the man he has nothing to prove plus whilst qualifying his age might be showing, race pace he's still on it. Russell is also not a run of the mill driver, he dragged a williams it had no place being. Out of all the drivers on the grid I respect Hamilton the most and what he has achieved above all. It saddens me when people try and diminish him based on such a narrow view. I see it constantly as well. Only one person on the grid has to be perfect.
I do have to caveat that I'm looking into making sure this visualization is 100% correct, there's some conflicting data cause the gap should end at \~0.1s so I may need to amend this
This is qualifying, not race.
Not in Quali.
I can’t stand George but his spa 2021 qualifying lap cemented the fact that he knows how to get performance out of nothing
I think its nothing short of a complement that the Merc is being called a shitbox while fighting for Podiums, shows just how dominant they were.
As well as George is used to driving a bad car, 3 years in the Williams, while Lewis is grappling with not having the W11 underneath him. He’s a great driver but winning for 7 years then being chucked into the trenches of the midfield is a big adjustment physically and mentally
It's more like Lawis has 103 wins and 7 world titles (some would argue more).  The only moment you will see him take a serious risk now is if he can compete for more wins or titles.   George is hitting the ground running because he is talented and wants to get as much result out of the car as possible.
Ruseel*
I’m not sure there are. The 5 Hz is fine for TV, and I’m sure that teams don’t want other teams to have more detailed looks at their strengths and weaknesses.
I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s higher.
I don't believe the cars transmit the exact brake pressure data. Just "On" or "Off".
Massa would argue he has less.  Anyone can argue stupid things.
This is correct. How a driver brakes is considered proprietary information.
Lol you really took that personally, damn

Another example of consistency which makes a helmet design much easier to remember and associate with the driver.
I respect a driver that treats their helmet as their identity and doesn't fuck around with the fundamentals.  Like the good old days.
who would have thought that he got more points in his first year in williams than his last year in ferrari
It's almost like he commissioned new helmet art every year... but always used the previous year as a reference, and it slowly deviated from there.
First one lools like an X-Men helmet
wow, one of the best and most consistent helmet evolutions I’ve seen!
My favourite is the 2009 helmet, it saved his life. He says he keeps it on his furniture at home.
Easily the nicest helmet of his time.
Did he have special one-off helmets as well?
First thought it was Lando's
His world championship-winning* one was my favourite.
Is there a higher res source?  Cool post.  Love Felipe Baby.
2011-2012 are the best ones
2004 is hotness
Champ helmet's colors are amazing
Am i the only one,that expected the 2009 helmet to have a hole in it?
I really like the one he wore the year he won the WDC.
*2008 WDC Massa
If you ever change your helmet, at least change it once you’ve found what you want as your look. Massa found it
Stokin' the fire.
massa rocked the xbox logo before it was cool
Hill, Stewart, Fittipaldi, Lauda, Schechter… all identifiable at a glance.
I think he peaked in 2002
But what about his suits? (Now, it’s a lawsuit!)
2011 and 2012 are easily his best designs. Also you could spot them a mile away, given the nice contrast between the lime green and Ferrari's red.
I dont care what ppl say, he just wasnt the same after Hungary.
8 seasons at Ferrari… I love Mass but boy did he win the lottery on this.
Hakkinen's helmet design is the one I kneel to. 🙇‍♂️
I feel consistency is boring. I admire drivers who have something unique for every race.
Not seeing much consistency.
I love that I can go back and watch races from the V8 era and spot Massa from a mile away. I love when drivers keep consistent helmet designs
How it should be
TBF, the possibilities for that are nowadays a lot less. Because if you look at the helmets in the OP, they gradually started implementing these standardized sponsor areas (like the horizontal band around the top of the helmet).   A design like Massa's only works today with all those designated sponsor areas is because you know what is supposed to be below these areas.   Nowadays, helmet designs are largely designed with these sponsor areas in mind, meaning there's not much room for creativity.
Only because of the double points rule in Abu Dhabi that year
Otherwise known as: design evolution.   See: the entire auto industry.
Yes, but for those statistics, I only include the generic ones.   He had special designs for following GPs:   [Brazil 2011](http://www.italiaspeed.com/2011/motorsport/f1/19_brazil/montezemolo/2611.html)     [Brazil 2012](https://grandprix20.com/2012/11/23/felipe-massa-pays-tribute-to-his-father-with-helmet-livery/)     [Brazil 2013](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/f1-helmets--392094711280126928/)    [Silverstone 2014](https://avtomaniya.com/pubsource/photo/8337/225-felipe-massa-williams-silverstone-2014jpg.jpg)     [Monaco 2016](https://arrestedmotion.com/2016/05/os-gemeos-designs-felipe-massa-helmet/)   [Brazil 2016](https://twitter.com/WilliamsRacing/status/797785478812540928)     [Belgium 2017](https://elkenor.com/events/felipe-massa-joy-of-racing-martini-campaign)     [Abu Dhabi 2017](https://www.racefans.net/2017/11/24/love-massa-reveals-special-farewell-helmet/)
It’s bwoken
I personally like consistency but doesn’t have to be the same, see Seb with the German flag, some of his were amazing
He also kept a consistent team during the V8 era. It lasted as long as his Ferrari stint.
If you factor out the double points, he scores 116 points in 2014 so still beats his 2013 points tally.
Sheeeshkebab that Belgium one is clean
Oh whaw, thanks for the list!  How do you search those?

Kellys face when max asks if they can put the harley in the living room 😂😂🤣
They cut it in this clip but Kelly also reassured Max she wouldn't let him get fat as he envisioned
Poor guy, no one's gonna let him ride his Harley.
Max to H.A. after 2028 confirmed.
now i gotta know what kind of harley it is. he doesn't seem like a bagger bro or the oldschool type. something like the low rider s maybe?
No. I never envisioned this. But now my life will be incomplete until I see it.
Max probably loves anything with an engine really, he likes quads, motorcross bikes etc. too
*...I have a Harley*  For what?  Uhhhh
Harley has some orange branding, but nowhere near as orange as KTM.
Not really? But I laughed a little imagining him having a handlebar moustache
Apparently he bought ‘a Harley’ (nobody cares to elaborate) and he had it customized by Von Zadig in Belgium. Don’t know what bike it’s based on and what the end result looks like.
I'm not sure if he's serious or joking about owning a motorcycle that Kelly doesn't know about. I feel like it could so be either.
I can't tell if he's serious or just joking... He really has a Harley and she doesn't know? That would be hilarious
I can understand if it's in his contract not ride a motorcycle. You know what doctors call motorcyclists? Organ donors!
What is this from?
Simply lovely!!
Everyone admires F1 drivers, but it's well-known that F1 drivers admire MotoGP riders because you have to be borderline crazy to race on two wheels at those speeds.  I would've paid good money to see F1 drivers competing in a one-off on two wheels.
Damn their relationship gives me some weird vibes
Cruisers are great for the road...nice to know Max's got himself a Harley
I mean he also has a sim rig in there, so you might as well
She is such a mom.
The Roadster is the best looking Harley
Yh he may have a Sportster.  Still can't believe he has a Harley, he rlly doesn't strike me as a Harley guy. In fact he does look and act like the definition of a Gixxer bro lmao
I remember reading a couple years back that it is a customized forty-eight
Springer
The new docuseries about Max. It’s called Max Verstappen: Anatomy of a Champion on Viaplay NL.
Look up John Surtees.   F1 WDC with Ferrari.  But also, multiple world champ on motorcycles. As a matter of fact, most years he would win TWO world championships, 350 and 500cc.   https://www.motorcycle.com/features/motorsports-legend-john-surtees-passes-1934-2017.html
I’ll phone them and let them know your opinion
Convert the bike into a moto gp sim rig ,😂
Well thats at least part of his job  Is what he probably says hahaha
[Something something groomer](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxL4HwSKPdYDBir2m7fOunrnwqJgrSZKN1)
> he rlly doesn't strike me as a Harley guy.   Maybe it was an aspirational thing? Young Max saw a Harley in some Hollywood movie/TV show or had an older male family member own a Harley? So he made a promise to himself "When I get the money, I'll definitely buy one!"  But yeah, I would *never* have guessed it lol
Is there a way to watch it somewhere online
Oh yeah, I know all about him.  It's especially impressive because he did it in two different motorcycling classes. Since it's not a typical F1-F2 situation and "weaker" classes (especially back then) weren't just treated like a lower series, but rather a high-end competition of a different type.   Shame that we never got to see Rossi have a go at it since he was *so* close and now it's impossible to imagine anyone doing it in the distant future as sports are becoming more specialized than ever.
Moto GP Road Hog edition!
I remember 5 or 6 years ago, Lewis was doing some motorcycle track-time with I believe V. Rossi, and Lewis was pretty fast on two wheels. I bet he would win a motorcycle race against the current F1 grid.
Yeah, although that was promotional only.   Theoretically speaking, he's probably the favorite. However, I know Max & Lando are big MotoGP fans so it'd be interesting to see how they fare.   Shame there are not more British riders in MotoGP to diversify things, and it doesn't look like there will be for the foreseeable future.

Elite sportsman are weird people. Battling is fun and all, but have you tried *winning*?
No driver would intentionally slow down just to race others, there so many things that could go wrong, its not worth the risk.  The opposite is more likely to happen. If a faster car ends up behind a slower car then instead of fighting to overtake the faster car holds a bit back, saves its tyres and when the slower car ahead pits, then in free air the fast car suddenly laps a lot faster and does an over-cut.
Imagine Redbull doing what Lewis did in Abu Dhabi 2016 but every race. Scary
I'm sure some drivers have been ordered to take it easy to save the machinery (and/or sandbag in practice) but I've never heard of anyone doing so simply to mix it up with the competition.  The general consensus seems to be that to win is great, to dominate is better.
When Brabham introduced the BT46B fan car at the 1978 Swedish grand prix they deliberately qualified on full fuel tanks in order to mask the pace of the car.  That wasn't the driver though, and there's no way a driver would slow down just to fight other drivers. These guys want above all to win.
No it won't happen.   If you got a dominant car you try to create a Safety car gap to the next driver as Mercedes has done in the past. And "safe" the car as best as you can.  A gap big enough that if a safety car is ordered the leader can go into the pit for new tyres and come out  on track again in front of the number 2 if that number 2 decides not to pit.   That way only a technical mallfunction can cost you the win.
Red Bull will have set their eyes on winning as many races as possible (read; all). That means you need to create a SC pit window to ensure you’re always in control.
You are never gonna go slow enough to be under threat.  But you would absolutely slow down to save the machinery and not look too dominant.  Winning by 10-20 seconds is plenty comfortable.
Slowing down to find a race, doubtful in my mind but letting the pack stay close to save the tires, fuel and/or the machine was and is a smart move most of the time.
McLaren in 1998 told the drivers not to build too much of a gap in the early races. They still lapped every other car.
Not quite the same thing, but Villeneuve running slowly at the 1997 Japanese GP, knowing that he was likely to serve a penalty for an infringement earlier in the weekend, and trying to back title rival Schumacher into the pack, scuppered by Irvine on light duel being able to pass his way to the front anyway.
Not a driver, but it was confirmed that merc often ran lower engines in the 2014-16 period so the fia doesent nerf them.  Both Max and Checo drove to a pretty low set delta during the Bahrain gp, but thats not for fun, but more so for safety.   If you want drivers going slow for various reasons, you have Checo AD21, Hamilton AD16 or Alonso at Monaco 22. These are blatant but there probably are plenty others
Not the drivers but teams have.   Merc in 2014 ran with the engines waaaay dialled back most of the time, and I mean dialled back by a hell of a lot. That being an era where there were no restrictions on changing engine modes meant that if they ever did get into trouble they could just turn it back up.
Niki Lauda once said that they had to intentionally take it easy in qualifying with the Brabham BT46 'Fan car' to not make it obvious.  They still took pole.
There are literally team radios where they tell the drivers the target lap time they have to do. Verstappen ignored them in saudi arabia, for example, doing low 32s when asked to do 33.0  This isn't remotely new, or speculative, or anything.
I think RB would do that to avoid scrutiny, it would be smart, though I don’t think they’ll do it enough to put a win in jeopardy
It's the reliability vs. performance scenario.  You don't want to go so slow that you screw up tire temps or risk the win, but if you can take on a little time to minimize the risk of a DNF and still win, you should.
Racers with dominant cars often slow down to AVOID confrontation. See Max on L1 in AUS as a recent example. Dominance facilitates less risk-taking behaviour.
I can remember Button being asked to bring car home in Turkey 2009 if I’m correct, his lap time dropped significantly while leading the race.
I have a feeling that's what Perez did with Norris in Australia but RF nullified that and now we have people saying Perez couldn't even catch a McLaren.
It would be fun. I can totally see Verstappen holding Perez to let Alonso get closer.   Probably won't happen, but fun to think about.
Mans legendary enough to have a race win in all the crazy circumstances.  Slowing down the whole field and winning  Only car on the starting grid  Keeping a car inside a second of his lead to win   Win on three wheels…
Except teams themselves have been warned not to stomp the field too badly. I think it was Bernie who warned Mercedes that if they were miles ahead of the field, they would get zero coverage and sponsors wouldn’t be happy with the missed TV time.
Adrian Newey explains how they sandbagged with Damon at testing in 1996 (IIRC) in his book, just as a side note. Neat stuff (awful proofreading)
Still took pole also
Paddy lowe
That's completely different. That's to conserve the car and reduce the likelihood of a crash. OP is talking about slowing down to battle the others, perhaps to make things more interesting
3 wheels win was what got me into this sport.
He didnt win the only car on grid race though did he?
Ah.... But that's why red bull has perez
Nope. Andretti did (not that surprising given how much Brabham did to avoid taking pole), and actually led the majority of the race too. Someone spilled oil on the track in the race though and the Brabham's advantage really became clear.
Oh wow really? I can’t believe I remembered that wrong. I could swear Lauda took pole. My bad

Maybe if RB have a Brazil 2022 type weekend and Mercedes still haven't sorted their issues out, a win will be on the cards.   Season's just started, and a win is still on the cards, for all 2.5 non RB teams fighting for podium places.
I’m generally a Lawrence Stroll critic, but this is exactly the right time for him to be asking that of his team…
I thought they had that 5 year plan? Is only their... What? 3rd year isn't it?
It’ll be pretty funny if it’s Lance who achieves Aston’s maiden win, especially if it happens in Canada!
That name will never not be funny.
My bet is that Alonso will win the Monaco GP if there are no mechanical issues. That car has superior mechanical grip.
I just want my son to finally win a race… and his third title too if possible.
Both Fernando and Lance are exceptional in the rain so I would bet on that.
My guess is that Fernando can win in some of this races: Canada, Austria, Hungary or Brazil if the stars align.
Why do we insist on using his full name every time? Wouldn't it be easier just calling him Mike or Krack
By the looks of it, whenever Max and Checo take each other out. Difficult to see anyone else winning on pace alone this season.
Stroll will maybe win if the 2 RB and Alonso crash altogether
All it takes is a Max DNF and I back Alonso to take Perez in a head to head battle if the cars are anywhere near even. It's quite possible.
"when Alonso is going to win?"
If you have an Alonso, you have a chance. Upgrade the car and a bit of luck. A win can come this season but it all depends on Red Bull
The honest answer is “when Max DNFs”
By we, you mean Alonso?
Monaco
To quote another source from the paddock: “Next year (TM)”
When red bull double dnf on a track that doesn’t expose the dragginess of that AMR23
I just need 100M to sign max verstappen
When Max has an off week.
Double DNF from Red Bull, sir.
The window is closing if Merc continues to get better without even upgrading their car yet.
Just need someone to go bowling like Hungary 2021. A
Has the man not watched a race this season?
Spain should be spicy imo. Only one major drs zone and one small one could mean less race prowess for RBR.
Gotta send one of the cars bowling Lawrence.
Imagen Alonso wining Mónaco 😁
Stroll will never win a race.
When lance takes out max and checo
When both Red Bulls crash out, that's when.
With their advantage in downforce, I think their best chance to win is Monaco or a wet weekend.
Lance with a miracle Monaco qualifying.  Starts from and blocks everyone til the end
Just need a few red flags like last weekend to wipe out everyones remaining engines.
One big oopsie into T1 and nando has clear sailing
As is literally everybody…  If Red Bull have a cock-up or they have a double DNF like Bahrain last year pretty sure Aston are the favorites for the win
Waddaya mean "We" Kimo sabe?
When Max (and to a lesser extent, Checo) DNF
then after alonso get their first win, he's going to ask when is Lance's turn to win
The data shows they just need more straight line speed. Alonso has done fantastic with the current car
When redbulls explode
Ask Stroll to take both RB out in T1 and if the stars are lined up in the right way after that, ALO can have the win.
Depends on when Lance decides to go bowling.
Como 33?
When Max and Checo both crash.
when you replace your son with a better driver
"When Lance realizes he has mirrors"
Working with Lawrence must be the worst t experience in your life
Have Lance full send it on turn 1 while Alonso hangs back….
Monaco is the best bet.
Sooner than Maclearen
I mean if the Aero penalty against Red Bull works, they'll have good chances outdeveloping Red Bull and winning the championship with a good 2nd half of the season.
*heheheh Mike Krack*
I’d assume when both Max and Checo crash or catch on fire.
Maybe Monaco? Maybe Canada,
MY CRACK
I hope Fernando wins in Monaco. Stroll should take out Leclerc for the memes lol
~~Maybe a Monza 2020 type event.~~  Monza  Daddy stroll often gives me Fat Tony vibes, maybe he will arrange accidents for RB
Maybe daddy can buy him a win.
Only if Toto does not turn off the AM engines remotely
It really sucks but with Merc and Ferrari bringing significant upgrades in the next two races I would be surprised to see the Astons on the podium for much longer. They made a massive step forward but I think next year is where they take the fight to the top. The additional wind tunnel time that they have up until the summer break will affect next year's car the most.
That CAN'T be a real journalist's name??
Of course he is. He’s a capitalist which means he never has enough. You made $20 for me yesterday, I need you to make $30 for me today.
As long as he insists on having his son in one of the cars he's basically halving their chance for a win.
When stroll stops sucking… and actually drives like he wants to win… instead of being okay running mid pack . Being gifted a Win…
And this is why they are not going to win
What was Mike Cracks answer
It takes an RBR implosion/accidents and we will see if Merc has a good month developing an update.
He’ll have to ask Christian Horner that
Lawrence, buddy....this is more of an appropriate question for Redbull, not Krack.
We? There is no we.[nando](https://giphy.com/gifs/f1-tJY68TKk9Y7qC1px08)
When both Red Bull DNF is the answer
To finish first, first you have to finish. Anything can happen.  When, who knows. Maybe pay someone to wreck the red bulls to speed things up.
How about stop the rally cross excursions for starters
Lawrence Stroll means it, but he's still reasonable with expectations. I just know though people are going to lambast him...it seems whatever Lawrence or Lance does, there's still a group of people who just say rubbish about them. At least that noise isn't as loud as it was say, from 2017-2019.
I'd put money on at the end of the season when the parts life gets a bit gruelling, both Sergio and Max having to start with grid penalties and one of them gets hobbled in a first lap fracas, leading to a fairly easy 1-2 for Aston Martin as the other one makes it back to 3rd  The only question is, in that situation, would Lawrence be ok with Alonso leading his boy be quite a margin to that 1-2, or will certain factors happen to ensure Lance is ahead to bring that first win?
Monza.   Lol I have no idea.
When both red bulls crash.
For anyone other than Red Bull to win a race this year it would have to be a Mercedes at Hockenheim 2019 level of colossal fuck-up.  The only exception to that being someone doing a lap of the gods in Monaco qualifying and managing to hold off Max for 78 laps.
I have nothing relevant to add, but I will never not laugh at “Mike Krack”
Didn't they do that in 2020 already?
Oh boy, someone has to tell him…
Will: When your driver finishes the race ahead of everyone
Given that Red Bull haven't had stellar reliability this far, an Aston Martin win is absolutely possible this season. But I do think it would require at least one Red Bull car to break down or crash out since they're just so fast.
Unless both RB and Mercs have big issues then it aint gonna happen.
From 2 races, so not much factual yet, it seems that RB and AM have the same track preferences, and Merc have other. So when there is a track that does not suit RB well, AM will also be disadvantaged, and Merc might be better suited. With that, the only way I see AM win is when both RB’s are not scoring on a track that suits RB and AM.
Lawrence is right. Perhaps the RBR personnel he poached are not the actual talents behind the rocketship RB19. LMAO. Toto, Zak, Lawrence should all try to lure Newey over to their teams before he retire for good.
I mean unless Red Bull has a Verstappen DNF (or a severe mechanical issue like Silverstone last year) and some kind of Checo disaster, nobody else is winning a race this year. But odds say that will happen at some point so a fluke win could be in the cards.
My brother in christ! You have Alonso for a teammate
When both Red Bulls take each other out in a Spain 2016 crash
On the right circuit AM have a W in the
Much as I like a Nando win, a Lance win would be awesome.
The RB19 is still a better car than the AMR23 and Max Verstappen is still a better driver than the guys you have.
I definitely see them winning a race at some stage this year - its a question of whether they can win or merit or if they will depend on RB issues.
I just knew that Ferrari is that half team, not AM
I'm really looking forward to AM's upgrades. They have a massive amount of wind tunnel time for the first half of the season when compared to other top teams. If they can put that time to good use, who knows what they can achieve.  Is it public knowledge when they will bring their first upgrade package?
Ferrari is not winning a race this year
Love how Ferrari aren't even considered
The main issue for them at this point seems to be Mercedes jumping forward. Jeddah, they were genuinely faster, Australia, they just didn't have the pace.
I think they have a better than even chance of winning a race this year.  If you're consistently running in the podium places, it's only a matter of time until something swings your way.
Or a 2018 Baku type race day
With 6 sprint races a suboptimal red bull setup is almost inevitable.
I dunno. Ferrari was solidly second fastest at Bahrain which is the probably the most technical track out of the 3 we've seen so far, and the only reason Sainz fell off was the deg on the tire and Charles car breaking.   I know people are always quite down on Ferrari but based on interviews with Fred he seems FAR more composed and capable at leading a team back to where it needs to be than Binotto ever did sadly.
Everyone thought Williams was gonna luck out in some weekend back in 2014..
Yes I’m sure he’s extremely happy with their progress but his ultimate goal is a championship so of course they can’t just stagnate now but have to keep grinding
or they can go the Renault route and reset their 5 year plan every year
I think the five year plan was to become a championship challenger. Which they are not in 2023, odd win or not. So they are not getting ahead of themselves.
Putting a lot of faith in Lawrence's patience
Stroll ‘23, Stroll ‘24, Stroll ‘25…
They're Reverse-Alpine.
Even still, the idea is to get it asap.  If Krack is repeating this to the public, I'm sure it's meant in a positive sense. It's just basically "We're consistently competing for podiums now, when do we reach the next step of a race win?"
And one year ago they were dead last. Hardly 'normal' progression which makes me question even more if this years car isnt simply a fluke.
Tbh if there is rain I could see Stroll taking his maiden win, no drs and he is amazing in the wet
Technically it won't be their maiden win as a team, but as Aston Martin, yes.
Going to be at that race and that would be fuckin sick
With Alonso luck, it could be a bottle bowling scenario and lace goes from p5 to p1 in 1 corner
I'd love to hear Mike Hunt's take on Aston taking a win this season.
Yeah "Lawrence" does crack me up every time
Lawrence: <sniffs> Where is my crack?  Mike: Here I am!  Lawrence: I meant my coc... Oh yeah Mike my man. When we winning?
Shout out to Mike Ocksmal
I feel rb’s corner exit speed is so good it trumps the aston’s late braking advantage, maybe a track like hungary where medium-high speed corners dominate and there’s not a lot of drs or acceleration zones aston can have a better chance, they’d just need to hold rb off for an entire race where in monaco alonso just needs a good pole time
It's their best bet. If you put it on pole you're probably gonna win unless your Leclerc.
It would be cool to see him win there
If they qualify 1-2 somehow the one being #1 after the first corner should win the race easily, if the #1 just holds the rest back a little bit (which sainz didn't do e.g.)  Qualifying in Monaco will be so hyped  Everyone wanting that Alonso win but inb4 Stroll will be the one somehow, like Rosberg winning one over Schumacher in the Merc that year.
>My bet is that Alonso will win the Monaco GP if there are no mechanical issues. That car has superior mechanical grip.  By what logic? Their mechanical grip is the one thing that should be identical. Same tires, same dimension of tire and unless they do the setup differently (different camber, etc), there's no reason their mechanical grip should be different.  Maybe the length of the wheelbase could impact this, but I think that will mostly impact the turning circle radius, not so much the grip itself.  If you mean slow speed corner grip, yeah sure, maybe.
Alonso can give the greatest drive of his life, but a slow stop or a bad call from the wall can take it all away at Monaco.  The saving grace is that Alonso is so aware he might push back on a stupid call.
Bla bla bla Alfa last year
Didn't the mercedes powertrain dnf twice already this year? car 18 and 63 both died. it's gonna be alonso's turn sooner or later, and I am betting its the lap where Alonso in q3 with 2 purple sectors
Read this in Connor Moore's voice.
Yeah, but so is Max and Lewis. It's, imo, heavily dependent on Merc's development pace and RB having an issue or screwing something up. Or Alonso pulling out El Magia™ at Monaco or Hungary or something.
Max had one of the most impressive wet drives in recent memory in Japan last year.
>Canada, Austria, or Brazil  I don't see that. Aston Martin lack top speed and the long straights in all those tracks won't suit the AMR23. Focus on tracks with a lot of slow to medium speed corners like Monaco, Hungaroring, Zandvoort and Singapore.
I mean, even with the stars aligning I don’t see how they could beat RB in Brazil if this doesn’t mean both cars DNF.
Because it’s hilarious
Let's be real, it draws more attention this way 😂
I’d prefer to call him Khia since her song is always playing in my head anyway as soon as I’m reading his name
Nearly every time Crofty or Brundle comment a name of a driver, it's their full name. It makes more sense and is more readable to say "Mike Krack". The brain processes it quicker and easier.
 George and lewis will double team alonso and I don't think stroll can be in the equation to fight back. unless stroll found a way ahead of them in the first laps
The cars will not be even this year unless FIA nerfs Red Bull
Stroll has done impressively well against his benchmarks, former world champions, a 4 time and a 2 time. And we all know the 2 time's stats don't reflect his abilities.  I can't see Stroll beating Alonso on an even playing field, but there's a good chance he'll be in position to pick up scraps if Alonso drops them.
Yes. Very yes. Like it’s the only possible option.
Don’t give Lawrence any ideas
if max win a couple more with redbull he might jump over for fun so he can have actual competition. its not like redbull will not welcome him back if it goes south
I personally feel like, at this point, Australia was an anomaly. Track characteristics perhaps suited Mercedes more than Aston Martin, whereas the opposite was true in the previous races.
Mercedes wasn't faster than Aston last week. Alonso and Hamilton had identical pace. And this was a zero deg race, which suited Merc much better than Aston.
That's just because the track and conditions were advantegous for Mercedes.   I dunno why some people are acting like the Merc wasn't the pickiest car on the grid last season.
If Ocon and a plug like Maldonado can win one, I don't see how Stroll can't, especially in a competitive car.
He proved in Turkey 2020 that he can be comfortable in the lead. I wouldn’t blame his result on him. Only time will tell though, either he’ll turn out to be allergic to wins like Hulkenberg is allergic to podiums or he’ll get a lucky one and that’s it
Modern crashgate inspired by Bottas
I think they could beat checo. A Max DNF and I think there’s a possibility for AM to take one.
 i think it would work, but Mercedes and ferrari are screwing themselves over so the gap would not close. If Mercedes stuck to the right concept I don't see Aston being ahead of them.
I mean, you are talking like if AM will not have upgrades for the next races and its complety wrong. They will have significant upgrades in Baku, Imola, Barcelona and Canada confirmed by Mike Crack. All teams will bring upgrades, we cannot know which team will upgrade better their car, but if we take into consideration wind tunnel, AM have a slight advantage
It’s the name of Aston’s TP
i don't think there is a single aston martin employee happy with not trying for a car that can win.
Lol tell that to McLaren. They don't have anyone's of the bosses son there and they are still not even close to winning. Such a lame comment you made.
This is why they jumped from 7th to 2nd.
Who’s that?
williams 1,2
I see Alonso being able to pull it. But Max would have to hit traffic or something doing Qualifying
Monaco, Hungary, Zandvoort, and maybe Singapore should be interesting tracks for this car.
Merit or not, win is a win. I wanna see Alonso and/or Stroll get a win.
Max won’t let anyone else win at Zandvoort though, just out of willpower
They'll still have to be in a position to capitalise. Williams were usually seen as the second quickest in 2014 but every time Mercedes lost it was Ricciardo that snatched the win. It's a good thing they have a driver who knows very well how to win a race.
I'd argue a win is on merit regardless. To win the race you have to finish the race. That means building a reliable car and not crashing it.
I'm calling a win on merit in Monaco.
They will 1000% be reliant on RB issues and likely Merc issues tbh.  I'm expecting Merc to step up as the year goes on and Aston to step back.
If your car doesn't have issues while your rivals do, you're winning on merit.
My gut tells me it depends on RB issues.   McLaren won cause of issues, Alfa tauri won cause of issues, alpine won cause of issues.   The top teams are just too dominant to win against straight up.
They're in the same place mclaren was in 2021, but with Ferrari in the way if they can get their shit together too. Could have had decent results in australia but they got screwed  They're not going to have an easy time of it
They’re gonna need external factors to play right in order for them to win. We’ve already seen Mercedes make a massive stride forward (all the while moaning about how slow they are and how the RBs are so fast), so Aston’s gonna have to out-develop Mercedes, let alone RBR.
Narrator: no one could win on merit against such a dominant red bull.
I really don’t see anyone being able to beat Red Bull on merit at the moment. Maybe towards the end of the year, as they switch development focus to next year’s car. There’s some hope that the aero restrictions will rein in their development but that’s in the medium to long term.
Nobody is beating RB this season 'on merit'. Only a RB reliability issue will let anyone else win on pure pace.
Yeah no shit. One team has a podium every race the other is barely hanging in the points.
> I'm really looking forward to AM's upgrades.  Same. Will be interesting to see what they've got in the pipeline.   > Is it public knowledge when they will bring their first upgrade package?  No idea.
Progressively from Baku to Spain. Baku, Imola, Silverstone, Spain notably. McLaren, Redbull, Ferrari and Mercedes both have similar plans. Not sure about Alpine or the others.
Stranger things have happened.  I think Verstappen will win 15+, while Leclerc somehow wins 1, Alonso 1, Hamilton 1, and Perez the rest. It’s just a hunch, but neither Sainz nor Russell will a race this year.
They might have a chance in places like Monaco and Singapore
If they got podium in 2020 and Seb did as well, they can win this year.
They're the 0.5 team lmao
Yep
i think he bought the team to help his son, and then realize if he manages to make a championship-contending team he can actually make a bank so he poured money into it, luckily lance is fast enough to be still relevant in his push to win a WCC, so no hard questions needs to be asked if lance stroll is in the way of the WCC.
The 5 year plan starts always starts next year
They changed it to 100 races plan. :P
With how intricate an F1 car is, you don't fluke your way into it. Whether or not they can sustain that development is another question.
Don't you just hate it when you accidentally build one of the fastest pieces of machinery in the history of mankind in a format known for its technical complexity?
The issue is the best rain drivers on the grid also have good cars this year. Max, both mercs and Fernando.  Also it seems like in the last couple of seasons Stroll didnt really enjoy the wet weather as much
He is but there are better wet weather drivers on the grid.
Russia 2021 enters the chat
He was really good in the rain when he was still a bad driver in general, but now that he's become a decent driver, his rain performances don't stand out at all anymore. Or that's been my impression.
Stroll is wildly inconsistent in the rain, i wouldnt say hes consistently good. Either hes dogshit in the rain or hes amazing. I think youre just forgetting the times when he really sucked in the rain
Max is probably the best wet weather driver on the grid in the fastest car…
If they actually let the cars drive while the track is wet, rather than waiting for it to be dry enough for inters.
I wonder if AM will struiggle a bit in the wet because they have trouble heating up the tires.  It has already hurt Stroll's other strength: his race starts.
>but as Aston Martin, yes  Maybe that's why he wrote *Aston Martin*
when did you buy tickets, they are all sold out now!
Surely Holden Hiscock and Barry MacDickensider also have something to say about this.
[Lawrence Sheldon Strulović](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Stroll)
Never met him. But my name is Mike Oxlong.
well, we all know how good alonso is at defending in hungary...  come to think of it, hungary is also where he got his first f1 win 20 years ago
The thing is that by the time we get to Hungary, so many races will have passed that it's genuinely hard to predict how the cars' performance will look like by then. Even Monaco seems kind of risky at the moment.
Or Ricciardo. Monaco 2016 still hurts.
Not really the same seeing as rosberg was way faster at Mercedes than Schumacher
Stroll qualifying second in Monaco? Maybe with a lucky red flag, but on pace? No way
Monaco qualifying has become a total shitshow
Different suspension?
Red Bull and Aston Martin run opposite pull-rod/push-rod setups. I can't remember which one runs which on what end of the car, but their suspensions are very different.
lance also had probably one of the best starts in japan last year
maybe Singapore when they stop developing the rb19, it would be funny for alonso to win there this time though, did he win there since 2008?
That´s the definition of ¨stars align¨ ha ha ha.   I based on the race last year where the 2 redbulls had one of their worst races in Brazil.
Less and less each time though :'-(
Is he related to Mike Hunt and Ben Dover?
I dunno, Alonso ON IT and Perez doing an AUSGP rerun I could see Aston Martin on the top step
I wouldn’t be shocked if Red Bull is caught after the summer break. They will have both titles wrapped up and given the penalty and some of what we have heard, they are likely moving on to 24 already. Scarbs suggested they have a tiny bit of planned development for this year then they will be moving on.
Yup. Especially the cold temps and difficulty in bringing tire temps helped Mercs a lot and hindered the AMs. I wouldn't read too much into Australia.
And Melbourne had 4 DRS zones where the Aston sucks..
But Aston has to capitalise as much as they can early on, because I'm sure at the end of the season Merc will be back up to being better than them consistently.
and aston was one of the worst cars last season?   mercedes being better in a wider window is more belivable than a team jumping from 7th to 2nd
i mean carlos won too and i don't put carlos over ocon
Stroll did the same thing as Bottas in hungary21, it's just that he hit the rest of the top10 that somehow evaded the Bottas missle.  Also Stroll is a natural in crashing, ffs he almost crashed Alonso out of the Bahrain race. When something will happen between Stroll and a frontrunner, i wouldnt even believe it being ill intention, it's just how he races
Thanks!
Where is he wrong though?      Lance can be pretty fast on a good day but unless we have an '07 Monza or '12 Spain, he's not about to win a race any time soon. Lance can be a podium contender at any time he wants but it'll take some  events to get him on the top step.
when aston was slow last year there were murmurs of micromanagement and bad workplace culture with him around. Im not sure if that changed but at least they have Dan Fallows whom Lawernce probably would respect of more.
Alonso Qualifying on pole at Monaco and fend off a frustrated stuck Max behind him would be a sight to see.   Finger crossed for Max not rage quitting
Alonso win in Singapore? Can't imagine this to be controversial in any way.
Doubt he'll win in Zandvoort, the power of orange will fuel the RB19 that day.
Zandvoort has some very quick corners as well. I'm sure RB will be quite strong from corner 3 to 9. I don't think it's too comparable to Monaco or Singapore.
Chances for Alonso in Singapore if Lance loses his car. Unfortunate accident.
I was watching a racing documentary last week (can't remember the name), and this quote applies: "It doesn't matter if you win by an inch or a mile. Winning's winning."
Your car being on better condition than your rivals is also worthy of winning.
Just like that infamous race back at Indianapolis, eh?
I love Alonso's driving and his antics, but I'd want it for stroll even more. Just because he gets quite some stick for being shat on for his dad owning the team. Did that help him ? Absolutely. Does he deserve to be in a team in the position they are right now on sheer merit? Also absolutely.
I think RB can run a decent amount of wing with their efficiency. Zandvoort is not actually that slow so I think RB will be fine with the advantage they have, especially in the faster corners in the middle of the lap. Then their very strong drs might make them over of the few cars that can overtake on this track.
I really enjoyed Panis win in Monaco! Probably my all time favorite race, possibly beaten by Adelaide -94 (and I say this as a Hill fan).
Yeah, winning not on merit is if say a driver got disqualified after the race for a non-racing reason, and you got promoted to first. Pretty unlikely circumstances
Motor racing is a team sport. That includes the factory, the mechanics, the strategists and the drivers. Every win is always absolutely on merit.
Stroll's maiden grand chelem, you heard it here first
Ive got this gut feeling Russell will win before Lewis yet again.. and I don't like that as a Lewis fan lol
I'd really like a Hamilton win this year. It'd be a good confidence booster after going winless last year.
Leclerc definitely has the talent to win at least one race in spite of Ferrari, but only if he can mentally overcome the depression.
PErez winning 5? *buys stock in champagne*
It starts when Ferrari wins a championship.
Its more structured than ferrari's 1 year plan that always starts next year.
Debatably the pink mercedes was a fluke, an intentional fluke if that makes any sense, but something that definitely wasn’t sustainable.
Just see his start from the Japan GP, it was excellent. Stroll is a decent driver, we’ve seen that in 2020 with RP and seeing it again this year but he’s definitely inconsistent
I don't think there was any year where Stroll had better car than Max, yet he has beaten him in wet sometimes
Charles is almost there as a great rain driver, he just needs to iron out some issues.
Has Russel had a few good wet races? I know he was decent at a damp Imola in a Williams but I can't remember other ones that stood out.
Like Max and Alonso.  EDIT: Yes, there are others as well like Lewis and George. I just wrote the first two names that came to mind.
Can you stay out on this condition?
>  I think youre just forgetting the times when he really sucked in the rain  Like when? He has had a pole, a front row start, and a P4 in the wet.
Aston Martin is just a sponsor for the team though. In the record books the team already has a win
[SHELDON?!](https://youtu.be/99lYuY8KsC0)
Would be poetic, but from a sheer performance pov I think hungary may be stronger for aston vs monaco, but maybe I’ll be wrong, been wrong many times before this week lol
And had one of the most impressive performances in the wet I can remember in 2006. He looked like a Rocket ship against Schumi. That damn pitstop man...
Yeah very true, rb or aston can eliminate even more of their weaknesses, still think aston will be closest on low speed tracks because of their supposed unoptimized rear end but not sure like you said
You do realize that in the year Rosberg got his win with Mercedes, both him and Schumacher had an even split of 10 to 10 quali wins over their teammate?  Way faster is quite a bit of a stretch
A light shower just before Q3 and he's either pole or in the wall
Don't think that makes any difference for the mechanical grip. The thing that would, would be the exact configuration of the suspension like stiffness and such. But whether it's push or pull rod should be irrelevant.  What they do have is different aero which might behave differently at slow speeds and give you the impression that one team has more mechanical grip than the other, but really it's just their aerodynamics working better at those really low speeds.
Yes, he won it in 10'.
Haha well yeah but that could happen at any circuit, I thought you might've meant something else besides a double-DNF because you highlighted those four races.
I gets funnier every time
Incorrect.
I'd say Perez had a better performance in the race than Alonso
> cold temps and difficulty in bringing tire temps helped Mercs a lot  Statements which sound so weird after last year's performances lol.
alonso never really got into hamiltons drs so it didnt matter ig
Doubt full am still has benefits from last year
VER punts ALO resulting in double DNF  Get Strolled
Love it when this happens, but the overcut is usually pretty powerful around Monaco. That would be a tense few laps.
I dunno that RB might just be able to edge him out in the DRS zone or coming out of the tunnel given how much faster it is
I can already imagine the sounds of Max raging on the team radio. And GP trying to keep him calm. GP would be earning his money that day
Hope not, Twitch has shown us what Verstappen does when he rage quits. https://clips.twitch.tv/ChillyOutstandingFiddleheadsStoneLightning-2MpyliErqF2saTqK
Plus, DRS. Max will just slingshot out of the Arie Luyendyk banked DRS corner, overtake Alonso and then it's "Haha yes boys" for the umpteenth time this season.
It’s the famous documentary about the importance of family.
that same documentary also emphasized family. Fernando Stroll confirmed?!
Are you sure it was a documentary?
I get the sentiment but it's not like Gasly won Monza on pace and merit
Pls m8 LMAO…each race in 2023 Stroll hass touched many cars around him which resulted in either DNF’s or crashes or almost crashes. Ask Alonso 😂😂 Stroll isn’t good enough for F1 without his daddy buying a whole team for him.  If AM descides to quit..no team on the grid will take Lance on merit
What has happened?
He’s just a lucky little git with that fresh faced hunger.
I don’t think Lewis’ confidence is ever under duress
Next season it is, then!
More like  Ferrari "longer-than-Liverpool-most-recent-EPL-title-wait"-year plan
Can you provide examples? I can't think of any, at least ones where there wasn't a reasonable explanation (pit stops, strategy, etc)
> Charles is almost there as a great rain driver, he ~~just needs to iron out some issues.~~ is just on Ferrari.
Yeah he’s definitely a great driver. Definitely not Max or Lewis level but he is insanely quick in the wet still. Though, I’d still take those two and Fernando in the wet.  People forget he was on course for P2 on pure pace in Turkey 2020 after starting from the back, until he made a silly mistake in the end.  Also Turkey 2021, he was keeping up with Max and Bottas for most of the race, and at one point was even closer to Max than Max was to Bottas. They gambled for the 0 stop strategy, didn’t work out so they lost out on the podium.  He was also dominating Monaco last year in the wet (6 second gap to Sainz, 10+ to Red Bulls) until strategy disasterclass. Then of course Singapore 2022 when he was gapping his teammate 1s per lap (but SC keeps bunching the grid up) and keeping up with Checo’s RB.
His spa quali in a williams and his sochi quali the same year are the first that come to mind
Lewis?
And Lewis and George isn't too bad himself either.
And possibly Norris, except the car is not in the best of places atm.  I remember he had a few epic laps on Spa a few years ago. Lightyears faster than anybody else, for a few laps. Didn't end well, but it was epic while it lasted.  That ride will forever put him on my shortlist of highly skilled wetweather drivers.
YESS! *Crashes*
That pole was one of the biggest "what ifs" I have seen. He was doing a really really good job in front. He could've won until he got pitted by RP. He wanted to stay out. He dropped so far back after the pit. Perez stayed out and got podium. It's actually insane looking back at it again
He was the 2nd torpedo after Bottas in Hungary 2021.
🤦🏻‍♂️
i think merc are a safer bet , given how exceptional their in season developmen usually is ,while aston has never had any major bumps until now
I’m talking overall
Nooo it's like a dad joke that comes back every weekend
yeah as much as i love alonso he was not perfect in AUS. From my memory, he has been having poor starts all through the season, except jeddah where Perez is even worse.  all the safety car restarts this year has been quite mid by him, maybe that's the being old part even Alonso cannot conquer.
I've said it since pre season, Merc will end up above them, probably 50+ points if I'm honest. AM has done amazingly, but I'd be incredibly impressed if they did stay ahead.
The world is not ready for Grand Prix winner Lance Stroll.  But I am.
I've jokingly said this before but now I'm starting to believe. Alonso will get 10-12 podiums this year and Stroll will get one, but that one will be a win somehow.
If the overcut is powerful then stay out longer.
I can already see it playing out.    Max passes Alonso coming out of the tunnel, but cuts the chicane because he's going too fast.   Alonso starts shouting on the radio "he cut the chicken! He must give-a back the space!"   Then Max arguing on the radio that he had already passed him before the chicane and he lifted after cutting it, so there's no time gained.
I don't believe he will be raging. He is not Max in 2018 anymore, he is cruising comfortably to his 3rd WDC and I don't think he mind seeing Alonso winning again.
and coronas
Is that the one where they measure quarter of the mile very preciesly?
The trophy is still on his shelf, right?
He had enough pace to stay ahead of the McLaren    He had enough merit to keep his car on track and not crack under pressure
We need to know
Why can’t you see the races right now?
And id like to see him go winless for another season because watching his more rabid fans implode is an endless source of entertainment (bonus if he actually retires at the end of the season).
2026 is next season right?
Turkey 2020 qualifying comes to mind but not sure if there are other times in fact. I thought Monza 2017 qualifying but Max actually did beat him there.
I firmly believe he is equal level with Lewis and Max but he also needs an excellent all round package(car, management support and competent strategy team) which he hasn't really had so far in his F1 career.
Jesus I somehow forgot he almost put that on pole. Ya that's fair then.
I can't think of Rain and Norris without Sochi 2021 coming to mind.
As long as he remembers to pit
Bottas did create that just in front of him and that was less than a corner.
I'm fairly skeptical about Merc being able to do a lot to turn their fortunes around. They didn't really manage to do all that much in 2022. They were indeed great at this in the past, but that was before the cost cap era. Now it's going to be much, much harder for anyone to turn their season around.  Then again, some teams like Aston have really poured a lot of effort into making sure that they have the best possible base at the start of the year because it's hard to make strides during the season. But that also means that they might have fewer resources left than other teams and thus will be more limited as to what they can do for the rest of 2023.
Schumacher was out 4 years. Watch the quali results of his 3 years at Mercedes and you will see that he drastically improved each year until his 3rd and last here he was rpetty much even with Rosberg. At the rate he was adapting and improving i wouldn't be surprised if the follow up year he simply beats Rosberg.
At least you get milk...
My dad's been making the same jokes for my whole life and they're still funny!
Call me Reggie Fils-Aimé because my body is ready.
It's actually almost happened twice. Italy and Turkey in 2020 were both possible Stroll wins.
Josh has been predicting this for the last 4 years
I would kill to see that...
I would love it. Think it would make a few people take him more seriously
If Stroll is going to win, let it be Monaco in the rain
Would AM team order a Lance win over Alo? And if so would Alo follow?
Imagine VER punts ALO resulting in double DNF with Stroll behind them to win the FORMULA 1 GRAND PRIX DE MONACO 2023!!!!
Josh Revell would celebrate.
Actually makes sense, a race chaotic enough for AM to win might very well collect Alonso in the chaos.
To match the theme of Stroll podiums he'd probably have taken out Verstappen himself and gotten a 10 second stop go penalty in the process.
Yep. Alonso and Verstappen are both excellent at managing tires, I’d love to see them just play chicken and push their stop all the way to the final lap lmao. Fastest pit stop wins.
it's only powerful if you're the faster car, but then so is the undercut
Yeah but Max has a strategic mastermind and a pit crew super team. AMR don’t have any of those things. And that’s where races can be won or lost as Ferrari will tell you.
Poor chicken
People usually don't get away with dive bomb cutting the chicken, they're pretty wise to that at this point
And the proper technique of shifting a 20–speed manual gearbox
Agreed. It’s very funny for the segment of his fans who rely solely on statistics for his case to be the GOAT (for the record, he’d still be top 7 all time and in GOAT contention had Singapore 2008 been nullified and had he not taken the chance on Mercedes in 2013, even though Nico Hülkenberg would have more WDCs than him), because they can’t reconcile him not winning with him being the GOAT.
We are checking.
Turkey quali is a misleading example. Everyone but RPs were on wets but RP made the inters work.
Max and Lewis are the best in wet conditions by far. Lance is great, and he is better than most by a good margin in the wet, but when it came to races, he wasn't keeping pace with Max and Lewis in wet conditions.  2016 Brazil really emphasized these margins.
That's quali, not taking 1st in the race. Or finishing above max in the race.
Screams!!!! Noooooooooo we all remember. My disappointment at that was equal to Charles in France
Spa 2021 as well. That pole was his for the taking.
Norris: “Leave me alone, I know what to do!”  Narrator: He did not.
Merc did definitely have a huge performance increase last year though, went from being a second off and no hopes on even a podium , to consistently battling with rb and beating Ferrari at the latter part of the season (Hungary Cota Brazil being few great examples)
Turkey 2020 definitely not, no one was beating Hamilton that day.
Inshallah
I think no on both counts. Stroll Sr clearly believes Lance benefits from the tutelage of Alonso, and he’s helped develop the car.
I mean he kind of got collected in Melb, so hopefully that's the getting collected quota out of the way for this year *wishful thinking*
The problem with undercutting is traffic tends to be bad at Monaco.
So he gets 5 second penalty but because of pace difference he makes 15 second or bigger gap. Then other red bull does the same.
All while drag racing down a 20 mile, 1/4 mile drag race. Then blowing the floor out of the car hitting nos.
Bro, you had 17 podiums and a win last season.
Max and Lewis are just the best in everything. wet, dry, quali, overtakes, you name it.
Agreed. Max’s wet performance in F3 is probably a big factor in him skipping F2 all together
2016 Brazil was Max on far fresher wets than anybody else on the grid, it's not really a race you can benchmark.
You've got a Fernando Alonso flair and didn't include Alonsos God tier wet qualifications? He knows how to get heat into tires
FWIW Merc weren't that bad at the beginning of the season - note how they started with a podium in Bahrain. On top of that, back then it made sense to keep trying to develop their cars in order to try to understand what went wrong. And besides, it was the first year of the new regulations, so there was more reason to keep experimenting. However, as more time passes, it becomes more and more difficult to discover new things that will unlock significant performance benefits.  On top of that, they'll also have to consider that spending a lot of resources in improving the current car means less of an ability to make an impact the following year, as they've found out, much to their disappointment. Don't expect them to make the same mistake twice.
No you have to give back the place, literally everyone would do it otherwise
Madness.   This tribalism isn’t good for the sport. I liked the first couple of seasons of DTS but it’s got more sensationalised since then.  I watch races for the racing, and get annoyed when anyone is driving away with it. It’s that that puts me off, not one person not doing well. Merc winning by a mile was bad, as was RB last year. It’s always happened though.  Deleted their comments now.   The most ludicrous thing about their statement of “I only watch races that Mercedes win” is that how can you be certain until the end. Unless just watching a repeat in which case that’s boring as you know the result!
Never heard of them. Have they won any races?
its not probably, it was **the** deciding factor, [Helmut Marko saw him drive at Noris ring going 2 seconds, or more, per lap faster than everybody else.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnUEHNqV32A)
The only reason he had fresher wets was because RB shafted his strategy, but to talk down going from 15th to 3rd in like 15 laps in the wet in a much worse car is nuts.     If from 14th to 1st in Spa was impressive, then how was Brazil 2016 not?
He was second fastest all race then overtook about 15 cars in a few minutes when he had to pit during safety car queue. Loads of others had pitted very recently.
>The most ludicrous thing about their statement of “I only watch races that Mercedes win”   These people are going to leave the sport in droves once Hamilton retires, they don't care about Mercedes as a team.
Since he replied to my comment originally, what did I miss? Lmao.

I think how it works now is fine but I would make one change. If they decide to throw a Red right after a Safety Car, they should reset the order of cars to be what they were when the Safety Car was called out. Still allow all the cars to change tires, fix wings, whatever but at least cars that pit when the SC comes out aren't screwed because the race director didn't call a red flag soon enough.
Current method is the most simple and easiest to implement. Every other system would require so many caveats and loopholes to account for all scenarios that you’d end up with teams gaming the system.
There is no fair way to deal with it.   If racer A is just ahead of racer B and he pits and lets say it takes 30 seconds to do so, and he was a second ahead he is now 29 seconds behind and racer A Will try and reduce gap whilst racer B will try and grow it.   If a red flag is thrown immediately after like with Russell, racer A now suffers as if even if he had just maintained the gap to racer B he would have come out ahead again. He is now behind as racer B can change tyres ander red flag.   But not allowing racer B to change tyres would also be unfair to racer B as he had a 29 second gap to racer a ( 1 second behind) and he could now be just a few places ahead on re start and if he then pits right after red flag be potentially somewhere in the region of 20 odd seconds behind    So no real fair way, and with the current system an element of luck is involved so I am happy with it.   Going forward if red flags has a bit more of an entertainment value to it, would be interesting to see how this plays out.
This topic (and by extension, the "starting order should be reverted to pre safety car order" topic) is only ever brought up whenever someone's favourite driver ends up getting fucked by pitting earlier than the interruption. It's ultimately just an extension of their favouritism.   F1 strategies always involve some form of risk. Nobody can predict things like yellow or red flags, they just happen, and you either end up benefiting from them or getting screwed by them. That's just how things work.   I personally feel that the biggest disadvantages to not allowing tire changes during red flags is that, firstly, cold and potentially very used tires will invariably cause a lot of carnage on the restart, and secondly, as an extension of the first point, there is no real "fairness" argument either. People who got fresh tires before the race was paused would have an unfair advantage at the restart. Additionally, what if you got a puncture during whatever incident caused the red flag, and had to limp home to the pits? It'd be unfair on you to have to restart with the same tires, and unfair to everyone else to have a tire advantage if you do change your tires.   Bottom line, being able to change your tires during a red flag is the fairest possible scenario, as it allows anyone with damage to get it fixed, and also restarts the race in the safest and fairest possible way.   I would not be entirely against closing the pit lane during a yellow flag, but this again runs the risk of anyone with actual damage not being allowed to go in and get it fixed.
Sometimes you win with the safety car and a red flag, and sometime you lose…  It’s part of racing.
Because the moment something up to chance goes against someone's favorite driver, the obvious answer is that the source of the chance needs to be removed.   It's racing. sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. All this talk of changing rules is ridiculous.
If you aren't allowed to change tyres under SC/red flag, drivers who pit early get a massive advantage as the field bunches up. An extreme example of this is "crashgate" in Singapore 2008.  Also, all 3 red flags in the last race were called for puncture risks. Obviously there is a safety issue with preventing tyre changes.
It's not fairer, a SC/red flag situation often increases the risk of punctures. If you don't allow people to change tires they might DNF because of a damaged tire. And if you allow people to switch their damaged tires everyone else will be disadvantaged having to stay on their older tired, or drivers start driving through debris on purpose creating a potentially dangerous situation just so they'd be allowed to change tires. Tire rules are fine as is if you think about it for just a bit more then 5 seconds, but thinking about something for 5 seconds seems to be fucking hard for way too many people.
Luck has always been a factor in racing. It is part of the game they have chosen to play.  One time a SC or red flag goes your way, sometimes it doesn't. That's life.
It's not fairer. People just like to moan every time it happens.
I'd imagine it's  safety issue first and foremost. There's a very high probability cars could pick up damage to their tyres under a safety car or red flag. The damage may not by fatal at lower speeds but the driver may be aware that he's tyre may be compromised.   So they can't stop people from trying to make their car safer. So they can't stop people from changing tyres during a safety car.
I like the strategy calls with safety cars and red flag changes are sometimes unfortunate, other time necessary.   There is really no need for any changes. It is important that teams understand when a red flag may come out. It's ridiculous to call a red flag for a little gravel for example, or pushing a car behind a wall. Although, if that's where race direction wants to go, it can work, if they communicate it well. Then it becomes a more consistent part of strategy.  Like last race. If there was barrier damage, I'm 100% fine with the red and the strategy implications it holds. Now, it just doesn't  seem like a justified red flag.
I got a great idea. Continue to allow people to change tires under SC and Red Flags. Perfect solution! The end.
> It just flips who's lucky and who isn't  That's my take on it.  You win some you lose some.  GR lost out this time but next time we may win.  Every time SC or VSC or red flag comes out someone makes out like a champ, someone loses.  Perez lost a whole race last year I feel by pitting before SC came out and everyone else got cheap put stops.   Part of racing. As unfair as it is
For me the unpredictable nature of a race is part of the appeal. When an accident happens and you jump in for a quick pit you are taking the chance that it won't go full red, if your team thinks the crash is bad enough to trigger a red flag they're taking a chance. Whoever chooses correctly should get rewarded.
I don’t understand why people keep calling for it to be changed. Personally i love it, it spices up races and makes strategists have to consider if the FIA are likely to call a red or not.
Fair or not fair these random events bring a lot of fun and variety to a sport that can be really tedious and boring for the spectators, depending on the current regulations and the track layout. Excitement for a race in the wet for example will not be the same if the safety cars and red flags did not allow a random car ( and especially a middle or back marker) to gain places and even win races. All the memorable seasons owe it to these randomized occurences to create tension and sustain interest. We even still discuss today crash gate from back in 2008 !
This is brought up every single time there is a red flag.  I guarantee you, the next red flag we have, that crofty will bring it up again. It’s a situation that has no fix, people are going to be upset no matter what.
Leave it be, it's luck. Some teams gamble, some don't. Just because one loses in gambling, doesn't mean you should change rules so that everyone wins.
No need to change something that's not broken
Personally I like it the way it is.  It adds to the strategy aspect to it, I mean if someone pits during a SC because it's an advantage to them, and then a red flag comes out, well that was a bad strategy call.  They have to live with it.  Track conditions are ever-changing and that's what makes the sport exciting, along with the strategy of when to pit and when to stay out.  To me, the people complaining the most had "the most" to lose during last week's race.  But if the tables were turned I wonder if they'd still be complaining?  No matter what, there will always be people who have issues with the way something is done.  To me "it aint broke" so no need to change anything IMO.
I think you are right, there is no perfect solution but the way it is right now seems fairer than forbidding to change them. A few years back you had to wait 10s if you wanted to change the tires under the sc, I don’t know why they got rid of that - it feels like a good compromise to me.
I agree that changing tyres should be allowed under red flags, but I think making major repairs to the car should have some sort of "punishment". Maybe dropping some places on the restart or a time penalty.
Neither one is inherently more or less fair than the other.  Either way someone is going to get advantaged by the timing of the flag. One way it's the people who pitted aggressively. The other it's the people who didn't or couldn't.  Neither is inherently wrong and it comes down to what style of racing you want.  Indycar for example doesn't let them touch the cars basically at all.  The only thing I would suggest creates unfairness is when they call a safety car, run it for one or more laps, then call a red flag after people have pitted under it.  If there is a red flag, the order when it ends should be reset to to whatever it was when green flag racing stopped.
Imagine you just undercut someone (change tires earlier then your opponent on purpose) and then someone shunts in the wall for a RF. Then the one who did not pit and did not loose time has a free pitstop. And the undercutter lost 20+ seconds and possibly some positions.
It's not. It is what it is. You either screw those tho have stopped right before, or those who needed to still stop for tires.   You can't have both
It’s a competition vs safety argument. It’s a fairer competition if they didn’t allow tire changes but safely is going to win put in modern f1. Everyone just needs to get over it and move on this is a really boring discussion.
Easiest and fairest solution is to just close the pitlane under SC and VSC conditions, as they do in most other motorsports
Any tyre change during a red flag should be a pit lane start.
It’s a free pit stop. A team could have built up an advantage through superior strategy for 40-50 laps and then lose it all in an instant because the other team gets the free stop.  It doesn’t flip who is lucky and unlucky. The team that earned the lead through better strategy and pace isn’t always lucky (although sometimes they benefit from luck too). The team that wins the lead through a free pit stop is always lucky.
Because in a red flag the racing stops, pit stops are part of racing
I think it's perfectly fair to allow tyre changes but there are a couple of things you could do to make it fairer on all drivers:  * SC/VSC - you could mandate that any driver who pits under a safety car or virtual safety car has to sit in the pit box for the amount of time they'd gain from making a normal pit stop. So, for example, if a SC/VSC pit stop loses you ten seconds, and a normal pit stop loses you 20, you have to sit for ten seconds before your team can service you, like when serving a penalty. That way, in theory, you're not disadvantaged if you happen to pit just before an SC. * Red flag - you could allow tyre changes but also add in a rule that states that you have to enter the pits during the race. So if the red flag comes out before you've pitted, you can change your tyres, but you would still have to pit later in the race and fit a different compound. This would've thrown up an interesting dynamic in a race like Australia where Max, Lewis and Fernando would've had to sprint off after the first restart and then pit later to potentially fight back with fresher rubber in the second half of the race.  The nature of the SC/VSC or red flags are such that there will always be winners or losers but you can do things to minimise the advantage/disadvantage to any particular driver.
Yeah it is BS. If not allowed to change, some will have to restart on old tyres, than go in after one lap to pit and rejoin behind the pack.
How about a position penalty for tyre changes? If you choose to change your tyres during the red flag, you go back 3 positions.
I agree with you mate, people havent thought it through
It depends on the context. A red flag is supposed to give teams a chance to make the cars safer for a restart. Let's think of scenarios:  The race has stopped and it's started to rain - you can't let them go out on used slicks. They need to put on wet tyres in the event of a weather change. (Or vice versa, it was raining and is now dry).   The race stopped and cars are damaged from a crash - you allow teams to change damaged wings and parts before the restart. This keeps the racing safe on restart.   I do think that if your car is not damaged and weather conditions have not changed, then tyres should not be changed.
Afaik changing tyres under red wasn't allowed and then someone just did it quite a few years ago and the rules changed. Usually when that's the case it was Schumacher, but I need others to weigh in on whether my memory is just way off here.
It's only brought up by non-race fans. Everything on Sunday is a gamble and calculated risk, it's what makes things suspenseful and what new/casual fans don't see or understand when they say a race was boring.    If Mercedes was paying attention they would have seen that the barrier was damaged, and in recent years that's pretty much always a red flag situation. They gambled thinking they could get an advantage but lost out instead, that's how gambles and risks work, and it's a great part of this sport. Anyone that wants to limit that just hates fun.
If the idea of the Red Flag is to freeze the race, then you shouldn't be able to work on the cars. Seems pretty self-evident to me. IndyCar gets this one right. Safety car/Yellow Flag stops are OK as is. I like that F1 doesn't immediately close the pits when the yellow is thrown. IndyCar gets that one wrong.  Want to throw a big curve in there? Release the cars at the end of the Red Flag from the pit lane according to the last recorded interval. Max was 8 seconds ahead of Lewis? Max takes off while Lewis waits to go.
Actually as you say this, I'm ok with the red flag tire changes, but disallowing tire changes during sc/yellow flags may make things much fairer.. sure it's not as exciting and dramatic, but you don't have instances like Russell getting completely screwed this last race, as he would have stayed out, and potentially even the abu dahbi race may have been different if they were at least both on the same tire?
I've always felt that I want to see 2 changes, one pit lane closes under SC until we are packed up and under red tire changes should be like for like (Hards with Hards, Softs for softs) so you can maintain safety in regards to tires picking up damage from debris but also not just throwing the entire strategy out the window.
Under a red flag its difficult to make a good rule but under a safety car you could make the cars coming in for a put lose roughly the dame time as a normal put, I.e add time to their pit before they start (except for cooling)
The issue isn't so much with tyre changes during SC or red flags. The issue is specifically throwing a red flag *after* (and most often *well after*) they've already called the SC, meaning teams that do the optimal strategy because they have that option (pitting under SC) end up being fucked.
I'm one of those rare few who think the old aggregate timing rule should be brought back (most of the objections can be summed up as 'it was hard to understand what the effective positions were,' which is something that still occurs today when there are competing pit stop strategies, and as far as I can see could be solved by new TV graphics). If it were, the red flag pit stop loophole could be closed by just giving a time penalty to anyone who makes a tyre change under red - a similar rule already exists in the case of a race that is red flagged and not resumed, in which case anyone who hadn't made their mandatory stop gets a 30 second penalty.
How I think it should work. Pit under vsc/ safety car like normal where you come out you come out that’s on you and your team.   Safety car becomes a red flag since no one was allowed to pass anyway the grid restarts as it was when the safety car was deployed.
It's unfair because drivers have to change tyres once, and that for the most cases means making a stop and losing positions. And then all of a sudden someone has it for free.   It's even more unfair in situations like Russel in the Australian GP. The man was in first and pitted under sc, and then all of a sudden its red flag. If they had trown a red flag straight away, he would restart in first instead of 6/7 or whatever...  But at the same time, motorracing has many things unfair, I just accept it's part of the sport. For example, a driver builds a 20-second advantage, and all of a sudden, because some random crashes his advantage It's nullified. it's not fair. Or max-lewis in 2021 in Silverstone, how is it fair that someone causing a colision and taking the main rival out of the race gets to continue and the rival can only sit back and cry?   These things are unfair, but if the rules are the same for everyone, it's unfair for everyone in the same way, so it becomes fair.
I would let them change tires but make sure they are the same compound. This would require you to still make your stop to run the mandatory two different compounds.    I think it’s fine how it is and would just leave it alone though.
It’s not an issue under SC, but a red flag is the stoppage of a race, and thus the cars should not be touched. No changing ties, or replacing damaged bodywork.  It creates an unfair advantage, as has been shown countless times over the past few seasons, where teams that out under SC are penalized because other teams stay out, then luck in to free tire change and replacing damaged parts of the car, and restart in front of cars that were in front of then prior to the incident.
It flips it around indeed and also adds people have to restart on totally dead and worn tyres, so yes it's actually an even worse solution.  The tyre change under the red flag is the best of all the bad options, it can not be 'fixed'.
I’ve been saying for a while that the fairest way is to reduce pit lane speed limits during safety car periods so that the same amount of time is still lost compared to pitting in green flag conditions
Easy solution would be +5-8 second hold time before working on the cars.  That way the time gain isn't so extreme as to completely upend the race simply because you stayed out an extra lap and got a 12 second discount on the pit stop.  For red flags anyone taking tires gets a 3, or 5 grid place penalty.
I don't why cars aren't released from the pits with the same time gap between them as when the red flag was called. Same sort of question for ending a safety car, actually. I'm new to F1 but it makes no sense to me that some unrelated car having an accident will erase all the work someone has done building a gap to another car.
Make it to where no repairs are allowed on a red in the line.  If you want to change tires or repairs you go to your pit.  You then go to the back of the line on restart.  If multiple cars pit, then they stay in the order they were on track, but at the back of the field.  If you had the guy in 4th and the guy in 7th put during a red, they would go to the back on restart with the guy who was in 4th ahead of the guy who was in 7th.
During the SC sure allow changes because you’re giving up track position for tyres. Under a RF it shouldn’t be allowed
I personally think that it has to be allowed due to safety reasons. I do however think that the rules should state that all cars have to do at least one pit stop during normal racing conditions.
My recommendation is that you either: can only change for safety reasons (rain conditions, damage) or you can change but it doesn’t count as your mandatory compound change.
Stupid idea but what about an orange flag? Scenario: crash happens, and race control is immediately not sure if it will require a red, yellow or VSC so they throw the orange for one lap to buy time to make the correct decision. Treat it like a VSC with slower deltas and maintained gaps for safety, close the pits, and then give the race control a lap to make a decision. From there, move to yellow green or red with pits open.
I personally think the current rules are unfair because I view the red flag period as a pause to the race and not a part of it. I think the race should restart in the same state that it was paused at. I think it’s unfair that some teams are able to gain a 30-40 second advantage while the race isn’t even active.
I would go with that top 10 or top 5 drivers cant fix up or change tyres on the car to give back markers a better chance to climb up
They should keep red flag tire changes, but have any changes not count toward the allotted 2 compounds per race rule.
Because it resets the race completely, throwing out the work/progress done to get the cars in that order, at that point in the race.  For example, a team is leading the GP by 15 seconds and pits to prevent the undercut.  They exit the pits in 3rd place.  On the out lap a red-flag worthy crash happens.  Now their immediate competitors, who they were beating handily, now get a free tire change, AND the positions gifted when the leader pit.
Solution - don’t allow pit stops to change tyres under the safety car.
The most important factor in an F1 race should be the combined skill of the driver and the team. Allowing tyre changes during yellow and red flags effectively means that some teams get a huge track position boost which they did not achieve on merit, and in some circumstances double down on that good luck with a free tyre change.  Disallowing tyre changes under red/yellow flags would nullify the chance of this luck becoming involved. At the very least, the cost of such a tyre change should be equivalent to what it would be under full racing conditions (for safety reasons, teams could then take a tyre change under yellow/red flags, and drop back by 24 seconds relative to their previous position).  Strictly speaking, it's not "unfair", but only because in the long term any particular driver or team is liable to enjoy as much look luck as they endure bad. In reality, it can be the deciding factor between WDC and WCC wins, so needs some work.
I think the answer is simply:  You can not change tire COMPOUND.   Nothing will generate perfect parity, but this would eliminate the most significant concerns.
I like the idea of free tire changes under a red flag to allow for any debris-punctured tires to be changed, but either you have to use the same compound tire (which would be difficult with the current allocations) or make it that it doesn't count towards using the 2 compounds so you would still have to pit under green flag conditions or a safety car or VSC.
I don’t have a problem with this as it is.   But I really don’t like reseting the grid after the red flag as it happened in Australia at the end of the race. AMR were 11th and 12th (Stroll by his own fuck up into turn 3) when the RF came out, yet they finished 3rd and 4th. That’s a huge point swing in drivers and constructors championship.  You are where you are when RF comes out, not where you were 10 seconds ago, that’s total bullshit.
In the name of fairness a stop and go penalty during a VSC/SC stop might be best. If it cuts a normal stop by 10 or so seconds then a 10 second wait should be fine.
The reason why they allow tyre changes during red flags is safety. When there's a red flag, often enough there is also debris on the track and not letting teams change tyres and making them carry on with potentially damaged tyres would be an unnecessary safety hazard.
Personally I think penalties shouldn't be so easily converted into strategy.  But I'm no expert on how that all plays out in actuality, so I'm more or less agnostic on the rule.
I think tyre changing is fine. Repairing serious damage that would normally be race ending is not, though.
I say let them change tires but it has to be the same tire compound they were on
Its so stupid that people talk about this everytime there's a red flag like what's the big deal it's just like if a safety car came out they'd change tyres anyway
I agree with you - it will be equally unfair one way or another, you cannot have a way that's fair for all. So for me, the reason why I side with the rule as it is now is safety: debris means that a car may puncture a tyre. It can be both an obvious puncture (the tyre disintegrates in half a lap) or a very subtle one (the tyre lasts for a few laps until it starts to cause problems). How do you manage all of this? You cannot make an exception for punctured tyres, since you'll incentivize drivers to try and drive through the debris in hopes of getting a puncture and gaining a free tyre change, which is dangerous but very difficult to prove it was done on purpose. And for subtle punctures, you are out of luck, you won't notice them and then the driver will retire / crash / pit stop for something that wasn't their fault.  Our current system is the simplest one, it requires no exceptions or subjective decisions, and it's also the safest because changing tyres is almost always the best option, so you avoid the whole issue of sneaky punctures entirely, for free.
Everyone would just say the opposite if they changed the rules and drivers couldn’t change tires.
I think changing tyre under SC or VSC is completely fair because the race is still going and counting laps and using fuel. But under red flag is very unfair because the race is completely stopped. I think a solution to this would obviously be to not allow drivers to change tires under red flag, or let them change the tyre let them change the tire and then add the average time lost during a pit stop to their current position and place them in order of that added time before the new race start. However that is very time consuming and could cause a lot of drama
I strongly disagree that it is equally unfair on each side of the debate.  If anyone has to benefit I think it is *less unfair* to the drivers who have already made a pitstop.  The teams and drivers would then understand that staying out i.e. choosing not to pit is a gamble that could backfire. This is how it works in Indycar. The way to avoid being disadvantaged is to pit to cover the risk. This is easy to understand and gives equal opportunity to all drivers.  Currently, it is the opposite. It is the drivers who choose to pit under green flag conditions that are gambling, because their rivals could suddenly get a cheap or free pit stop. I think this is backwards.  There shouldn't be a potential penalty or disadvantage for pitting.  If anyone has to lose, it should be those who haven't pit yet, because in choosing not to they are acknowledging the risk they are taking.
My opinion of it is that they should be allowed to change tyres under under flag conditions but it doesn’t count against the mandatory pit stop,
I guess its on the team to look at what happened and  make a decision based on if they think a red flag is coming or not.
Eh, tough one.   I think the current way is fine, but it would be nice to immediately throw a red flag if it's warranted, so we don't see teams get penalised for being bold with strategy. Although I do get that situations like this can negate strategy altogether, but I feel like that could be solved with higher degradation tyres.
I used to think it was a bad thing but if you have damage or a puncture, which could be common in a red flag, then how do you handle that? They get new tires and everyone else can’t? You can’t let someone limo back to the pits and then send them back out like that.  It’s just easier to implement fairly and as you said, luck does play a factor in every race. Plus red flags, even after last week, aren’t common.
You should be able to changetires it just shouldn't be a different compound and count towards running a different compound.
What I've seen from this thread is somehow nascar has the most fair system.
My suggestion is to still allow changes during a red flag (because maybe the red flag is due to an accident you were involved in and you need new parts) but if you make any changes, you then have a pit lane start when the race restarts.  This should keep a bit of the randomness from pitting during a safety car but take away the extra shenanigans during a red flag.
I guess that’s just racing, though. Race Control are humans and won’t judge every single situation perfectly every time right off the bat, so it’s up to teams to determine if a red flag is possible. Over the course of a season, I’d expect these kinds of luck-based pit stops to even out for each driver so nobody gains an unfair advantage.
I think changing tires under a red flag should be allowed because if an incident was severe enough to cause a red flag then there is a good chance there is debris that could cause a puncture. I know that is not always the case but I’m in favor of less discretion on the part of the stewards.
You know they could just you know, count out a pitstop for that track and under a red or safety car anyone who changes tires gets put back that amount of seconds based on the gaps in the last sector before the safety car was out.  So if you were say 3rd and 22 seconds back places you 7th, you can pit, come out in 5th, but drop back to 7th before the restart. It's not fucking rocket science. You could do away with any 'free stops' under safety cars in that way.  VSC would actually be much harder as they can end any time, the amount of time you gain in the pits can change if the safety car ends while you're in the pit lane.
Why not forbid tire changes during SC/VSC as well, to make it even fairer? While we're at it, why not eliminate tire changes at all? Have everyone on the same tire the whole race. Even better, have a single car manufacturer so that all drivers have the same car... That would be fairest of them all, but would not be Formula 1 anymore.
Nah, either leave it as it is or in case of SC that is transformed into a red flag just bring back positions from the start of SC.  TBH I think it's better as it is, sometimes you just need a luck in this sport.
I think it's clearly *unfair*. But safety cars and red flags are not about racing fairness, they're about safety, and tires are frequently damaged during events that require safety cars or red flags.
Last time I looked this was supposed to be a sport with good and bad luck this group is slowly changing racing into professional wrestling you mine as well just predetermined the finish while your at it
The last sentence is the issue for me. If the timing of the stewards decision changes strategies or penalties then there is a problem. To the extent that such an issue can be mitigated I think it should. But then what do you do? Require one full lap of yellow before a red is called? No more than one full lap? But I mean ref decisions fuck with sports all the time. There's probably no answer.
Ehh I don’t know, I’m ok with it. It’s part of managing your strategy and making decisions based on risk. It’s not like the Race Director is waiting to see who is pitting and then using that to influence his decision. They’re busy looking at all sorts of things to decide when to throw the VSC or SC or red flag and I’m sure there’s a reason for when they decide to do it whether it’s 3 seconds after the incident or 1 minute after.
That would just make things unnecessarily complex for (arguably) not a lot of improvement. There is too many rules anyways.  As others said, "easiest" fix would be to decrease the time to call a red flag. Any crash causes a virtual SC, lap times go up above two minutes. If you can make the red flag call within 15-20s you decrease the chance of someone making a bad pit call. Was just a slow call this time. Otherwise all good I'd say.
This is basically the point, however doing so would have the effect of disincentivising fast risky strategies to get a quick tire change as soon as the SC is out.  Twice Ferrari this year has been screwed by exactly that: opting for a risky strategy, an early pit stop as soon as the SC is out, only for a red flag to be called and their place dropping.  I cheered the risky strategy, I think it's great to have a window of opportunity like that. But yeah, here the risk should be related to going for an early pitstop (will the tires last? will they be in the right window at the right time?), not gambling on whether a red flag will be called out or not.
Totally makes sense!
This. It will remove the gambling aspect of it if the order is locked the moment the first flag (either color) gets thrown
If you did that everyone would pit because there would no longer be any risk.   F1 is all about managing risk and trying to make the right call. Make it simpler and you get nascar where strategy barely matters.
I think this is the best answer here.
Agreed
So you could pit under SC, get fresh tyres and keep your position?
Going back to order at previous lap makes the most sense IMO, and there is plenty of historical precedent. Still gonna be some winners/losers, but it will be far more rare for someone to 'lose' big.
This is the most fair, well thought out plan I’ve heard so far.
That is an interesting idea, but I don't think it's the best option. Yes I think it's dumb to call a red flag after a safety car. And they should try to avoid it as much as possible. But I don't think there should be a rule to reset positions. It was mentioned because of Australia, but this was also discussed after Saudi 2021.  A safety car is about luck and taking risks. You pit under a safety car to get an advantage, but it is not guaranteed, so you take a risk if you decide to stay out in the hopes for a safety car when you stay out when your rivals pit. This is also risk and luck based, Max took a risk to not pit behind the safety car, the risk meant he would need to put when the Mercedes had already pit for new tires and was behind him. But by doing so, he got a free pit stop under red flag and gained a position.   I don't like a red flag after a safety car, but I think we should leave it as it is.
I reckon the best system is, you can change tyres under red, BUT it doesn’t count towards your requirement, i.e you must still change tyres in a pit stop.   Rule would be very easy to write, something along the lines of: All competitors must use two types of tyre during a dry race (as it is now) then, at least one change of tyre must be completed during a pit stop during the race.
I would disagree that there would be a bunch of caveats needed. Other series don’t allow changes to be made under red and they just have a penalty for getting pit service done during times when it’s not permitted. NASCAR, IMSA, & Indycar all have drive through penalties for this i believe.
It wouldn't be perfect but you could require at least one full pit stop. Do whatever you want during a red flag but you're still coming in.
I think its funny that fans complain about the unfairness and randomness of it yet want mixed up grids and exciting racing. Like perfectly fair in sports means the favorite wins nearly every time and clearly no one actually likes that.
Agreed. People often challenge this idea, but are immediately met with obstacles and caveats whenever they try and come up with something else. I think that most of the problems people had with the first sc was that race control took too long to elevate the sc to a red flag.
> I would not be entirely against closing the pit lane during a yellow flag  The problem with this is it MASSIVELY disadvantages you if you’re late to stop, and basically forces everyone onto the strategy of “pit as early as humanly possible”.  They tried this for a few races in V8 Supercars and immediately switched back because it was such a failure. The driver in 1st would pit, and come out in 4th (or whatever). Then all of a sudden there’s a safety car, the field compresses, and he’s right behind the leaders who haven’t pitted yet, and they can’t duck in to do anything about it. As a result they have to take their stop under green, and they end up 30 seconds back from the guy who pitted early.   The result was in the next race EVERYONE pitted super early to avoid getting caught out by that, and the races became shit because everyone was driving at half pace to manage their tires.
I think you’ve hit on a key point with the start of your post, which is that fan opinions about rules vary wildly depending on who is being affected and how. Many wordy screeds are posted online about why this or that rule is awful after a popular driver is negatively affected. Don’t mistake the volume of such objections for logical soundness or resemblance to truth.
What I would like is penalties that are outstanding are served during a red flag by grid position drops. They can wheel cars around the pit lane so could line up 5s penalty = 5 place drop, 10s=10, drive through = back of grid, stop go = back of grid behind drive through. Similarly would like for drive through / stop go penalties to be able to be done behind safety car, but only after 2 laps of it (so everyone is in the snake).   Makes sense for restarts  to not have people with penalties hanging over them (and yes if you were already at back of field, your penalty doesn't do much)
I think it's more that they seem to be throwing way more red flags now so there should be a review of the rules/procedures.
Yeah, I think a better solution though instead of everyone getting a free stop under a red flag is teams which elect to change tires must start from the pitlane, if everyone pits and changes tires then the grid start is initiated for everyone again.  Pirelli have to check each tire after a red flag anyway so why not let teams continue on their set if they didn’t trample over debris.  For the argument that it would be unfair to teams which were damaged from debris, just think of it as normal race conditions: they’d have to come in early anyway to repair damage and would be a pitstop behind others, this rule basically forces the same thing although starting from the pitlane still probably trumps changing sets later, but it’s just another element to strategy if a safety car appears later in the race rather than being a foregone conclusion
Exactly. Someone gets fucked over either way. At least it is simple and more importantly safer with the current system.
Azerbaijan 21 being a prime example.  In hindsight we now know it was improper tire pressure, but at the time there were legitimate concerns about tire integrity.    The problem is coming up with absolutes for unique and rare situations.
They should be allowed to change tyres but it shouldn't count towards the mandatory tyre change
But a red flag isn't necessary about luck because it's controlled by a person.
... when their favourite driver is negatively affected
Specially when their prefered driver does not benefit from it
I would like to see the rule changed not because it is fair or unfair, but because if we're requiring everyone to make a pit stop, I'd like them to be required to make a pit stop.  Changing tires under a red flag means that you can effectively do a 0-stop race where you never have to do an in-lap to the pits or an out-lap from the pits, and your pit crew never has to change the tires under time pressure.  Not allowing tire changes at all would probably lead to some bad situations, though, so I'd like to see some kind of middle ground where you start by taking the running order and the time gaps from when the red flag was waved, and if you decide to change tires, you get some kind of time penalty roughly equivalent to pitting under a safety car, maybe 12 seconds or so?  It would be track dependent, but everyone has estimates of these, so you could either take a default value or agree on a number for each track.  Adding time penalties is not difficult -- look at the end of the Australian GP -- Sainz's penalty was added basically instantly after the race and you could see him tumble down the leader board.  And if you use the running order and time gaps from when the red flag is thrown, then you are rewarding drivers who established big gaps to those behind them.  If you did it that way, it seems a lot more like the normal risk/reward question you have when deciding whether or not to pit.  How many places will I lose if I decide to pit?  Is getting my tire change done now worth the time lost to pitting?
Yup. Could disallow changing compounds though.
Just want to offer my opinion as someone who watched Indy and NASCAR before becoming a fan of F1. The way it's handled in NASCAR is my favorite, under caution/sc you're allowed to pit (pit lane does close for a lap or two while the safety car gathers the field but I think that's just more for the issues ovals present).   During red, you're not allowed to touch the car except under very particular circumstances like covering the car for rain (also an oval thing). The field is frozen, the race is stopped including strategy calls. If you want to change your tires, you have to wait until the red is withdrawn - in NASCAR with a yellow before going back to racing.   In my head, for F1, I think my ideal rule about this would be similar: pits stay open during safety cars, it would be the whole safety car period unlike ovals. Then under red no changes to the car should be made. Once the race is ready to resume, you can enter the pits again on your way to the line/green depending on the start procedures, but you'll have to do a pit lane start. So if under red you decide you want to change tires, you can however you will be starting from pit lane, making this a Hungry 2021 style end to the red flag.
One of the key points of the red flag is that teams can repair the cars so they're safe to leave again.
The only situation where you'd make major repairs is when the car is unsafe to drive, so limiting repairs would just force unsafe cars back onto the track and/or increase dnfs.  Wing and tire changes are hardly major repairs, anything that can be done in a normal pitstop is routine.
Or starting from the pitlane, like breaking parc ferme
Did you read the post?
> It’s a fairer competition if they didn’t allow tire changes  How is it fairer?
 What if there’s damage? Which is possible given that there may be debris on the track due to whatever condition caused the safety car. You can’t make a car that got a puncture stay out because of the SC.  Only damaged cars can pit? Then it becomes a question of what damage is “enough”. Drivers and teams will try to game the system to get in a free/cheap pit stop as much as possible.  I fail to see how this is more “fair”. SC are nonstandard incidents. It will be hard to plan rules to cover everything. No matter the rule set, someone will get “lucky” and some will get “unlucky”.
How is that any more fair though?
If you're conceding that you've executed a good strategy by anticipating the SC and so stopping for your tyre change before it happens, you'll also have to concede that you can "earn" the lead by anticipating the SC and not stopping for your tyre change before it happens. Your argument doesn't hold.
That would make so much sense, but probably will never be implemented since they don't want to make it more complicated.
Most teams only have one set of hards left in the race. So I think that gets too complicated very fast.
I have thought about the closing of the pitlane too but that can be bad in different ways.  If some pit then safety car comes out they aren't getting shafted.  However the drivers that still need to pit after restart will get decimated.
Close the pitlane with people running flat after picking up debris. And there usually is no like for like possible as they will be out of tires end of the weekend/race. Strategy is already out of the window.
They bunched the back up during 07/08 seasons and it was shit.   Given the allocation only allows for 2 hards tyres for a weekend it would never work. Obviously you could change this but then you run into allocation issues elsewhere. And you could amend the number of tyres but then it adds so many more resources to create, transport, use and destroy said extra tyres.
>pit lane closes under SC until we are packed up  Awesome idea, so you're leading the race with comfortable lead and late pit stop strategy (like Vettel in Monza when he've made his only pit stop on last lap and won). Then safety car is out and you have to wait until everyone packed up. Now you can pit. Congratulations, after pit stop you're now last.
Why do you feel this way though?
What if the weather changes during the red flag? And also, what if teams switching things up creates excitement?
I like this suggestion, I wonder how difficult it would be to implement.
Luck is still involved though. If a red flag comes out during the common strategy pit window (not an unlikely scenario) those drivers that already pitted effectively get a free pit stop. The 20-25 s they spent on the stop gets nullified when the race restarts with everyone bunched up, and those that stayed out will lose that time when the restart happens.   It’s even worse for the leaders if they were still out in that situation since they’d need to stay out longer after the restart hoping to gap the rest of the runners who didn’t pit and they’d get swallowed by the other front runners who pitted and now are fresh tires. They could pit right after the restart, but then they’re restart effectively last and lose a tonne of time clearing back traffic and potentially having issues in a packed pit lane.
> make it that it doesn't count towards using the 2 compounds so you would still have to pit under green flag conditions or a safety car or VSC  It's extremely difficult to phrase correctly, though, since the regulations do not require any pit stops at the moment - just the use of two compounds - and don't even operate in terms of pit stops. And, honestly, can't - as making a (green flag) pit does not necessarily fulfill the requirement that's the entire rationale behind the two-compound rule.  You'd have to deal with stuff like:   * drivers changing to a different compound under red, then stopping under green for the same compound;  * drivers changing to a different compound under red, then changing back to the first compound under green;  * drivers changing to a different set of the same compound under red;  * drivers changing to a different set of the same compound under green;  * drivers changing tyres under red, then coming back to the exact same set they started on under green (like, with an early red).  Should the regulations cover all these cases in terms of compounds, sets of tyres, pit stops? Anything else?  And, all of these problems accumulate even more once you try to account for multiple reds.
According to you what was the correct grid format considering rules clearly state the grid order is set after passing the sectors and none of the cars made it to Sector 1 before the red flag.
With this, you could close the pit lane for that 1 full lap giving RC time to decide on a red flag or not.
If a car passes the pit lane during the SC and doesn’t pit, then they don’t get to change anything during the RF.
That's not reasonable and will never happen. Many times it can take several minutes to call a red flag because the marshals need to inspect the protections after a crash - but the first priority is always getting the drivers to safety. By the time it's clear that the drivers are safe, they have to make a decision on whether the protections are safe to continue the race or they need replacing - in which case a red flag needs to get thrown. Doing all of that in less than a whole lap is impossible.
No it wouldn't, the process is already complex.
It can't have happened twice this season, only Australia had a red flag.
The gambling factor is what makes it exciting though.
But if someone pits after the flag... do they then get reset back to their higher position, except now with better tyres?
Why would everybody pit?  If there is a normal sc, not everybody pits right?
Yeah, I guess it would have the same risk as pitting under a regular Safety Car. At least if a red flag is called, the grid gets reset.
Only if there is a red flag, and if there is , then everyone would get fresh tires and keep their position.
Only if a red flag is called during the SC.
During green flag running*   “during the race” leaves it open for loopholes lol
Then that just hooks up the people who did pit under the yellow making even more of a randomizer as the red flag could be thrown before some even make it to the pits
But that would give a major advantage to people who chose to pit during the yellow flags / safety car
Basically make it like parc ferme. Swap like for like parts that's it and that includes tire compounds.
Why though, if you're allowed to stop under a safety car, where you also lose muh less time, a red flag is just more of a timesaver, also everyone can use it, not just the people that are in a good position under the yellow. I think pitting under a red is perfectly fine and fair.
But then you still hand a massive advantage to those who pitted just before the RF. You fuck over someone either way, but the current method is just more simple and it is more transparent who gets fucked.
Every car can change tyres but only for one of the same compound. If a car is changing from or to wet or intermediate tyres then there are no restrictions.  There.
Surely you see how floored that would be? There would be so many situations where you’d get fucked by it.
If we implement this system people will just complain when those that change during the SC which then switches to red or just before a red flag gaining a massive advantage. What happens if you enter the pits just before a red is shown?
This is something I did not factor into my thoughts. Thanks for the insight.
This. A million times this.  People are so reactionary, they want the rules changed after every event. Now they don't want red flags called within a few laps of the race ending
Yes
100% agree. And I personally choose to believe that at least one of the red flags in Australia was only thrown to produce a photo finish. It would have never been thrown if the incident happened earlier in the race.
Nah, this is way too much. Now a red flag gives a free pitstop. What you propose is putting people at the back. That’s way worse
Because there are no situations when that ever will be unfair ofcourse. It's just fixing the problem by creating a different but almost exactly the same problem.
Then you just massively disadvantage those who were planning to pit the few laps after the red happened to coe out.
That doesn’t help. At all.
So the red flag is just thrown when someone decides to? Sounds like NASCAR  and "debris cautions". A red flag happens when certain criteria in the regulations specify, usually when there is a crash of some sort. They don't just throw the red flag on a whim.  Which of the drivers that were negatively impacted is your favorite?
Not sure how true this is, but it often feels like newer fans have these ideas. If you followed the sport for longer, you probably have some fond memory of a red flag making a race 'awesome' as well as screwing your favourite driver.  I think it's fine, and that's after red flags have been a net negative for Max in 2021, compared to Lewis. They made iconic races like Monza 2020 fantastic as well.
I think you gotta allow changes for safety as most of the field has typically run through a debris field at least once.  Allowing tire changes but have to be the same compound could be a reasonable compromise.
Then everyone would start on softs to get a pitstop early to avoid having to take an unnecessary pitstop later in the race if it gets red flagged. It would penalize long first stints making them very risky.
Yeah, anything that could be done during a pitstop is fine, I was refering to things you couldn't do unless the race was stopped (suspension, rear wing). Maybe repairing those could come along with a slight penalty. Of course safety is priority, and car repairs in order to ensure it, are a must. Just an idea I had so the red flag couldn't be as beneficial to any teams.
That could also be a posibility. In fact I like it better and makes more sense due to the parc ferme rule.
Because it essentially gives a free pit stop(it fulfills the requirement of using 2 different compounds) so anyone who pitted immediately under the SC as Russell did or just happened to be on a strategy that had them pit under green right before the red flag is essentially penalized between 22(green) & 10-12 sec(SC or VSC).
I don't think it's more fair to disallow tire changes, but at the same time, I think you lose something by not forcing the driver to have an in-lap and an out-lap and have the mechanics making a tire change under time pressure.  There's a bunch of time risk involved in making a green flag, or even a yellow flag, pit stop, but under red, you're basically never going to make a mistake.  A middle ground could be something like a 10-12 second penalty -- relative to the time order when the red flag comes out -- if you change tires.  Something close to the time lost for pitting under a safety car.  That way, everyone would have to sacrifice some track position every time they make a tire change, unless everyone changes tires.  It would make a red flag more equivalent to just extending the safety car period.  Personally, I like the idea of the impact of the red flag being very similar to the impact of a safety car, because then there wouldn't be so much talk about whether or not the red flag should have come out because of the impact on the race, and the focus could be on whether or not the red flag should have come out for safety purposes.  That's also why I would argue for doing a rolling restart after a red flag -- it's just more consistent with the safety car procedure.
Closed pitlane doesn't mean you're not allowed to pit whatsoever. It means you can only pit if you are desperate for it, and there's a punishment if you do (usually a time penalty. Or for endurance races, you are only allowed to fill fuel for 3 laps, so you need to come back in again way sooner than you want to)  It's fair because it takes away any gambling by the teams (or more often; dumb luck) on safety procedures, giving the race director breathing room to throw whatever flags he wants without having to worry about impacting the results. It also removes any "I pitted under yellow only for it to turn red" shenanigans. Closing the pit lane is the only way to keep safety procedures fair, otherwise someone is always going to benefit with free pit stops  Indycar does this, NASCAR does this, World Endurance Championship does this, IMSA does this, all touring car championships, etc. It's common practice to keep competition equal
Takes away any ability to gamble on strategy through safety procedures, and the race director is free to call flags as he sees fit without having to worry about impacting the race. Also takes away any "pitted under yellow only for it to turn red" shenanigans
Only under full safety car, not VSC. Full safety car will always benefit someone, even if it's just the leader who has chiseled himself a 20 sec lead, only for it all to disappear. There is simply no way to make a full safety car not benefit somebody  Closing the pitlane is still more fair than having it open, and causes way less problems for the people who have to consider safety precautions with teams and fans breathing down their necks
Anticipating the safety car? What?
yea and in general, I'm not crazy about the idea that sometimes the strategy revolves around a driver having an incident. no harm in keeping everyone on the same tires through the safety car period, is there? aside from decreased drama of the split second decision making of, who comes in, who stays out
Yeah closing the pitlane is much worse.   If a driver on very old tires hasn’t pitted he then has to pit once the safety car goes back in and will then be sent to the back of the entire field.   Both methods will cause someone to lose out unfairly but with the pitlane open the unlucky losers will lose a few positions and still be in touch with the cars they were fighting with. If the pitlane is closed the unlucky losers are sent all the way to the back of the field and lose out much more.   There is no totally fair way to do it but keeping the pitlane open is the most fair.
Its a safety issue imo, if the point of the Full SC is to allow track clean up and equipment on track, then having the entire pack together allows them to work, otherwise there is no reason for a full SC instead of a VSC. Also welcome to every other form of motorsport my friend where that is exactly have full course yellow works, teams work with the rules as they exist and will take risk if they think it is worth the gamble.
Safety mostly and its how every other major series works. As a track worker, I want all the pack together behind a SC not randomly diving in and flying around at a still decent clip all over the track getting packed up. Honestly not sure why we even bother with the SC then, VSC feels safer for me as a worker and if its a massive mess just go to red.
That's a perfect example of an exemption that would be fine, as a wet race throws the tire rule out anyway.
Thats not what I meant by that. Same state as in the cars restart in the same positions and the cars remain in the same condition they were in when the race was paused.
At race restart, the former leaders who have fresh tyres will have a substantial enough tyre advantage more often than not to if not regain the lost places, at least to stay within that 20-25s window of the cars in front.  The way things are right now, as we saw Russell dropped from 1st down to 7th then had no advantage, and realistically limited opportunity to make back the places. I think such a system would be *less unfair*.
But the drivers that stay out are choosing not to pit, so they should understand the risks associated with doing so. If they don't want to get caught out then all they have to do is cover their rival and pit as well. Simple. This is easy and clear for all to understand.  Currently, it is the opposite. Those that choose to pit are at risk of their rivals getting a free or cheap stop. I don't think it's right that making an active decision to pit has the added risk of losing out. They are already losing race time. If anyone has to lose out I think it is less unfair if it's the drivers who have chosen not to pit.
It's not difficult at all, and you wouldn't have to deal with any of that.   Tire changes under red simply don't count. Start on the hard and change to the soft under red flag? You have to pit again for softs or mediums.   The regulation would read:  Competitors must run two different tire compounds during the race in order to be classified. Compounds put on the car under red flag conditions do not count towards to the total.   Done.   Easy.
Not any more than they would be by a safety car
“Rules clearly state” … exactly. They should change the rule, because they are essentially negating things that happened on the track.
So cars with damage be it a puncture, broken wing etc., have to limp around the track until RC decide whether it should be a red flag, unless they are willing to get a drive-through penalty.
But that would screw over teams strategy for a quick pit to gain an advantage of the SC period, when no Red Flag is called. And SC strategy pitstops are a genuine part of getting yourself into a better position in the race.
The issue with this is that after 1 lap the cars should be bunched up behind the SC and you penalize drivers who have built a lead to take advantage of that hard earned track position.    I’d far more favor the order being reset to the on track position at the start of the Safety Car and allow all cars to take similar advantage of the Red Flag.  Or just leave it the same and add that element of “does this incident seem to likely produce a Red” like the first Red Flag did this last race.
By the second lap the cars are bunched up and there no chance to put under safety though, I think what the op is suggesting is fine but will mean all 20 cars will be heading to pits as soon as the safety car is called.   Whole the current situation is not perfect it's produces drama and makes the sport interesting, pity it fucks people over but most sports have something like that.
Bad idea, here's a hypothetical situation to show why:  A safety car is called out, but only for one lap before a red flag is waved due to debris in sector 1. 9 cars elect to pass by the pits, but then run over carbon fiber shards and get a slow puncture. Too bad they can't change anything! That would be an interesting restart
Most of the people in this thread want safety cars and flags to be a competition thing, not a safety thing.   Which is stupid.
What about this. If there’s a red flag, you don’t have to stop in your pit box.   You can choose track position instead. Drive to put exit, and wait there.   Wherever you stop, you stay. Box or pit exit. Cars at pit exit start at the front in the order they got there while everyone else is ordered as they were behind them.
The safety car coming exactly 1 lap after Ferrari pitted in Saudi Arabia did screw them over in that race though but that's bad luck I guess which is all too common for them now no matter what the memes say
Not when no one gambles by bringing a car in, which is what will happen
Of course, but in a race like last week where everyone was on hards for 40 laps straight I'm sure most drivers would have pitted.
‘Green flag running’ means that pit-stops under the safety car don’t count either though
Part of strategy
I’ve actually seen it work well across multiple years and series. All the drive through does is make up for the pitlane delta that you didn’t need to take when you changed tires or made repaira while the race was paused. The only people getting “fucked” in this system would be the people who had already gained an advantage anyway
No different than this.  Always winners and losers. And really nascar's rule that closes pit lane when the caution comes out until the field is bunched up is the fairest way.
Many people seem to forget or just not know that any distance-based race is about finishing first as slowly as possible. There are no meaningful records or prizes for finishing as quickly as possible in those.
Alright then I guess the current system is the best..?  Why is it fair for damaged cars to get a get out jail free card?  Isn’t that less fair?  But yeah the current system is the simplest and supports competition, so is what it is
Fair enough, there’s some issues with my idea for sure
It keeps the safety requirement and allows for better racing because it maintains pit strategy throughout the race and doesn't overly punish people that choose to pit under the yellow or before the red
Punishes them less than the people who pit under yellow and then a red flag occurs if we were to keep the other rules
Yes, it does. But people selectively rage when their driver's race is affected. And that's conversation dies down till next red flag race.  I think, the rule as it is now is justified. For safety purposes specially. People cannot strategize for red flags, they take risks by pitting normally without safety car or pit under safety car but get affected by red flag. All part of racing, not needed to be controlled.
You can even crash on the way to the grid (hungary 2021), and then repair the suspension on the grid before the start of the race. So you could do it in a long pit stop without bringing the car into the garage. Though I assume the FIA would not be pleased with the safety aspect of a repair occuring in a pit box for 15 minutes
He already explained how the opposite scenario flips the situation around. If the 2nd to 20th luckily pits before a red. Then the leader gets fucked and would need to pit after everyone bunched up putting him last.
And if you wouldn't have been allowed, the opposite is true. So I don't see your point. If you're one of the last to have not pitted, you're now back 22s but those 22s mean you're last since you have to pit when everyone is bunched up, much like Sainz's 5s penalty ended up putting him last.
Ideal world race director doesn't care about the results but throws the flags that are needed for the situation. That is what the goal should be.
>the race director is free to call flags as he sees fit without having to worry about impacting the race  I think this is kind of an underrated factor.  In an ideal world, the race director would be completely unmoved by everything the teams say, but they are only human and the next time they have to make a decision like that under time pressure, they might be more reluctant to call a red flag because of all the criticism they got the last time they called it.
If you disadvantage yourself by pitting earlier than what would be optimal in order to not lose out time by having to pit shortly after a SC, you've anticipated the SC. By pitting at what would be your optimal time, and this just so happens before a SC was called, you've been lucky. Flip these, and its the same under the current rules. You're either lucky or you've earned the lead by anticipating the SC. Same thing.
>then having the entire pack together allows them to work  And that's exactly how they're doing it now, if you didn't notice. Waiting until everyone catches safety car, then starting clearing the track.  >every other form of motorsport  What "every other form of motorsport"? Most motorsports don't have pit stops during races at all. Or every other form of motorsport is called indycar? American racing shouldn't even be considered motorsport, cause it's not sport.
This doesn't really answer the title of the post, yet it is still the only reasonable answer so far. Thanks for your insight.
> Compounds put on the car under red flag conditions do not count towards to the total.  The rule written this way excludes a strategy that goes: hard -> soft (under red) -> soft (under green), as "soft compound" does not count by its wording, despite you explicitly mentioning it as valid in your write-up.
No they can just do what nascar does. You pit when its closed you go to the tail of the longest line
In the case of punctures, broken wings, and all that, their race will also be f(ruin)ed if there was not a red flag. So, I don't see the problem there.
There could be obvious safety exemptions where things like that could be forgiven (similar to lap 1 incidents). If the stewards were as quick to call red flags as they were the last two time they did on Sunday, then this would never be a concern. I think they just need to define when a red flag should be called and better assess the situations. I think most people understand the need for the red flag for the gravel and the explanation from Magnussen's did as well, but I disagree that two cars with damage that were off track warranted a red flag to conclude the race. Maybe the rules need to be different for street courses with less run off and more likely to have debris where any shunt is automatic red flag (like Baku or Monaco where there little to no runoff anywhere).
But these are screwing those types of strategy calls. I think most agree the rule should probably be tweaked, but no one agrees how yet
It's not really a strategy you can rely on though, is it? It just comes down to dumb luck. Championships and race victories shouldn't be decided off luck.
I’m thinking an RF called during SC could reset driver position to the position when yellow is called? I mean they’re stopped anyway and that simply nullifies the SC strategy. Similar to what happened for the 3rd red.
What if a driver changed Tyres the lap before SC? He will lose positions He dont get back. Either way it's unfair to someone.  If you stop early you can take a huge advantage like Alonso in Singapur (i now it was scripted but showed possibilities) but you also take the risk of it not paying off.
Then they get to change and just drop to the back of the grid as if they would have if they had stopped during a SC after everyone else has bunched up  Edit because your situation is ridiculous: I haven’t seen a car take a puncture in a safety car in the last 3 years. Let alone 9 in one race. Bad luck due to racing things like reliability and car failures/damage are part of racing. The race director making decisions that reward/punish people randomly is not.
The cars don’t stop in their pit boxes for red flags. This is how it already works.
yes, sorry, I have explained myself poorly. I was indeed referring to the Saudi Arabia safety car, that as well is a bit questionable imo. I would like a bit more clarity about the transitions from vsc to sc or to red flag in general. I would prefer them to directly deploy sc instead of going vsc-sc, for example.
Because you don't get your position back if it stays a SC.
Because you don't always know that it will be a red flag?
Only 2 did though?
“During any conditions except a red flag”
Now you're in the box serving a 5 or 10 second penalty and they throw the red flag. Are you exempt if you enter pit lane before the flag or if you're in the pit at all and a red flag is thrown? What if you're already in pit entry but not at the speed limit line yet?
Yeah, probably "during a pit stop, excluding changes made under a red flag" might get closer to the intent people are talking about here.
can't you see how that is unfair aswell?   Driver A and B are in first and second place  Driver A pits. He comes out 2nd  Every driver except Driver B has pitted.  Red flag.  Driver B changes tires or doesn't.  1 lap after the restart the field is within 20s.  Driver B comes in the pits for penalty or to change tires and rejoins in P20.  it just punishes people who haven't pitted before the red flag. Sure it is better for people who have pitted that overall it isn't better
Not it doesn’t because the field is bunched up so it is prohibitively punitive.
I mean it’s not though is it. It’s prohibitive to people at the front and a free pass for those outside the points. It removes randomness from it and so by definition it removes fairness.
I had to read this a couple of times. Rip brain.
A red flag is because the track is dangerous and often what caused it gives people damage. Just because somebody took off your front wing doesn’t mean you should be punished on top of that.  And sometimes somebody gets lucky, but that’s how it works. If you are going to actively punish people for fixing their car you get a lot more unfair moments
It now overly punishes people that don't pit as soon as the SC gets called, because they will have to stop again, while others get a free pit stop.      Whatever you do, the system always has winners and losers and there will always be a risk to strategy calls. All you do is change who loses and wins out.      So instead of complicating the rules to get a similar result (but with the advantage flipped around) why not just let the rules stay as they are.
It’s about track position.
Ideal world, yes. In practice, they are only human. It would be a lot better if there's no reason for them to care in the first place, as it won't impact the results. Simultaneously, there won't be any reason for the teams or fans to believe the Race Director is fixing races either
Yeah, every time you bunch up the field, there will be winners and losers, but sometimes it is necessary.    The closest you could come to sort of maintaining the state of the race under safety condition would be something like a VSC where you were allowed to pit, but you had to wait an extra 10 seconds or so, so that you don't gain an advantage relative to pitting under green.  But you can't cover everything with a VSC anyway.  The nice thing about trying to maintain the race state -- from a fan standpoint -- is that it gives you the best shot at getting to see multiple strategies play out.  When you have a red flag and everyone can change tires, it tends to put everyone back on the same strategy.  Even safety cars wind up putting a lot of teams onto the same strategy, or at least pitting the same lap, because there is such a time advantage to pitting under SC versus under green.
Most motorsports don't have pit stops!? Do you just watch BTCC and F3? Supercars, NASCAR, WEC, IMSA, Indycar, F2, SuperGT, and DTM all have pit stops my brother, and of all those series we get on TV here ( don't get much DTM or Supercars here tbf), the pits close as soon as a FCY starts. I get being a snob that wants to turn your nose at other series but if you the the FIA is aiming for pure sport, get your self check out dude, its about entertainment and this past event proves that.           On your first point, maybe its the tv coverage but that's not how it appears to be occurring to me. If it is that would means a much slower clean up anyway. Frankly I'm all for ditching the SC and using VSC or Code 60 even and Red flags if we need it, but to my sense of play, free pit stops because you were lucky and near pit in when a SC deploys are not fair play or sporting.
That’s also true but If there was an appropriate penalty for changing tires under red it would allow the cars who haven’t pitted yet the option to choose how they remedy the situation. If theres only 2 laps left, they would probably keep their current track position on old tires and try to hold on. If theres 50 laps left, depending on how harsh the penalty is, they’d probably take the tires+penalty and try to overtake on track.  Currently, regardless of when the red flag comes out, the cars that get screwed over don’t really get much of a choice imo. They get new tires, the only choice they get is which compound to use, and they are stuck where they are.
That would qualify, since the Hard and second Soft would count
That's your (incorrect) interpretation, but it would be exceedingly simple to write that regulation in a way such that even people like yourself wouldn't be able to misinterpret.   I did it in 5 seconds while eating tacos.
Umm, thanks for proving my point exactly!
Nascar has the advantage of having 3-6 pit stops per race. Being out at the end of the line in F1 is a huge disadvantage, especially if most don’t need to pit again
People have had whole front wings replaced and gone on to score great positions.
Every team will claim their driver reported a vibration and be allowed in.   The more shit you add, the more edge cases you create.
Which means that it shouldn't be changed.
I don’t agree at all. No need to change the rules.
Championships? No, race victories? Maybe not. But a good call during a SC moment can be the difference between finishing 4th/5th or a podium. For quite some teams and drivers, that is pretty much enough to take such calls.  Russell was very vocal about trying to wait with pit stops, because of possible SC moments, just for that reason.
You can’t rely on it, but informed gambling is still part of the sport. They’ll look at the data. We lack the pace of our competitors but this track has historically had SC’s, and a few guys went off in FP? We’ll bet on that option with one of our cars.   E.g., RB got a lot of praise for their ballsy strategies when they were the 3rd best car. In reality, it wasn’t just they had very good executions, but that they needed to bank on not doing the same as the Ferraris and Mercedes.
You get the point though, right? Those that choose not to service their car get to start up front.
Exactly
"I had already decided to pit as part of my pre-race strategy when the red flag was thrown"  "I had decided to pit before the red flag came out and was setting my car up for it by adjusting all the settings to suit pitting"\  The more you try to fix it, the worse it will get.
What if they reinstate the Chinese Grand Prix and there are red flags flying everywhere🧐
Thats true but i still think it’s more fair since Driver B’s decision requires a trade off in this scenario. You can either have fresh tires or track position, not both. If you can change tires under red you get to have both fresh tires and the track position.   The penalty also doesn’t have to be a drive through like NASCAR,IMSA, and Indy. Those have a harsher penalty since the field gets bunched up more. It could be something smaller like a grid drop of like 2-3 positions on the restart or something else that provides at least a little risk to taking new tires.
As is there is still risk to pitting too soon or too late. Look at what happened to Checo in 2022 at Saudi. It is what it is. Other motorsports have this kind of system and it works great. In NASCAR if you pit too soon you could be looking at losing 2-3 LAPS if a caution comes out too quick. Indycar you run the risk of running out of fuel if you wait too long and catch a caution. That's all part of the randomness of racing.  That being said I am fine with safety car stops as is. If anything just stop allowing tires changed under red flag to count as your two compouds.
Pit lane closed under yellow until everyone is behind the safety car resolves that and that's what nascar does.
Under people's proposed rules, Hamilton doesn't score any points at Imola in '21, and goes into the last race of the season 23 points behind Max.
It doesn’t have to be a drive through either. It can be any penalty that offers a trade off between fresh tires and track position. You shouldn’t be able to change tires without some sort of trade off imo
Okay, fair enough, each side has its pros and cons.  Also another thing, this was about tires not body damage.  If your tire gets cut down in the race you don’t get to catch up and the tires can be inspected independently from the rest of the car.  So let teams repair bodywork but if the tires are inspected and are good then you can keep going on that set, if you change tires then you start from the pitlane
It punishes those drivers less than the people who pit under yellow and then a red flag occurs if we were to keep the other rules because you keep grid position. If I'm in 2nd and pit to end up in 10th and a red flag occurs, I start in 10th but don't have to pit. If I'm in 2nd and don't pit, I'm in 2nd and the delta is reset. It's pretty much the start of the race except people at the back of the grid (people who probably pit) don't have to pit. Makes for better racing.
How? You lose track position in both scenarios.
Yeah, I should've wrote more accurately: not most, but most major motorsports, cause I personally only follow world championships and don't give a single fuck about rest (watching Indycar, DTM etc. feels just like watching unofficial football match, so pointless). So no mandatory pit stops: Formula E, WTCC (may it rest in peace), MotoGP, probably Superbike too. Pit stops: F1 and WEC.  >its about entertainment  Yeah, I noticed that since Americans bought F1 it's became more about entertainment. But I personally will NEVER accept having entertainment over fair competition. And every time when they'll do some shit like they did last weekend i will be mad. Even if it gives advantage to the team I support. I don't give a SINGLE fuck about race being "entertaining" in a way current F1 owners want it to be. When I watch sport i care ONLY about 2 things:  1) competitive integrity from both drivers and race officials (so no things such as Abu Dhabi 2021 or Australia 1994)  2) seeing teams, that i support, winning (yeah, yeah, 2014-16 years seasons were the best).  >ditching the SC  Agree. Nowadays they started doing too many SC. SC is needed only if recovery needed to be made from the actual track surface. If it's somewhere in gravel for example, VSC is enough. Even if that crane-tractor is needed.  >free pit stops because you were lucky and near pit  1) pit stop during SC is "cheap", but not completely free;  2) closing pit lane is MUCH more unfair, I already wrote the example above. With current rules you can maximum lose maybe 15 seconds if you pitted before SC while rival pitted during. But if pit lane would be closed, you can lose MUCH more time. **You can have a minute advantage over someone but still ending up behind** because safety car will nullify all that gap and you'll need to pit after SC, while opponent pitted before.  Maybe I've shouldn't write so long but currently had nothing to do. Most important thing is in bold.
Is "second Soft" a different compound than "first Soft"?
> I did it in 5 seconds while eating tacos.  And confusing "compounds" with "sets of tyres".
If you were involved in an accident and have damage, being put back to 17th place because they pitted early isn’t going to be what ruins a driver’s race. A tire puncture would be a different story however
Yeah, I agree. But check the comment I'm answering to.
Yup. That's a real issue. I disagree with the closing of the pits
~~Heck, drivers you "miss" a corner and smash half their wings into a barrier".~~  Heck, drivers would "miss" a corner and smash half their wings into a barrier.
I mean. You’re implying that it is impossible for F1 to have rules without loopholes, because rules can’t be clearly stipulated. That’s nonsensical.
What if driver A is already past the pit entry after the yellow flag/VSC/SC happens, but driver B isn't? Driver B can stop immediately if it is within his pit window, nice. Now driver A has to go around the whole lap at reduced speed, but a red flag gets called, because the whole barrier is fucked. Now driver A is completely screwed without even having a choice. He must go to the pits because of the red flag and can't even change tyres, while losing any lead he has.  There are always these kinds of possible poor luck situations, but usually you can catch at least some seconds of VSC if it's only out for like 80% of a lap.
It would be somewhat complicated, but not impossible to do something like:  \- take the running order and their time deltas at the time of the red flag.    \- if a team decides to make a change under red, then they lose time relative to that running order, equal to an amount specified before the race that is roughly the time loss under a SC pit stop.   \- recalculate the grid order and have them shuffle into place on the outlap  I think I would like that as an alternative rule -- if you had a big lead when the red flag comes out, you could change tires and you'd still probably lose 2-3 places, but you wouldn't lose 10-15 places like you might if you had to pit when the field is all bunched up.  And typically it seems like the red flag comes out before the safety car has been able to totally bunch up the field.  I think the main thing that I don't like about red flag tire changes is that there is essentially no risk in it and you take any of the driver and pit skill out of the equation.  You don't have to do all the right things for an in-lap and an out-lap, and there is no time pressure for changing the tires, where maybe you could make a mistake that would cost you extra time.
But then the people who did not pit get fucked massively by being a whole pistop behind with no gap to the cars who pitted before.
Sounds better than we’re he deserved to be at that point in the season.
I respect your opinion although I don't think I can fully agree on all your points. I would most argue that cheap SC stops are just as unfair to me as the inverse its all part of strategy and sometimes you get burned. With a SC you will always lose any gap and its only fair if everyone pits under the same condition, perhaps the real fix is an added delta for SC stops to match the Green flag time loss there buy removing the discount.
No, but it was a compound put on outside of a red flag
It's sadly cute watching you try to be pedantic for no reason and still being wrong... but that's your journey to take.
Not necessarily true. What if you are the leader (think verstappen 10 sec ahead) and get a puncture at the very end of the lap? Second last corner or something like that. Could come right into the pits. Sure, he’d lose time, but it’s not like he wouldn’t still have a shot. Going to the back would be so much more worse.
You're saying there's no problem in not letting them pit because their race is ruined anyway, then agreeing their race is not ruined?
I can’t stop trying to figure out where the 4th and final apostrophe is supposed to go and what that sentence is supposed to mean.
Have you.. watched F1? Every rule is exploited as hard a is possible. The more complicated you make the rules, the greater your attack surface.
Yes but Driver A can change his tires there is just a penalty applied. He can have a choice to keep his track position or put on new tires. They’d get to pick the lesser of two evils. If theres 2 laps of the race left Driver A will probably take a chance starting in 1st with old tires. If there is 50 laps left Driver A will probably take the tires and the 2-3 grid place drop for the restart and try to regain the positions lost while on track. I think the party that gets screwed over should get a choice, bc currently the only choice they get is which compound of new tires they put on.
That's not what the "rule" said, though - was it a compound put on the car under red flag conditions?
To be fair, two compounds could be read in such a way that even a new set of tyres under Green or standard SC conditions would be an issue for completion
The hipotetical situation in discussion is what to do before a red flag. Guys here are suggesting to close the pit lane from an accident until the red flag is called.   The other guy said It was unfair if the guys with damaged parts are not allowed to quickly go into the pit lane a little before a red flag since they would fall into the last places because they would be slowly limping for one or two more laps until the red flag is called.   My point is that it's not "more unfair" because if a red flag scenario is not called they would also fall back because of the damage.   The point of recovering is also a possibility, but it's not the discussion here. What we are talking about is the impact of having a part damaged when an accident happens (or getting a part damaged when an accident happens) vs a tire change. And that is why I'm saying, it's the same and not unfair to those guys.
I must have typed that on my phone, it's absolutely horrific lol
 This is just nonsensical. How do they make any rules, if making rules is impossible? The sport is full of them. And even the vague ones have accepted interpretations.  Yes, teams push the rules, mostly those around design. And appeal decisions etc etc. But to say this means that making a new rule that can be enforced is impossible is ludicrous.
No, it was a compound put on the car under green
I didn't take the point about the damaged cars not pitting as a thing about being unfair but more that it's _extremely unsafe_ to knowingly allow cars to circle with damage and no way to enter the pitlane.
Thanks Captain.   And I agree
I have never once claimed that F1 cannot make rules. You are twisting my words.

Better to save the engine. No extra points for winning with 30 seconds difference.
I don’t think this was a response to Russel.  Max said this after the race and Russel said what he said after Max so I could be wrong but it’s more of a bait article.
> "I think anyway, there’s nothing really they can do," Verstappen said.  >"I mean, we just try to do the best we can with the development of the car, but it's also about pace management.  >"We didn't really know, I think no-one really knew how long that Hard tyre would last, so it's about just bringing it home because we had a bit of pace I think over the others.  >"There's no need to try and gain half a second a lap and destroy your tyres to the end because you never know, a Safety Car can happen, red flags, like we had today. So yeah, it's not necessary to risk all that."
You don't gain anything from going all out 24/7 with a gap like that. Merc nerfed themselves in 2014 in the same way b/c of how stupidly far ahead of everyone they were.
I mean he doesn't deny it at all and the way he talks in the article hints that Russell is right
Max has really taken onboard the requirement for patience. Obviously he still wants to and still does push unnecessarily at times but he’s definitely learned lessons from lost points.  In regards to his own comments here, of course. There’s definitely pace in the bag.
>"I was just quite cautious as well, in the first lap," Verstappen explained.  >"I didn't want to risk getting damaged and the cars behind me were really aggressive which [is] fair enough, they knew they were not quick enough, so the only chance they had was Lap 1 and they took advantage of that."  Rings any bells??   Same thing that happened in later races of 2021. Hamilton had the faster car and Max either had to do desparate moves to gain the lead or get stuck in P2.  Hamilton being called a mature driver against Max's aggressive driving thought out the hybrid era. Well Hamilton had the faster car, so he can choose to ignore an opening and try next lap cause he has the fastest car.   Now you can see the same happening with Max taking cautious approach because why risk it.
How long until the “Verstappen can only win from the front” comments start?
Such a laid-back answer. I bet some people here expected drama.
I see Russell is following in sir Lewis's footsteps of being a massive whinger.
Max is going to race in time trial mode so many times this season. Racing sim in real life.
YOUR HONOR I STRENUOUSLY OBJECT.
My take on this is Max agrees, he could of gone faster but it might of been foolish. Yet he might of had a lead that would of allowed a pit stop and not lose the lead.
Well he pretty much confirms it lol. He’s doing the right thing to save tires and the engine
Don’t have to read the article. Of course they are
Yeah well nobody wants to get the Williams treatment.
I wonder if he's been half botching the starts just to have a little fun and not just lead the whole race
imagine the spice if Max had someone worthy in the 2nd RB seat.
He should really mess with everyone and say "yes, we've got another 50hp we can use, we just don't need to".
Wonder what would happen if there is 1 extra point for every car you lap.
There's more to it than just saving the engine. Red Bull have the least Aero time this season. They can only do so much to improve compared to the rest of the field.  They show their hand too early they risk everyone using that extra aero time to catch up and then over take em (Well some of the teams anyway.) They have a much smaller window to make improvements to maintain their lead than the rest of the field does.
Mercedes are so used to sandbagging they assume red bull are too. It’s literally like the entire team has totally forgotten the years from 2014 to 2020 exist.
What... click bait karma farming... here
It’s bonkers how many terrible articles are all based on sound bites from the pre- and post-race interviews. If you had an hour every race week you could literally get all the un-twisted information directly from the drivers and team principals by watching:  Post-qualifying driver interview  Pre- and post-race driver interview  Team principal interview   F1TV is worth it just for that.
Everyone talks about how OP the W11 was but it ain't got a thing on the W07. The W07 won all races it finished, one race was lost in Spain where both drivers took each other out and the other one was lost because Vettel took out Rosberg and Hamilton had reliability issues leading to a dnf.
Yes, indeed.  Russell: RB takes it slow to placate FIA.  Verstappen: RB takes it slow to bring home the car, and not destroy tyres.  Note: A Mercedes engineer once actually stated that Mercedes used to dowhat George accused RB off: dialling back perf, because the gap was too large already.
Its a bit shame because even if Mercedes was also definitely sandbagging in 2014 Rosberg and Hamilton at least had eachother to worry about.  Max doesn't have even that. In the races his car doesn't break down he's gonna be cruising to victory.
>Max has really taken onboard the requirement for patience  It's incredibly easy to be patient when you're in a race by yourself tho. In the seasons prior to 2021, when he was running in no-mans land all season long, he was also the embodiment of patience. The only time's he hasn't been patient is when he's fighting against someone in a better or equal car, where aggressions and taking chances is how you win (And that's not a knock against Max, because this is how literally everyone in the field drives)
The requirement for patience comes hand in hand with having a dominant car and a championship that's yours to lose. He was never in that position until about a third of the way through last year. Aggressive driving was what won him races before, but he's not in that position anymore. He's just driving to the car he has under him.
People tend to be blissfully unaware (or intentionally ignorant) that the one who has a disadvantage will always be forced to try things and take risks, which is the case in practically every sport. Even outside of sports! In business for example.  In basketball you have hack-a-Shaq, in American football you have onside kicks and hail mary's, in actual football there's goalies crossing the field for a last-minute corner kick, in hockey they ditch the goalie for an extra field player, etc.
He already showed many times that he can win from way back on the grid.
Hamilton could compete for wins for his entire career up until last year. You'd make a complete fool of yourself if you say the same about Verstappen no matter how long this domination lasts, he has more than proven himself in lesser cars.   I'm gonna guess it's going to be more like Schumacher. Everyone knew that he was fast, but they just got tired of him winning every year.
Give it another year and he's had a rocketship for his entire career and doesn't know what it's like to not compete for wins.
You mean free practice
Yeah, he’s sort of saying “we’re not sandbagging we’re just so good it would be daft to risk crashing out of the race just to try and keep a lead we’ll take back later”.
It's "could have" btw, not "could of"
Seems unlikely given the danger of a turn 1 incident that could wreck his race, also he seems the type that wants to maximise his use of the cars performance when possible.
I think he wants some grand slams
Who would actually be able to compete with him tho
Would a potential few points per race be worth the reliability and penalties associated with quicker wearing parts over future races?
Interesting discussion to be had on how to add more ways to earn points.
2026 new wc point system: every overtake = 1 point  no blue flags 😂
But if there is safety car?
This makes no sense.. You think if they drive too quick people will try to improve their aero faster? All the teams are working to make their cars as quick as they can, as fast as they can.   How fast Red bull goes has no bearing on what anyone else is doing.
Showing their hand only relates to weird rule changes in the middle of the season and it will also make some teams give the season up. They dont want that. They want every team to try and catch their unbeatable car, whose limits only known to redbull.
Absolutely, 2014-16 was obscene levels of dominance.
The W05 is the one for me, Bahrain, Spain and Spa that year were absolutely absurd in terms of relative pace to the rest of the field, probably the most dominant Mercedes of that era imo
Paddy Lowe told that he Toto and some other people had discussions about how much they would turn up the engines before Q3 in 2014. They also restricted the engine modes to the drivers in the race.  In Bahrain after the SC restart Rosberg ignored the restrictions and turned the power up. Lewis responded to it by doing the same and that’s how they pulled a gap of over 2 seconds a lap over the field.
It's largely the tires. People aren't really getting that the tires in 2014 for Bahrain and the tires today are night and day. Back then you could do 15 laps 2-3 seconds a lap faster on the same tire that you could instead do 30 laps that much slower. The tires weren't thermally limited, if you pushed them harder they did less laps but far faster so you would have to pit again but you could make up that time.  Now you go over the thermal limit you lose performance and lose tire life fast as fuck, you go under the thermal limit and you lose performance and lose tire life.  If you had 2014 type compounds today then that RBR could disappear into the distance. He pulled out 2 seconds on Hamilton within a lap to break drs and over shot badly, then his tires would have heated up and he needed to back off to a much slower pace to prevent them overheating.  that RBR is completely tire limited where in Bahrain in 2014 it was pure engine/car performance and the tires were fine to make it to the end at max pace.
Perez, and only Perez, disagrees with your comment.
What's more of a shame is regulations that were devised to even the playing field have led to the most one sided championship we're probably ever likely to see. And that's more on the other teams than the regulators.
☝️  If the RB19 wasn't as good, Verstappen would still be racing like he did in 2021. His personality didn't change, the relative performance of his car changed.
So you think he’ll go back to throwing away all of his points for the sake of 7 as soon as he’s challenged again?  If we’re going to add quantifiers, you learn a lot from being in a championship battle. Had Max had the patience and wherewithal to prioritise finishing, he would have won in Brazil.
[removed]
Exactly, I mean if Max would have been in the Mercedes in the 2014-21 years, he'd be an 8 time champ already. Before the RB domination he's won races in slower cars but in a totally dominant car he's basically in god mode which is what he's demonstrating now.
Verstappen spent like 6 years without a championship contending car. He's not likely to forget those lessons anytime soon.
You are spot on
Thank you professore
Idk, he’s not like Vettel who always wanted the fastest lap even when it didn’t pay out any points. I don’t see Max as somebody after all the stats
Lewis, Fernando and Charles  Maybe only Lewis truly though
Just a thought, Max and mystery hero would be lapping the field  by the end of the first stint.
Thinking about it a bit more I don't think they would try. In a season like this RedBull doesn't need the extra points and in a close season the leaders push each other to the max anyway.
If playing F1 has taught me anything, you just dump a bigger budget into aero to improve it faster. Duh!  &#x200B;  /s
That’s not true necessarily, there is a decision to be made (for all teams) how much to spend on developing this years car vs when to start on next.  Red Bull keeping it reasonably close could entice teams to develop more this year in the hopes of catching up, instead of giving up this year and potentially bringing a superior challenger next season.
It makes perfect sense. No one knows how fast the Red Bull actually is. If you don’t know, you have no idea what times you should be targeting. Let’s say you develop the car and you find Performance that should translate to .4 a lap faster than Red Bull has been displaying. Seems like a pretty good improvement and now faster than the redbull? Turns out they’re actually .5 faster than what they’ve displayed and you’re still slower.   The point is to hide the target so companies unwillingly undershoot their target performance expectations.
Except for when they go and spy on the car and go to copy every detail because ‘how is that car 30 sec ahead.’ It would put a whole different fire under their asses if they were.
2014-2016 tested my loyalty to how boring the sport could become before i stopped watching. One of the very few seasons i deliberately skipped watching races because of how boring it was.
https://f1i.com/news/403416-dominant-mercedes-hid-engine-advantage-in-2014-lowe.html  The W05 was insane
It also helps that the car in 3rd was a Force India, the only time that team got near a podium that season
And sometimes Perez’s dad. But probably not always.
Going from no cap to a salary cap was always going to have growing pains. It was definitely made with 10+ years in mind, not immediately.
I thought the main purpose was to allow better racing by reducing dirty air?
That's just nonsense. How is this more one-sided than Mercedes in 2014, 2015, 2016 or 2020? The first 3 you could at least argue that Rosberg was competitive,  but in 2020 there was no championship battle.
One Team got it right. But the midfield is very close
The field itself is probably the tightest its ever been from 2-10.  So it worked with a single outlier.
>to the most one sided championship we're probably ever likely to see  2020? and it really isn't the fault of the regulations that Perez is nowhere near Max lol
I think if you ask anyone in the paddock, the aero regs are certainly working, but the TD for the floor screwed over almost every team and set them back. I think some of the performance stagnation is the result we’re seeing from that knee jerk response. That and the cost cap will make things a little harder in these first few years where everyone has to figure out how and where to spend to maximize performance.
As opposed to other years where merc had the advantage and other teams had even less to spend than merc?  At least now there is a wind tunnel allowance which will help reducing any gaps.
any regulation change has teams that get it right and teams that get it wrong.
this is how each regulation change first starts out, one or 2 teams gets it right, but it takes a while for the field to catch up
Their fault for not spending more on catering.
I mean do you think someone can win from the back with the slowest car? You're watching the wrong sport if that's the case.
10 races before 2021, without the fastest car
Duh.. obviously the car is by far the biggest factor in F1. Ain't no way Hamilton is a multiple world champ without the Mercedes domination tears from '14-'20. Same for max.
Max has never had a capable team mate so you can’t say that kind of thing without context
That’s what people will say, not what I think.
I mean he was in no mans land his entire career apart from TR. When  RB won in hybrid era they were the fatest car on the track or else 2nd or 3rd fatest in no mans land.  It wasn't championship contending but defo not the slowest
It's "professor", not "professore".
Lewis couldn’t even do it in 21 in a better car not to mention an rb one that may not be built completely to his liking
Good point
At this point in the year, I think it would be foolish to move to next years' car. If you keep developing this year's car you get real-world feedback on changes; if you switch to next year's car at this point there's going to be a lot of development with no actual feedback and a significant risk of being misled by correlation issues. The point at which this becomes a tricky decision is when either regulation changes or deciding that you need to change something that is impractical to release mid-year (e.g. significant suspension geometry changes), but the 2024 regulations haven't been settled and I suspect everyone wants more data on their 2023 car before making such big decisions.  I think the 2021 season somewhat messed up perceptions surrounding the tradeoff--in that case the regulation changes were so substantial that it was simply impossible to pursue incremental development; almost everything teams learned about their 2021 car would be useless.  Looking at it from a different perspective--if thinking they have a chance of catching RB is the only thing keeping Mercedes/AM/Ferrari developing their 2023 car, why do backmarkers  (outside of extremely cash-strapped teams such as Haas last year) continue to develop their cars, rather than switching to next year's car as soon as they realize they are a backmarker? Last season Aston Martin released a significant (and expensive) mid-season update and McLaren released major updates for Singapore, despite neither team having much to fight for by that point.
Not just that, showing their true pace gives the teams a more accurate expectation for their design targets. So if RB hide their true pace by say 0.3 secs and some other team catch up to them and are faster by 0.1, then RB can use the 0.3s in the bank to go 0.2s quicker.  At this point, RB still has resources to go quicker while other teams have exhausted a significant part of it trying to get there.
Do you honestly think that teams cannot reasonably estimate how far ahead is RB? I’d imagine teams already have a good idea on how big the gap is, what may not be clear is, how much better can RB get
Maybe if it wasn’t so blindingly obvious how fast their car was, then I’d agree. Even with their ‘sand bag’ pace right now all teams know they’re nowhere near competing with this years car. So like you probably say are putting more effort into next year already.  Tying that back to my original comment, it makes no different how fast RB drive right now, with how ‘fast’ the guys work on their aero, whether that be this years or next years car.
Can't start on next years car yet as there can be rule changes for next year at the middle of this season like last years floor change so everyone is working on this years car.
>instead of giving up this year and potentially bringing a superior challenger next season  As there are no major rule changes between these seasons, the car you develop this year *is* next year's car. It's a continuous development, not a "Well, now we throw this away and start anew" after every season. So no, absolutely no one is going to "focus on next year's car", because that would entail focusing on this year's car anyways
Everyone already has that fire. Everyone knows RB has far and away the fastest car and is the one to copy. They aren't suddenly getting more aero time or better photo quality because RB is 40 seconds ahead instead of 20.
These teams are clever as fuck, they all already know the RB could win by 30 sec+ and they all already are trying to figure out how it’s so damn quick.
Yes and no. It’s not like the RB had any real pace in hand even with DRS for lap after lap. It might have been closer but not by much
I know but you know how it is dude. When a team pulls out a gap like that it takes years of development and regulation tinkering to bring them back.   So deflated and as a Charles supporter it's even worse.
That's the purpose of the aero regs, the purpose of the cost cap is to have closer competition which, at least at the front, has so far failed spectacularly. We'll see if it's any different in 2026.
Very short memories. RB is already off pace to match Mercedes' 1-2 finish record (by percentage of races). I also think a lot of people are extremely overconfident in their projections--I've seen way too many claims that RB's advantage is actually 3-4 seconds a lap, or that it's just about settled that RB is winning every championship until 2026, based on no real evidence
Aston didn't get it right, they're barely as good as Ferrari last year relatively speaking and the midfield is always close.
Credit to Toto \^\^
Yes, and we have evidence of it happening before. I guess you haven't watched the sport enough to know that.
What race might that be?
He's often beaten drivers in other better cars so I am not at all surprised with the walloping that max has handed out to his teammates. It's lucky for Hamilton that Mercedes could not get his hands on him when he was in the junior categories.
Verstappen had a car that could challenge for wins and podiums but he would usually have a hard fight and typically was starting from 3rd-5th. Verstappen had plenty of wins before he got a car capable of regularly starting on the front row.   Hell, he had like 3 poles before his first championship contending car and 10 wins. He knows how to win from grid positions other than first.
I love reddit
In Italian it is unless you are female then it is professoressa.
The period goes inside the quotation mark.  Languages also exist other than English.  Good job.
I agree it would be foolish to move to next years car already, I said each team must decide when that development switch is a best fit for them - for some it may be a total focus on this year, others may be lost by the summer break. Your example of Aston Martin is exactly my point, they brought a dramatic update which was the foundation of this seasons car, after having no real stake left in the 2022 championship.
This is exactly my point, agreed 100%. Why give the competition an accurate target to develop towards?
This assumes there are no technical directives or mid season rule changes.
No, but they might copy the parts and upgrades that RB bring to the car.
Yeah I mean the problem for merc and Ferrari is learning to operate at 1/3 capacity (or less). I think merc is a great example here - they were used to taking really agressive development paths and then using their people or $ advantage to make it work.   They tried the same thing these regs and have gotten burned with it, but I think they’ll learn going forward.
Conflating failure of the regulations with Merc and Ferrari flailing is getting real old. Both teams have admitted they didn’t do the job and it’s their problem to fix.   The regulations could never ensure that a team develops a car properly if we’re going to stick with the formula and not spec.  We had something good going last year until Ferrari started exploding then lost all pace after the flex plank change. Merc had ample opportunity to switch course but waited until Bahrain *this year* to commit to a new course. In that time, under the same rules, Aston has trumped the pair of them across 3 races moving from 6th to 2nd.  You give groups the time, resources and money to complete a project, it’s not up to the task master to make sure they all do an identical job.  Edit: thanks for the Reddit help report!
At least it made one point clear: Merc and Ferrari now can't throw a few hundred million to it and miraculously come up with a car that is suddenly better than the rest. The jnitial ideas lock you in your own league and you have to hope you did it right. It sucks at the too, but makes the rest so much more fun to watch. Like how AM is now much better than before
The one team is Red Bull
> didn’t get it right  *looks at average pace difference of their previous car*  Not beating the previous champion car coming from 6th doesn’t meet any reasonable criteria for failure. If the goalpost for success is being the fastest car, 9/10 teams are failures for the majority of F1 seasons.
Aston sure did get it right, their car is literally faster than the RB18. Here are the Bahrain (only 2023 track we've raced in whose layout is the same as 2022) quali times, as an example:  Alonso's fastest Q3 lap in the AMR23 was a 1:30.336  Leclerc's pole lap in 2022 was a 1:30.558  Verstappen's Q3 lap in 2022 was a 1:30.681  while his pole time in 2023 was a 1:29.708  This means that Alonso's lap was over 3 tenths faster than the title-winning RB18. Such development and improvement is definitely nothing to scoff at.  "Being as good as Ferrari last year" is sure an improvement considering they had the 2nd best car while Aston finished 7th in the WCC last year.
>they're barely as good as Ferrari  They are much better than Ferrari
Who's won a race from the back with the **slowest** car?
Yes someone won from the slowest car? What the hell are you saying?   Unless you're extremely lucky and some weird redflag or safety car shenanigans happen you are not winning from the back with anything but one of the fastest cars in the grid.  If you're referring to Perez's Sakhir win back in 2020 with Verstappen out and both Mercedes getting fucked over. At that point Perez did have the fastest car. The second place was Ocon in a Renault. Either way his car was far from the slowest, it was second or third fastest.
Yes and most of the time max was the evidence
You should stop *talking shit" and produce some evidence to what you're talking about.
He means that Max has 10 race wins from before 2021, aka 2016-2020, a period in which Red Bull only had the fastest car in a handful of races. So it's proven that:  1. Max can win in a car that isn't the fastest  2. Max can win from literally anywhere on the grid if the car is the fastest.   All the greats have to prove these two things. Schumacher did it, Alonso did it, Hamilton did it, going back through history you'll see that the very best drivers win in cars that aren't the best, or win from anywhere in cars that are the best. However, starting P20 in the 3rd fastest car is rarely ever gonna result in a win without complete chaos and that's just the way the sport works. If you have a fast car, you only need skill. If you have a slow car, you need to be in the right place at the right time.
Is it though? I still fancy Lewis over Max in that scenario.
And everyone likes to say that as if he's spending his time at the back of the grid.  >but he would usually have a hard fight and typically was starting from 3rd-5th.  The podium was only possible   * if Merc and Ferrari fucked up, * If Redbull were the fastest  He was never fighting anyone apart from Riccardo until 2021. He spent so many years in no mans land.   No one's saying he doesn't have skill but gosh at the worst, he was in the third fastest car, which was first fastest for multiple races during a season
It's "Reddit", not "reddit"…
I apologise. English isn't my first language. Thanks for correcting me.
Then you'd still have to change this year's car.. and no one can start working on a new design for a technical directive that haven't been made yet
Unless your car is running a near identical Aero philosophy, you can't just blindly copy parts from one car to another. And even if you do have a near identical copy, you have to make sure you understand the concept or else it may not work out well in the long run. See pink Mercedes (racing point) turning into the green Mercedes (Aston Martin)
Which is interesting but does make sense because essentially Merc could spend money and flesh out 5 plans and give a deep analysis where as now they might only fully flesh out 3.  But here is the thing all those ideas probably play off each other when it comes to the final build so you loose some potential talking points.  And that is why the salary cap is pretty stupid because in a sport such as this if RB has such a margin there isn't anything you can do which will lead to a period of domination because everyone spending equally only leads to RB essentially maintaining thier margin. Lol those fuckers don't need WT time they are freaking fine and will start updating the heart of the car while the others are just trying to catch the RB from 2 years ago.
People don't like to use their brains and love to call the regs a failure because their favourite team isn't contending for wins or a championship 2 years in a row.   Like as if bridging the infrastructure and expertise gaps should have been done in month 1 of the financial regulations.
Margin for error is part of what makes the regulations a success or failure. Saying "well technically it was possible to succeed" isn't consolation for repeated failures of a team finding a way to succeed. I think it's far too early to determine one way or the other, just pointing out that theory and practice can often times be very different, and the practical outcome is what matters at the end of the day, not the theory.
You do forget to take on consideration that your comparing a car that has been developed for a year with a car at the first rae of the new regulations.  The Aston only finished 7th because the f'd up the start of last season. With a bit better start they would have fought with Alpine/McLaren for 4-6.

No it wasn't
Max always had in all of his victories, at the very least the 3rd best car. And all instances where he won from the back, say p10 or further back, he had the fastest car.   Ayrton Senna in 1994, driving a Toleman (what was the 7th or 8th fastest car), managed 2nd in a race where he **would** win had it not been stopped.
George is already beating Hamilton consistently and max has about 10 times the hunger for winning and the talent of George so you can fancy whatever you want but Max is beating Lewis in the same car. There's a genuine reason why Lewis wanted Valtteri to continue instead of getting George. Even if Mercedes produce a championship winning car, Lewis has to first beat his teammate. George has given enough indications that he's here to win and not to just create a path for Lewis. Given that even Nico gave lewis a run for his money, George winning his first championship is much more likely that lewis winning his eighth.
>He was never fighting anyone apart from Riccardo until 2021. He spent so many years in no mans land.

If he was fastest you would say Red Bull was fastest.   There is a flaw in that logic. How would you know it wasn’t Max that was fast instead of the Red Bull? Take Austria 2018. He easily put Ricciardo on a pitstop in half a race. He won the race with a gap of 1 second against Kimi. No doubt Ferrari was fastest here, but people would just see Max winning and thinking ah Red Bull was fastest here.
Yes it’s painful now, but the idea is over time:  1) merc and Ferrari will learn to be more efficient 2) other teams will also be operating at the cap, so the sport isn’t relying on just 2-3 teams and if one messes up it’s an easy victory.
Too early to judge is exactly what my mentality is. I’m just explaining why Redbull being ahead of their two closest competitors by some margin is not the fault of the regulations. I definitely refrain to say for certain that things will work out ideally for fans.
When doxedfox asked  > do you think someone can win from the back with the slowest car?   and your replied with the first word being 'Yes'. Perhaps you should check your own literacy before challenging others'?
Before calling someone illiterate maybe you should read the comment you replied to   > I mean do you think someone can win from the back with the slowest car?    \- guy you replied to  > Yes, and we have evidence of it happening before.  \- you
Chill out man.
Ayrton Senna in 1984, driving a Toleman (which was normally the 7th or 8th fastest car), managed 2nd in a wet race where all but 3 cars crashed by the time the race was stopped.   Sure he is immensely talented and clearly the greatest ever around Monaco and in the rain, but he wasn't staying ahead of faster cars. It's not an exact comparison here, because in 2023 (at least since 2014) you can't race in conditions like that.   Even then, if you look back at Brazil 2016, a really wet race by modern standards, after a tyre strategy blunder by RB Max was sat in P14 at the race restart in the 3rd fastest car. He proceeded to pass nearly everyone ahead of him including Rosberg in the completely OP W07 to finish 2nd. And most of these were on track overtakes too.   At the end of the day there's always gonna be legends in F1 and those legends are created when a driver outclasses his contemporaries by such a degree that no one ever forgets it. By that standard, Max is among those legends already. As with all great champions before him.
Riiight. You’re comparing Lewis at 38 years of age to a bunch of drivers 13-15 years younger than them?  Lewis in his prime (2007-2020) is beating Max hands down. He nearly beat him in 2021 with an inferior car and when he stared making bad mistakes.  Lewis has proved himself against every obstacle given to him, no doubt in my mind he’d better Max. Even now he would.  Sorry you don’t agree but I guess that’s the beauty of opinions isn’t it!  Also, George is not beating Lewis consistently.
A car is only as fastest as its fastest driver, no the slowest.  Riccardo and both Mercs DNFed in Austria 2018, exactly what I was saying.
Definitely. I think people are writing off the budget cap prematurely--I wouldn't expect it to make much difference to the competitiveness of the big three, since they already had largely comparable budgets. And we shouldn't expect it to have led to first-season competitiveness, since the 2022 regulations were at least largely known before the budget caps and the three big-budget teams got a significant head start.  The big change it promises is there being more than three teams with a realistic shot at the championship. We've already seen AM make a big leap, McLaren seems serious about doing what it takes to become competitive again (even if results so far are quite underwhelming), and even Williams has a credible plan. And Audi seems serious about being a contender, and I doubt they would be entering if that required a $400m budget. The permanent-backmarker crowd that used to comprise 70% of the grid  should be down to Haas and AlphaTauri by 2026, and it's going to be awfully hard for Red Bull to consistently outperform seven other teams that can compete on fairly even terms.

>He proceeded to pass nearly everyone ahead of him including Rosberg in the completely OP W07 to finish 2nd.  Max overtook Rosberg during the beginning of the race - a brilliant overtake around the outside of T3 to take P2. After the strategy blunder dropped him down to P14, he recovered to finish 3rd, behind Hamilton and Rosberg.
Senna was right behind Prost, who was leading the race in the fastest car. Senna didn't finish second just because others crashed, he would get to second regardless because he just outdrove everyone else in that race by a enormous margin.  The 2016 example of Max is not really that great. The gap in performance from his RB to the Mercedes was not nearly as big as the gap from the 1984 Toleman to the fastest car, and it was also a race with lots of retirements. Overall, it was nowhere near as big a feat as the Senna drive from 84, and therefore no, Max is not among those legends. At least not yet.
>	Lewis in his prime (2007-2020) is beating Max hands down. He nearly beat him in 2021 with an inferior car and when he stared making bad mistakes.  xd.  No doubt lewis is a great driver, but to say his car was inferior that year is a reach. Their cars that year was back and forth. Some tracks benefitted merc better than RB and the end of season Ham had the best car for last races, as evident by him winning if not for a certain Masi. Jeddah, Brazil and Abu dhabi all were in mercs hands.
You first object to my comparing younger drivers against lewis and then say that he could still beat them?? Well which is it? Lewis in his prime would have given folks like George and Max a good fight but in order for him to do that now he needs a vastly superior car.   Unless George has continuous reliability and bad luck/timing issues like he had in Melbourne, there is no way Hamilton is beating him this year.  And the reason for that is simple. As you yourself said these drivers are younger. They are in or reaching their prime while lewis is not. So there it is.
No. A Red Bull in 2020 in the hands of Verstappen was quicker than the Racing point of 2020. Doesn’t mean the Red Bull was the faster car, not at all. Verstappen made it seem the faster car.   Obviously when Ricciardo Dnf’d the gap with Verstappen was already there. His dnf flattered him or because otherwise it would have been embarrassing how far off the pace he was compared to his teammate.
Quit back tracking after making shit points
Bruh looks like everyone but you seemed to think you implied something else so maybe be a little accountable?
Lol, Lewis will finish ahead of George this year  Bookmark this please  I’m totally confident.
Well, this just sounds like it will be depressing...

> Paul arrives at Williams Racing after more than five years at UFC as Senior Vice President, Global Partnerships, where he was responsible for commercialising all revenue streams.  Woah
Looks like Williams are back on the ascension
Another big signing for Williams.  I know we really have no idea how this guy will perform, but where is Vowles finding the money to poach these lifelong executives from major companies?   Dorilton either must absolutely love Vowles or just see F1s projected growth so massive to justify this.
Brazil 2024: "Alex Albon was running on P1 before a crash with Lewis Hamilton ended the Williams miracle. Now in the podium Lewis seems quite happy... Wait a second is that Albon on a thong and MMA gloves running towards Lewis!?".
Sounds like Zak will have a run for his money in getting the sponsors in!
Perhaps a bit of both. Also maybe James has a personal association with him that might have been used to attract him to the team. Maybe James perhaps sold him on the idea of a new challenge for Paul.
Just a question, who is Dorilton and how do they make that money and can invest in the team more money than it brings? It’s incredible that Williams found Dorilton, because I think anyone else would have the money and patience
*Brought to you by Modelo, brewed for those with a fighting spirit.*
It’s believed Dorilton is a fund owned by a Hong Kong billionaire Calvin Lo, and the money is made by the teams value raising.    This is done by the natural price increases were seeing (F1 is becoming magnitudes more expensive) and by them raising up the F1 ladder.  Being higher up means more time being talked about, better sponsorship opportunities, more air time, more fans, more merch, etc
Private equity fund, the money and patience is because Williams is a valuable brand name in a rising sport and they believe they can extract value from that.

They’ve somehow moved backwards with more money YOY. How Alfa Romeo is that?!
Confused Bottas Face… =  Also…  Happy Bottas Face… =  Also…  Angry Bottas Face… =
Was bottas just off the pace in Jeddah & Australia or were there external issues at play🤔
This car won't be competitive until Audi takes over. They have the shortest wheelbase on the grid so they're always going to struggle in the straights. They have the most complex floor on the grid, which I think may be flummoxing them. Their main benefit at the beginning of '22 (being the lightest car) has been negated as other teams have shed weight.   Oh and they're using a Ferrari PU that's a ticking time bomb.
I don't think Valtteri will make it to Audi.
I'm still waiting for them to challenge Mercedes as they said they would after the tests...
Yeah, I don't think he will have that seat for much longer if Zhou performs like that.
Worried Bottas is starting to go the way of Riccardo, more concerned about his personal "brand" and being an influencer then about racing itself. Hopefully I'm wrong and his performance improves in the remaining races, can't help but like the guy haha.
Probably focused more on his butt ass and being a bogan than actual racing
I don't want the Alfa name to be gone next year :(
Eh, could’ve said the same about AM this time last year - sometimes the gains take time. I’ll give it till the summer break and then dunk on them
They're sadly pretty much on the same trajectory as the second half of last year, if you count Bahrain as an outlier. Hopefully I'm wrong and they get their act together, otherwise it's going to be hard to get any points with how competitive the other teams are.
Dont hate me but clearly something happened during the 2nd half of last year. And i dont mean the car performance, yes, competitors caught up but Bottas has dropped off massively.  I have a feeling that neither driver is anywhere close to getting the most out of that car. I dont have the impression that the Haas for example is much faster, its just that Nico and Kmag manage to get more out of their car. The midfield is so close this year, the driver gaps are more important than the car gaps imo. Its probably no coincidence that nico and lando were fighting for p8/p9 in australia since theyre two of the more talented drivers in the midfield.
They’re just a mini Ferrari
In Jeddah he had floor damage after running over the Mclaren’s wing. And apparently he had deployment issue at the beginning of the last race. Check out the comment thread from u/Cold_Machine9205 yesterday and the overtake video that was posted   https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/12cd6ki/australian_gp_media_driver_ratings/jf1f6ce/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&utm_content=1&utm_term=15&context=3
I belive he picked up some damage in Saudi, but freakin' hell, he shouldn't be losing to someone who was considered a Mazepin/Latifi when joining F1 and still isn't rated very highly... At this point I'm starting to wonder - is Bottas just shit, is Zhou actually pretty damn quick, or maybe the Alfa just doesn't suit Bottas' driving style at all/he struggles to find the right set-up?
Thank you for articulating why the car sucks so bad. So sad for Bottas and my boy Zhou.
>This car won't be competitive until Audi takes over  Why does everybody seem to think Audi will magically make Sauber fast? I don't know, but isn't Audi just a title sponsor and an engine supplier? So far I'm predicting Sauber to be the biggest flop of 2026, it seems the expectations are over the roof...
I honestly wonder what happens for next year. You can see my bias is my flair, but Zhou is doing a really good job and they've got Theo waiting in the wings... Is this the end of Bottas?
Let's go one step further. His contract could be bought out and kicked out before it's up at the end of 2025 (pretty hot take)
They never mentioned the basis on which they were gonna challenge Mercedes. Maybe it was the number of engine failures which is something Bottas excels at.
Last 2 races he had floor damage and energy deployment issues
Who could have guessed that merc knew what they were doing when they were strict with him. Bottas would be a great driver for a midfield team in his peak shape, but unlike a Max or a Fernando he seems to need a "Toto" to put some pressure to him in order to perform.  He should have learnt a bit from Lewis about managing to fit both his social part, but still maintain his peak in the racing aspect
But Alfa doesn’t have a B spec or any huge upgrades, this new front wing was the upgrade and it might’ve failed lmao  Mclaren is in the situation AM was because they actually switched concept, Alfa is just bad right now
> someone who was considered a Mazepin/Latifi when joining F1    Zhou scored point in his first race. Are you still living in 2021?
I love Zhou, he deserves better. That being said, he's driving the hell out of the car and extracting more out of it than Bottas has.
A lot of people are expecting Audi to have some rocketship engine ready for 2026, since they more or less had direct influence on the regulations changes.   Similar thing happened with Mercedes and the hybrid V6T engine back in 2014, they had like 2 years worth of head start in the engine department and their engine was unmatched until at least 2017.
Audi have 3 years to work on their PU and car, if they can't get that shit right, they've got bigger problems
He's had both floor damage and electrical issues the last 2 races. I'm not saying he's suddenly gonna turn back into the qualy merchant but the start of this season is completely unrepresentative of his pace.
Was = the past  Now read my comment again
True Zhou scored 1 point in his first race but it was just p10. Still a good result but he needed BOTH RB’s to DNF to get that. Its all part of the game but that race isn’t some otherworldly performance.  I do agree that Zhou is quick & has been faster than Valtteri after Canada 2022 multiple but he hasn’t been quick at the right times when Alfa was a good car or done anything amazing like Bottas has with his lap 1 heroics at Bahrain 2023
Zhou is doing everything he can to keep that seat even if Pourchaire wins F2 and that's all that counts to him. If he can match Bottas and show improvement, Sauber have no reason to get rid of him.
I wouldn't say he's getting more out of it than Bottas. Bottas got 4 points in the first race, when Leclerc was the only top team DNF. Then, week 2, Bottas suffered from debris after the Gasly/Piastri collision. This past week something was wrong, yeah, but Zhou got 2 points in a race with 8 DNFs. It wasn't exactly difficult scooping up points. I'm not saying it wasn't impressive- I wish Zhou the best. It's only his second year. It's also worth noting that he got fastest lap in the first race on team orders, and he maybe would have finished about 13th instead of 16th in that race if he hadn't. I'm just saying that I don't think it's fair to say he's having a better first three races than Bottas.
Eh, it’s his second season, he’s still in the shitbox phase of his career
I wouldn't go crazy, he didn't extract much out of a car with significant issues and damage, nobody could
Bottas had a great race in Bahrain and a very unlucky one in Saudi Arabia, but it is notable that Zhou has outqualified him at the last two circuits and even in Bahrain was only three hundredths behind Bottas for qualifying.   Qualifying is generally considered as arguably Bottas’ biggest strength as he was often really close to Hamilton at Mercedes. So it is understandable that people are wondering why the qualifying gap so far is that close or even slightly in favor of Zhou.   Personally I don’t buy the theory that Bottas is losing motivation in the car. The team has an exciting future with Audi supplying engines in 2026 so that’s plenty of motivation to try and do well to still stick around by then.   I think it’s more likely that Zhou has been able to put in the work and improve his qualifying pace like in the second half of last season when he was getting close to Bottas, and on top of that I suspect the characteristics of the Alfa Romeo might better suit Zhou’s driving style than Bottas’. Like Hamilton has mentioned how he feels the current Mercedes lacks stability to give him 100% confidence like it used to be, and I can imagine it being a similar case for Bottas where Alfa Romeo’s car is an even bigger step down in performance from what he was used to driving before at Mercedes.
Is that why he keeps out-qualifying him too?
No that's just cause he was faster or Bottas hit traffic, or he's faster, significantly

It's insane he wasn't penalised for it.
My buddy and I watched that restart at least 15 times. When we finally noticed Sargent come flying in at the end and rear ended De Vries out of nowhere, we lost it. And watched it another dozen times.
Wonder why AT didn’t lodge a review of the incident? If Sainz was given the penalty then surely Logan would’ve received one too?
Another example of where the only incidents that matter to the FIA are ones at the front. I doubt the FIA would have treated Hamilton outbraking himself and taking out Verstappen in a similar manner.
He should have at a minimum been called into the stewards, you can't just go knocking people out of the race and not get call in.
He should have been penalised since Sainz was too.
Did anyone ever hear the in-car audio of him shitting on the car throughout the race?
While I think the Sainz penalty is completely fair and should have happened, the fact that Sargeant and even more shockingly Gasly got away without punishment is just wrong.   All three should have been. Sainz can definitely feel like he's been hard done by.
If I remember correctly, Albon got a 3 place grid penalty last year for driving into Stroll or pushing him off track (I think?) in Jeddah to be served in Australia. I just do not understand how Sargeant got away with not getting a penalty, or at the least investigated...
I had an accident where I drove into the back of an SUV last year. Should have said "That was pretty weird" to the other driver eh
Man this is so different from the usual 'he pushed me off the track, he didn't give me room, it's 100% someone else's fault and I'm entirely blameless' nonsense we usually see at the front. So refreshing
If Sainz was given a 5 sec penalty, this should also be penalized.
Weird? What’s so weird about soft tires not having any grip on a tire that’s 65c? Not my words! Source: future gp winner lando norris. 😬
I’d argue that he didn’t get one then, because they would have to give gasly one too and their too scared to follow through on their on penalty points system.
I am so glad that the start of this season has proven to me exactly what I thought.  Sargent shouldn't be in F1, he had 1 year in F3 where he was with Piastri in a tight championship, but was arguably a pretty average year for Piastri compared to how he walked into F2 and obliterated them all.  Zhou has slowly warmed up to it and has surprised me, but Sargent is a Mazepin 2.0, whilst he isn't spinning, he has no page and makes massive errors consistently. His attempts at quali so far have been very, very poor.
Not just avoiding a penalty, the stewards didn’t even investigate it.
Meanwhile Sainz was penalized for something that "technically" didn't happen because Alonso was given his position back.
T1 incident. Sainz shouldn't have been penalised either
What got me was the marshall behind the barrier just shrugging as Sargeant came to a stop in the gravel.
Lodging a review means they’d have to bring new evidence. I doubt AT would be able to meet that threshold
Probably hard to convince the stewards, also it's AlphaTauri. I don't trust them to be proactive and protect their drivers.
If Logan gets a penalty that would not move De Vries up into the points, so why bother.
That’s my question too. Can they appeal a non-penalty? I guess the regulation has stated the time period they can do it but it is so clear that I would lodge the review immediately after the accident. I don’t think cold tyres or lock up could be any valid excuses as other drivers braked properly.
Why pick a fight with another team when it would get you absolutely nothing?
[removed]
[Joylon Palmer raised the same thing in his review of the red flags. ](https://youtu.be/YPDNuxwD8-M)   No idea how he got away with it other than stewards missing it and no team calling it out.    As an aside, from Joylons video Sainz 100% deserved his penalty, if you compare it to the same thing that happened to him at COTA last year.    Was a super messy restart.
No.  But now I want to pull up his camera view on F1TV and watch again lol.
>My buddy and I watched that restart at least 15 times. When we finally noticed Sargent come flying in at the end and rear ended De Vries out of nowhere, we lost it. And watched it another dozen times.  I heard the commentators mention it but nowhere have I seen any clips surface at all, I'm dying to hear that radio lol
https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cqs7USWIy7B/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y= I don't know if you've seen it but James Vowles gives a nice explainer on the technical reasons why he spun out, part user error, part OP engine modes
I think you've worded that wrong. The tyre was 65c not the track.
you're talking about a rookie in their 3rd race in F1... of course, Sargeant isnt the next Verstappen but give him the benefit of the doubt and time atleast.
Feels overly critical. IMO he's looked like... a rookie, but not an outright bad one like Latifi or Mazepin.
Bahrain qualifying: P16 (Albon P15). Bahrain race: P12 (Albon P10). Worthwhile note: Almost made it to Q2, but set the exact same time as Norris later.  Jeddah qualifying: P20 (Albon P17). Jeddah race: P16 (Albon DNF). Note: set time fast enough to reach Q2 but was deleted due to pit lane line.   Australia qualifying: P18 (Albon P8). Australia race: DNF for both.  Australia is the only one so far where he’s had a real stinker and showed no pace. The other 2 races have had errors made by him, but he still showed that he has potential. He’s a rookie, and will only learn from those mistakes.  Mazepin was always miles off Mick, even with the fact that they were P19 and P20 guaranteed. Most of the time Mick would be running his own race, too far behind from everyone else but too far ahead of Mazepin.
You being glad that he isn't doing well sounds malicious. Sounds like you don't want him to do well this way.
That sounds overly harsh to me. Imo he's looked like a decent rookie so far.
What a take. Do you actually watch F1?
>Sargent  Who?  Why are you called Twatman btw?
You can’t even spell his name right bro, your take is already invalid.
It technically happened, the FIA doesn't have the power to erase reality or travel back in time. What you want to say is that it didn't have an effect since it wasn't acknowledged in the official results - but that is irrelevant. You penalize the actions, not the consequences.
“FIA does not consider the result of the action for their penalties”  My ass.
I mean it caused a lot of damaged cars. Gasly doesnt crash into ocon if he doesnt go in the grass to dodge the wreck.
Uh it did happen, are you blind.
I mean, just because there's more lenience on T1/lap 1 incidents, doesn't mean that you can get away with everything.  Sainz was behind Alonso, had plenty of space, while Alonso was already on the edge of the track, boxed in between Sainz, gravel and Hamilton's gearbox. Alonso had nowhere to go, Sainz had plenty of space, and again, he was NOT ahead of Alonso, so he was not entitled to his line in any shape or form.   It's a slam dunk penalty - Sainz had only himself to blame for an overambitious clumsy move.   Also, just because its T1, incidents tend to get investigated regardless - Sargaent knocking off De Vries definitely should have been looked at.
It wasn’t even investigated. Plus Sargeant was at the back. There was no scrummage around him. He just braked too late and ended both their race. For me that’s a penalty even if it’s lap 1.
At the very least it should have been looked into. And imo, should have been a penalty as well. It’s the same as the Bottas bowling in some way. Missed the breaking point  As for Sainz one, I would have to disagree on that one.
Hungary 2021 was also a lap 1 incident and there we even had rain as a mitigating factor, yet Bottas and Stroll got a penalty. Sargeant deserved a penalty here
Nah, when you lock up and smash someone off like that you have no excuse. If it's tight battling I could understand the T1 excuse but it wasn't.
Russell hits sainz T1: “the penalty isn’t harsh enough”  Sainzs hits Alonso T1: “it’s the most unfair penalty ever”
Sainz fully deserved to get penalized.  If he didnt deserve to be penalized, then Russell shouldn’t have been penalized last year in USA.  Or Raikkonen in Britain 2018.  Or Leclerc in Sakhir 2020.  Or Vettel in France 2018.   Or Verstappen Hungary 2017.
Sainz himself said the penalty wasn't harsh enough... When it isn't being applied on him (i.e. US GP when Russell torpedoed him)
It was so much worse than Sainz lmao
Both should have been penalized.
Wrong but ok
T1?  What race were you watching, lol
It was glorious
"Our car is in the gravel now" seems pretty good evidence when they handed out a penalty for Sainz causing more minor contact in the exact same corner.
> also it's AlphaTauri.  my point of view also. they're like the opposite of competitive.
Considering the AT is so slow, especially in the hands of De Vries, Logan getting a grid penalty next race might actually help them.
Because it’s not about the outcome. It should never be about the outcome, just the incident in and of itself. Sargeant should have gotten a penalty that resulted in a grid drop for the next event since he DNF’d as a result of this incident.
Someone didn’t watch the 2021 season very closely
Gasly not getting a penalty either is annoying, Seb got a 5 second penalty for rejoining unsafely in Canada and he didn't even knock Lewis out of the race. There just is no consistency in the applying of penalties.
This channel uploades full radio's with track position of all the drivers from every race and quali. It's quite good, but they haven't made it to Sargeant in Australia yet.  https://youtube.com/@InsideTheCockpit
Nothing has surfaced. Probably Ted doing his usual shit stirring and made a big deal out of Sargeant making two comments
I've watched him for 3 years already, so he's not just a rookie to me. He's been a rival to both the Aussies I support and was very surprised when he was promoted this year. I don't think he deserved it and I don't want him to succeed as it.means Jack Doohan is more likely to get a spot next year.  I'm allowed to want a driver to not do well? That's how sports work.
Jeddah quali was him making consistent mistakes to put himself 20th.
Yeah and I'd say a lot more than you. I also have watched every one of his f2/f3 races.
Dude my phone autocorrecting his name when I type it does chance the validity of my opinion. People are allowed to dislike other drivers. I'm allowed to get down voted for it because others disagree, but my take isn't invalid. It's just a different view to yours.
The Matt Gallagher effect
> the FIA doesn't have the power to erase reality  I mean, this is a misunderstanding of sports on your part.  There is no reality, it's a performance. They literally have the power to choose how the events are recorded, said record being the only relevant fact about 'what really happened or not'.  This is like asking what *really* happened to the pawns in a chess match, or what *really* happened in a DnD session.  The answer is either, "What we decided is canon happened", or, "A bunch of folks sat down to engage in imaginative play together."  The race isn't real. It's a game.
"technically".
I feel like the FIA at least has the power to tip-ex out reality....
Gastly was in the grass on his own and before Sainz and Alonso made contact. Should go watch that again. He almost did the same thing as Sainz but avoided Alonso and went off track.
None of them would have crashed, probably, had they not restarted a grid with half the cars lining up off the racing line among an entire race worth of marbles.  Restarting the race like that was a recipe for disaster. None of the drivers lining up on that side of the track would have had amazing control of their cars, and they wouldn't find out about it until they dangerously understeered into cars, or were unable to brake effectively, a few seconds later.
I think the outcome of the punishment is harsh. Going from P4 to the back of the grid for 1st lap incident even if it was a mistake seems unfair. In most circumstances, a 5s penalty might lead to a 1 or 2 place drop but this 5s penalty was like a DSQ.
Glad you're not a steward then
I think he means it’s inconsistent.
yeah, they were very similar crashes and the same penalty. I'd say there was more traffic/chaos australia on account of the sun and the two lap scramble, along with the fact that the consequences of the penalty were very different, makes them feel different overall, but looking just at the cars, it was basically the same crash.
I never seen AlphaTauri coming up for it's drivers in terms of FIA politics.
You’re surprised Williams promoted their academy driver who met their criteria for getting an F1 seat? lol
You don't choose the definition of rookie lol
A lot of people here, my self included, have been watching these younger drivers for years. That doesn’t change anything. Doohan didn’t even finish ahead of Sargeant in the championship last year. Not to mention Doohan also took Crawford out in the feature race without penalty…
Ok? He’s still a rookie. That’s like me saying “Piastri shouldn’t be in F1, he messed up his front wing and ruined his own race” after Jeddah.  The fact that Sargeant has been within striking distance of Albon is impressive. You don’t need to put one rookie down just to big up your guy.  Especially when your guy hasn’t exactly been a perfect angel himself. Forgetting how in Bahrain Piastri qualified P18 while Norris got P11? Imagine if I said “knew he shouldn’t have ever got to F1” after seeing that horrendous debut.   Give it time man, the season is long. Piastri/Sargeant are still rookies. They’re going to make mistakes. I doubt we’ve seen the worst of it yet.
You think after watching every one of his races you’d actually be able to spell his name correctly.
In that case it seems you don’t like him because he’s American? Idk, just weird that you seem so glad to see it.
Ohh, I’m sorry. I thought you were doing it on purpose.
But thats what everyone said after Silverstone 2021 and I consider that true. Like, I don't care if its Bottas locking up into Norris in Hungary while fighting for P3 or Sargeant locking up into De Vries in Australia while fighting for P15, if you make a mistake and take somebody out, you should be penalized for the same mistake the same way.
Ehm no. It doesn't work like that, period.
> technically: considered so by a strict interpretation of the rules.  Your use doesn't adjust to this definition. The rules in F1 don't say that this situation has not occurred, or is to be ignored. It just says that the grid position cannot be determined from that scenario, so a previous one must be used. They are not meant to pretend it didn't happen at all. From the rules' POV, the restart at lap 56 was part of the race. But I go further - the fact that you can still investigate incidents and apply penalties for events that happened during that lap proves that the rules acknowledge that lap as part of the race.  The word you wanted to say was "in practice" (which is the opposite of "technically") - "in practice, the second restart did not happen, since the positions were reverted". But even then I'd argue you'd still be wrong since cars that DNF'd and the FIA investigating incidents during that lap means that, in practice, it very much happened, too. It had a real impact in the final ranking.
Should’ve been a grid penalty instead. Anything over 2s penalty was straight to the back
Do you think Bottas shouldn't have gotten a penalty for Hungary 2021? Because that situation is really not too different from this one.
With this logic a driver could just take out the whole field at turn one and get away Scott free because it's a T1 incident. What are you even saying
Dude it’s as clear cut a penalty as you can get… he outbraked himself and rear ended another car. If anything it’s worse than Sainz
And I don't think Doohan deserved his chance this year either.  He clearly still has work to do as he lost a lot of points last year going for far too much, France comes to mind. Though I think we can all admit he got the unluckiest hit of the year in Zandvoort when he was second and go rear ended cause people thought the leader had gone post safety car.  I thought Doohan and Sargent were on the same level last year and both looked a level below what was required.  Doohan looks to have a terrible team this year and then has compounded that with poor driving and bad luck in quali the past weekend. Have been very disappointed.  Sargent is only beaten out by Mazepin and maybe Latifi for poorest start to a career in recent memory.
I don't think he's been within "striking distance' of Albon. Personally I think he's been the worst driver on the grid by a mile and I hope it stays that way.
And a lot of people misspell Ricciardo all the time. I got it wrong for years, doesn't change anything. My phone also autocorrected the word Sargeant to Sargent and I didn't realise. Doesn't change anything about my opinion and is a weird point to bring up.
Nothing to do with him being American, I just genuinely don't think he deserves an F1 drive and am glad to see him doing poorly.
Everyone said "The Matt Gallagher Effect" after Silverstone 21'?
Except for the fact that it very literally does.  Sports are improv shows. It'll all make a lot more sense and be easier to enjoy once you understand that it's theater, not war.
Bottas bowling becomes a legitimate strategy
What a strange and sad way to view the sport. If you need to let your hatred out, do it in a less miserable way.  Your bias is literally blinding you if you think he’s been the worst driver on the grid by a mile. De Vries is clearly that driver, not Sargeant.
Ahh, I thought intentional my b.
No, everyone said "You penalize the actions, not the consequences."
De Vries is down there as well, but I'd say Sargent has been worse overall. There is a very large gap from there.  What is so wrong about disliking a driver? I want him to do badly? So? It's a pretty common place thing in most sports to want another team to do badly.  After following his F2/3 career I don't think he deserves an F1 drive and the sooner he's out of the sport the better imo.
Idk why you put that on my post, I was just saying everyone only started repeating "how can you be penalized for a lap that didn't happen" after Matt from the P1 YT channel said it right after the race, which is an obviously incorrect statement.
It’s a weird thing to hate on another driver for no reason, this isn’t like other sports. Sargeant has done nothing wrong to merit someone to outright hope for his downfall.   I’d understand if this was his 3rd season and he was using daddy’s money to buy the team while being lapped by Verstappen (i.e. Mazepin or Latifi).  Sargeant’s junior career was hardly the worst case to ever be in F1. It’s funny, in your original comment you praise Zhou yet Zhou had an even worse case than Sargeant to be in F1. Zhou finished behind the likes of Mick (out of F1), Mazepin (out of F1), and Tsunoda (had calls to be out of F1, but now has De Vries to inflate his standing/performance).  It more seems like your irrational feelings towards Sargeant are fueled by an insecurity that began in the very same junior series you were watching. You seen how closely matched he was to Piastri before his funding was pulled and that’s why you want him to fail so badly.
The thing with Sargeant is that while he has been making rookie mistakes, at least he shown he has that raw speed. Verstappen when he was a teenager had raw speed but made so many rookie mistakes, however he's grown and improved his race craft, and now arguably the best driver on the grid. With De Vries he's just slow, he got out qualified by Tsunoda despite having the new floor while Yuki didn't, and look to be absolutely nowhere near his teammate.
Ah, I missunderstood you then. I thought you said about "The Matt Gallagher Effect" because he often uses the "You penalize the actions, not the consequences" phrase. Yeah, Matt said that during their Twitch stream as well I belive, but corrected himself in one of the podcasts (?), I might be wrong here.

2012 and it’s not even close.  Don’t get me wrong, 2021 was great, but in a different way because of the tension and drama. 2012 has a lot more close races and a *lot* more contenders for wins.  2010 was fun too, but it was mostly close because of reliability and so much mistakes from almost everybody, for me it pales in comparison to 2012 mostly because a lot less races were genuinely great to watch.  Best race ever: European GP 2012 for me, with Canada 2011 a close second
Canada 2011 best race, 2012 best season. Spain 2013 close second with the strategy.
My go-to seasons would be 2010 and 2012. As for the race, it would be Germany 2019.  But this is me just being a homer
The problem that I feel like these older broadcasts tended to suffer a lot from is that they left the spectator with a serious lack of information. Often times the camera would suddenly swap to a driver standing next to the barriers, Murray would shout something like: “Oh that’s Panis! He’s out of the race.” And we would immediately move on. Have no clue what had happened, etc. Now whilst there’s a certain charm to be found in that I feel like todays broadcasting allows the viewer to develop a much better picture of what’s actually happening in a race. It’s easier to engage with the content so to say, rather than just consuming it back in the day. I’m sure 2021 as a whole wouldn’t have felt half as special if we didn’t have access to all that we currently have. “No, Michael, no!” or “Lapped cars 4-14-6-18 may now overtake” would’ve never happened and nobody would’ve batted an eye. And that’s just in the space of about 5 minutes in a single race. I too have a hard time not to see Michael or Ayrtons races through rose tinted glasses but I can’t help but feel that todays stuff is a cut above.
2012 best season 2011 Canada best race
2012 on all fronts
I've been watching the 2013 season recently and while the championship itself that year was one sided, the 2010-13 regs were better for racing than anything we've seen since. Multiple stop strategies were the norm and Red Bull, Ferrari, Mercedes and Lotus could fight each other for podiums every week. Even in the races where Vettel goes off into the distance there's normally some sort of battle going on behind
Best season for me is either 1984, '85 or '86.  Just in general the late 70s to mid 80s is my favourite era of F1, but each of these three has something special to offer IMO.  '84 you have an extremely tight but respectful title fight between two drivers with very different approaches and outlooks, as well as a number of other stories such as the debut of a certain young Brazilian, Alboreto entrenching himself as Ferrari #1, Piquet's record-matching run of pole positions in the lightning quick but extremely unreliable Brabham, Tyrrell's DSQ, Rosberg dragging a crap Williams to a win, and De Angelis staying in title contention for far longer than he had any right to through sheer consistency.  '85 you've got a season where legitimately 4 teams had cars capable of winning the title if given a bit of luck, and fantastic racing as a result. You get to see Senna in race-win capable equipment for the first time, Alboreto leading Ferrari's best charge of the 80s, Rosberg leading Williams' resurgence after a few off years, and Prost really blossom into the cool, calculating master that we know him as after a year learning from Lauda   And then '86 has an incredible 3 way title fight between the mighty Williams FW11s of Mansell and Piquet, and Prost putting in IMO the greatest season long performance of all time in the inferior McLaren to win the title. All this in lairy high power turbos which in quali trim are still unsurpassed for power.
Commentary - has to be Murray Walker, simply the single best sports commentator I have ever heard, added such genuine passion and excitement to every moment.  Broadcast Graphics - probably the current ones are the most informative, but I have a sweetspot for the yellow and black mid nineties graphics.  Best Season for racing - Hard to argue with 2012 for having so many different drivers in different cars genuinely competitive.  Sportsmanship - Has to be 1958 when Stirling Moss lost the title by arguing his title rival should NOT be excluded from a race.  Favourite race of all time - Either 1998 Belgian GP or 1996 Monaco just for pure craziness and unpredictability.  &#x200B;  Side point - I totally despise the Visor cam and Drone cam of the modern footage, these cameras don't make the action easier to see and understand and detract from the presentation.
I honestly think 2019 was an amazing season for racing, the only issue was the championship battle was awful. The individual races from Austria onwards were great.
I think that the absolute peak of motor racing was probably 1957-61. Obviously it was far harder to watch than racing of today, but almost every race during that period was extremely exciting, helped by the fact that the dominant driver, Stirling Moss, insisted on driving British cars even when they weren't the most competitive and so pulled off many extraordinary victories. Of these, 1958 was perhaps the greatest season of all, with the Ferrari vs Vanwall title fight and every race being a classic. But it also had the charm of being a less professional series and not being about the money, but instead the joy of racing. Read the Denis Jenkinson reports on Motorsport Magazine archives to get the full picture of what a brilliant era this was. For a more extended period, 1966-86 was probably the longest golden era of Formula 1.  1976 is also a classic season, with the film Rush a good way to get an understanding of this. I also think 1981 was one of the best seasons ever, and this entire season is available to watch on F1TV. Of recent seasons, 2021 was extraordinary and perhaps the best season ever, although there was a bit too much controversy.  In terms of best races ever, I would suggest the following list in terms of Formula 1:  Reims 1953, Nurburgring 1957, Silverstone 1965, Monza 1971, Dijon 1979, Jarama 1981, Monaco 1982, Adelaide 1986, Interlagos 2008, Canada 2011, Malaysia 2012, Hungary 2021.  There were also plenty of pre-war classics such as Nurburgring 1935.
Best race is probably Belgium 1998 for me. The only recent race that would be similar in chaos was Saudi 2021. But Belgium has far more, the start, Schumacher plowing DC, pitlane fight, Mika being punted off, team orders, Jordan 1-2. Incredible.
Best season was 08. Pure drama and two different cars that were very close almost every race leading to an incredible duel.
2012 season, and my favourite race has to be 2019 Hockenheim!
For the (very) recent modern era, we were spoilt with 2021 for just racing and action as well as the title fight. The FIA did screw up a lot, but camera coverage excluding monaco is excellent. Plenty of teams got podiums - the top 2 as well as McLaren, Ferrari, Alpine, Aston Martin, AlphaTauri, and if you count the belgium farce (again FIA screwing up) then Williams. That’s literally every team bar 2.   I think crofty gets too much shtick for his commentary. I don’t think he’s as biased as people say, or at least tries to restrain it, but he generates a LOT of hype and excitement.   2012 was also exciting, like 7 different winners in a row. Probably better than 2021, but I have short term bias
Best race: 2013 Germany, 2005 Suzuka, or 2012 Brazil, I’m having a tough time choosing between those 3. Best season: 2012 hands down.
People on here said 2012 was good and I have absolutely no complaints about that. Watched the whole season at the start of this year and everything was good. Cars, close battles, 7 different winners in the first races, good tracks and Brazil was great.
I feel the best F1 seasons were 1999 and 2000. So many memorable races, lots of drama ánd good races.  Best race is difficult to say. I enjoy good entertainment, like Belgium 1998, European 1999, Malaysia 2001, Austria 2001 or Brazil 2003, but the many errors/rains/other chaos made these races fun, not good racing.
2020 is underrated imo, lot of incredible results
Of the (relatively) recent series, I like 1997, 2003 and 2012 because they were very open and had close championship battles.  There are also older seasons like this but the broadcasting quality drops off or is even non-existent, in English at least.
All the years from 2005 to 2013 are golden in my book.  Alonso displacing the Schumacher dynasty in 05 & 06.  2007: Raikkonen's 1st championship in a battle that went down to the wire with Alonso and rookie Hamilton.   2008 Kubica's first win and Lewis clinching the title at the last corner on the last lap of the last race of the year in Brazil.  2009: The Brawn GP story, and the perennially underrated Jenson Button cleaning house.  2010: Vettel comes of age to become the youngest ever WDC.  2011: Vettel doing the double, with that titanic Button vs Vettel battle in the wet at Canada 2011.  2012: The best season ever, with a 6-way title fight that went the whole year and was again settled at Interlagos.  2013: Vettel's history making 4th title.
Brazil 2019 is my personal favorite ever race. A combination of good racing and strategy, carnage, and some really fantastic commentary imo. I generally do agree with one of the other comments that the individual races in 2019 are underrated because the championship battle was nonexistent.  In terms of seasons, 2012 and 2021 seem to generally be considered the best "modern" seasons. I personally prefer 2021 because I like the more consistent narrative thread and drama of the direct head to head that lasted the whole season from beginning to end, but both are amazing.
I think the best race imo is Turkey 2020 for the following reasons   1. Hamilton showed how he is different gravy compared to Bottas who spinned like 7 times IIRC while Lewis was SUBLIME en route to clinching his 7th WDC. Shame there was no crowd imo  2. It was a return to Istanbul which has a lovely layout imo kind of a shame we never got a dry race in 2020 or 2021  3. It was a good weekend in general seeing Stroll get pole was nice.  Best season is 2021 & its not even close imo  1. Pure drama & carnage especially from Silverstone 21 onwards. Certain races like Silverstone, Hungary, Sochi, Brazil & Jeddah were so intense & even felt like warzones lol🤠  2. There was always some special circumstances that made qualifying or the races special weather it be crashes, rain or grid penalties. The only boring weekends were Portimao, Monaco, Austrias, Spa & Mexico. Even though these weekends were forgettable they still had some nice moments.  3. Actual CHAMPIONSHIP FIGHT & debate on who was faster. The tension was palpable. Mercedes made a huge step with their Silverstone 21 upgrade but the margins were a lot closer at tracks that in theory were supposed to “Suit Mercedes” Spa, Monza, & COTA come to mind. Equally Mercedes were in a league of their own at circuits thought to favor Red Bull like Turkey & Brazil  Even to this day I believe you can make a valid case as to whether Red Bull or Mercedes is faster, they both stole wins at circuits that in theory favored the other side
Hate to say it, but F1 has always had problems with rules take 1998 British GP. Schumacher gets a 10 second stop go penalty for passing Alex Wurz behind the safety car. He takes it on the last lap and since he crosses the start finish line in the pits before he makes it to his pit box to serve his penalty, he won the race 🤔  As for best seasons I would say 2010, four drivers being able to possibly win the championship at the last race what more can a fan ask for.  As for race I think Sebs first win is amazing, just a beautiful drive and the commentators really don't think he will win, but it slowly dawns on them, it quite funny to listen to.

I don't know why, I've been loving Singapore 2008 lately.
1997, 99 or 08 for best season.   Canada 2011, Suzuka 05 or European GP 99 for best race.   It's sad to see so many people say 2012. Whilst the season was entertaining it was literally ALL about tyre saving. A season where every race drivers were never getting near the limit, driving sometimes 5 or 6 seconds off the pace conserving tyres can't be the best season for me. No matter how much doubt there was about the winner of each race.
1998 and Spa
An ofter overlooked race is the 1995 European GP (Nurburgring)  You have a wet/inter track, Jean Alesi "on fire", Michael schumacher in his best non-Ferrari form and the two Williams trying to keep the championship alive with some ballsy race. It's one of the best "old school" race, often overlooked thanks to a perceived "easy" championship for Michael.
2007 & 2012 for me
[Suzuka 2005](https://youtu.be/FGINdQGaVh0)  Last year of the V10s, things were screaming, and Alonso on the outside of Schumi into 130R.
Over the off season I watch most of 2002 - 2021.  The best season for me was 2008 as it was remarkably open for the first half 4 folk in contention and it came down to the last corner of the last race.  Best race - Canada 2011, just for the laughs of counting how many times Button went through the pits.  And won the race. Senna at Donnington '93 was a brilliant demonstration in the wet, this was hilarious, Button crashed with Lewis and Fernando, had a drive through for speeding under safety, punctures, held every possible place in the race from last to first and passed for the lead on the last lap.
You had 3-4 teams that had a chance of winning races on any given weekend, which is amazing. I found it a great introduction to the sport, personally.
Yeah. 2021 races were nowhere near as interesting as people make them out to be. People forget how boring they were because the title went to the last race and we had multiple teams involved. 2012 also had far more last race drama before the final lap.
2012 was insane. 7 different race winners in the first 7 races. the season was so good in general. paired with that final in brazil.  would get my vote aswell for best season (at least from the ones i personally watched properly)
Germany and Brazil 2019 were both chaotic races in the best way possible
I'm right onboard with you on 2012.
Lmao I heard Murray clear as day with the Panis quote
This is exactly why it occurred to me. We're seeing a vast shift in spectator-accessible information during the race, whether it's simple tracking back to examine the start from a specific on-board or overhead to (almost) every corner of the track being possible for the broadcast to see.  I mean, my choice would be Brazil 2012. Räikkönen in the weeds, Vettel's epic climb back into the points. This is about the time when complex coverage really started to up its game I think as well. If you think about how small a broadcast-quality onboard camera can now be (phone, GoPro, etc.) it's crazy. Not to mention the 360 fisheye on the nose!
The broadcast has definitely come an extremely long way, not just in terms of information but in terms of actually showing the action. Used to be pretty common to almost exclusively show the leaders regardless of what was going on in the rest of the field.  I was watching the 1984 European Grand Prix the other day, and Elio De Angelis (who was P3 in the championship) started 23rd and made his way up to 6th without a single overtake being shown, before retiring.
100%   Older races didn't even have the timing tower at all time, let alone the data feed or the onboards. Notably, it made it close to impossible to follow the midfield tbh  The camera work was better tho
Even just going back to 2015 where distances between cars and timing towers are barely updated is weird now
The first half of 2013 is an amazing season to watch. I always wonder how good that season could have turned out if Pirelli never switched up the tyres after Silverstone.  Also, shout out to 2013 for having what is easily the best Monaco GP of the modern era. Absolutely bonkers race.
Agreed about the helmet cams. Drones are great in principle, but less than ideal in terms of how well they can track the race.
Yeah 2019 is a weird season where it had arguably one of the most boring races in a decade (France) but also a couple of the most exciting ones (Germany, Brazil). Def a lot of rewatchable races in that season
What are your opinions on the quality and immersion of the race coverage? I think the more we go back at this point, it becomes a different world in how deeply we can examine the racing, and the more it concentrates on the leaders.
That penalty was a joke. They gave it after the 30 minute time limit had passed, and they originally referred to it as a '10s time penalty', which didn't exist back then. Ferrari assumed it was a stop-go.  From memory, the stewards that gave that penalty were sacked after that race.
I think I'm gonna have to watch this season now.
Don't forget 7 different winning drivers in the first 7 races. Absolute nuttiest start to a season ever.  On that note, the first half of 2013 was also very chaotic, especially with the tyre strategies. That year only got boring when Pirelli panicked after Silverstone.
2021 was amazing to watch in real time but when you watch the races back there isn't a lot to them. Some were great, like Hungary or Bahrain, but the vast majority were mid.
I honestly disagree; while some of them were a wash, quite a lot provided spectacular driving against a stopwatch. List of fantastic races from 2021:  Jeddah - you can pile on about fair racing, but imo the race was spectacular to watch and a perfect example of a driver in a much slower car giving it absolutely everything  Brazil - no explanation needed  COTA - the best example that fantastic races don't require overtaking and wheel-banging, thrilling watch from beginning to an end  Russia - rain shuffling everything and Lando driving so well  Spain - great tactical battle  Hungary - Nando vs Hamilton, Ocon's first win, crazy race all around  France - Max's historic outlap and a perfect drive for the win  Baku - fantastic sprint race, although most of the race was quite boring before that  Bahrain - no explanation needed  Imola - Max shoving Hamilton at turn 1, Lewis coming back towards the end only to lose it in the gravel and then pull a comeback for P2  Silverstone - GOAT lap 1 racing, race towards the end for the win  Abu Dhabi.  Belgium, Portugal, Monaco and Austrias were dire, but I don't know how do you call this a non-historic season in terms of the number of interesting races.
I think at that point, every camera was run by dedicated professionals whose job focus was motorsport coverage. Now there are so many cameras that are static or have minimal tracking, but also drone cameras and things that simply weren't possible "back in the day". It's both an improvement in some areas and a step back in others. The overlays are amazing now though, especially the live tracking of distance to the car in front.

Man, the universe sensed a Hulk podium and had everything prepared just in case
Good thing Ferrari didn't have anything to worry about until now
It never ends
Stop he’s dead already
I am tired...
I guess binotto was right as he described the engine to gunther as a bomb
I prefer this than a fuel level issue. I know we were told pretty quickly it wasn’t a field level issue but it would’ve been absolutely gutting if HAAS ended up DQ’ed after that race.
Would’ve been funny if his car broke down right before the finish line.
Ferrari in 2019 - Rocket engine, but cheating. Ferrari in 2020-2021 - shit engine. Ferrari in 2022-2023 - Rocket engine, but only reliable for 10km.
Ferrari, are you having MGU-K problems too?  Question.
If the rumour about Merc engine being turned too high up and ruining it is true too, that means unreliability is back!!! Miss the good ol' days of surprise DNFs at the last few laps. We might be in for an interesting season indeed.
The season is already lost for Ferrari. Better to run into these troubles when you’re already having a bad season. I forsee a lot of penalties, but that will also allow them to fix their issues.   This kind of stuff hurt them a lot more last year than it does in 2023. Ferrari doesn’t participate for the odd podium every now and then.
Traditions.
Thank god Ferrari focused on reliability this year
Ferrari pain is never ending :(
FIA: "2022-2025 fixed specs for power units. Reliability fixes ONLY!"  Ferrari: "Mamma mia, we made it worse."
“Will be a concern” fixed it
Glad he was able to rack in those points though.. they were well deserved.
Mama Mia...
What’s MGU-K?
Add it to the list
Think Ferrari have enough worries about their engines
*"We are checking" intensifies*
Just Ferrari things
Ferrari and concern are sadly 2 words that make perfect sense nowadays
At this rate of bad news about ferrari power train, all ferrari powered cars will start from the back of the grid.
they're already all concerned lmao     this doesn't really change shit, it can't get much worse lol
Might or might not
Oh no! There goes the championship... And to say everything was going great so far...
*No, no pleece rickee, pleece*
How is it breaking all the time. Rules changed last year and it wasn't that bad
When is it gonna end Robbie?
Soon Charles 2023: DNF, 10 penalty, DNF, 10 place penalty (but engine blows up anyway)
Guys here’s what’s happening … Ferrari has spent all of this years development time (and most of last years) on NEXT years car. Now their having “Power Unit” issues so that they can pull some “reliability upgrades” throughout the season (Al a Renault) so that next year they will finally be ready to dominate … right? I’m not crazy! Your crazy!
At this point, I'd hope both Alfa and Haas are looking at other engine vendors.
🫢🥱
Ferrari are still in a better place than Merc when it comes to reliability.   Russell's engine went full flamethrower after just 2 races.The fire damage alone should write off a few good components.
N.
Another day, another ferrari failure
At least things can't get any worse from here.
Question?
Concerns for Ferrari cars??? Breaking news everyone!
So when Ferrari said they will focus on reliability, what exactly does that mean?
If Hulk ever comes into podium contention at Haas you just know Ferrari will take it away from him
Hulk podium was the only reason I hoped they kept the same order. Really wanted an Alonso podium, but Hulk is the one person who'd be even better.  He had a fantastic race.
I'll take a Tsunoda podium then if that situation happens :p  Edit: it'll be that 3 dragon head meme with Tsunoda in what is probably the slowest car somehow making it
He definitely told a witch that he would do anything to just be a F1 driver and she granted his wish but also cursed him with no podiums.
Can't believe we were mere seconds away from that (if red flag was called later)
All their problems are solved and was bored
"this is the worst race....so far"
Leclerc to have a retirement rate of 50% by the end of the season.
he did have PU problems and had to pull off the track, not making it back to the pits, making this a race that featured 4 red flags. This was rather inevitable after that malfunction, albeit not a retirement.
Chin up, there's only 20 races to go. 😅
Charles as well
Maybe they knew and Binotto had to go? I mean he left pretty suddenly, right?
Short term yes. Long term this is a big reliability concern for Ferrari.
It pretty much did, he went on the radio in the 2nd to last corner to tell the team the engine was cutting out and the team told him to "stop the car immediately" as soon as he crossed the finish line and perform a KERS jump out of it.
That has actually happened before haha. At Australia no less.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u67thSgNTs8
It was, they told him to roll across the line then stop
Like Nigel Mansell  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpMoG47kZc
"Aerodynamics are for those who can't build engines."
I don't see the rocket to be honest.
Understood, we're checking.
Is there any reliable source who claims Mercedes had their engines turned up? Or just Redditors throwing stuff around?
Good old days? Do you not recall the beginning of last season? Where 3/4 Honda engine runners DNFed because of engine failures towards the end of the first race, as well as the Ferrari engine blowing up and Leclerc nearly DNFing while holding the lead at Austria
One such particular surprise dnf that comes to my mind is vettel in korea 2010. That track was basically a waterpark slide and vettel controlled the entire race… up until literally the last few laps. Ugh good times
So, write off this year and focus on Next Year™️?
Kinetic energy recovery, charges battery under braking and deploys via the same system
New version of what KERS used to be.
the MGU-K is attached to the crankshaft. When a driver presses the accelerator, the MGU-K becomes a little motor that adds its own power on top of the engine’s power. When activated, it adds about 161 horsepower to the car’s total output, but it can only be activated for brief moments of time.  If a driver opts to slow down, though, the MGU-K generates energy. It, too, is made up of spinning magnets like the MGU-H, but here those magnets are used by the MGU-K to harvest the kinetic energy in the crankshaft. This helps drivers slow down more quickly thanks to the added resistance, and additionally adds energy to the car’s batteries.
Haas, no chance. They are very much  intertwined with Ferrari, their base is next door.  Alfa, no chance either. They will be the Audi works team in 26, they won't get a new supplier for the remaining 2 years.
No point for alfa, with audi coming in 26
Alfa is just a title sponsor, and it's ferrari linked.  Audi enters in 2026, i doubt they bother changing anything till then
Alfa would already moving to Audi in 2026 and Haas is basically a crude Ferrari B-team
That their statement was unreliable.
Ferrari pressed the self destruct button, but performed in true Italian fashion, late and spicy
I'm not even a fan of Hulk, and yet I don't think I'd ever forgive them for that.
I was freaking out thinking that the curse was finally broken, then I saw the notification about the order and how they would proceed to end the race and I was fuming lmao
Yeah, was hoping for the same as soon as I realised Hulk was 4th and Sainz likely had a penalty incoming.
Imagine Hulk’s first podium is with Haas 💀💀
My dream is for someone to just go bowling and we get like a Tsunoda/Zhou/Albon podium
PER VER TSU
Ah, the dreaded PER-VER-TSU
This is the only thing that explains it.
Ferrari domination will bore fans.
Angry finger wagging
Ferrari going for a record breaking season
He'll be celebrating a completed race like it's P1.
It’s 66% as of right now
The race was finished so there may be a waved red flag, it wasn't during the race.
He was told to stop the car immediately, which was noteworthy because a minor issue wouldn't probably require that - you can just drive slowly to pit and save your team the hassle of picking the car back. I was surprised no one mentioned this until now.
4 red flags, but not all 4 during the race itself. however, 4 flags that happened while the cars were on the track for the race.
I thought the red flag was due to people on track?
Not all pull overs are red flags.
dont forget the several sprints left  I HATE YOU FOR MAKING US SUFFER FOR SO LONG, LIBERTY MEDIA
Sainz almost got points because Hulkenberg dropped so far back.
And then fans got on the track and could've gotten their hands on that Haas when it had static electrocution risks. Glad that did not happen.
Sergio Pérez at Baku 2021; immediately parked on the pitlane exit after crossing the line, apparently terminal failure… though rumour has it that they also had so little fuel that if they did the cooldown lap there wouldn’t be enough for the sample.
I was at that race.  The heat was brutal.  Anyone from Texas could have told them a summer race in Dallas was going to have temperatures over 100 ambient plus tons of heat loading from the asphalt.  The track was literally melting and rippling up in the corners.
One of the most iconic moments in F1 history.
"Engines are for those why don't want to Yabba Dabba Do the car around."  \-Einstein, maybe
We will come back to you.
I mean, the chances that is true are high, when was the last time Merc had a complete ICE failure before last weekend ?
those were not engine failures, if I recall correctly it was the fuel lines that were faulty due to the bouncing. Not sure if it was that for all three red bull DNF's. But no engine failed because of it at least.
Ferrari have been planning for 2024 since uhh..... 2009?
Bit more than that. It also works as a motor that adds energy and also helps in breaking.
Makes you wonder what the hell Ferrari's PU department did all winter no. And reliability was their top issue to fix lol
3 guys on the podium with the top 3 slowest cars. Sign me up
Would that be the first podium without a single European on it?
This is my dream as well. Bottas, you know what you need to do.
PER VER TSU SAR    Pervert Susar (they misspelled Susan)
That’s what 30 bhp gains over winter do to this sport. When will FIA reign in Ferrari’s dominance? /s
Any domination is boring.  Nobody wants lopsided competition.
Mental if he scores only one podium in Monaco and not for the rest of the season. He definitely asked a witch for help or something.
No, it was due to Nico breaking down and stopping on the circuit. You may remember hearing an engineer saying "the key regulation is no overtaking" in regards to the late fourth red flag.
This one was red flagged though
Tell that to the race directors from last weekend
Ah yes let’s be worried about more what ifs that never happened
Box box  No wait--  Yes, box box
I don’t remember them ever having a failure as bad as George’s this past weekend in all of the V6 turbo hybrid era.
There was one proper RBPT PU failure last year, on one of the alphatauris, but yeah the Bahrain Red Bull double dnf was due to faulty fuel pump which is a standardized part
Meanwhile Nandos alpine has caught fire again, even if he isn't around
No, you’re thinking of MGU-H, which is coupled to the turbo.  MGU-K is coupled to the drivetrain and is analogous to a hybrid road car in terms of operation.   /u/P_ZERO_ is right.
It's very reliable. You can rely on the fact that it will never last 4 races.
Of course they worked on reliability in the winter. But being Ferrari...
They "gained" 30hp or something too
There's been several without Europeans, but you have to go back to the 80's/90's, back to the days of Piquet, Andretti, Scheckter, Villeneuve, etc.
Probably unless we count Alex as British
Last one with only 1 European was Sakhir 2020 with Perez winning, Ocon 2nd Stroll 3rd.  Before that all the way back to 2009 Germany, Webber win, Vettel 2nd Massa 3rd. Still looking for no Europeans.
TSU PER MAX
PER VER TSU PER  Pervert Super (Checo Perez Jr. debut)
I think you missed the joke on that one.
The only way he's getting a podium in Monaco is if his car spins out and lands on it
But it didn't happen during the race.  The race only featured 3 red flags.
It was red flagged because fans had made their way onto the track not because Hulk stopped his car.
Famously good to wait till things happen to worry about them
This gave me instant pain of monaco 2022, thanks.
And 4 (out of 5 mechanical DNF's) are because of water leak
They spent 3 months just checking.
He races as Thai though right? I know citizenship gets fucky with lots of them having dual or not living in their home country any more. I was thinking more based on what flag they race under
I'm just trying to come up with a time where there was three drivers in podium capable cars who weren't from Europe. Webber, Massa, Barrichello, Perez, Stroll now, Ricciardo, Senna, the assorted Villeneuves. But I cant think of a time when any three of them would have all been in podium cars.
which is why i think they should wear lifejackets in monaco, before some driver drowns in the marina!
Yeah, he races as Thai, but I mean he was born in the UK, speaks British English, his only fluent language. Still, stats like this are based on the flag you race under so it would count.   In that case though ~~the worst F2 driver ever~~ lord mahaveer is Dutch
Found it and you’ll never believe it. The infamous 1990 Japanese Grand Prix where Senna took out Prost.  Piquet 1, Moreno 2 and Aguri Suzuki 3.   Pretty sure that’s it but I did it manually scrolling so could have made a mistake but I doubt it.
Definitely should have waited for the Grosjean crash before incorporating the Halo
>	Albon: My mother is from Thailand, my father is British. I speak both languages, although my Thai is not quite as good as my English.   There’s a spectrum even within the category of fluency, and from this I wouldn’t assume he is fluent in English only.
Yeah definitely a technicality but I'll take it
And Max would be belgian if we go by that, but he chose the dutch license and feels Dutch personally
What a fantastic find! Nicely done. I am eagerly awaiting the clickbait article telling everyone about this now lol
completly different things, but hey, if it makes you feel better, my friend
Be the clickbait you want. Go find a podium photo and throw it up there and link to the Wikipedia.
I agree, and not letting fans touch a potentially electrically charged car is way more on the "halo" side of caution than the "worrying that cars could somehow make it past all the fencing and fall in the marina" side, my friend

They need so much more engineering talent. There was a time when they were the ‘mad scientists’ of the grid and a lot of the stuff they developed is still in F1 today. Technical signings is a need for McLaren, they aren’t realising their potential nearly as much as they should be.
McLaren is more marketing than substance at this time.
They'll never fight for a championship, until they're a factory team again
If Ferrari has “Next Year” trademarked, then Zak and McLaren need to trademark “just a few years”.
I think the rules are quite expressive with the ban on supercharging. Unless they want an electirc supercharger and use the MGU-H as such...
If  I made it through the McLaren-Honda years, I can make it through whatever shit they're cooking up right now. Hopefully they go back to being a competent racing team by 2026.
Alternative headline: "Zak Brown scrambling to make changes, after massive failure in technical hires leads F1 team to the bottom of the pack"
Zak Brown challenges his car to a boxing match.
Rational conversations on topics has taken such a nosedive since this sport exploded lol
Three races in an Zak Brown has PR WDC wrapped up already.
I thought the cars are supposed to be turbocharged????
Seems like Technical Experts just grows on tree when Zak is around.
Needs to work on his turbo charging more than super charging hahahaha amirite
Is this another way of saying more sponsors on the car?
Great let’s cover the car in more advertisements. It’s such an ugly livery.
So more sponsors?
All talk and marketing, he should join RB, at least they can build a regular winning car
McMarketing
He means technical signings as in more sponsors with a technical background, right? Hopefully some of them have flames in their logo, those stickers usually make cars faster don't they?
Let me repeat this for everyone in the back:  THIS IS NOT MCLAREN  This an imposter marketing team pretending to be McLaren trying to be a second-rate Ferrari, carrying the brand name but doing nothing to warrant it  Butthurt brits please downvote
Maybe just charging them to start with...
Oh ok they're "*supercharging*" it. Cool cool.
Better if he supercharged the team 5 years ago - why wait until now ?
Supercharging something implies you were going somewhere fast in the first place.
I imagine losing Seidl hurt them a lot
If they can't focus on their F1 results, might as well just focus 100% on building its brand to the nouveau riche who don't follow F1. Besides, Lando ain't fighting for points, much less the championship this year, Zak should just utilise him for purely marketing purposes, by appearing in music videos/movies/award shows/premiere red carpet events in a McLaren. Maybe they can't just lease out MTC for all blockbuster movies and maybe even wedding events. Why not earn some cash while he's at it.
At least their Indycar team is good
Yeah. It’s only time they think about launching their own coin token (quick! Get your own McLaren Coins, it’s fun!) or their multiverse something or their NFTs (if NFTs weren’t already almost dead comparatively to the boom of last year)  I understand they need desperately the money, they aren’t Ferrari, doesn’t have the backup of Mercedes, RB or Renault, work teams and with large funds, and want to be at the middle/front, so need to do and expend more than the likes of Williams, Alfa, Alpha or Haas. They are in a difficult position, we get it.  But really seems they are focusing more on the marketing and sponsors thing than the performance one.
Yup, the turn around is always just around the corner and someone else's fault they aren't in the top 3.  Zak should just be quiet for a bit and focus on the car.
Each year they are closer to being Williams 2.0.
2-3 more years™️
Aston proved that customer teams can still mix it with the big boys.
It's not about fighting for a championship, it's about being the best you can be.  Right now even for a customer team they're not reaching their potential, so if they became a works team that would still be the case. If you do a good job and are then just lacking a bit like Red Bull in 2018 with the power deficit and being a customer team, then it's valid to blame it on not being a works team.
*Knock knock* It is Honda there?
Yeh it might take a while for them to make big progress.
Customer teams can fight for championships.
Things have changed, and I'm not sure it's still true. It's more difficult, but I don't think it's impossible.  The biggest advantages of factory teams used to be money, last spec engines, and the ability to modify the engines to fit the chassis over the season(s).   But now there is a cost cap, customers are entitled to the same spec engines, modes and lubrifiants as the main team and there is an engine freeze limiting the risks of an inpromtu upgrade clashing with their car design.   Mclaren just screwed up
Ron was correct.
Aston martin would like to disagree
Red Bull won 4 in a row without being a works team. Aston has made a car that is competing with the factory Mercedes this year.  This is a BS excuse. They just need better engineers.
>They'll never fight for a championship, until they're a factory team again  When were McLaren a factory team?
At least Ferrari fights with the top dogs. McLaren fights with Haas and AlphaTauri.
In Spanish there's this meme about "Campeonato respeto" which translates to "Respect championship"
All he’s done since taking over is absolutely tank the team but somehow no one is talking about it
Just don't let Volvo into the sport, that's how you get supercharged turbocharged hybrids.
McLaren was hit hard by COVID and misunderstood the assignment with budgeting for the cost cap. They got rid of more talent than they needed to and now it’s biting them in the butt.  RB overspent by $2.3 million, apparently. If McLaren underspent to a similar degree, they could get plenty of great talent just in time for the wind tunnel going live in June.
Except everything points to Seidl being part of the problem. He's the one who oversaw development of their current car. If the B car pans out, he's not going to look very good.  Per the article:  >“Well, I think when we put Andrea in as team principal, I wasn’t happy – we weren’t happy – with the pace of development last year.  >“Which was a bit masked by the driver news, which was kind of the main story. We kind of stalled out. I asked Andrea to look at it, and ultimately, he felt the model wasn’t right.
I’d imagine it did on some level, but Andrea Stella has been aggressive in his approach. I’ve been impressed with him so far.
While true they weren't better before, he was after all when the 2022 car was made right?  They need new people and infraestructure
I can't tell if this is a serious post or not. Sounds like an MBA's "good" idea.
Be careful what you wish for.
I hope this is /s Nobody cares about a losing team, can’t attract the rich and famous if you’re barely getting points…
Sommehow I wonder how people think a good marketing department means that there is less focus on the technical departments.  Btw. The most successful team in this years WCC has NFT's.
https://nft.mclaren.com/  Like this?
Let's see if Alonso has a shot at the championship. I'd love to be proved wrong, but they're not challenging Red Bull yet. They top 3 for sure.
They can, but it's harder. The Mercedes engine is designed for Mercedes' needs, and the rest of the team can easily work with the engine engineers (!) to find the best compromises between engine and the rest of the car. Aston has to build their car around the Mercedes engine. If they have a great idea somewhere else that conflicts with the engine, tough luck, that idea is out of question and you have to start again.
I honestly thing McLaren should get back into bed with Honda.
With this scammer in charge there will be no progress
it just never happened since the hybrid era. You could maybe argue that Red Bull with Renault engines were "fighting" for a championship, but in reality they just got a few wins from 2014 - 2018 and never came close to challenge Merc for the title. Ferrari was at least leading the championship with Vettel a couple of times in 2017 and 2018.  And Red Bulls championship winning success in the hybrid era came with their exclusive Honda deal, ergo, they were a works team.
They could in the mid 90s, when Ferrari were the only manufacturer.
He was, but he went about it all wrong.
Red Bull was a works team though. When Renault sold the team in 2010 they signed the deal with RB. Before that they already had a deal which made them equal partners in terms of equipment etc which was unprecedented at the time.
Realisticy RB only won 1. Renault was almost fully behind them by 2011.  And RB had Newey.  Aston made a car thats currently losing to a works team by almost a second per lap.  Its not just about beating your own works team as a customer. Its about beating all of them.  The ammount of customer teams beating works teams to a title in the last 40 years is less than 5.
It's not a BS excuse, being a works team definitely helps or at least the main team the engine supplier supplies. The example you mentioned is a perfect for what an engine supplier can do. RB won 4 in a row with Renault, but that same RB asked for special modifications to the Renault engine so it worked with their diffuser.  Imagine something like this today, asking Mercedes or Ferrari to make some modifications to their engine which then boosts the performance of a team they are supplying. Don't think it would happen these days.
They were the team Mercedes put all their efforts into, before they bought Brawn.
McLaren are an odd one because while they don’t make an engine, they do manufacture all the other parts in-house. They’re in the grey area between factory and privateer. Not quite one and not quite the other.
One of Ferrari's drivers is tied in points with a Haas driver at the moment.
He joined in late 2016. Constructors results since then:  2017 - 9th  2018 - 6th  2019 - 4th  2020 - 3rd  2021 - 4th  2022 - 5th   You can criticise their recent stagnation but ultimately that record is not one that says to me he tanked the team. Especially when you look at everything he's done off the track to bring in sponsors and therefore money to help pay for things like the new wind tunnel which we've yet to see the benefit of.
Or Lancia… or VW…
Yeah it sounds like he was too conservative in his approach while everything Stella has done so far suggests he’s more inclined to take risks and be aggressive to get them to where they should be.
The wind tunnel had been holding them back a lot (especially the covid delays in getting it built), they'll most likely improve in coming seasons now that it's finally online
That's McLaren Automotive. McLaren Racing have https://collectibles.mclaren.com/
Whether they have a shot at the championship this specific season isnt the point, the point is that a customer team is performing at the same level as several factory teams.
tbh the comparison would be with Mercedes, not Red Bull, since they are using Mercedes' engine. The problem is customer teams not being able to achieve what they would as works teams.
no one is challenging red bull this year.
Whole rear end is Mercedes
Alonso's curse of picking the wrong team at the wrong time has been transferred to McLaren picking engines.
McLaren had a very successful relationship with Honda and a terrible relationship with Honda. We clearly need a tie breaker here
Who is the scammer?
🤦🤦🤦
Reddit moment
The point is you can outperform works teams. It’s a suboptimal starting point, but people treat it as if it is this insurmountable thing and it’s not. And with engine freezes it’s more doable than ever.  The client/works gap seems natural law because the works teams happen to also be the richest, biggest, more technically advanced ones with the same engine. The one time it didn’t happen in the hybrid era Renault was beaten by a client. Hell, AM is above/on par with Mercedes today.
We are in a budget cap era now. Comparing back to when works teams could pour hundreds of millions of dollars into development seems misguided.
RB with the Mercedes engine (or if the Renault was up to spec) in the hybrid era would have been able to fight for championships.
>	And Red Bulls championship winning success in the hybrid era came with their exclusive Honda deal, ergo, they were a works team.  Gotta disagree on this one. They won that championship with Honda engines and as a Honda customer. To be a ‘factory’ team you’ve gotta do that engine R&D yourself.
They could in 2010 when a customer team won.
Ron was one of those rare cases where his strategic vision was as sharp as ever but his managerial style had long become outdated for the modern world.
Red Bull wasn't a works team in the 2010 season and yet they absolutely nuked Renault from orbit.  Aston is also a customer team and yet they made a car that can compete with Mercedes this year, while McLaren is busy fighting for P15. So yeah, totally BS excuse to defend that McLaren shat the bed again.
That's because usually customer teams are also the ones with a lower budget. The rest have that big car manufacturer money
Clearly this is an unpopular opinion, but I don't believe you could call McLaren a factory or works team even in the Haug/Mercedes glory years.  If we're going by success and proportion of cash injection then they were arguably a Honda factory team first.  But they were never anybody's "factory" team, they're a proper F1 privateer that buys engines and makes sponsorship deals, just as has always been the way.
Can we please stop using random stats that don't mean anything as if they were worth mentioning? They aren't.  If you really believe in what you are suggesting, then let's bet money on which team will end the season higher - mine will be on Ferrari, yours will be on Haas.
That customer team is performing well above the factory team, at this point in time
The comment litterelally says compete for a championship. Stop trying to be a smart ass before you learn how to read.
tbh it looks like there's a lot of blame to put into McLaren in their last partnership.
Zak Brown
tbh if you win one out of every 5 times, you cannot really say that "it can be done" and leave it like that. Yes, it can be done, at a 1 to 4 disadvantage.
And I gotta disagree on that one. Since Red Bull (and their sister team) were Hondas only customer. So Honda adjusted the engine to Red Bull's needs and Red Bull gave direct feedback to them and worked very close with them. Thus you could always see Japanese Honda employees in Red Bull's garage and they always celebrated together. That in fact was a works teams relationship. It's similar to how it was with McLaren Mercedes, BMW Williams or BMW Sauber back in the 2000s
13 years ago is still not a current example
I’m curious, could you explain this? I’ve always had a feeling he fell off because his style was ancient, but I never really got to know the details of what was going wrong. Ron Dennis is clearly one of if not the greatest team principals in history and I was always confused.
Yes they beat Renault, which were shit. They had Newey and an ungodly amount of talent. They had a way way bigger budget than Renault. And the Renault engine was by *far* the best engine because of their engine mappings to make the blown diffuser work. And after that they became the works team.   So it’s extremely unlikely McLaren will ever be competing for a title without being a works team.
This example is 13 years old
They literally painted the car Mercedes silver
Can we please stop having such short memories? McLaren beat Ferrari in the constructors literally 3 years ago. They're both glorified hype machines coasting on "prestige" at the moment.
Yeah. I think it doesn't matter whether AM can take the fight to RB, the fact that it can take the fight to the factory team means that you don't have to be a factory team to win.  I think the logic behind only factory teams having a realistic shot comes down to two factors, and neither applies anymore. The first is restricted engine modes; Mercedes fairly openly admitted to handicapping its customers' engines when it gave Grosjean access to a better mode mid-race. The second is the synergy between aero and engine design (particularly packaging decisions)--engine changes that helped the works team would likely just throw off the customer teams. With the strict limits on engine development, I don't think that's much of a factor until 2026--both works and customer teams need to work around a fairly stable engine.  That said, I think the second may become an issue in 2026, at least for a time--AM and McLaren may have a limited window to contend unless they find an engine partner for 2026.
if i’m recalling correctly Mclaren went on saying they built a race winning chassis but the Honda engine was too slow/unreliable. Nevermind that Mclaren rushed Honda to join a year early and also bring their size 0 package immediately.
OK buddy...
Explain?
This doesn't change anything lol what matters is that it can be done
> Since Red Bull (and their sister team) were Hondas only customer.   So there were 2 customers that year, sounds like a customer team to me.   > That in fact was a works teams relationship.  I disagree and this has not been the traditional definition. Historically a factory/works team has meant having the same manufacturer for both the engine and the rest of the car. The current Red Bull is a grey area because it's clearly still a Honda engine (For the moment at least).   > BMW Williams or BMW Sauber back in the 2000s  Those were as much BMW factory teams as Red Bull is a Honda factory team. They were an engine supplier.
Current enough, and the budget cap will only help customer teams.
Ron was known as a [micromanager](https://www.skysports.com/f1/news/12433/10659312/paper-review-ron-dennis-management-style-caused-boards-decision); the type who asks why you're 3 minutes late for your shift and that you should be arriving earlier than your official start time so that you're ready to start bang on the minute rather than trusting you to manage your own workload. That style was probably all well and good from 70s through to the 90s with strongmen managers but falling out of favour by the 2000s but by the late 2010s his style was really ancient which was probably why they cited it as a reason for his removal (probably a lot of backroom politics too). I believe Williams also suffered this same stiff and outdated culture under Frank.  He also took Lewis' decision to leave McLaren as a betrayal and spoke out about the [importance of loyalty](https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/dennis-demands-loyalty-from-his-staff-you-cut-yourself-you-bleed-mclaren/3219407/).  Basically everything wrong you hear about modern Japanese work culture (think Musk's extreme working ethic too except Ron was actually competent) is what Ron embodies; the West moved away from that culture to one of self-accountability and flat hierarchy, but Ron never did; he'd fit right in managing a company there.
>They had Newey and an ungodly amount of talent  Exactly what mclaren needs rn
The Aston team isn't 13 years old though.
That sponsorship colour was literally applied in McLaren's private privateer factory by the privately owned team 😂  The whole point of the enterprise from the Mercedes point of view was to align with F1 without purchasing a team. Ultimately they *did* purchase a team, but McLaren was never ever a Mercedes factory team.  Look at the money and R&D assistance that Williams had from Honda during the active-ride part of early 90s. There's no real difference between the Williams-Honda synergy and the Mclaren-Mercedes arrangement, but we wouldn't dream of calling Williams a factory team.  At least I bloody well hope we wouldn't.
How many times did McLaren beat Ferrari in the last 10 years, do you say? 8? 12?
Yes, but McLaren's "race winning chassis" was only that because they said so. We have no evidence whatsoever that their chassis was as good as they say. And the rest is what you said - McLaren put a lot of pressure on Honda, and constantly intervened in their work. Honda at least has said that Red Bull gives them a lot more freedom to build their engine properly than McLaren did.  We'll never really know, but from all I saw, I think both sides were equally to blame for the McLaren-Honda's lack of results.
He is running the car and the drivers into the ground.
Yup, and you can survive jumping from a 5th floor. Maybe 1 in 1000 times, but it has happened before. Doesn't mean it's a reasonable argument to justify why your apartment doesn't need an elevator.
I really hope Aston prove me wrong, but we'll see if they challenge for the championship.
Oh definitely i agree with you, I re read my initial comment and it kinda comes across like im defending them which I definitely am not, I think The chassis while maybe not a complete piece of garbage, Was not nearly as good as they (Mc) claimed.
Not saying it was a race winning chassis but in ‘15 ’16 they were consistently at the top end of the grid when looking at mid corner speeds, which is dictated by chassis
May I present to you, McLaren 2013 thru 2017.   No wins. Throwing drivers like Kmag, Sergio Perez.   Ending careers like Stoffel.   Having a car so bad that Jenson retired. Botched Honda relationship (can’t pin it all on Alonso as much as everyone likes to).   No sponsors.   McLaren was nose diving before Zak arrived.
Ya it's not like they were the 4th best car for 4 years in a row
This isn't even worth a response but you got one
And how is he doing that?

Team member too close to the fence. 5 place grid drop.
is it fair to call this the ferrari experience when its his own mistake that leads to him being out of the car behind the fence here? or is drivers making mistakes part of the ferrari experience?
Nice cosplay from the fan !
What? The agony?
They get paid to watch every race this year, kinda jealous!
Welp
Lol yes. France last year, seb in Germany in 2018, Singapore a few years back.
as much as I want to see Charles win, I can't stand his stans, if he makes mistakes, it's on the team because they put lot of pressure on him oh boo hoo, he is getting paid millions for exactly that.
Funny how Leclerc gets blamed for a racing incident, yet everyone after the race were sympathizing with Sainz for getting rightly penalized for a clumsy divebomb then calling the FIA unfair.  Not saying Leclerc couldn’t have done more to avoid the crash, but it’s funny seeing the different reactions.
the mistakes get made as a result of the mess of internal politics, see hockenheim 2018
It's that Gordon Ramsey meme.   Charles makes a mistake: "It's OK Gorgeous"   Sainz makes a mistake: "Frickin Donkey"
While I understand that it creates more opportunities for mistakes, it's still his own faults, and to fight for a championship you need to be almost perfect in execution.   Everyone makes mistakes and Sainz and Leclerc contributed to disappointing results.
Plus he's not getting any more pressure than other top contenders lol. If you are fighting to be the best, you are going to have to handle that pressure. It's something that comes with the title.
> rightly penalized for a clumsy divebomb then calling the FIA unfair.  He was right to be penalized, but a penalty that drops him from 4th to 12th is way too harsh.  The FIA needs a different procedure for penalties when the race is guaranteed to end under a safety car. It could have potentially been unsafe due to all the other drivers behind trying to finish within 5 seconds of him under the safety car.  The penalty should have been based on how many places back 5 seconds would have put him before the restart.
The penalty was a little harsh, it was essentially a lap 1 racing incident which are usually not treated as harshly as it was. Also, it was only as punishing as it was under this specific circumstance where they only had one lap and just follow the SC to the finish line. Under any other circumstance a 5 second penalty would've dropped him 1, maybe 2 spots down and not put him outside of the points entirely.     Not to mention that Sargeant did something much worse and didn't get anything for it.
That was not a divebomb. Rewatch the clip. Dude fully made the corner. Again he should have gotten a penalty for the next race imho. When the penalty takes away 8 positions it's quite unfair imho.
Sainz absolutely deserved that penalty.
this mistake didnt get made as a result of internal politics. i get that a lot of stuff is wrong at ferrari but come on. he cut in to early ahead of stroll and crashed out. not every incident is in direct correlation to ferrari having bad management.  imagine the other way around, stroll cutting off charles and as a result crashing out and landing in the gravel. you would probably question my sanity if i would blame aston martin in that case.
What a load of bs. A driver error is not on the team.
Lmao what, hockenheim was the perfect example of pure driver mistake. Similar to Leclerc in France last year.   Nah this is just pure copium.
Yeah and it's annoying lol. Like come on man I get he's literally one of the best on the grid but people gave Sainz so much flack for the slight positioning mistake he made when he hit Alonso, but everyone blamed Ferrari for Charles screwing up at the first lap.   Again, no need to blame people. It's a team sport. Shit happens.
5 seconds penalty is literally the lightest punishment you can give.  It is consistent to other similar incidents (see Vettel France 18, Leclerc Japan 19, Hamilton Brazil 19, Hamilton Austria 20, Russell Austria 22 etc.)  You can’t just change the penalty just because the field is bunched up and it would drop the driver in question out of the points.  We want consistency, but yet something like this happens, and people want a lighter penalty.
I agree there should be some leniancy in lap 1 incidents but at the same time i feel like they need to clamp down on them more than they usually do.
Sargeant definitely should’ve got something, I agree with that. But that shouldn’t affect the Sainz penalty.  The penalty was not harsh even in the slightest. Isn’t 5 second penalty the smallest penalty one could possibly get?   The penalty shouldn’t change from what it normally is just because the field is bunched up with one lap to go. 5 seconds is consistent with other similar incidents in the past (Vettel France 18, Leclerc Japan 19, Hamilton Brazil 19, Hamilton Austria 20, etc).
??? read any interview about ferrari post todt/brawn era
You misunderstand my point. Yes, what the FIA did was "fair" in the sense that it was consistent with their rules. But consistent doesn't actually mean fair. The FIA rules clearly don't account for this sort of situation, and they really should.
Yo these comments are hilarious. I'm sure leclerc was thinking about interviews during his start.
Mate it's ok, he made a mistake. No need to create excuses.
That would be highly controversial if they changed penalties depending on the situation.  Going by your point, Lewis should’ve gotten a 30 second penalty or something harsher than what he got in Silverstone 2021 just so the penalty would be “fair”, and thats just not right IMO.
Huh? That's not at all what I'm saying.  I'm saying if a race ends under a safety car, then outstanding time penalties should be counted based on position before the start of the safety car. Some penalties already work this way - if a stop-and-go is assigned in the final 3 laps, it's 30 seconds instead. Is that highly controversial?  And what the hell does Silverstone 2021 have to do with it? This is about the conditions the penalty is served under, it has nothing to do with the actions that caused the penalty.
That’s different though because stop-go penalties require the car to physically serve the penalty, like Kimi in 2015 Russia, so they just do time penalty equivalent.  What suggestion do you have for an alternative for a 5 second penalty?
>What suggestion do you have for an alternative for a 5 second penalty?  You mean besides what I already suggested?
The man. The myth. The lengend is back
 BRACKLEY (April 6, 2023) The following statement was released today by James Allison, in response to questions about his future career plans:   “I’m back.”
A first podium of the season to celebrate and take us into the break after a strong weekend in Melbourne. Our Team will now look to build on the progression of the first three races before Baku.      James joins us this week to answer your questions in our Australian Grand Prix  Akkodis Race Debrief.
So good to hear from James again! Excited for the things to come. Thank you for the debrief video! :)
Guess who's back. Back again.
I'm sure James could explain the apocalypse in a way that it's going to be ok, so not sure if pace is really there or not
Mmm... The legend had a little cheeky smile when speaking about what they've got planned. All aboard the hopium train again again! Choo Choo!
I echo the sentiments and excitement expressed by others about the return of James Allison. As a Mercedes fan, it's quite comforting to hear from him and hear about the progress being made.
“Mike this is Toto, let James pass”
Mildly hyped James is back onboard.
We are witnessing the greatest comeback in sports history. 📌
Had to be him
Lovely to see and hear James again :)
Well done.
James' back, tell a friend.

Kind of cool to see som drivers with quite different career paths lined up next to each other with almost the exact same number of races and podium/win distribution.  Massa and Patrese, Mansell and Lauda, Verstappen and Senna look basically the same.
Would've been great to see a DNF section, which is especially relevant to compare against the older generation.
The total of the bar is the drivers starts. Of those starts how many resulted in podiums. And of those podiums how many resulted in a win.Eg, Alonso of 356 starts he has 101 podiums. Of 101 podiums 32 wins.  Apologies if it seems a bit confusing at first, this is my first attempt at displaying stats.   To me it seemed like an interesting way to see this data and compare across the top drivers from those categories.   Any feedback would be good.  This is using the top 10 from categories Starts, Podiums, Wins.Stats from [https://www.motorsportstats.com/series/formula-one/records/2023](https://www.motorsportstats.com/series/formula-one/records/2023)
Max and Senna looking quite similar there   Also, Clark was just built different. My GOAT.
Max very similar to Ayrton there
Holy smokes man, Lewis definitely stands out.
Jim clark highest wins out of podium finishes? Thats pretty awesome
Holy cow Prost. And in the most unreliable era of F1
So I saw a stat that the AUS podium had the record for most current total number of podiums by the drivers on that podium (I think), but I was wondering if it was also the most experienced podium in terms of total number of races driven (at that point in time of course), does anyone know?
The other way to show it is by percentages  Driver - % of wins (from Drivers total Races) - % of Podiums (from Drivers total races)  Fernando - 8.93% - 28.21%  Kimi - 6.01% - 29.51%  Rubens - 3.41% - 21.11%  Lewis - 32.90% - 61.34%  Michael - 29.73% - 50.65%  Sebastian - 17.72% - 40.80%  Felipe - 4.08% - 15.24%  Riccardo - 2.34% - 14.45%  Jarno - 0.39% - 4.36%  Valtteri - 4.90% - 32.84%  Alain - 25.24% - 52.47%  Nigel - 16.14% - 30.72%  Niki - 14.12% - 30.50%  Max - 22.28% - 48.19%  Ayrton - 25.30% - 49.38%  Jackie - 27% - 43%  Jim - 34.24% - 43.83%
Where's Button?
Max is 16 wins away from being #3 driver with the most wins 🤯
I miss Hulkenberg in this chart /s
Michael, Seb and Lewis hanging out together there and representing most of my F1-watching life (at least from the point beyond which I was just looking at colourful cars go vroom).
This is why Jim Clark is the GOAT in my eyes.
I always forget that Max Verstappen has already completed 7 seasons. Seems like last year when he was still the rookie we knew was destined for greatness.
This really shows you just how crazy good Jim Clark was.  Lewis has a win percentage of 32.9% and Schumacher has a 29.7% win percentage.  Senna has a 25.2% win rate Prost has a 25.2% win rate.  Jim Clark beats them all with a 34.2% win rate.  He was as good as all these other drivers and it’s sad how short his career was.
That’s insane to me that Lewis has almost a 33% win ratio. Also insane that Verstappen and Senna have almost the same stats.
Nico Rosberg would be interesting since he retired early
Rip Hűlkenberg, 182 starts 0 podium
Pretty wild that currently there are only 3 drivers that have more podiums than Lewis has wins.
The best move Lewis ever did was going to Mercedes. If he stayed at McLaren he would've had Alonso numbers.
wheres fangio?
If my F1 history is correct, shouldn't Jackie Stewart have 99 race starts?  I believe he never started the last race of '73 at Watkins Glenn and retired a day early after the death of François Cevert on the Saturday.
I miss Nico Hulkenberg in this chart
One is not like the others… (Trulli)
We need 1 more bottas win so he can be the true second coming of Barrichello
To equal Hamiltons current stats, Max needs to score 112 podiums in the next 147 starts. Of those 112 podiums 66 need to be wins.
These sorts of stats are interesting, but shouldn't be taken too seriously. There are too many variables. For instance Alonso was on mid field teams for ages, and regulations and reliability were totally different 30 years ago.
Im saying it again, but Clark is so undoubtedly the GOAT
Very cool
This shows that Hamilton and Schumacher should have gone to Formula Zero. Podiuming more than half the time. Jeez I can’t even do that on iRacing.
Few more years with Alfa and Bottas - Barrichello will look very similar as well
Nando and Kimi, as well, which is kind of crazy given the length of both careers. You'd normally expect more variance with more starts.
Jim Clark had a total of 23 races without issues in his career - he won them all.  Also Clark has 25 wins.
Where is Jenson my friend?
This is very well done for your first time. Upon reading your post title I could immediately understand the graph. It’s simple and easy to parse. I didn’t even need to use the key as it was self-evident. Nice job!
Struggling with how you chose the drivers as alesi and berger had more than 200 starts and it's not based on number of wins as trulli features.
Clark's stats are just absurd. Had he not died so early he would have a lot of records still standing today.
My man HATES podiums he doesn’t win. If you ain’t first, you’re last.
You can make a lot of comparisons between drivers. Lewis and Schumi, Max and Senna, Lauda, Prost and Vettel, but Jim Clark is the only driver in my opinion that you can’t compare to anybody.
for now, if Red Bull stays dominant for a bit the graph will start looking more like Hamilton/schumacher
If nothing goes wrong with his health and red bull stays competitive to the end of next season, Max will be the driver with the 3rd most wins
"Haha yes"
Yeah, the fact that essentially 2/3 of his race starts have resulted in a podium is simply insane.
If DNFs were also visualised, Clark would stand out even more than he does in this graph.
I'm kind of amazed that he has more wins than podiums that aren't a win.
Him and Prost
Longest stint in dominant car will do that.
And he still holds the record of most grand slams, 8  ... In three years!
I’m sure it is, 837 races in total. No way that’s beaten by any podium.  That’s an average of 279. Only 7 drivers ever got passed that.  The last Vet-Rai-Ham podium was halfway in 2018. Now I’m too lazy to calculate it exact, but at this point they max out at 961. Let’s say it’s 20 races a year per driver (some years more, some less). That’s 60 for 2019, 2020, 2021 and 40 for last year. So about 220 races less, so way less than the Ver-Ham-Alo last week
With Lewis and Fernando on the Podium it might just have been that one.
Man Lewis is mind blowing
Managed to slip through the net somehow!   [With added Jensen!](https://i.imgur.com/ccX0XVf.png)
He could possibly get it this year.
haha a lone massive blue bar would be so sad to see. Poor guy. I hope he breaks the curse this year. Almost did it in Australia
Not Verstappen? :P Considering he's already been in the sport for 8 years?
Only 33%? Fangio would like a word...
Hamilton's career is a unique culmination of everything being done right. Ridiculous talent, great career decisions, great cars. Just special.
If he keeps finishes at the same rate as he has over the past 48 races, he'll have 116 more podiums and 82 (WTF!) more wins over those 147 starts. He has the ability to do it, but I can't imagine that Red Bull will be able to keep him in a car that is capable. Its bananas to think that it's even possible, considering that the first 6 years of his career F1 was dominated by Hamilton and Mercedes.
With the domination RB are having and heading to...
The stats of a good support driver
Why would you normally expect that? Throw a red and blue dice a few times and their results will be wildly different. Throw them a few thousand times and they will be almost identical.
In 1968 he even managed the incredible feat of winning every F1 race he finished.
Also pretty telling that he “only” has 32 podiums but he has 25 wins. Jim was a beast.
How does that work?
Oh shit! [Here with added Jenson!](https://i.imgur.com/ccX0XVf.png)
Thank you for the feedback!
It was top 10 from each category then fill in the missing data for each driver from the other category.  So Trulli features because he was in the top 10 for starts, Bottas for podiums, so on. Then their missing data was filled in.
I'd put money on Max being past Michael and right on the heels of Lewis before he turns 30.
That's asking for 17 more wins out of 20 races left. Definitely not impossible with how good RB are looking but something or the other always goes wrong in F1. I don't think he'll be reaching that milestone just yet. By next season though? Definitely.
61.34%, 4th highest of any driver ever and the top 2 have 1 and 7 races to their name respectively. Only Fangio had a real career in F1 and he outscores Hamilton with his 67.31% podium rate.  The top 10 of all time all have a 50% podium rate or higher and Verstappen could join them this season if Red Bull stays on top.
To save others from looking it up, Clark had 29 DNFs in his 73 races. Of those 44 he finished, he was on the podium for 33 (75%) of them, winning 25 (56.8%).
as would Senna, he was on the podium of 80% of the races he finished iirc.
Not that rare on this list, actually - Hamilton, Schumacher, Mansell, Senna, Stewart, and Clark all have more wins than non-win podium finishes. Still a wild stat though, in the grand scheme of things.
While I agree, teammates are still a thing. If RB has no competition for the next few years and the pair stays the same, Max will make Lewis’ run look comical.
And they weren’t exactly racing 23 grand prixs
on the other hand, I expect more Ver, Ham, Alo podiums this year to break the record again :p
Despite him having a good car most of his years, it's crazy to be performing thst well for so long. That's 17 years of being great
Thank you! Good visualisation.
But he's not next to the other 3 yet.
Fangio is god and therefore is excluded from the comparisons of mortal men.
I personally hope we'll have more competition in the next years. Of course I want Verstappen to win (see flair), but I'd like it to go till the last race of the season.
Except people and cars aren't die or coins, and F1 has infinitely more variables over the course of long careers.   For two guys to each have ~350 starts and have such similar results in podiums/wins is wild to me.
💀
He was one race from managing the same feat in 1965 as well. Won every race he finished, except the Italian GP.  (I get the joke, but still wanted the share the 1965 stat)
This is why Jim Clark is my GOAT.  Not even Schumi and Hamilton have the same win percentage as Clark.
He won 2 races with car issues.
How did you miss berger and alesi then as they both have over 200 starts and berger at least has 10 wins.
>end of next season
Honestly? We said the same about Max passing Fernando last year, wouldnt count it out
He also only had 23 races where he didn’t have a mechanical problem. Yet he still won 25 races
Oh yes and seeing how none of these 3 seems to retire yet we can expect a future one in 2024 or even 2025
Few are great right from the first race, even fewer have a car that accompanies that greatness.
id think the opposite - the more starts the less impactful any individual season or team are. the driver becomes the most consistent thing the more starts you have
I mean, sure, I agree it's interesting to see. Just seemed like a weird way to word it.   Being so close after hundreds of races suggests all those factors ultimately boil down to them being very closely matched. More races reinforces that stat more, not less, and I wouldn't expect if you had Alonso & Kimi fit in 600 races instead of 350 it would've diverged.
Oh in my mind issues =dnfs  Obviously not lol
Because they didn’t feature in the top 10 of either of the 3 categories.
Well I was factoring the August 2023 Spontaneous Dental Hydroplosion (SDH) pandemic that will cancel all events until mid-2024 though.
dunno, good chance ASton Martin won't get another car as good as this.  &#x200B;  or if merc becomes the dominant team, Russell will be more of a force than Perez.
Alain's absolutely crazy too when you consider he didn't always have a great car
Oh christ I am with you now.
They got here on merit though, not because of a reg change  Aston are here to stay imo
Why couldn't Aston be the next 2nd or 3rd fastest car for a few years? Have some hope my friend
And the amount of races each season had at that time compared to now
They are there on merit, but chances are Merc and Ferrari are poor at the moment and could improve massively

I still don't get what's going on. They discovered in the winter that they went in the wrong direction (again) even before testing in Bahrain. How is that possible? Why didn't they change direction then?
tbh they should've seen how off pace they were again at Abu Dhabi last year, right off the back of the Brazil win and known it was the wrong concept. I suppose at that point, it may have been too late. All those podiums they got last year also probably gave them a false sense of hope.
So what's going on over there, Lewis says he raised concerns, George said he didn't, Toto said he didn't but now admits he did.     They knew it was flawed before testing but carried on anyway in the wrong direction and George has said they all agreed on that but now it's come out they didn't?     This seems so unlike Mercedes of the last few years, it's almost like they had one bad (by their standards) year and imploded afterwards
So according to the data it should have worked but didn't is what Wolff was saying.
After the error in their cfd/wind tunnel models (and firing people responsible for it), they seem to move in the right direction, or atleast that's the vibes coming out of mercs.  The coming upgrades in the following few races are so crucial to cement their approach. Maybe that's why toto said they want to make it right this time.  [Formu1a.uno article](https://www.formu1a.uno/retroscena-mercedes-ritardi-e-simulazioni-errate-anche-a-causa-di-parti-fuori-tolleranza-testate-in-galleria/)  Arguably the most trusted news source in formula 1.
Without knowing the quality and depth of the idea this isn’t really anything we can talk about in any meaningful way.   The idea could have been “we need to change the concept to be more like red bull” or it could have been a 17 page technical overview with research on the best aerodynamic set up possible. It could have been an idea that would have taken 3 weeks to make a reality or it could have been an idea that would have taken them past the start of the season to realise and test. It could have been risk free, sure fire gamble with obvious pay offs, or it could have been a Hail Mary that could have thrown them as far back as it did move them forwards.  It sounds like this sound byte is there purely to reinforce the fact that the process was the normal, sensible one for a team to take. Someone had an idea, they discussed it as a team and through some process of weighing up the risks, benefits and facts they had to hand, they made a decision.   The title used here is trying to dredge up the mini-drama that swirled around the “they didn’t listen to Lewis” story, when it probably was intended to smooth that over.
Nikkis gone so no one’s caping for the driver interest anymore; the engineers are in charge.
So they can only bring the new concept with a new chassis in 2024. Which puts them at a massive disadvantage in terms of development of that concept compared to RB and AM.  I don’t see them closing the gap before 2025 honestly
I think it’s interesting to note that Hamilton still wasn’t happy with the car after Australia
So he wasn't spewing bullshit,Lewis was telling the truth.  Merc was notorious for being over reliant on computer simulations.Bottas confirmed that this was the case and that the engineers don't care too much about driver feedback when it comes to R&D and setup work. Computer Sims has been misleading the team for quite a while now.Maybe it's time to change their approach and start listening to their drivers.
I believe everyone that is stating that the engineers were right is missing the most basic and important point. There is a difference between knowing how to implement a concept and knowing what concept to implement.  In any and every field or business there are idea women/men and technical women/men. The idea people are often not technically savvy enough to design the idea but know what concept will be successful. While the technical people generally have plenty of E=MC squared ideas that look good on paper but is often far less in the crucible of reality. In fact, most often, your best idea people have zero ability to actually implement the idea.   Think of it this way, a restaurant owner may see trends in the neighborhood (or nationally) that people are prioritizing healthy foods. So he'll go to the chef and say we need to add more baked chicken and vegetables to the menu instead of the chicken fried steak smothered in gravy. Can the owner cook the food? No. But his vision of what a successful menu will look like can definitely be right.   Same situation here, Lewis Hamilton definitely can tell an engineer the general characteristics of a fast car but has zero idea how to implement all of these characteristics in a cohesive package but he can definitely right about the characteristics of a championship car.   This sounds like a situation where he knew the car did not have x, y and z characteristics but they ignored him because the engineers "knew better". Was it pride of the recently elevated Mike Elliot? Was it some other team dynamic? Was a part of this caused by Lewis going on sabbatical after Abu Dhabi and not really giving input during that important development window giving George an outsized say in development feedback? We may never know, but one thing is for sure, whoever was involved in this development direction was clearly wrong and it is damn near criminal that they doubled down on it heading into this year.  Edited: phone auto complete
It shows how listening pilots is important, and how you can't develop a car against your driver.  And that making feedbacks and help to develop the car is part of drivers' skill.  &#x200B;  Pierre Waché of Red Bull explained it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAqMnCc4rZ4) (in french but subtitles are OK) at 43'55.
I think that Lewis was the one in the right here. The engineers should have listened to him regarding the characteristics instead of going with what the fastest concept was on paper.  Driver confidence is everything and while this concept may be the fastest one according to the data, it's useless if the people driving the car don't trust it enough to push it to those theoretical limits.  This isn't a Danny Ric situation where one driver is clearly outclassed by the other and the lack of pace is down to the one in the car either. Lewis and George are tit for tat so clearly the car's handling is the biggest issue and the most important sensor on the car is being ignored.
I mean yes, its a very very hard to go for new concept and make it work so quickly, but when your most experienced, 7x times WDC driver is saying that u need to change something drastically then u should back him up. Yes its not 80s-90s F1 when drivers were heavily involving creating car and testing it, but drivers are the only one human beings who had real time experience with the car.
Unrelated question. does anyone think that Merc increased the HP on Australia gp cars by overclocking the engine, for lack of a better word, and that's why George's PU blew out?
Now this is interesting, they've always listened to drivers input so why change ?  Not to mention, because of the budget cap, all the more reason to have everyone in the conversation.
>Lewis had a different idea. But in the end, we all decided together to remain faithful to this concept  which is the 100% right approach. lewis is one of the best athletes in f1 ever - might be the best of all time even. but he is a driver. mercedes employs quite a few extremely well paid engineers who dedicated their life to studying and engineering race cars.  if you take the word of your driver over your specialized engineers on design decisions regarding the concept of the car you doing it fundamentally wrong.
i had a genuine question about this. back when mercedes started dominating, it was mainly because of the new engine specs and they’d nailed it by a mile.   do the drivers have an input on where the engine development should head or at least where more focus needs to be established?
So what would happen of both Merc and Ferrari decide to blow the budget by a mile reconcepting their cars? Surely there are consequences but are they worse than being a full year behind development wise until 2026?
Lewis: "see, I wanted to develop a car that was really really fast, but Toto said no."
What directions are there? High downforce vs low drag?
So Lewis is the only one left there with a brain. How do you look at 2022 and think you had the right concept???
"We told Hamilton don't worry this car will be fast af boi...😂"
Merc is a hilarious team, sticking to a failed concept for 2 years because of ONE track-specific win. Mind you they were significantly off the pace again in Abu Dhabi which was literally one race after that.
Pre-season testing last year they fit side pods on the car for the first part of testing  and then revealed the zero pods. Or maybe it was film day. But if they have side pods fitted to last year car, it can't be too hard to do it for this year as well I think.
Toto always admits that the driver is the most important sensor in the car.  They ignored the sensor and blew it.
The car even has the line where different sidepods could be. Merc needing that efficient cooling can make them make very slim vertical sidepods. Would love to see if it changes their problems.
I really wish people would make the car for driver if the driver is a 7 time WDC winner
Oh he must have wanted a fast car
Why do I have a feeling that Hamilton being in front of Verstappen on merit during the 2023 Australian GP may never happen again for the rest of the ‘23 season🥹🤦🏽‍♂️
TLDR…  Ham: FAST  Merc: SLOW
Hamilton is doing his ['I told you so' dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHt40yobses)
yeah. he wanted a fast car, got a slow one
They are still front runners sometimes they make it look like they are driving a Williams
Wait they expected to not have a shit box?
I think it was probably along the lines of copy the RB
And the team did the right thing. Lewis is an all timer but he's not an engineer or aerodynamicist.  As lewis said it just didn't look right, but aesthetics and aerodynamics don't always go hand in hand. They'd have been silly to suddenly drop what they were doing because the driver thought it looked off
Gotta love Mercedes finger pointing about the second fastest car.
Can you imagine if Max Verstappen went to Adrian Newey and said I have an idea for the car design? Adrian would say stick to driving bro, I got this
All teams know why Mercedes stuck with the concept, because it still has more potential than the Red Bull / Ferrari concepts.  They made some solid progress last year and so with the floor being raised this year they were hoping that they could unleash the potential of the concept.  The problem is that the concept has such tight tolerances, is finicky and will be difficult to get it working but if/when they do they'll be able to challenge for the championship(s) again.  These types of aggressive concepts rarely work because of how complex they are and how they introduce other issues; it's the same as how McLaren went for size zero before, if you get it working it's faster. The problem is it affected their cooling and thus the engine + their engine was underpowered + they had issues with balance.
He specifically specified that he wanted the fastest car
He wanted made of gold and with diamond rims
Didn't know Lewis was an engineer or aerodynamisist.
Could also have made the car worse of course.
We know. Both have said so. Lets move on to something else insignificant?
Oh really...hmm
L
Wonder what his ideas were ?
I wish someone pressed either Toto or Lewis and actually made them get specific on this topic. What part of the car does he mean specifically. Development can mean so many things. This is such a constant vague, nothing statement that gets thrown out.  As much as Lewis is good at driving the car and as much as he can give feedback about set up, which is different than design, he might as well be Hellen fucking Keller when it comes to overall car design and its hundreds of subsytems and how they interact with each other.  There are probabaly dozens of PhDs at work designing a car, what the fuck is Lewis Hamilton or any other driver going to tell them about how to design a car? Hamilton can describe driving outcomes, but that does not go into the deep design frameworks and approaches early on enough in the overall car development.
It all comes back to the same point, Merc believe the data more than the feedback of the drivers.  No wonder Hamilton was pissed post testing
Honestly, in general car developement between seasons, the engineers are the far more qualified people to make decisions. Sure, the drivers should be able to give some input, but their feedback is much more valuable when they can actually race the car.   Drivers like Norris don't even know what torque is, you think they are able to run aero simulations in their head? We are talking about fractions of a percent of performance difference here, it's just not possible for the drivers to participate meaningfully in purely theoretical developement.
For the same reason Ferrari is still using their concept.  These things are decided way in advance and any course correction especialy as big as a full on concept change takes time.  Which is why i doubt we see any big changes for either until next year.
The basic development and design is decided around mid season for the next season, so all developments are on top of this base concept.      If the concept is wrong (be it zero pod or the drivers sitting ao far ahead), then the concept and the following pipeline needs to change, as by winter break their design is already fixed with upgrade paths for the first races of the season.      For them to change the concept means re-evaluating everything that works or doesn't work and also deciding, designing and building the new concept with a few iterations in cfd and small scale testing (wind tunnel). This all takes half an year or more.
A bit of a mess really - seems the Brazil win gave them false hope.
>Why didn't they change direction then?  An F1 car has hundreds of systems all working together. Changing one has up and down stream effects on everything else. Then you factor in time, sourcing, testing, and money restraints, and you can't just build two, three, or four different F1 cars in a season.  For better or worse, the cards you show at Race 1 largely determine your whole season.
The idea of concept is kind of nebulous, as in everything that goes into it, it's a broad spectrum, and the development pathways are decided months in advance. They set targets they believed were correct but the race pace exceeded that.  I remember last year that Toto was signalling potential trouble when he mentioned in pressers they were on the precipice of deciding the development pathway, as in a few weeks away from it being locked in and I didn't read good things from the way it was being said, like there was a split in opinion and they had to make hard decisions. For whatever reason it was not in Lewis favour.   I think now they are saying minimum that Lewis disagreed with insistence to develop this concept, particularly because he feels it's hard to drive.
They weren’t sure it before testing yet, at that time it was somewhat of an A-spec car, with a more complete version planned to slowly appear with updates.  As to what’s going on, Lewis let slip that he wasn’t satisfied with the stability of the rear end of the car, and this comment from Toto suggests he mentioned this already last winter.
Someone in charge doubled down and now they can't replace them because there has been a colossal exchange of higher up personel lately.
One of the things that Hamilton objected to is how much further forward the driver has to sit in the cockpit. That kind of chassis design consideration would have been finalized pretty early on - like April-June of the previous year? - and once you start designing around it, it can’t really be changed. Especially in a cost effective and fast way. So winter would’ve been way too late for at least some of his issues.
They can’t just change an entire concept in a few months
"discover" is a pretty strong word.  It was probably more like "suspect".
Elliot was so confident that they knew what they needed to fix.  Not sure if it is correlation issues, but then they would not have known in the winter they were wrong.  Confused, based on what did they then decide that this is the direction to go ?
Simple… Ego.
Is the direction really wrong though? The W14 is much faster than last year's Red Bull. Regulations have changed little.  Mercedes is already the second best car, third race in Fernando already can't catch Lewis.  The problem is that Red Bull improved on their car as well and they are stilll the fastest. Mercedes should have enough wind tunnel time to further decrease the difference.  I think this whole crying by Mercedes is them desperately trying to fly under the radars. Don't forget that by the end of 2022 season not only Mercedes was clearly ahead of Ferrari (who debuted the season with a championship winning car), but was also clearly giving Red Bull a run for their wins (I believe strategies fucked up at least 2 win chances by Lewis), and was even the fastest car at Interlagos, Red Bull just couldn't challenge Mercedes there.  Thus, I don't believe this whole "we fucked up", or "no sidepods were a bad idea" or "someone else thought something else". Mercedes is faster than 8 of the other teams with sidepods, their design has definitely merits we don't understand, including teams with the same engine.
This story is being kept alive by clickbait content pages to create fake drama. Everyone knows an F1 car is so complicated that end of the day Hamilton has no idea how it’s actually done. But just keep repeating it over and over and you get a nice headline of Hamilton and Mercedes drama.
Time and money
Do you think they can just redesign, test, and build a new concept in a couple weeks? Do you legitimately think the entirety of an F1 car and all of the parts and their interactions with one another is as simple as printing a new t shirt design? Nike probably takes 6 months to put out a new variation of an existing shoe model, you think an F1 car would be quicker than that?
> Why didn't they change direction then?  i mean they could have but they'd just end up with a half way measure a la McLaren. better to understand what you have at least then you know if your calculations correlate with real life
The cost cap.  It’s made changing course all but impossible, because the sink cost fallacy has become the no-money-left tautology.
Maybe too expensive to change direction when they already made the car part/the whole car maybe. So they trying to change it through upgrades instead
This is the first year of the team price cap, it's not cheap or easy to develop a car let alone redevelop a car midway through the process... especially custom supercars
wind tunnel time.  They used up a bunch and while yes, they can change concepts, but it would mean they won't have enough time to fully develop out the new concept and they may be very much worse than where they are now even with a new concept.
IIRC from a recent interview I listened to, the foundation of the car is locked in around March/April. It was def too late to change structural philosophy by the winter.
"Wrong concept" and yet they have the second fastest car on the grid and they were competing for wins by the end of 2022.  People are buying too much into the whole "we built the wrong car", no they didn't, they built the second best car out there, but you can't pretend you build every single year for a decade the very best. Sometimes someone will design something better, that's life.  But keeping this narrative that they designed a disaster of a car is beyond ridiculous.
>George has said they all agreed on that but now it's come out they didn't?  It's possible that the agreement was of the "fine, I don't think that's the correct direction, but I'm ok going with your expertise for the time being" variety.   There's a vast gulf between "we are all enthusiastic about this direction" and "we all grudgingly agree that we need to pick a direction because we're on a strict time limit, so let's go with this one."
The difference between being alignment and agreement, I think.
Personally, I don't take ***anything*** Russell says at face value, he's the ultimate PR robot.
Imploded?  Honestly this is just media looking for headlines. Of the top four teams, Merc is the only one worth talking about, so all the focus is on them  Red Bull: Dominating, expected to dominate all year. Only story is if Checo can compete, not much to write about there.  Aston Martin: Darling of the ball, everyone is stoked. The only thing you can ask is "Is it sustainable, and will it improve". Again, not great for articles.  Ferrari: .....Doing Ferrari things.  Merc: Openly admitting the concept is wrong, and working on a new one. Everyone is obviously interested in the new one, and what it means, when we'll see it, etc.
Hubris is whats going on.  Mercedes got used to dominating and didn't have to drastically alter their car since 2017, arguably 2014. Red Bull had to rework their car multiple times from 2014-2021, running two different power units with totally different concepts.   Mercedes bungled the 2022 regulation change, but they were too confident in themselves and their design to change it. The no-pods concept might have worked in their wind tunnel, but it clearly wasn't working on track that year. They got tricked by one good result in Brazil into committing to it for an entire additional year.   I fully believe, based on no evidence whatsoever, that they stuck with the no pods thing for so long because they really wanted to come up with some radical cool concept to show off. They didn't want to abandon it because they would have to admit they aren't the top team anymore, even if that was becoming clear to everyone else.
I feel like Toto is losing it since Lauda has passed away.
No, it worked, they just under estimated the acceptable target.   Redbull and AM and possibly Ferrari if they ever get themselves together are .3 to a second up on racepace, and that's Redbull at a lazy 10HP down.   The ceiling they accepted is too low. The car that was on pole last year would be 12th this year.
That doesn't tally with what they said earlier as Toto said they hit their targets but evidently those targets weren't high enough with others improvements
It was the wind tunnel model, reportedly. And only reported by one publication that I’ve seen. I’d take it with a large pinch of salt. That would imply a systematic breakdown at their factory and I find it unlikely they’d have locked out 2nd/3rd in the third race had that been the case.
> and firing people responsible for it  Was this reported in F1 news media and/or "rumors" from "sources". Because it goes against Merc's famous "NO BLAME" policy...  I'm not naive enough to completely drink the Merc kool-aid about their "No blame" policy. I'm just more curious if there has been news reports of this happening...  Thanks!
I mean Lewis is not an engineers or "aero wizard".    The only true thing could be he just said "I don't know man" about continuing their concept. The theory he actually had another idea is absolutely insane to me and I don't understand why this article/post is so popular.
I hadn't thought of that. It is strange that Lewis is suddenly saying no-one is listening to him, I don't remember that being an issue in the past. And his comments about not being able to feel the rear and sitting too far away from it (or close to the front) appears to be legit. Seems like they really did just ignore the drivability aspect for their design to work. Shame.  Edit: Just watched James Allison on YouTube explaining they are bringing suspension upgrades to adjust the car balance. He said they are specifically doing this to improve drivability and driver confidence. It could be something that achieves nothing on paper or even adds some drag/weight, but is a net positive for the pilots to feel and predict the limits of the car and push.
Sounds spectacular. But what’s this based on?
This is it. The engineers are in charge and when you have someone like Russell who seems to be a company man then the engineers can use that as confirmation bias. They need someone to act in a similar role, maybe try to get in Vettel.
This is the truth, no one at Merc besides Lewis would admit it.
That was my first thought as well.
Pardon my ignorance, but what do drivers have to offer by way of engineering in modern era F1? They give feedback on the drivability of the car, sure. And engineers should take that feedback into account when pursing changes and upgrades, 100% agreed. But why would I put more weight into your hunch regarding aero design over the person I hired with a PhD in aeronautics?
This
Yeah I agree sadly.  Wolff was saying last year that they reckoned RBR was right but if they just followed them 6 months later they'd probably always be 6 months behind. I remember when the Merc launched and everyone was afraid, Newey was saying nothing on it surprised him, but he was surprised they went that way. Kiss of death.  Mark Hughes was saying recently that AM have really shown Merc what they got wrong in the sense they (AM) swallowed their pride and went transparently along the RBR route, and have come out ahead of Merc from nowhere. A microwaved RBR is better than an oven-cooked Merc.  A little yellow flag for me was actually Brazil 2022, when Hamilton said Merc still went into each weekend clueless if they'd be fighting for 6th or 3rd. Always felt a bit 'they haven't truly cracked it', knowing that so late.  No, I agree with Hughes that Hamilton's demeanour recently reflects a degree of acceptance he's probably not getting his eighth.
At the same time, I expect them to hover around 0.3-0.9% off the whole time until they swing back up at the front in mid-late 2024 or early 2025. I'm not so hopeful about Ferrari once Red Bull start bringing developments to this years car - last years car went nowhere. Ferrari I think will be on the low end of that scale, perhaps even another .2-.3% more.
I think they will bring a new chassis to Imola. I know they’ve spoken about keeping the no pods but at the same time they said it will look radically different so I think they decided before the first race to bite the bullet but they don’t want to outright say it at the moment.
Honestly this whole regulation period is all Red Bull. Late V10 era was all Ferrari before that it was Williams then Mclaren. V8 was all Red Bull following the aero regulation change. Turbo Hybrid was all Mercedes and first ground effect will be all Red Bull. It’s just how F1 works. It’s like empires, unprecedented domination for a while until something topples them, and no one will believe it will happen until it does. Honesty it’s just how F1 works. It used to be the top teams developed a far superior concept and could just throw money at it making it better and better while their rivals struggled to catch up now it’s the exact opposite. The cost cap means any team with a significant advantage has it pretty much locked in for years since the other teams can’t spend the money needed to catch up. Sure it’d help with overall parity but I have a feeling these regs will have the unfortunate side effect of essentially locking in advantages for a good period of time.   I don’t expect anyone to pose a significant threat until 2026 depending on how drastic those changes are, but it’d also worth noting Red Bull will no longer have the Honda rocket in the back of their car anymore and it will be their first time fully developing F1 powertrains so it’s possible they might miss the mark there. At the same time they basically poached all the magicians responsible for the Mercedes missile and plenty of other top tier powertrain engineers so they might only improve upon what they already have. I’m also not sure if they will be allowed to continue to use the Honda power plant as a base for that era and develop it on their own or if Honda owns that IP and they’ll have to build from scratch
Why would he? That outcome, impressive as it may be, was more track-related than the Mercs suddenly being somewhat good. Even then, they were still miles behind RB.
Always be pushing
They were miles off the pace of the RBs, why would he be?
Max overtook and within a lap or two was 3 seconds ahead, of course Lewis wouldn't be happy
All these people replying don't realise that you're not talking about performance, you are talking about how comfortable he is when driving the car😂
It didn't look like that was something that could be changed easily, and he did say the car was better in races; it's in quali that his discomfort really impedes him since he can't fully push
100%  Bottas mentioned this multiple times, Lewis mentions it this season because he says he just can't get a feel for the car, and therefore can't push the car to the limit, and Toto just confirmed it.  So yes, drivers aren't engineers, but they clearly are helpful in developing a car, especially when the engineers are ending up with the wrong data due to their own mistakes.  And the car is bad, so that's on the engineers.
Which is so incredibly dumb lol. Drivers are like the best all around sensors you could get. Sure, quality of feedback would vary a lot but something tells me Lewis can give some very valuable info.
The fact a formula 1 team trusts computer simulation more than two top tier drivers with 32 years of experience between them one of whom had seven world championships and the other a master qualifier w a handful of race victories is absurd to me. They know things that a computer sim simply can’t take into account or even consider in its models. You’d think you’d trust your driver who’s considered one of the GOATs of the sport and is also notorious for his exceptional feedback and developmental acumen. On the other hand that does sound exactly in line with how a large German corporation would run their operations. The models can’t be wrong, right? They’re computers after all not unreliable human beings lmao
I don't believe much this whole narrative that they don't listen to the drivers.
Yeah, I think for me the biggest thing is that they doubled down on what they knew was a bad concept.  The engineers are to blame, or whoever told them to keep developing the previous car.  We should have had an entirely new Mercedes this season, with nothing to do with last season, because that car was a disaster. Their freak win in Brazil meant nothing.
Considering Mercedes’ bullet proof reliability, that came immediately to mind when I saw Merc’s jump in pace and Russell’s engine failure. Yet not one comment about that possibility from the broadcast.
I don’t think it’s black and white as you imply.   The driver is the one who actually extracts the lap time. If they need something to extract that lap time it doesn’t make sense to disregard what they are saying. Especially when they have almost 2 decades of experience driving F1 cars and another almost 2 decades racing other cars.   What makes sense on paper doesn’t always make sense in practice.
Hell no. Driver confidence is everything, even in road cars where the margin of error is a hell of a lot larger.  Randy Pobst once said Ferrari engineers told him "We know all the parameters of that Nissan(R35), we've put it in the simulator and there's no way it's going that fast.(around Nurburgring)"  Randy simply replied "Driver confidence!"  Oh and remember the SF-23 is suppose to be "a second quicker in the simulator"?
I disagree, they've got smart engineers who don't drive, he knows what's stable, drivable, responsive and he significantly contributed to the development of the 2017 car and continued to push a direction through to 2020.   By ignoring the best measuring gauge they've got in the most successful driver of all time I think they've kinda effed up.   They've gained a little focusing on possibly suspension, but it's not going to jump the way it should. Lewis still said it's difficult to drive and he doesn't trust it, and if you compare the other fast cars it's deployment in and out of corners still sucks
The drivers drive the car though. In Saudi Nico spoke about the engineers not seeing eye to eye with the drivers because they don’t actually get the feel of the car.
The car could be the fastest possible on paper and in the wind tunnel. But if it's undriveable then it's not going to be fast on track. All the data in the world doesn't matter if the guy sitting in the car driving it can't make it work.
You pay an f1 goat premium salary who has 15 years of experience in driving  f1 car and not listen to his feedback?
I bet Toto is very relieved now that u/mtojay of reddit 100% confirmed his decision.
But the engineers keep saying the car looks great in the wind tunnel and the simulations, and everything's apparently going to plan, yet the car performs like ass & the drivers keep saying that they can't feel an improvement in the car.  How long do you trust the numbers & simulations instead of what the drivers and laptimes are telling you? 6 months? 12? 18?  Mercedes kept bringing upgrades last year, and the car did not improve. They only did well at some tracks like Zandvoort & Brazil due to track conditions & track surface suiting the car. It was due to luck because they went straight back to being shit in Monza & Abu Dhabi, directly following their good races.
When you have (arguably) one of the greatest F1 drivers ever in your team you’d need to have a pretty massive ego to think you know better than him as an engineer.    Merc admitted themselves that what they were seeing on the track and hearing from the drivers didn’t correspond with what they saw in the wind tunnel and sims.    Fundamental breakdown between the engineers and the drivers for Merc imho.
I remember in 2012 Hamilton saying McLaren needed to switch philosophy. Thanks for that, man.
I agree, i dont see why Lewis has been saying what he has. It doesnt really benefit anyone and his technical knowledge probably wasnt the reason for his opinion, it’s probably just luck to be honest
Exactly. As much as Lewis is a world class driver he’s still the driver. I’m sure his input is very well heard but he doesn’t know enough to understand if the concept should be this or that. He can say he prefers one route but there are so many nuances that’s really not the defining part of the car.  I don’t really understand why Lewis said this and Toto is backing him up instead of just letting it be forgotten
Engines don't affect the drivability of the car while the aerodynamic characteristics do, so it only makes sense for them to consult the drivers about the later.
It's not engine development, it's more aero, stability, suspension etc it's handling. The engine just does it's thing and they exploit it
What really would the requests from the drivers be apart from more power and reliability
"I want engine fast af and reliable af"
The engines got locked in before 2022 so teams can only bring upgrades under the guise of reliability.
Many. Yes, in basic terms. The Williams is a low drag car, but isn't great in the corners. RBR's have traditionally been great in corners and worse on straights. But there are so many different variations and ways to go about it. Also, how the car uses its tyres is down to aero and the design of the car.
Car development is months in advance, the decision was made way before Brazil.   To be fair Spain for example was a very good race, Hungary they got pole as well i think races like that made them believe they could fix the design, last year i remember they saying that the suspension was the issue and of course they couldn't fix that during the season.   They were wrong but these things aren't just "lmao just put sidepods on" they take time and a lot of development and planning i would assume, then you have the simulation issues they had in pre season and the massive correlation issues the whole of last season.
What is the evidence that they stuck with their concept because of Brazil?
Side pods don't make the concept, nor are they a cure their current car. The whole car has to work together, side pods are just a piece of that puzzle.
That normal sidepod concept was a second slower by their estimation. They would need probably a whole season to make it work
I think it's going to happen more often.  Red Bull isn't going to take risks anymore on starts. They know they have so much speed with DRS, so they just wait for the right time.  Look at Verstappen, passed Hamilton with DRS and then then pulled a gap for no DRS for hamilton.
Well max got an exceptionally poor start and decided to play ultra safe in the opening moments. Lewis put in a great performance but I wouldn’t say it was indicative of anything to put stock into in terms of performance.
He may get ahead again for a few laps, but Max and Checo will zoom past him.
He was never in front of Max on merit.
Because second is still first loser to them. Because they are still a second off the pace. The attitude that they aren't good enough when they are still front runners is exactly why they ended up winning 8 constructors championships in a row. It is only acceptable to be the best.
Some teams chase excellence not mediocrity.
Why do you think the Schumacher era was so successful? It's because Todt and Brawn had complete conviction in Michael. If he wanted to go a certain direction in car development or wanted something changed, they did it. They never treated him like they knew better.  This is also what's been successful in RB with Max, The best drivers know not just what makes a car comfortable for themselves but also what makes it fast.  This seems to be gone in merc, Niki Lauda's success came largely from very much the same thing but without him at merc it seems like the engineers don't value what the drivers want in development direction.
This is such a petty take because we know he is qualified to give direction on a development route or rule out a car because it lacks handling and consistency and pretty much everything that you would want in a car. This is Sir Lewis Hamilton, the most successful driver of all time and every other great driver from Stirling Moss to Michael Schumacher to Prost, to Mansell and Seb has talked about his level of talent, even his biggest rival of the current era Max Verstappen acknowledges him as one of the greats.  If the man says this car is lacking the car is f****** lacking.
You forgot fashion icon and google map enthusiast
That’s a really bad straw man argument you’ve got going there.  Everyone is aware that Lewis and Toto are not going to be able to give an expert technical breakdown of where to improve the car.  That doesn’t mean that feedback in less technical terms is not useful, irrelevant or otherwise.  Nobody is saying that Lewis is an engineer or has a PhD.  But for you to be so obtuse and ask what is Lewis going to tell them about designing a car is disingenuous as fuck and it begs the question- on what grounds do you feel confident in saying lewis’ input on car design is useless?   You’re on Reddit with the rest of us speculating while Lewis is approaching 20 years in the sport.  You’re just not in a position to say what you said.  For you to just carelessly claim that he can’t contribute to car design is a lazy, low information, appeal to the lowest common denominator rubbish take.
So you missed the part where he explicitly stated that the position where he and George are sitting in the car is too far forward?  His lack of formal education in engineering is irrelevant as it pertains to how the car drives.  There’s real world performance and computer sims.  The real world performance is literally all that matters.  I highly doubt that the only feedback lewis gave engineers was “hey guys the car doesn’t look right!”
You have to be silly too if you thought he just said "it looks off" or "it didn't look right" and that this whole disagreement is based on that alone.
That does not mean that Max can't have a suggestion based on which something good can come out of... Being closeminded like you said would be idiotic.   Why is Adrian on the grid looking at other cars to search for ideas that his team did not come up with?
This, Ferrari have realised their ceiling is lower than needed and they have to completely rework their floor and suspension concepts, but that U-turn takes months
Here’s a quote from Toto at Jeddah. "I think that the car is going to look very different in five, six or seven races based on the decisions that we have taken and the development direction that we have embarked on." I don’t think it’s wild to say the car could look very different in the next couple months.
Yes just look at McLaren. They started a new development direction even before the end of last season, and they are only going to be able to get the new development on the car more than 2 months late. People don’t fully appreciate the massive lead times in this sport.  It’s one thing to recognize you need a different concept. It then takes months of development and testing to produce a design cohesive and mature enough to actually put on the car. All the parts designs need to be finalized and actually built, which itself takes a huge amount of time, not to mention that you need to schedule all of this production around everything else you’re already producing (it’s not like the teams are running a lot of spare capacity, especially early in the season)
Also even if they basically copied Red Bull they'd still be behind on understanding and possible developments for this season.  Both Ferrari and Mercedes were close to Red Bull at points last season (or in Ferrari's case, ahead at some races), so it basically becomes "Should we try to get the most out of our concept in 2023 and hope that our developments are enough to be ahead of Red Bull for one season and then accept 2024 will be difficult, or do we accept that Red Bull will be faster in 2023 and hope that we can out-develop them on their own concept for 2024?"  Aston Martin, for example, could throw away their old concept last season because it was obvious they were nowhere near, and then take heavy inspiration from Red Bull for their B-spec car last year, and their current car this year. But for Mercedes and Ferrari that choice was not as obvious.
The flaws of cost cap are really becoming apparent from the top teams. I kind of hate that they’re not able to course correct by throwing money at it; it’s pretty boring for the viewer.
And money
There’s a big difference between “we realize we’ve fucked up” and “we realized we’ve fucked up, understand what to do next instead, and have had time to do it.”
Halfway thru last season they were still struggling lol
Its weird though because all last year they were vocal that they had made an error early in development and just needed to wait until everything reset to implement the fixes and changes
Surely they had decided on the next year's car before Brazil.
Brazil is way too late in the season for fundamental concept changes. That race was in November.   The car concept would have been decided months before that and at the time Mercedes still believed they had a good concept if they could just get rid of the compromises they had to make to overcome the porpoising.
4D chess by Red Bull
I doubt that. They knew they were the only top team that fully gambled on a dry setup for the races. They knew it was a bit of a fluke.
I'm hoping that Australia didn't do the same thing - again.
Red Bull playing 4D Chess right there.
>A bit of a mess really - seems the Brazil win gave them false hope.  I wouldn't' say totally false. Like, they were making improvements. in 2022, they went from solidly 3rd to contending/beating Ferrari about halfway through the season and almost took 2nd in the constructors. There werea  couple tracks where they were4 beginning to being able to compete if the situation was perfect. And by most accounts, they improved over last year.  The problem is that while Merc gained some speed and expected to be (say) 1/2 a second behind RB to start, RB gained like 1.5 over everyone..so MERC is still like 1-2 seconds off their pace.   Like, qualifying was close in Q1, close in Q2, close in Q3...then Max/RB sends it and beats everyone by half a second in a lap where Max isn't even perfect. And they're beating everyone by 30+ seconds. While not even pushing their car after the first 5-10 laps.
It's all about perspective right. Maybe to some they built a pretty decent car because after all it is still faster than most of the field (although I'm not sure it's the second fastest). But for a team that's so used to building the fastest car overall, these last two cars must feel almost like a failure to them.
Spot on. The question about the right concept is less about their current performance, given how close they are to Red Bull, and more about how much potential is left. If there’s a lot more potential to extract, why not stick with it and try to outdevelop Red Bull?
Yup,   that was my interpretation of their “agreement”.   I cannot imagine a world where a professional athlete over 30 sees a strategy they don’t like and stays quiet about it. Championship winner or not, you’re going to hear what I have to say.   I’m running out of time here and I’m not going to waste it because you’re easily butthurt.
I think he’s only a robot because he’s had to be, his entire F1 career thus far has basically been perform on track, don’t fuck up off it and you’ll eventually land in one of the top 3 seats on the grid.
That's funny because he's been pretty much spot on about where they are in every interview so far while Lewis acts like the Merc is in the bottom 5.
Merc: no mistakes.
Got a source for the last claim? That's crazy
Probably no one thought that RedBull would be one of the teams with the biggest improvements. RB19 is at minimum 1.5 seconds faster than RB18.  Mercedes and Ferrari improved a good amount from last year, but RedBull went crazy.
yeah they did also say that, I guess all we can assume so far is that the brazil win seems to have driven them in the wrong direction with their current concept.
Putting my tin foil hat   - After winter development, Merc found conflicted dimensions in their wind tunnel models. - Merc fire the staff responsible for it. - Merc keep it lowkey as possible to avoid another PR meltdown after 2022 or promises after Brazil 2022 win. - Merc corrects wind tunnel car model. - Bahrain confirmed their doubts irl through car setup?.. Hence, toto after bahrain know where they want to go with this concept. - Merc now in full force developing.  Thanks for coming to my tedtalk.
Merc locked out 2/3 by chance more than judgement. Checo royally fucked his quali and he should have been ahead, and as far as i can tell ferrari also kinda messed their quali timing up.
>"It turned out that some parts used in the wind tunnel (to scale) were inaccurate and produced outside the permitted tolerances. These problems have not only affected the development of the W14, with the delays we talked about just before the presentation, but also in terms of correlation. This also led to the dismissal of some people who followed the production."   [Source formu1a.uno article](https://www.formu1a.uno/retroscena-mercedes-ritardi-e-simulazioni-errate-anche-a-causa-di-parti-fuori-tolleranza-testate-in-galleria/)  Arguably the most trusted news source in formula 1 reported this.
Engineers not listening to a driver is frankly bizarre.
If you look at where the Merc drivers are seated it’s a good deal further up than the RB drivers. I’m no F1 driver but it seems like being slightly lower and closer to the driven wheels would give you a much better seat feel of what the car is doing and how much grip you have and where you’re losing it. Seems like a fundamental oversight to have their drivers further up then anyone else especially since Lewis is a driver who really connects with the car through the seat of his pants. For some drivers it’s steering feedback like Alonso or front end sharpness/responsiveness like Kimi but Lewis has said he really connects with the car through his bum so this setup really seems disadvantageous for a driver like that.
> I don't remember that being an issue in the past.  because the cars were already quick?
I heard the reason why they didn't take lewis' suggestions is due to the salary cap thats been placed on teams.  Before, engineers could entertain drivers suggestions and put something together and see if it works or not.  But now with limits on spending they can't just take and try every suggestion as testing, modifying and development all cost big bucks.
Hopes and dreams
[Toto has mentioned the impact that Niki being gone has had on the team.](https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.wolff-admits-to-missing-niki-lauda-during-difficult-times-for-mercedes.4rBGI4g5eVjzW5RB3CbFNz.html)
No where does it imply Hamilton was suggesting anything related to aerodynamics. Almost certainly related to drivability and balance.
Could be things like weight distribution or stiffness, maybe positioning of the seat. Let's also not forget that he has been through several years of car changes and can likely identify when something isn't feeling right. So it's not allowing him to extract 100% from the car. He can tell the engineers from previous experience what impact certain changes will have on the cars handling.   We've seen many times that taking what is in theory and on paper the best approach,  isn't always the absolute best option, not just in cars but also other areas. Taking different approaches allows for different perspectives and can open new doors that weren't know before.
Because not everything works on paper and simulation will ensure that it will work in real like
Because it doesn't matter what all your numbers say if the car drives like shit and there's another faster car out there
Found the Merc engineer guys.
In science there's the theoretical part and there's the practical part. It doesn't matter how good you think your theory is if it doesn't work in real life. Engineers are in charge of the theory while the drivers are in charge of the practical part.
Why would you *not* put the weight of someone who's driven a multitude of different cars in different generations that has also won an absurd amount of championships?  A PhD means nothing.  Applied knowledge and creative collaboration of peoples skill-sets is what makes great things happen.  McLaren is currently engineering run. See how well that's been going for them.
Better 6 months behind than 24 though surely? Really don't get Mercedes strategy last year and this year, they knew the concept was flawed last year but stuck with it anyway, it's the definition of insanity.
I don't know if I trust AM are actually faster than Mercedes right now. It does seem like they could jump them next year if Merc don't figure a lot out very quickly.
And now, he might have his 7th (chronological his 1st) stripped from him.
I don't see Ferrari ever properly returning to the front. They completely lack the work environment a modern F1 team needs
No lol. They can’t bring a new chassis in a cost cap era. Wolff has said that so many times already.
Lol besides someone who's won more times than anyone in history  is not going to be satisfied 2nd.
It’s even funnier when you consider that like 3 people all decided chip in too, already making the same irrelevant point 😂
"Drivers aren't Engineers"  *sad Jabouille noises  Jk I know you mean in Modern F1
Yup. Might be great to have the theoretically fastest car possible but if for whatever reason the characteristics of the car don't allow the drivers to maximize its potential it may be worse than having a slightly slower but easier car to drive.  I remember Lando said he prefers having a car that gives him the confidence to push rather than having the fastest car possible if it doesn't give him that confidence. I think he was talking more around setup but it's a similar principle.  A few years ago Peter Prodromou (who is McLaren's newly appointed Technical Director of Aerodynamics) was asked about RB's "secret" and said this:  >RBR's big secret? Listening to the driver. An F1 car is orders of magnitudes of variables. Aerodynamics you have yaw, pitch etc., engines have (many), chassis has (many). And so the cars have 'unreal' numbers of objective sensors. But they won't tell you the symptoms, like 'entry understeer'. 'Drivers are the sensors engineers forget'. **They can pick out the things that matter.**
It varies though - some drivers (iirc DC being one) are extremely good development drivers, able to relate to the engineers how changes affect the car in a way that they can use.  However, that was in the days of empirical testing - put the driver in the car and get out on track, these days with almost purely digital testing such an approach can't be used.
Lewis’ idea might also have been slow.  We don’t know for comparison.   If they went too far in giving away balance/feel in order to chase theory, I think I largely agree with you.  Feels more like art than science.
This thread is pretending that this season is the first in this car. I know it's updated, but Lewis had an entire season in the car to tell them that it didn't feel right and he didn't trust it to go where he wanted it to. After a season of not listening, it's on the engineers if they deliver a second car that still doesn't feel right and the driver doesn't trust.
look, i am aware that drivers are the ones driving. the name implies that. and of course they are working together with the engineers. especially in finding the right setup and communicating what they like the car to feel and how it feels atm. but this is a completely new formula. with ground effect. its utterly ridicolous to assume that lewis has a better idea on what car concept should be best for the current regulations. lewis himself has also not taken part in a ground effect era before. he has not driven the rb or knows how the other cars in this formula feel. he has exactly 1 car he can judge under these rules. and its totally fair to communicate that the car is not behaving and feeling like he wants to. but for merc to throw out their complete car concept because lewis thinks/feels its wrong and take his word over countless engineers is quite frankly ridicolous
Thank you
> When you have (arguably) one of the greatest F1 drivers ever in your team you’d need to have a pretty massive ego to think you know better than him as an engineer.   i would argue 100% exactly the opposite. if you have an engineering team that won 8 out of the last 9 wccs. and nailed the regs last regulations to an extend like the sport has barely seen before you need to have a pretty massive ego to think you know better than them as a driver
No way man. The driver could have some input but they don't know nearly as much as the engineers.
Maybe he meant a philosophy where the car doesn't break down every other race
lmfao you’re right. stupid question
Better sound
VTECH
Copy whatever Adrian Newey decides is probably a great tactic. If you dare to differ you’re probably going wrong.
Newey got tired of his cars losing on the straights they decided to go full on straight line speed
ok thanks for the info
I think its a stretch to say Verstappen got an exceptionally poor start. Russell just had an amazing one & Hamilton pulled off a really good move on lap 1.  And Im tracking lol thats why I mentioned I would be surprised to see Lewis in front of Max on track again because Red Bull don’t make a lot of mistakes & Mercedes is a good bit off
Exactly! He's doing what Lewis was doing before 2021. Why get into lap 1 squabbles and get damage when you have a car advantage?
I think Lewis made the difference on the start and first few corners but ultimately the car wasn’t fast enough to keep him there. Same with Fernando in Jeddah.
He overtook him.  Unless you have a different definition of "merit".
Nobody knows how other teams are set up, tbh. We just know bits we get in interviews that are often PR speak.   I would guess Michael had much more impact but that is because he raced in era of unlimited testing. If Lewis was allowed to basically live on track where he would test weeks on end - I am guessing his feedback would be better and listened to more keenly. In current era sometimes you just have to make a guess.
I'm not going to pretend to know the inner working of Red Bull. But does anyone believe Adrian Newey is taking notes from Max?
I agree mate , I was Just joking around .
> google map enthusiast  I find endless enjoyment from people who still don't realize the "wow, this blue dot shows where I am" was a joke aimed at people who claimed he had left Melbourne early and was posted to prove he was still there.
Before he drove it I doubt there's much to say other than appearance based feedback.
Especially because changes to one thing require changes to other things. It's not like you can copy RB sidepods leaving everything else like it is and be as good as them.
Also takes millions too. The cost cap has the ugly side effect of basically giving teams patents on good concepts since other teams don't have cap room to adopt them quickly
Is the ceiling an analogy or is it part of the car? Never heard that as a part before but your mention of the floor in the same sentence has me wondering lol.
And whilst you are working on re designin those parts you usually dont have the r&d capacity to develop other erea's
Ferrari was stoked about the potential before the season started.  So I think the gains they are seeing in the off-season aren’t translating to competitiveness in season.  So they either have a correlation issue or performance targets which were too low.
I'm honestly kind of banking on it.  Mercedes knew last year they needed to make some massive changes, and they told us months ago the Baku package would be the first step of it.  I'm actually really happy with how they've performed this far, but its honestly feeling like pre season until Baku
Ferrari is also bringing new sidepods and floor to Imola or Barcellona.
Halfways through last season they were already competing with Ferrari, and by the end of the season they were generally faster than Ferrari, and in some occasions they could win races.  At Interlagos they even had the fastest package.  I think Mercedes this year is incredibly fast, their car is probably the second best on the field and they are faster than 8 of the other cars that have different sidepods.
People read into that as meaning they'd made a mistake with the aero concept when Mercedes didn't actually disclose what they were referring to, only that there had been mistakes. It could have been anyone of a number of things but reporters just assumed it was the aero package.  With this year's car, flaws were found during development, but by the time they were found they were too far down the path. It's better to keep going with a car that's 80% finished than scrap the whole thing and start over with maybe only 2 months until the season opener.
They just say they made a design error that was fundamental. Everyone thought that meant aero but I think it was chassis and that's why it wasn't solvable with the budget cap.
Yeah I keep seeing this take and it's a bad one.  By the time they got to Brazil it was clear that they needed to make some fundamental changes, and they were openly admitting it. It's not like they stopped going down the new path just because of one race.
Sacrifice 1 race and win next year’s championship  Best trade deal in the history of trade deals
They learnt well from Merc
It's not an exact 1 to 1 match, but in Bahrain, pole in 2022 was a 1.30.558 and in 2023 pole was a 1.29.708  P8 in that Quali (2023) was Stroll who set a 1.30.836  P7 was Hamilton with a 1.30.384  The cars are a bit quicker year over year it would seem.
I’ve seen theories involving far greater quantities of tin foil this. I saw someone on another forum suggesting it was intentional sabotage.   I would imagine there’s some element of truth to it but what has been reported is inaccurate and likely the effects of whatever happen were amplified.   Until we get more info I’m inclined to believe the issues lie elsewhere.
you seem to underestimate how difficult it is fire and hire a bunch of engineers, or even reassign.
This is very light on the tin foil, I like it
Hmmmmm...  Accurate, it seems like. And that's why Toto is agreeing with Hamilton, telling him to chill and fucking with the media narrative...  Merc is in full sandbagging mode.

Yeah they were.   But they still had to develop it to maintain that lead.   It’s not like they just said “fuck it, let’s take the next 6 years off”.
Yet, if there were 2 Valterris in the W12 or 2 Sergios in the RB16B, we’d be having very different conversations about “quick” or “quicker” cars right now. The point being, engineers get stuck in their own heads and are always going to trust the data, while the drivers are going to trust their feel. The link between the data and correlation to the real world is the driver.
Yeah, well, easy to say now.  Shovlin said there were aspects of the 2022 car that were the strongest on the grid, which led them, Siren-like, to continue.
Lol. Can't see that
Not a chance lol
To me it’s a culture thing.  That “brand over everything” environment can work when you’re winning but it can become incredibly toxic and stifle growth when you aren’t.  It makes it feel less like a team and more like a bunch of individual employees that are all replaceable if they don’t live up to what they think the brand demands.    Just seems like they create an environment that adds more stress and might deter being innovative.
Binotto, with all his flaws, was trying to make Ferrari a proper modern F1 team. He was not great at it, but he was on the right path.  With firing him and the return of political infightings, Ferrari is fully back to their early 2010s bs.
AM did last year
See; Red Bull 2019/20. Fast as fuck boy, but nobody other than Max can point it in the right direction.
Excellent quote, appreciate the addition.
That’s slightly different.   Lewis and Wolff have spoken about the mistakes they made in the winter, before the car has even hit the track. When the car is that early in its design stage then you listen to the engineers over the drivers.   Maybe after you get it to the track and you need to tune things driver feedback matters more, but in this context Mercedes were right to follow their engineers over the driver.
While true, last year they knew the concept didn't work yet they continued with it, the drivers knew that it didn't work
I appreciate that and what you’re saying. But I still think a driver knows how they can extract the maximum from a car.
Quite possibly. But I would imagine his ideas were more along the ideas of how a car should behave as opposed to actual design decisions.
You'd be right if lewis gave suggestions like a different sidepod design etc. because he can't really know how that would work out.  But what they seem to mean by a different direction is that there was a disagreement between Lewis and the engineers about "what" they need to achieve with the new car not "how", and in that case it's the driver who knows what they need from a car to get the lap times out.  If you just have the engineers develop the car there's a very high chance that you'll end up with a car that might have good performance but extremely poor drivability.
He drove this same car concept last year, it's hard to handle and provides inconsistent performance, in every way that counts. If it's shit it's shit that's not something Lewis Hamilton gets wrong. It's not a danny.ric situation where One driver can get the most out of a in the other can't both of them a pretty much at the level where they are at.   This concept that they have followed produces shitboxes the difficult to get results out of and consistently slower and stiffer. The problem isn't the communication or the driver's or any other thing beyond a concept is not branching out and numerous people all smart people from other teams particularly Adrian Newy have commented that is surprising but they keep going down that path because it has failed for everyone else.
Yeah, also there is the fact that even if Mercedes copied the Redbull 1:1 the performance probably won't be the same, they still have a different engine and gearbox that can't be changed and will have effect on the weight balance or engine cover shape.
The engineers that won 2014 aren't there anymore, I'd wager. Mercedes got a ton of their best talent poached since their winning years.
The driver has to drive the car.  The engineers egos went unchecked for a bit too long.  If the driver can’t have full confidence in the car, it won’t matter what the engineers have given him.  If Verstappen suddenly can’t feel confident in that RB this season, it doesn’t matter that it’s the fastest car anymore.
A lot of those engineers are at RB and AM.
You are welcome to that opinion but the simple fact is the engineers chose the path they’ve taken now and they’ve been proven to be wrong with their development and design and Merc and Lewis have said numerous times that they decided to not follow the direction Lewis preferred.     And now they are playing catch up to not just red bull but AM too.     At the end of the day any changes they make in the future might help but it’ll be a struggle now for them to catch or surpass what red bull have achieved.
Yeah.   I accept that, but then the engineers appear to have dropped the ball on the Merc car for last year and this one.    And the driver was saying he felt they should go in a different direction, and now they might be?  It looks, from the outside, that the driver was correct.   Depending which way they go and if it actually works of course.
No “H”, mate.   Unless that’s the joke. In that case, I was r/Woooosh’d
Last year, yes. This year, they found some trick with the rear wing and DRS to make it more effective while still giving high downforce so the RBR is better in corners than it was last year...and fast on the straights.
However you want to put it, his start put him at a severe disadvantage.  Doesn’t matter, either way. That particular moment isn’t reliable data to make any sort of overall conclusion. I’d say it’s safe it won’t be the last time but you may have to wait for a particular circuit/conditions for it to happen again.
Yeah, he’s smartened up. Way too many lost points from frivolous endeavours. You learn the hard way, logic has to take over passion eventually
I think you hit the nail on the head. Michael basically lived on the track to improve that Ferrari because he could. That doesn't mean he designed anything of course but setting up a car to the benefit of your best driver is something that he really seemed to push for. With enhanced data collection through technology some of that can obviously be done without ever putting the car on track these days - but its still no surprise to hear Max, Lewis and Alonso especially talk about how important the "feel" of the car is to them.
Absolutely
Yes.
So many of Hams trolling posts go over the heads of people who believe he's kind of dumb.  Why do they believe that? Reasons I guess...
Since you’re embedded in the team and are privy to all of their off season communication and such, let’s take your word for it.
*stares in Aston Martin*
I dont think the reliability stuff helps either. With grid penalties for failures, there is every reason not to push envelope. I am surprised more teams dont push reliability for a couple bigger points hauls then bite the bullet. Maybe increasing the engine allotment by just one would make for a couple more exciting races
Watch Domenicali and the FIA implement a sliding cost cap scale. Williams gets Mercedes's old budget ($400m iirc), RB gets Williams's budget. Although Newey still has a wind tunnel in his head so not sure if it would even out the field as much.
It's not a ugly side. If cost cap didn't exist, Ferrari and Mercedes would be able to do that, but Williams, Haas or Alfa Romeo wouldn't - putting them at a disadvantage and making them unable to challenge the top dogs, since the big teams can just spend a shit load of money to correct any mistakes while the smaller teams are stuck with errors.  This is precisely the kind of thing the cost cap was designed to do: remove the ability from top teams to pay their way out of every problem.
it's way cheaper to copy an existing idea than making it up yourself from scratch, though, so it's not like it's to the level of a patent
I don't think it's as bad as patents.  If several teams come up with similar design strategies they can all use it.  It's not like RB has 'rights' on the overall concept.  If you fucked the first design and went with it, then it's your fault for running with a shit concept.  If you can't afford to switch designs mid-season due to the cost cap, then you have to understand that you took a risk that didn't pay off.
I believe he means ceiling as in highest possible potential.
Ceiling here refers to maximum potential. So by saying that Ferrari's ceiling is lower than Red Bulls, you're actually saying that Ferrari's best possible performance is not as good as Red Bull's best possible performance.
In this case, I think the car’s ceiling means the maximum potential of the car.
It's an an analogy for the potential performance. Some concepts have high ceilings but require a lot of development. Merc and Ferrari are hinting they've got the opposite problem and that their room to develop is not as big as they would like to get up to speed with Red Bull.
It is an analogy I think
Common American sports analogy. Your ceiling is the best you can do. How great can you be with everything going your way? Similarly the floor is the worse case scenario. How bad can bad get for you when everything is going wrong? Some teams' best is higher or lower than others. Some teams' worst is higher or lower than others.
Performance targets were too low, Redbull and AM jump took both Ferrari and Mercedes by surprise and the pack bunched up like they are there
They admitted what it was.  They thought they could slam the car to the ground and it would perform great.  But they weren't able to slam it to the ground due to porposing.  I'm not sure if any other factors also were involved.
Everything on F1 in intertwined, the packaging is hard to change because of the aero for example.  It was most likely a combination of the suspension with aero.  They are 2nd/3rd though this season, so actually quite a good car honestly. RB are just above the rest.
>They just say they made a design error that was fundamental. Everyone thought that meant aero but I think it was chassis and that's why it wasn't solvable with the budget cap.  They admitted as much in one of their debriefs.  [“Come now to Monaco and to Baku, what that unfortunately uncovered is a second issue that was being masked by the first. I’m confident we’ve made a step forward in terms of porpoising, but we very clearly have bouncing, and to the outside it looks almost identical, but there is a subtle difference between the two.”](https://us.motorsport.com/f1/news/mercedes-f1-explains-difference-between-porpoising-and-bouncing/10322631/)
Incoming Merc win in Baku - that’ll for sure make them double down on their concept.
If it came out that RB sabotaged the merc wind tunnel it would be one of the biggest stories in sporting (not just F1) history. Social media would be completely unusable. Toto would call for a lifetime sentence for Horner. It would all be glorious.
We dont know if they were done with lewis involved by the way. Maybe lewis wanted a concept change for those cars as well and because those cars were good those words are not being spoken. We literally dont know anything within the team that might be the reason for them not listening to lewis.
Funny you say this and this comment is loosely related, but I think it was a mistake on mercs part not putting Russell in the W12 mid season to help Lewis win 2021. Now it's looking like a challenge having George there instead of Valterri in 22 & 23 and it's not what Lewis wanted either.
True that, hindsight being 20:20 and all that, but they also said during parts of last season that the concept was flawed so they already knew ahead of this year but stuck by it anyway, that's the bit I don't get, last year was fair enough. This year is dropping the ball a bit imo
[That wasn’t a new chassis](https://the-race.com/formula-1/aston-martins-explanation-for-developing-two-f1-cars-at-once/)  > What we did was made sure that the chassis could take the two concepts,” said Green.  >“The chassis was designed to be able to take the old cooling system and this cooling system without modification. So that was a big thing, so on the chassis, there was no additional cost.
And when Albon did in 2019 he was also fast as fuck. Passed most of the field in the second half of Spa and had a shot at a win in Austria.
You're talking about five months ago like this car wasn't in development all last season as well.
Well if your driver is saying I didn't like this part of the car last year, don't put that on this year's car. I think they should listen to them even if it's winter.
Lewis just goes around the Factory, " I won't say I told you so, but...."
VTECH  Is a VTEC BRM H-16
Oh yeah but they weren't slow last year either on the corners but this year yeah it's a beast
I can only go off what they've told us.
Even with all the memes this year's car is pretty different
Ah now. Aston spent last two years with a vettel building this car.
Aston built their B-spec car a year ago.  This year's car is a refinement of that. It took a whole year.
Failures are very expensive, even without the actual rules the budget cap would create the same conservatism.
We already have that. The lower you are in the constructor rankings the more wind tunnel time you get in the following season. Though maybe we need to make the ranges bigger in the future.
Although this is a good idea. Legally this would not be possible.  It would mean that teams would have to hire loads of engineers one year that they'd have to fire the next year.
Not a bad idea to be honest
Indeed. Without the cost cap, Mercedes would have gotten out of last year's summer break and show us their Black Bull or Black Ferrari to try and win some races.   Instead, we had some fuckery with extreme setups, showing FIA how bad bouncy cars are, to get a TD implemented that could possibly hurt the competition, as Mercedes cannot just spend 200 million and months of wind tunnel time to solve their problem.
>This is precisely the kind of thing the cost cap was designed to do: remove the ability from top teams to pay their way out of every problem.  The regs were supposed to make the racing closer, and the money was supposed to level the field so that any team could win.    But the potential problem we're seeing is that no one has the money to fix problems. RB got it right...and now no one has the money to fix anything or catch up. Forget merc or Ferrari. Even a team like McLaren, which was historically (hybrid era) fighting for the 3rd-5th spot...they messed up the regs...and are now a bottom team. With little hope of making any progress. And at the same time, we aren't seeing any of the bottom teams (haas, williams, alfa, AT, Alpine) on the podiums based on merit.
It's not like Haas, Alfa, and Williams are doing anything with the cost cap.   They're still crap, but now Mercedes & Ferrari are crap too. Great stuff...
She means but yes, the maximum potential of the concept
That's a symptom of the problem, not the actual problem. They never disclosed why their car specifically porpoises at that ride height when other teams like Red Bull didn't.   You wouldn't expect them to either. No F1 team is going to disclose details of suspension geometry and how it's supposed to work versus what is actually happening in practice, assuming of course that it was the suspension causing the problem.
incoming, merc back to back wins; verstappen dominates next 15 seasons
I’m sure they have committed to a new concept and won’t be fooled twice
Ahah would be amusing albeit unlikely.
How can one team sabotage another teams wind tunnel? Genuinely asking.
Ahh thanks, didn't know that
~~2020*~~
Heck this years cars has a lot of similarities with the alpine.
Vettel the Builder!  *Can we fix it?*  Vettel the Builder!  *Yes we cannn*  [For anyone unaware of the context!](https://youtu.be/l-epqIHe4w0)
And that’s considering the Mercedes PU is probably one of the more flexible since everything is designed to be tightly packaged initially. The Ferrari powered cars seemed to be forced to build a certain way leading to those similar sidepod designs. So for any of the Ferrari teams to explore another design that would require some major revisions…which could even potentially hurt the PU performance.
And it seems to have worked.
Thats true. The budget cap would have to be adjusted upward or some sort of provision made. They are never gonna do it.   I just miss the days of explosing Ferraris and Renaults trying to run down McLaren. Im not sure Nigel Mansell shares my zeal for that era!  Im sure any change in that direction would only benefit Mercedes and Red Bull- with Ferrari getting maybe 2/3rds the benefit.
McLaren was never "historically" fighting for 3rd - 5th besides the 2020/21 seasons. Actually they've been lower midfield more often than fighting at the front on the hybrid era.
> And at the same time, we aren't seeing any of the bottom teams (haas, williams, alfa, AT, Alpine)   Aston Martin was a bottom team, and they are on the podium based on merit now. I don't know why everyone arguing that bottom teams don't win are ignoring the bottom team that is now winning.
I like cost cap, but I generally think it's too tight, the teams are parts recycling by midway through the year not progressing
AM charged up the field over the winter, and Williams has made huge progress, not to mention haas now being consistently in Q3.  Many of the bottom teams have gotten much closer because of the cost cap
Aston Martin jumped from like 7th to 2nd. And Haas, Alfa and Williams are still very close to the rest of the field - the division is not as clear as it was 10 years ago. And it'll keep diminishing as the effects of the pre-cost cap era vanish over the years.  Not to mention that cost cap also means that ALL teams are more profitable. Mercedes was spending almost $500 m a year, years ago. Now it's spending less than $200 m. That's $300 m less money Mercedes has to spend to remain competitive in F1. That is very attractive for other brands that may want to compete in F1 with a $200 m budget, but not with a $500 m one.
Sorry!
Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, won’t get fooled again.
Not OP, but I don't think they meant sabotaging the physical wind tunnel, but rather fudging the numbers, and the interpretation of those numbers.   I'm in NO way an expert, but F1 uses statistics and models to corelate the wind tunnel data vs real world. It's possible the sabotager picked the wrong model on purpose?  This is all COMPLETE speculation, and I am sure Merc has in-house checks and balances, but I'm just giving my 2 cents on theoretical possibilities...
Spa was in 2019, Alex got in the car in the second half of 2019 and was good in it.
Both are like a hybrid between the Ferrari and red bull concepts since last year in the case of alpine
The Mercedes PU is very tall because of the huge plenums.  The Ferrari PU can be mounted closer to the fuel tank because the compressor is behind the engine with the turbine.
Nigel wouldn’t because the man was extremely superstitious. Newey mentions that in his book. So if he could get squeamish in a winning Williams I would imagine the guy was a relative basket case when his car could still dnf easily.
Ferrari bringing a dozen or more engines to a weekend
You're missing the point. The point is that the new regs + financial cap was supposed to put everyone on an even playing field and making it so anyone could win.   Haas, williams, AT, Ferrari, MERC, RB...everyone should be fighting for podiums and wins. There hasn't really been a mix up. The top 3 teams are still the top 3 teams (plus AM...who stole RB guys) and bottom teams are all still the bottom teams.   And what we are seeing is that teams that KNOW they have a problem, and think they have a solution...are stuck hoping/waiting until next year to see if their fix works...and they can make improvement.....All the while, RB is adding more and more performance.   We'll see what happens. Hopefully the wind tunnel stuff and financial cap hits RB, but they are literally coasting to 40-60 second wins and the race is over 10 laps in.
That's because they dropped development to work on this car for two years, Vettel is still AMs best podium place they weren't always a backmarker, last year they did not get the concept until the impact of Dan Fallows was felt
Aston would have probably made a leap to the front, albeit a bit slower & smaller, without the budget cap. They have been investing heavily in personnel and infrastructure.  I understand ths profitability aspect, and it's great for the stability and future of F1. But from a spectator's pov, the budget cap has not been a positive change.
Ah sorry, I misread your comment to mean only Austria.

The tyres were really difficult to get up to temperature the entire weekend. I believe people spotted from Alonso's dash that he was losing tyre temperature during his stint on the hards too as the rubber wore down and there was less tread to move around and generate heat.  I think that's also what was behind Mercedes apparent uplift in form. They were just better at getting the tyres into the window for whatever reason. We even saw the Mercedes pulling away from Max at the first two starts for just a lap or two before Max got his tyres up to temperature and reeled them in immediately.  The restart was just the perfect recipe to cause chaos with a two lap shootout where drivers are incentivised to take risks and cold tyres where you don't know how much grip you're going to have when you arrive at the first corner.
Um excuse me Lando but I am an expert.   I’ve watched Drive to Survive (first 2 seasons) and have watched 2 races (2021 Belgian Grand Prix and 2009 Malaysian Grand Prix) so I think I know what I’m talking about….
What is Lando talking about? I saw dozens of certified reddit experts saying the drivers should just go slower on cold tires, why don't the drivers listen to *us*?
I agree with most of what Lando is saying here, though I do think something that isn't mentioned much is how the calendar affects this race. Melbourne's surface is meant to work in hot temperatures, as this race has until recent years opened the calendar or has at least been the second race. Holding this race at the end of march/start of April, a good 3-4 weeks after it should be held, is a huge difference that opens you to the cooling track conditions of autumn in Australia. This track surface needs to be hot, and it was cold the entire weekend.
Just wait until the tire blankets are banned.
Clearly, F1 is going in this direction, so it's better to start getting used to it.
Tangentially: this notion that we saw the dangerous and unpredictable chaos was due to cold tires also tracks with Hamilton saying that getting rid of tire blankets and going out on cold tires would be a safety concern. I genuinely think Hamilton is right to be concerned.
Specifically talking about tire temperature and 0 grip is the reason for all the accidents. We will get chaos after pitstops once those tire warmers are forbidden.
Isn't that why drivers get paid millions a year though?
Norris is forgetting that a lot of those critics have raced those F1 cars. Never mind the fact that the majority of drivers managed to get through that start without running into others.
No offense, but Norris should focus on driving
It’s ironic that Merc were so strong considering warm up was one of their biggest issues last year.
> They were just better at getting the tyres into the window for whatever reason.   And they had wear problems in Bahrain and SA.  We may be able to predict Mercedes performance in a weekend based on track temps.
There were so many spins in F3 and F2, it was ridiculous. Every cars comming out of the pits locked up in T1 and ran in the grass, looked like a sketch lol
Really interesting that last season they struggled to get temps into their tyres and now they've seemingly reversed the problem
You gotta watch the 2005 US grand prix too so you can become a true master
Does this Lando guy thinks he is smarter than us????
exactly..   the problem is even the people that outbraked themselves could have been trying to 'go slower' or 'brake earlier' .. well maybe not Sargent but everyone else :D  they know they have less grip and the tires aren't up to temp but there's no magic formula for where to brake, go under you'll lose places, get it right you're a hero, go a bit over you crash out..
Not just reddit experts, youtubers too.. *"in my opinion, these are the best of the best and they should know when to brake."*
Yeah, this is really dismissive of Lando. I've seen *most* of Drive to Survive AND I've played a dozen hours of Motorsport Manager. Pretty sure I know what I'm talking about.
Had a guy argue with me that "it's not FIAs fault that these professional drivers™ suck". I was like yeah, if your point needs to establish that the 20 best drivers in the world suck, then maybe you don't have a point.
Jolyon palmer is an expert and he criticized sainz, Gasly, and Sargeant though…
This actually makes sense. Red flag situations must perhaps also be based on prevailing track and tyre conditions.  There should be enough stats built up during the race weekend to get a good idea of Tyre warm up scenarios versus track temperature to determine the viability of restarts.
Why does it need to be hot though? The cold surface made for a much better race than I long time.
Hush, don’t insinuate that F1 is “heading” in a certain direction. You’ll be labelled a conspiracy theorist 🫣
I agree with the current tires. They are made for a very narrow temp-window to perform. Outside of that window they are quite soapy without grip, as we hear drivers complain behind safety cars to lose temp and in adverse conditions (e.g. threshold between dry and wet).   Question is, if the manufacturers will be able to quickly switch to a more broad temp window, which usually means, that the peak performance is lower, but on a broader temp range.   In the later case it wont be safety concern as much as it is with the current tire mix.
Ahhh yes, because there will be zero compound adjustment.  Just the removal of **those** tire warmers.  I, for one, welcome the banning of our tire warming overlords.
Should have but you in the car didn’t they?
No? Drivers get paid to win races. There's nothing in their contract saying their job must be this easy or this difficult. It's a completely subjective question of "should <this thing> be part of the sport?".  In this case the questions are  * "should restarting the race with only two laps left, leaving your fate up to other people's mistakes, part of the sport?".  * "Was it fair that Fernando Alonso, who was comfortably at lap 3 the whole race, was suddenly dropped to position 11 without making any mistake himself, with no chance whatsoever to recover? Do you want that to be a possibility in this sport?".  * "Is it fair to put pressure into drivers to lose it all at an arbitrary point in the race, knowing that they won't be able to recover any position lost if their start is not aggressive enough?"  None of these questions are part of their contract. It all relies on what you think the answers to these questions are.
And one of their biggest strengths a few years prior
Do the feeder series use the same tyres as F1?
The wreck with Nisaany and the Fitapaldi was scary.
A US Grand Prix? Pffft.   US Grand Prix’s don’t count and every true F1 fan knows this.
Lets have a vote.
I thought he *was* just one of us redditors..
I mean...
Not to mention you only have 2 laps to make up for it. You are putting drivers in a position where the slightest concession has dramatic consequences, of course they are gonna be aggressive and commit mistakes.
The issue is that if you let off and the cars around you don’t, there’s a chance of losing millions of dollars worth of points by simply taking yourself out of the competition
Red flags need not to be called so often, because they are the absolute last resort for when you simply cannot continue a race. For decades, red flags were extremely rare, we went entire seasons without them. And, when called, they should be rolling starts, not standing ones; at least if you are calling the restart with <10 laps from the end. It's not fair to have a bad start in the restart and lose your race to that, without any chance to make up for it.  There's many reasons why your standing start can go wrong, and many of them are not related to your skill as a driver. Case on point: Alonso in the second restart last week. He did nothing wrong, but he dropped from 3rd to 11th because another driver hit him. How is that fair? 56 laps standing strong in 3rd place, with enough pace not to even have to defend, and suddenly you find yourself in lap 56 dropping 8 positions due to another person's mistake, with only two laps to make up for it.
"Needs to be hot" if we're talking about preventing carnage. I don't disagree that it was more entertaining than the average Melbourne race
Also you'll be called a "purist" for not wanting F1 to be turned into a WWE wreckfest parody of itself for the sake of selling more in the country where people claim they watch nascar to see crashes.
[Gentlemen, a short view back to the past. Thirty years ago, Niki Lauda told us ‘take a trained monkey, place him into the cockpit and he is able to drive the car.’ Thirty years later, Sebastian told us ‘I had to start my car like a computer, it’s very complicated.’ And Nico Rosberg said that during the race – I don’t remember what race –  he pressed the wrong button on the wheel. Question for you both: is Formula One driving today too complicated with twenty and more buttons on the wheel, are you too much under effort, under pressure? What are your wishes for the future concerning the technical programme during the race? Less buttons, more? Or less and more communication with your engineers?](https://youtu.be/FlFt_W4664M)
Drivers get paid to win races? So 19 don't get paid?  Yes  Yes, the rules took a bad restart into the equation   Yes, it's racing
Yes, yes, and yes.   F1 races have a start procedure. If the race is stopped and needs to be restarted, the process should be the same. Crashes, safety cars, and red flags are part of racing, if you lose spots because of a restart, tough.
And their worst enemy a few years before that!   They went from killing tyres by looking at them to not getting them switched on.
Yes, but they only use two compounds and don’t have tyre blankets so they come out cold
F2 does, but the compound choice is more limited. F3 have their own tyres
That one didn’t lol.
Everyone know that 2005 US GP happened only because of the fake Netflix hype
What did the Americans do to you
Can you repeat the question?
> Yes, the rules took a bad restart into the equation  How? If you mean that the grid was "reset", that was only because they didn't make it to the end of the first sector.
I find it a pretty weak argument to say that something must be the way it is because it is the way it is.
American sports.
We are checking.
🤣 makes me laugh every time I see it, never gets old
Yes
Normally I agree, I just don’t think this is a problem to be solved.
Guy has mid life crisis over F1 gaining popularity in the US

Race-pace of Sainz did indeed look very good, but I don't know if Australia is very representative (it usually isn't) for overall car performance.
Ferrari should never be confident...always be skeptical
Only Ferrari will say shit like this after no points in a race.
Mega what? This is a joke, right? RIGHT?
I don't think it was a great race to really judge where everyone is at. 8 DNFs, enough cautions and red flags to destroy rhythm, and a large section of the race which became about who could squeeze the most life out of the hards. Sainz clearly had pace for a good chunk of the race. We'll have to wait a few weeks to see if its for real.
Is this "mega step" here in the room with us?
At this point the only measure is the qualifying. 5th and 7th does not look like a mega step.
The Melbourne track is not a good indicator of performance.
Ferrari have an upgrade package that means both car will actually finish the race this time. A huge upgrade for the prancing Horses.  It does mean a 2.7 sec drop in race time but having the ability to come at best 11&12th is better than not finishing with both cars.
The pace looked like Ferrari is actually back at being clear 2nd but it's not enough for obvious reasons.  It feels like this statement is either Ferrari relying so much on a new package or Binotto completely bullshitting about how good is 2023 car and Ferrari actually being happy about 2nd with the car they had.
Mega step backwards, they mean
Why can't they just keep their mouth shut?
They did looked better but somehow Mercedes got in between them and Aston. Ferrari now needs to jump two teams. Exactly the same situation Mercedes found themselves in.
Ugh Charles why couldn’t you just join the Merc program? At least they’re clawing themselves back up. They’re so much more competent than these Italian fools.
Oh man, Ferrari you have to stop waffling
The Australian GP already happened?
Mega step, but they don’t specify in which direction
Thats a lie. All Ferrari does this season is lie. A car that was 'unprecedented in terms of speed', is currently the fourth fastest, with Alpine even closing in on them in Australia. Ferrari's best bet is to try and find solutions to their problems this year, finish fourth for the extended wind tunnel and cfd times, and challenge again from next year.
step backward
So are we talking like both cars in the points, that would be pretty mega compared to last race.
I mean any step would be a good one from Aus
It's not, also Ferrari were mighty there last year compared to Red Bull so not surprising to see them look better here this year too.
Why did they not protest the result since he got punished for something that got undone? Is Ferrari stupid?
the treatment ferrari deserves from its fans
Because they're right, in this race they wasn't terrible on their tyres like in the previous ones, Carlos had the 3rd fastest lap of the race and it was more or less in line with Red Bull times.  Of course it's just one race, Melbourne is not exactly a traditional circuit and Red Bull probably had more in their pocket, so we have to see what happens in the next ones, but maybe they can at least be a little more positive going forward.  Even because they should have important upgrades coming soon.
'We can win all the remaining races'.
Yes
Driver errors left them with 0 points, not the car. Fred is completely correct to say that the race performance took a big step forward.
Ending up with no points wasn't due to lack of pace, the logical ability of some of you is mindblowingly low
Or the fact that Sainz was able to pass multiple cars and keep a very similar pace with Alonso and Hamilton?
Sainz had the pace for 3rd without his mistake in S1, and Charles was held up by Carlos on his fast lap. So I don't think quali was representative  In general terms, Ferrari's quali pace hasn't been representative of their race pace in the past - since TD039 in 2022 there has often been significant discrepancy  Here however the car should've been competitive with amr/Merc in quali and was quick in the race too. Carlos started 11th after the lap 9 red flag and came through to 4th on track with overtakes and taking life out of the hard tyres, and then closed up to 1.1-1.5s off Fernando before his tyres fell off slightly and Fernando/Lewis pushed a little more. But even so, I think this can be viewed very positively and the quali performance and race result were not representative of the progress
Clear second how? In Australia both Mercedes and Alonso's AM were clearly above them.
Sainz was handily faster than Gasly once he broke out of DRS range.  This comment is kind of ironic.
No, but Charles will finish the race which is a small step toward getting him to not run away and become a hermit in a cave in Mongolia
It was RB that was shit actually. They had about the same delta to Merc as in Bahrain and SA. RB were near Merc last year at Australia
He got punished for the action, as he would at any other point in the race. The fact that the effect of that penalty dropped him out of the points is unfortunate, but if he did that mid race, had the penalty hanging over him and then the race finished under SC, it’s the same result.
what got undone? There was nothing undone. That lap happened. it counts.  The order was just reset because the lap was red flagged before a new order of cars was established and you need an order to put the cars in for the next restart. And because there was none because they didn't make it out of S1 before the red flag happened, they went back to the last established order they had which was the one at the earlier restart.  Where does this idea come from that a red flag means that a lap didn't happen? The counter goes up, the lap counts towards the race and everything that happened pre red flag happened. but if you can't tell which order the cars are in you go back to the last time you knew.  The same thing happened in Silverstone last year when Carlos got his pole back.  edit: it's almost is they know what they are doing and as if there is a reason as to why the Haas protest was thrown out as quickly as it was.
Because nothing for undone, the lap still counted.  They just didn't have a place to reference where every driver qas in order, after the start. So they had to take the  position from the grid.
Because that's not how it works and you should think twice before calling others (especially professionals) stupid.
Carlos was faster because he had DRS and the Melbourne circuit is a DRS train. We don't know the true speed of the Redbulls yet, Max was cruising. Yeah, the tyres were better though.
For a fan I can completely understand looking at from that point of view, but I feel like this is the exact way Ferrari keeps shooting themselves in the foot by assuming they're making improvements when in actuality it was just a very specific track that caused their superior form. Australia is simply not their baseline.
So can Haas tbf.
So did Mercedes's. But we know Australia is a bit weird, Baku will tell whether they actually improved or not.
Did a better job than Perez of fighting through the field, seems like the low deg helped Ferrari a lot.
Calling any Ferrari employee a professional is a stretch.
The thing is though the tyres were a bit of an outlier on this circuit. Everyone was finding it difficult to get temperature into them so it might be that the Ferrari's tendency to overwork the tyres just wasn't exposed here.
>Carlos was faster because he had DRS and the Melbourne circuit is a DRS train  He never lowered the gap to Alonso below 1.1, never got DRS even for a single lap.
Max was so relaxed, he took a side-gig as lawnmower.
Ha yeah technically he was correct, the best kind of correct.
And, of course, this is being said by someone who can't even understand some basic F1 rules

First points in aus is something to be proud of in that car as an aussie, although he did inherit his place from retirements you've got to be there when it counts.  Happy bday mate.
As a McLaren fan I'm very happy with him so far.
Oscar finally showing emotion
Who has the worst haircut in the paddock? Is it Piastri?
He was in the points for a while wasn't he? It was a good effort
I wanted to say Stroll but it’s not so bad right now. He doesn’t look anymore like he’s cut his own hair without mirror in the dark.
Gasly's hair is worse.
His whole junior career it just kind of did whatever and looked pretty bad. But this thing where the mclaren stylists are attacking it with hairspray ….also bad   Lance is pretty bad but at least gives us variety
Now that Seb is gone, Gasly is the bald king of the paddock.
Who will be the first team other than Red Bull to win a race? Will it be because of RB dnf? Where might this happen?
Been watching a lot of post weekend content and by all reports Red Bull have supposedly said there was no issue with Checos car in Quali.   So a big mistake by him. Was lucky he managed to get 5th due to the carnage at the end.
I’ve still got so much to learn about historical F1 facts, so here’s a question:   Has there ever been a genuine race to the finish line to win a race? Not just a proper race in the final lap (ala Max and Lewis in Abu Dhabi, 2021) but a situation where drivers have been battling to overtake each other through the final corner/onto the final straight?  If that makes any sense at all lmao
What’s the fine for drivers if they says something about the FIA Stuarts after the race? Most major sports like the NBA, Football have some sort of fine if a player criticizes the referees post game. Ex: for thé NBA is $20 000$. Does the FIA do the same?
If you’re hard up for racing due to the wait, Indy car Long Beach is April 16
We all know Newey is godlike. Byrne, Allison are great. But who are let's say under the radar designers in the last two decades? I mean people like Dan Fallows, who was in Newey's shadow, and only recently got more shine, even though he has been great for a long time.
Tsunoda didn't just turn into a world beater now that his teammate is ancient de Vries. Gasly, a midfield talent, comprehensively outperformed him.
Does anyone have the McLaren 2023 team hoodie? How is the quality of it? Are the letters coming off or not (yet)?
What are thoughts on a change to red flag rules that a tire change on a red flag does not count as your tire change for the race. If your in pitlane when the red flag is comes out, since you crossed the pitlane line you would be safe from the rule.
My roommate recently came across a 2020 Lando Norris pizza shirt at Goodwill. It features the number 7 several times on it. Does anyone here know why? It seems like he’s had a few pieces of merch with the number 7 on it, but google couldn’t help me figure out the reasoning behind that number
What’s the O/U on a race ban actually happening at some point this season? With Gasly I guess since that’s been the discussion.
Does Lance Stroll have a salary? Or is it an allowance?
What happened to Chain Bear on youtube? I noticed he hasn't uploaded anything for 3 months
Is there actually any chance that Hamilton loses his 2008 title due to Massa's legal action, or are the media just playing it up?
I finished reading newey's book after it was mentioned on this sub several times. Apart from the man himself it is very interesting to read on some of the "behind the scenes" stuff. Any other recommendations? Unsung heroes of the paddocks? History of circuits?
Would you like to see Magny Cours in place of Paul Ricard on the calendar someday?
Recommended news sources apart from formula1.com? Thanks
We all know that Massa's efforts to overturn 2008 championship results are not going to go anywhere. But it's funny that in a hypothetical scenario where he is able to do that, it will be Alonso & his team's doing which snatches Lewis' first championship.. (just a shower thought.)
Why it took 11 almost 20 laps to catch up with 4, if RB19 is so superior as everyone said?
**Should Red Bull replace Perez with Tsunoda now?** Tsunoda is driving excellent whilst Perez is holding Red Bull back with inconsistent qualys. He should've been P2 at the Australian GP but only got P5 with a lot of luck.
I'm saying this now because I'm a Verstappen fan and there is basically no chance the result will change now, but I think he should have got a penalty for the final restart. Most people didn't see it, but there was a video that showed Max stop in the box then jolt forward which was why he was on the edge of the grid box. I'm not completely sure, but I think there has been previous precedent for a penalty being given if a car moves in the box after initially stopping

Still fairly new to digging deep into the world of F1 but it seems like coming from last year into this year Daniel Ricciardo just seems burned out and not too interested in F1 all to much any more.      Not sure if it's been talked about before but thoughts on him trying to get a ride in NASCAR?               Personally I think he'd be highly marketable in the States and has the charisma to target some of the markets NASCAR struggles in. Plus at the very minimum it gets him back behind the wheel as opposed to being a back up coming back to Redbull.
I came across a poll that suggested Gasly is close to amounting enough penalty points for a race ban? This sort of thing just fades from my memory.

Mercedes really favoured Australian GP because of the smooth road surface and it meant they could bring their car lower to the ground. With upgrades expected to come in Baku what can we expect from Mercedes there based on road surface?
What exactly happened to George's PU in the race? Have we heard anything about it? I'm yet to read a news outlet carrying Mercedes' comments, they didn't address it in their race debrief either. Isn't that a bit off, because usually engine failures get explained by the team?
So I've been gradually getting into Formula 1 over the last 3-4 weeks and I've enjoyed it so far. Not really up to speed on race strategies, the technical aspects of the history just yet. But I'm getting there. So here's my question.... what the Hell do you do during these month long breaks between races?! :P
Why did Mercedes opt to not have side-pods, they only reason i can think of is weight. Also, what do side-pods do and what did the regulations at the beginning of 2022 say they had to be. Can Mercedes get back to the top even without sidepods?
Hey, the big question for the Sub.  &#x200B;  Can you stream on Twitch or you're going to get copyright strikes? I know YT it's difficult and easy to get your video copyright strikes.   &#x200B;  I know they have an official channel but if you stream or critique races on your own personal channel on twitch can you do that?
Why is there such a long time off from Aus GP to Baku?
Does anyone know where to find public data related to f1 races (lap times,...)? What are the best or mainstream sources?
I reckon Aston. Max DNF & Checo had a dodgy qualifying.   As to where, that’s anyone’s guess. I feel like Monaco could be a good bet though. Possibly even Baku if there’s a lot of chaos during the race.
Either Baku where we've had a few carnages so someone unexpected (i.e. not Max) could win.  The other may be Monaco, sometimes messy happening in qualifying delivering an unexpected poleman (and we know how important the pole is in Monaco).  For the team, Aston may be there on pace in Monaco, at least near enough to challenge the bulls if they make a small mistake.
Probably either merc or aston, I’m leaning more towards merc. Max is out or starting in the back, that’s the only way I see it not counting some rain/freak show event
It’s been a bit unclear tbh. I saw this comment yesterday, don’t know if you have?  https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/12cbj6o/ask_rformula1_anything_daily_discussion_5_april/jf1d39e/?  You always seem to be a bit more ITK with red bull. What do you think?
lol if you believe RB's PR message you've already drank their kool-aid.
Bahrain 2021, COTA 2021, Saudi Arabia 2022
Senna and Mansell, Jerez 1986.
Alonso v Schumacher Imola 2005.
I haven't watched it, but I reckon the 1971 Italian GP, which had a winning margin of 0.01 seconds and the top 5 within just over 6 tenths, must have been quite the fight to the line
> FIA Stuarts   Stewards
I’m reluctant to call these under the radar but just going to say them as you didn’t list them.  [Aldo Costa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldo_Costa)  and [Simone Resta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Resta)
Be a good post, really: examples where a driver was the exact same guy one season to the next but a new teammate changed perception.  I remember in 2016, Massa was considered a withered old man next to Bottas. Then comes Stroll and suddenly Massa was a 'wily old fox'. He's the same guy! He's just bonking a teammate on the head now.
I think it's less about Tsunoda and more about opening the world up to a Perez replacement. Perez is disproportionately popular relative to his ability or success, and this is just preemptive PR letting the world know he might be gone after his contract is up.
Everyone complains about their kit but my 2022 t-shirt has lasted totally fine.
You can't have cars driving over a debris-covered track and then tell 'em they can't change their tyres under a red flag, that's a safety risk. But having that new set of tyres not count towards the 'you have to use two out of three compounds' rule seems like a good and fair solution.
And another one...  no.
I think you're confusing the L and N of his logo with a 7. His number has always been 4, and the negative space in his logo (the space between the L and N) forms a 4.  [Check it here.](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1545074107418660865/Vt78CEJo_400x400.jpg)
Gasly is the closest, but they have been pretty lenient to not give him any more points, since they don't actually want to kick him out. I believe his points should be gone by May IIRC, so as long as he doesn't do anything horrendous, he should be okay.  Ricciardo was the next closest, and then Stroll. I don't think we will see a race ban this year, unless something very wrong happens
Not sure if you're making a joke, but we don't know his contract details. He is likely driving at his own pleasure with no salary
He’s taking a break due to undisclosed life stuff. He’s said he’ll be back at some point this season.
He was talking to his patrons in early March, about taking some time off.
If it was Alonso that won that title there might be a tiny chance but I don't know how they could take it away from Hamilton when he had nothing to do with it.
I have a better chance of becoming the next RB #1 driver
0% possibility.   Ok the other hand, Massa is probably going for a good sum of money and he's got a nice chance to take them in court.
No, Massa might have grounds to sue for lost revenue due to the sponsorships and shit he'd get for winning but there is no way they take Lewis' title.
Absolutely zero chance
No way that's happening.
Just the media playing up to let the rabid side of the fanbase hear what they want to hear. Well, we have some of those here as well.
As much as it sucks for Massa, who has every right to feel cheated out of a championship by Renault, FOM and the FIA, I just don't see it happening.

No. Hardly any good overtake opportunities in a modern F1 car. First hairpin is a decent opportunity, the second is not bc it has a high speed chicane right before it, and the final one is not bc it has a Mickey Mouse chicane right after that would be a nightmare in these cars. Rest of the track would be narrow high speed following. The long corners that allow for offset line attacking/defending in other sorts of cars like Estoril and 180* an F1 car eats them up like they’re nothing. It worked  okay in the past with smaller F1 cars with less downforce but not the current cars.   [Look at this in sim and ask yourself how many times two cars would be able to get side by side](https://youtu.be/KWCj5bB1W_8)
This sub.
He's not trying to overturn the 2008 championship, since that's pretty much set in stone at this point.  He wants the involved parties and the governing body to be held accountable due to how poorly crashgate was managed, especially now that Ecclestone said he knew about it. It would also set a legal precedent in case something similar happens in the future.
So you don’t think RB19 is superior?
Tsunoda is difficult to judge at the moment, as he's up against a rookie teammate.  De Vries is a largely unknown quantity in F1, so making a judgement about Tsunoda three races into the season (after a pretty poor year against Gasly last year) would be hugely rash.  Perez is doing fine, and Red Bull isn't in close competition with anybody. They have absolutely no need to rush into decisions like these, they have the luxury of being able to be patient.
Holding them back? They're leading both championships and he's number 2 in the drivers' standings. He's had some bad luck with reliability but when all is well he's solidly there in P2.  Swapping Yuki up would tell me RB learned nothing from pushing Gasly and Albon into that seat too soon. Tsunoda has been extremely promising but putting him the spotlight right away night be too much pressure like we've seen before. And for what? The hope that the gap between P2 and P3 will be a little better? It's just not worth the risk.
I think Red Bull had the same idea when they promoted Gasly, Kvyat and Albon to the main team. Showed promise in AT/TR, but didn't live up to expectations in the main team. They cna get him to test the sim and can evaluate him there, to see if he can handle a different car.      This is why they went outside to get Perez, who is performing decently with his 2nd in WDC - they didn't have someone in their pipeline to take up the Ricciardo sized gap. Tsunoda had many on/off weekends in the past, and we don't haven't seen him shine consistently.
is this some advanced trolling or am i just too cynical these days
Ah, good ol early season Perez bashing. Pretty much has been the staple of his RB career
Ok, I’ve seen your profile and you’re very clearly trolling. You’re Mexican and a fan of Checo, you’ve posted his victories on the Mexico sub and were very clearly happy for him. You’re just trolling/testing the waters around him with an opinion as outrageous like this.
Did you just drop your Ricciardo agenda for Tsunoda? What’s the point of praising Checo on other subs and trashing him on here?  How ridiculous.
He's absolutely fine to move after stopping, as long as he was stationary before the lights went out.
The rule (sporting regulations 48.1 (a)) says what is or isn't a jump start is decided by transponders. The transponder didn't report anything ==> not a jump start
This was debated endlessly. Lots of people saw it. The rule says the car cannot go past the lines (basically). His tyres were right on the line. And, you can move as long as no red lights have appeared. No penalty. Even Toto said Max was fine and correct.
https://www.youtube.com/shorts/i3aLsR1KDGg
He's doesn't seem that interested in a NASCAR drive based on the interviews he's given. If he was he wouldn't have any issues getting one. He feels he's not done with F1 yet but needs a little break from it.
He wouldn’t have issues getting a NASCAR drive, but I think he’d go for other open-wheel or endurance series before he tried his luck there
It’s not a poll. It’s a fact. He has 10 points and 12 is a race ban.
For anyone curious, this is a link to a video about the Australian race, probably made by the poster.
Oh they’re going right back up the midfield, car has no straight line speed.
The gaps and breaks in F1 are what got me into IndyCar actually. Now I watch both. Both series are great for different reasons.
There's only usually one month-long gap, the summer break in August. The reason we have a month gap now is that the Chinese GP would have been in the middle but got cancelled due to Covid restrictions.
Basically this, discussing any news that come out or talking about other F1-related stuff.
I watch a lot of old races on F1TV, theres a few podcasts I check into once and a while, and I play a lot of racing games in-between to get my fill
Watch old races, watch other series
Work on other hobbies/interests. Even 2 week gaps are going to be long if all you think about is f1
Definitely you should pick a season and watch the races back
> Why did Mercedes opt to not have side-pods, they only reason i can think of is weight.  There are a lot of aerodynamic reasons not to have them if you can manage it. Before 2022 ever-smaller sidepods, especially low down, were a direction the entire grid was universally moving in. The primary reason for this is the more airflow you get over the diffuser roof (pre-2022) or beam wing (2022 and onwards), the harder you essentially work the diffuser and the more better it gets. In theory, zeropods should provide relatively little obstruction for airflow along the engine cover towards the beam wing. That may have worked in practice, it's just that the W13 had a lot of issues not just restricted to the sidepods. They're non-structural carbon fibre, so they're actually fairly light (and if you look at front-aspect shots of the W13, you'll find that what it saves in width down low, it makes up for high up).  In the 2022 ruleset it also provides a unique opportunity to essentially use the upper side impact structure as a flow conditioning structure because it let them wrap it in a fairing they could shape, to a point. This is something unique to Mercedes' design.  > Also, what do side-pods do   They hold radiators and engine ancillaries. That's what the inlet is for. (Post-)2022 they have also become a valuable flow conditioning tool, that is to say, a way to guide and shape airflow towards the all-important rear of the car (and in a few cases, along the edge of the floor). Pre-2022, teams would achieve this using complex flow conditioning structures on the front wing before the FIA banned those, at which point bargeboards absolutely ballooned in overall complexity. Bargeboards are now essentially banned entirely, so sidepods and the floor inlet fences have become the new bargeboards. The front tyres shed a load of turbulent air (which has the tasty name ''tyre squirt'') which needs managing and will make your car very sad if it gets in places it shouldn't (floor inlets, for example). The floor edge likes having some extra airflow for floor/diffuser sealing purposes and the floor fences and sidepods are generally the only way to guide this. Rear tyres are GIANT BLUNT FACES for incoming airflow and shading these behind sidepods can be beneficial. Etc etc.  It needs emphasis that sidepods are not the be-all/end-all of performance in this ruleset and that the underfloor also plays an extremely vital role in this, bigger than the sidepods. That is not to say you can stick any sidepod on the RB19 and it'll still be fast, or that the W13/W14 would still be slow even with RB19 sidepods; the sidepods work *with* the floor, but it's much easier to have a fast car with shitty sidepods and a great floor than one with great sidepods and a shitty floor, to really oversimplify things.  > and what did the regulations at the beginning of 2022 say they had to be.  [Paint within these lines and you're good, plus a bunch of bodywork radius and direction change rules my brain is too smooth to understand or visualise](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/206621992252735489/781655874690613288/2021regs-iso.png). Credit to the person on f1t who made this, I have unfortunately forgotten their name.  > Can Mercedes get back to the top even without sidepods?  Possibly, if everything else about their car is exceptional. The RB19 is an all-around great car and that's really what modern F1 is about. Silver bullets don't exist.
So they could turn the side impact structure into an extra wing instead of into the internal structure of a sidepod. It’s all for the extra downforce from that wing their mirror sits on top of. This did not end up being worth all the drawbacks including difficulty managing the front and rear tires wakes (draggiest parts of the car), a floppy flanged floor without support that lent itself to porpoising, and a too far forward cockpit that puts the driver too far away from the car’s center of gravity.
I'm not an aerodynamicist, and any comments here will likely be poor speculation, but I'll try to answer with any information I have.  We don't know the exact reason they chose the 'sidepod-less' design, but they assumed it would have a higher development 'ceiling' as compared to the conventional sidepod.  They also likely assumed that the more narrow the side pods are, the less aerodynamic drag would play into effect.   The side pods house aspects of the cars cooling and other components, as well being a tunnel to allow cool air to enter, and hot air to leave.  I'm not sure if Mercedes will be able to catch up using the current design, as the 'ceiling' on the sidepods seem to have been already maximized. They have stated that they are 're-designing' most of the sidepods, whether or not they go full Ferrari or just slowly blend their sidepod, we will have to wait and see.  &#x200B;  Mercedes should be brining an update at Baku or Imola, and while this won't be a completely new car, they will likely be starting to slowly change elements of the car and it should look completely different next year
Part allocations have been around longer, supposed to be helping the environment with less parts used and more focus on reliability. Budget cap in a nutshell was to bring the teams closer together competitively, otherwise the smaller teams would never catch up to the big spenders
Power Unit components had a price cap in place when the hybrid regulations were introduced (max price $15m per season under standard contract) and are exempt from the budget cap.
You’ll get booted. You can comment on it but not stream it live.
China had to be cancelled because when the calendar was being finalized, they had COVID lockdown protocols still in place that F1 couldn’t cooperate with logistically. They have since lifted the restrictions but F1 decided not to replace it. Should be back just fine for 2024.
Definitely not in the know. Just going by what's reported.  Only Checo is saying there was something wrong.   Multiple journalists like Peter Windsor, Ted etc have said that any Red Bull engineers they spoke to said they found nothing wrong.   Then also we have the corner comparison to Max where we see Checo went in with way more speed.
Why would they lie? Are you not drinking Checos cool aid then? It's not a conspiracy hahaha   Anyway I'm not going by what the engineers have privately told journos like Peter Windsor, Ted etc etc.
Like Jackie Stewards?
Thanks! I completely forgot about Costa. It's crazy how many great cars he at least co-designed, yet I haven't heard him being praised as much as Byrne & Allison.
> He's just bonking a teammate  I mean, it's a whole new level of good team relations
Stroll himself is another example. In 2017 he seemed pretty weak and inconsistent next to Massa (despite two massive highlights in Baku and Monza qualifying) and in 2018 he seemed a totally competent driver next to Sirotkin.  For Mick Schumacher, the perception changed the other way around. Looking pretty solid in 2021 alongside Mazepin, looking inconsistent and often not fast enough when Magnussen was his teammate in 2022.
Exactly, Tsunoda is still the same and that's a midfield driver at best.
He's doing everything RB want so there's no reason to change unless he wants to leave. Xbox live Tsunoda definitely wouldn't be as compliant.
Finally! Someone who sees the light as I do. Perez isn't worthy of a Red Bull seat. I've been screaming that they should kick Perez out to the kerb and replace him before with Gasly but now with Ricciardo, and if Tsunoda gets better, **he** should be the 2nd seat at Red Bull.
It's only 2023!
It isn’t. What if said cars were about to pit after a long stint? What if they don’t have another set of tires for a short run? Just leave the rule as it is.
This is getting similar to the “so safety car just bunches everyone up and leader loses the 20 second gap?” Yes, that’s how it’s been, and that’s how it will be.
Ahh you’re right. Thank you! It’s much clearer in the version of the logo you linked here but it’s the same logo nonetheless
Is it pretty common to not have any? This is the first season I’ve tried to be invested
I highly doubt that
Teams are required to pay a salary to their drivers. Most sources put Lance at 2 or 3 million for this season.  [One example](https://racingnews365.com/f1-driver-salaries-2023)  But I think the guy was indeed making a joke since of course it's his dad paying that.
oh okay! I hope he's okay
The "how" seems pretty obvious to me: They decide that by the rules the Singapore GP should have been voided, they therefore void the Singapore GP, bang, Massa is the WDC. Doesn't mean I think that's particularly likely
This is the right answer. First thing I do every morning is come here, sort by New, to see what news I missed while sleeping. Any news is posted here within minutes. I'm in the U.S. so lots of news happens overnight from European news sources.
I do. But how much? Everyone on the grid needs tire management right? Took 20 laps to catch up with Mclaren doesn’t seem THAT MUCH superior to me.
Difficult? We have two-plus seasons of Tsunoda in AT and every year he's improved whilst Perez has nothing good to show for other than that "minister of defence" thing. I say RBR should promote Tsunoda and see how good he really is, conversely, Perez should also demonstrate how good he is at AT.
The hope is that Tsunoda will become the driver RBR envisioned to be. The hope is to become more dominant and less reliable on Max for wins and championships. The hope is to have excellent qualys week-in, week-out.
Have I said something that isn't true? I mean, where did Perez start at the AusGP?
It’s very clearly trolling.
Thrashing him? I am merely stating that Ricciardo and Tsunoda could be better options for Perez. Also, I praise him because he performed well when noted but we all know he is not consistent.

Sorry I didn’t phrase it correctly - the poll was asking if people thought he would get to the stage where he would have a race ban. Thank you anyway 👍🏻
Ok What about watching races that are not live. Say last year Monaco GP or Monza   or a race from 1992?
We should probably put this in a sticky post or something.

I think he's too inconsistent for them. When Merc had a dominant car it was Lewis-Bottas 1-2 half the time, but Perez often struggles to get it on the podium on a car that last season was arguably more dominant than the Mercs ever where, and this season is definitely the most dominant car in a long time. RBR should be 1-2 every race but they're not.
No, he's not. He should've been a clear No. 2 in the WDC last year but he's inconsistency coupled with his fantasy to win the WDC drove him to a disappointing third place. **Perez is a liability at Red Bull!**
Atm he’s doing well enough, but I agree RB should have somebody that can push makes a lot more. I’m not sure if DR and Tsunoda are up for that honestly. I would ideally see somebody like Leclerc, Russell or Norris at RB and hope for a Hamilton/Rosberg dynamic (on track).   I know it’s not realistic, but one can hope
I think Perez is 100% just the right guy in the right place at the right time. RBR don't want to muck around with things if they're winning both titles hands down.
Not sure I agree with Gasly, but I do think Ricciardo would be massively outperforming Perez.  RBR are in a tough spot though, they don't want anyone too good they'll be taking points off Max. They need a Bottas 2.0, someone good enough to get the car to P2 but not good enough to challenge Max.
Fair point but I was most worried about it after the first wash/dry.   I've still got a 2007 McLaren top actually!
> What if they don’t have another set of tires for a short run?  They always have at least a used set of tyres.   I still think the rule wouldn't work too well if there's a late red flag and someone hasn't yet used their mandatory second set of tyres. It would be really easy to end up well outside the points if it happened since you'd be forced to pit with a completely bunched up field.
but no, my favourite driver lost out, let's rewrite the rules
Most drivers end up with a couple points, I think Max might have a few still. They have a rollover period of around 1 year, so as long as you don't accumulate more points, they will go back to 0.
Elaborate
They won’t take it away from Hamilton. The worst they’d do is strike Alonso and Renault from the standings. There is absolutely no chance Hamilton loses his title. Not a chance.
It wasn’t a normal race. He was the fastest car on track on average
> I say RBR should promote Tsunoda and see how good he really is, conversely, Perez should also demonstrate how good he is at AT.  Yes, because prematurely promoting junior drivers to put them in a 1 vs 1 situation against Max Verstappen worked out so well the last two times they tried it.
Perez has plenty of good results to show, is pretty reliable and rarely makes mistakes that will damage the car. There's absolutely nothing to show that Tsunoda would actually perform better in the Red Bull than Perez is right now.  Changing drivers is always a risk (look at Riccardo going to McLaren), and Red Bull simply don't need to take unnecessary risks at the moment.  Let Tsunoda have another year at AT, then they can consider him as Perez's contract expires at the end of this year.
Great that they have him in a comfortable position where he can learn his craft on and off the track before they need to put the big pressure and big money on him then.
How exactly is Perez to blame for a technical issue
i see what you're up to. i enjoy it so go ham.
Nah.  Considering every single comment of yours is based on vibes rather than knowledge and the fact that many people have proved you wrong, what makes you think you know better than the team? Note: you don’t.  This whole thing is either very elaborated trolling or a rather poor attempt at validation. Either way, gotta admit it’s quite entertaining.
Well the purpose isn’t the same so you can’t exactly compare them. Like for instance they can replace front wings all day long with different kinds/setup and it won’t count against part allocation limits, but the R&D that goes into that goes towards the budget. Teams with $$$ could do that while teams with no $ bet on/test a couple designs and hope for the best. Budget cap evens that out because the big teams can’t just dump their allotted money all into front wing design anymore.
I don’t know the details, but I’m pretty sure you can’t use more than a few seconds of material. This is not my area of expertise by any means, but just look at the videos from The Race or WTF1, they almost exclusively use pictures/photos intertwined with videos that are 4-5 seconds long at most.
Bottas finished 5th in 2018 and almost managed to somehow finish 3rd in 2020 with one of the most overpowered cars of all time. I agree that Perez is inconsistent but if you want consistency, Tsunoda should be at the very bottom of the list of drivers to look for.
I agree! Perez is holding Red Bull back! Not to mention destroying Verstappen's legacy at the same time. (See Monaco)
They won both championships comfortably and having a driver who is willing to race to win looks better for the team than the difference between P2 and P3.
He isn't doing well! P5 at AusGP? Disappointing! Ricciardo or Tsunoda in that RB should be miles better than the slow-moving Perez. Yeah, he's the minister of defence but what is he defending now? Nothing I say!
Absolutely! Ricciardo is better than Perez, more charismatic too! And he'll respect Max much more than Perez will. RBR is making a bad decision to keep Perez at the No. 2 seat, plain and simple.
Yeah, I meant a new set of soft/medium tires after being forced to stop again. I see how that wasn’t clear. Still I agree with you.
Any result other than a podium for that No. 2 seat is a disgrace especially with that car and that team. Yeah, Perez has had good results but only those should be applauded *if* they come from a midfield team. Is RBR a midfield team? I reckon they're far from it.
I get your POV but this isn't some slow-moving sport, there's a lot of stake here! If Tsunoda has what it takes, RBR should not waste any time here and just go for it.
What technical issue? He straight went to the gravel after breaking so late and locking up in the curve, and he was making the same mistake over and over again in P3.
Well, at I achieved something: your entertainment.
Bottas was 2nd in 2020, stop making stuff up
Which is why I said it's less about Tsunoda.  They can't pretend to be promoting De Vries because Tsunoda is outperforming him, and so Tsunoda is the only driver RBR have in their pipeline as a threat.
How are they held back though? They're out front in both championships. Like, they couldn't get any more forward than they are.
Why do you think Ricciardo would be any closer to Max than he was to Lando?
They were saying that Ricciardo on the sim really didn't do enough for this idea, unfortunately.
They won the WDC and WCC last year and are going to easily win it this year. Not seeing where the mistake is. Perez is a solid driver and nothing Ricciardo did the last two years would make me think he's any better than Perez is right now.
But why rush in a young driver who might actually end up being worse? That's not good for Red Bull or Tsunoda. Perez is a known quantity who is getting more than good enough results for this year.  Let Tsunoda develop for another season and then evaluate once Perez's contract ends. We've seen with Albon and Gasly what can happen to young drivers who are rushed into the RB seat, so letting Tsunoda get better in a lower pressure environment means he is more likely to actually do well if/when he gets there.
Can’t be sure if this is trolling
But look at what happened with Albon and Gasly. It's not "wasting time" it's being careful not to waste his career by pushing him too early.
He had issues with his car in FP3 and qualy. It meant he had reduced practice time and then his brakes couldn't give them the same retardation he expected from precvious practice when it mattered in qualy.
The technical issue that both him and Marko said would be fixed in time for the race. I don't know if you noticed but the only time he went off during the race was during one of the race restarts when be had nowhere else to go.
Because we all see that RBR has the best car on the field and anything other than a podium is disappointing. Perez should've had, at least, a P3 at the AusGP because that P5 was a lucky one.
Because Ricciardo would be driving in a machine he's familiar with it (by machine I mean RBR as a whole) not to mention that there is a lot less pressure now than before at Renault or McLaren. He'd be practically driving for fun!
Because he was close to Max when he was still a rookie at least. Ricciardo has looked great everywhere except McLaren.   It's perfectly reasonable not to write him off unless he gets another seat and fails to perform yet again. Judging driver ability in f1 is really difficult.
Really? Do you have a source I could bite into?
Well, Max did it and he was a lot younger than Tsunoda who, by the way, is going to be 23 years old very soon. Conversely, De Vries isn't showing much and he's barely five years younger than Perez.   Alonso and Max have proven to us that age is but a number. You either have it or you don't, and the only way to find out is by throwing Tsunoda to the wolves.
I am not trolling. Just because I have a different opinion than everyone else doesn't mean I am a troll.
I reckon that they were impatient with both of then, more so with Gasly. They needed a bit of time to develop. Gasly could've been an excellent No. 2 at RBR by now. As for Albon, yeah, that race when Perez overtook him was the nail on the coffin.   I get it, Perez was needed at the time but that was then and this is now, and RBR has two excellent drivers to upgrade the position. Why wait?
Perhaps but he should've been keen to addressed then properly. If b-bal or any other parameter wasn't there, he should've have told them instead of just complaining. Alonso, Hamilton tell their teams *exactly* what is wrong and what it is needed. Perez seems to be just complaining.   Perhaps I am wrong, perhaps Perez is all over his garage but until I see a consistent qualy, I'll still think that RBR should replace him.
Yes, I agree that that one during the race is a driving incident but how can one defend him for that dreaful qualy?
He's second in the driver's championship 3 races in after a weekend where he had mechanical issues in multiple sessions.
Yes, when Max was a rookie, he was close but behind. Then he was far behind a rookie Norris.   So we can assume that Norris is driving way better than Max?  Max has improved a lot in the past couple years as well.
That's great, but why do it mid-season? Perez gets massively upset, Tsunoda gets no testing before running in the Red Bull, Red Bull has to deal with unnecessary disruption and extra work, Alpha Tauri have to deal with a driver who has no interest in being there. All of that just to change out the number 2 driver.  There's just no reason for a mid-season driver change when they can wait 20 races and change with no drama.
Sure, but the idea itself is a bit out there hence my surprise
Why wait? Because of the things you said in your first paragraph. It's not like Yuki is losing steam in the AT or other big teams are jumping to sign him. Perez is doing the job fine, literally why take the risk of pushing Yuki too soon?
He spoke about it almost constantly throughout FP3 and this was shown several times on the televised feed. Did we watch the same show?
I'm just going to redirect you to my first reply
Yes but how far from that championship is he? That P5 at the AusGP was a very lucky one.
I'm just saying you can't rate Ricciardo entirely based on his stint at McLaren because there's a good chance he just mentally tuned out and didn't even try anymore.  Fundamentally all I'm saying is that it isn't out of the question that Ricciardo has the potential to outperform Perez just because he performed poorly at McLaren.  Also, Lando was very much not a rookie anymore when he was Ricciardo's teammate.
How about during the summer break? I think it could be a good time to do it.
I'm on board with most of the ideas and opinion in F1 but this, and the stewards' controversies, are not in sync with me as with the rest of the sub. I've been called names and whatnot but I refuse to be a clapping seal because I believe that having a different idea and opinion brings in interesting responses, some have changed my mind.
I actually had the onboard from Perez. Yes, he complained a lot but what about it? Where is the technical side from him? Like Hamilton and Alonso do. He's been in the sport for a long time, he should know better!
It doesn't matter? He's the second driver. Better that Max has a comfortable gap. Did you watch 2016?
No, indeed we can't, so why would RB gamble literally millions on him over Yuki or retaining their known quantity in Perez?  Also by my calculation there was a half season difference in terms of how green Max and Lando were when going against Ricciardo.
You still get all the drama. Tsunoda doesn't get any testing, Perez still spends the rest of the year comparing in the media.   My question still stands - what benefit do you get doing it mid-season this year, rather than between seasons?
Again, sure. You do you.
Yeah he should really learn that the team radio is the best place to give away all your secrets, the silly boy.

Some jokes write themselves
No harm in doing that.
Well it's frustrating and hopefully this would been seen as the biggest "oops" for Alpine this season but it looks like this doesn't hurt the upcoming upgrade package.  So much what ifs but that's F1.
This may be the butt of many jokes (very funny jokes, admittedly), but it is a very smart choice.
As someone once said by failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail, at least Alpine are being prepared to handle any future incidents that involve their own cars  If your wondering that was Benjamin Franklin who said "by failing to prepare, prepare to fail"
What's unfortunate is very often the parts that get broken most commonly have a significant amount of aero upgrades throughout the season. They have some smart guys there in the factory. I'm sure they will figure it out.

You might call it a crash program.

Interestingly enough, I'm fairly certain this is forbidden (or it used to be at least) - I recall a story about this back in the day when it was common for all podium finishers to drop the champagne bottles to the team mechanics. I guess someone at the FIA wanted to prevent someone from getting hurt, or they didn't like the look of broken champagne bottles because it never happened that all three made it in one piece each. :P  Alonso doesn't seem to care much, though. Good for him, it's a stupid rule.
Haven't seen any driver drop the bottle down to the team in ages
Alonso makes me want to go buy AMF1 team gear.
Watching this man develop since Minardi has been a sight to behold. When you look back through the cast of F1 in 20 years, he’s gonna stand out the most for me.
I loved this. I'm gaining so much respect for Alonso this year
I still remember one of the 2006 ones breaking!
Just watch the FIA ban this.
Alonso's well experienced with Ferraris and being let down
I'm new to the sport (managed to catch some of the Australian F1 this past weekend). Dude seems like a class act.
So funny, in the past I didn't like Alonso. But in the last couple of years he is becoming one of my favourite drivers,  and he is still showing that he is a true champion.   I wish the media (and us fans!!!) would stop making up stories and making us choose sides and making us hate certain drivers.   The last race the podium was filled with champions who have shown their true race-craft and after their respect after. And because the media is now making the number one against the number 2 story again just like alonso /hamilton/rosberg and now Verstappen/Perez and not lighting out the relations between the 3 drivers on stage.    Did anyone else noticed the al the camera shots where of them being friendly?.  Because now it's not a story anymore.    We and the drivers are being framed by the media.  Do you all notice how easy it is to be manipulated by media for their gains.  Think about this with the next elections in your home country.    I love still love F1 and for the love of the sport I stopped following it in the media. And last race was an example why
Not even the Ferrari champagne can stay on the podium 😢
This man ages better than those bottles of champagne.
It was Michael Schumacher who started this trend, a few years prior to 2006.
Awww. ....nando still got all his hair.......
Thanks, Dan Gurney, for starting one of the greatest sports celebrations ever.
Consist3ncy
Alonso being Alonso
From what I recall, Schumi and Fernando used to do this pretty regularly
How is this tradition?  Ferrari can’t make champagne.
Isn’t this sport totally corrupted now?
This looks like a boat
I remember seeing Charles (I believe) do this once and thought it was an extremely classy move.
I don't understand tradition.
♥️♥️👍🏻👍🏻
I love seeing him win again. Such a goodie.
Guess they didn't want the rose water in the first 2 races 😂
Catching a giant bottle is very dangerous compared to driving around at 300kmph. -FIA  Edit: Kmph wtf is that. I should stop inventing.
FIA says no fun allowed 😤😤😤
Totally forgot it used to be quite common for Hakkinen and Schumi to drop the bottles to their team yeah
Schumacher did it when he got his podium with Mercedes. And I think I've seen it done since. Maybe Seb with Ferrari? Or Maybe Lando/Daniel at Monza?
I bet this rule came up for a race in Middle East.
Because advertising/product placement. Nothing to do with safety.
pretty sure they dont allow that anymore. I think it was because someone dropped it.
IIRC he did this after his Qatar podium with Alpine as well
Now bring back the airhorns as well.
Pretty sure Leclerc did at some point   https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/onb7ey/charles\_passing\_the\_ferrari\_sparkling\_wine\_to\_his/
dont lol every time i see it its in a post about it falling apart after a single wash. probably better off buying alonso's kimoa stuff if anything.
My bank account is screaming at me not to do it, but honestly i’m so close to pulling the trigger
I was about to but the neon green ALO caps are sold out now.
I wanted to buy the t-shirt since this year's merch collection appeared, but it's always in pre-order :(
I love Alonso, but I won't do that.
Totally agree, he is a thorough professional and dedicates his life to F1 and driving. A true legend of the sport and I would easily rank Alonso alongside Senna for his grit and passion for motor racing.
If only we could rewind to 2014 and have him not join McLaren that season... so many years lost.
He’s one of the best of all time for me
It's really fun seeing him embrace the team and lift them up. It's turning into a dream partnership for keeping Aston on this great path.
He knows and acknowledges better than anyone else the huge importance of the team
I’m fairly happy to see him fighting for good positions, because he’s an exceptional driver.   As for the respect, I inevitably must consider the man other than the driver: I’m afraid he behaved not as the best sportsman in the past.
Pretty sure it was moments after the picture on the left if that's the Chinese Gp. The Reanult team member drops it and then Schumacher walks over and drops his off to a Ferrari crew member. He catches it and the Ferrari crew cheer. Pretty funny moment if you can find a place to watch it.  Edit: 1:51:30 on F1TV
It already is and has been for years
If so, Alonso should protest this by getting a cock ring.
The FIA bans everything that's slightly fun
For once he can let the Ferrari down instead of the other way around
He is.  And while a lot of people are saying he can be toxic, he has tolerated a huge number of underperforming teams who have wasted his talent. And the reason he remained a class act through it all was that he drove exactly the same way: Relentlessly, aggressively, quickly, smoothly, consistently. He never gave up, in the shittiest car he still gave everything.  He's a modern legend.
May I interest you into some Alonso content? Careful, you'll be hooked in no time  [Best starts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpUy41CRR0)  [Brilliance compilation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcx1bcSfPlw)  [F1 story so far](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PepKLiBvx4)  [And radio classics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyNoSz-UvM)  edit, almost forgot the [best one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CCH3iHW1Ig)
Right now yeah. But boy oh boy we have a story to tell you
I am saying this as someone who loves seeing Alonso back on the podium. He's a 'class act' now that everything is going amazing in the team. He can be absolutely toxic when things don't go as smoothly.
Lol.
The tradition was this legend
Italian "spumante" is quite similar, sometimes even better than some french brands
Well, yeah. Because the car is built for crashes, the bottle is not /s
>	300kmph  300 thousand miles per hour
Kilomiles per Hour
Kmph is the sound I make when showing contempt. :D
well.. ummm. yeah?
Well, the world-caliber athlete, the driver, isn't doing the catching, to be fair.
I mean, driving a car at 300 km/h is a necessary part of racing, dropping giant bottles is not.  I don't have an opinion on this issue, but it's quite dumb to say that because x thing in an event is dangerous, then anything that is not more dangerous should be allowed.
Kpmh = KMag podium, HOLA!
Kilo Meters Per Hour
are you a ferrari strategist with all this inventing?
Fun   Isn't   Allowed
Chad Alonso did it anyway...I didn't see any FIA police jump out and try to tackle him
I'm not sure I see the relationship. You'd think it has to do with alcohol, but the fact is, they don't use actual champagne in the races there, but a non-alcoholic beverage (I forgot what it is), so that's definitely not it.
„Someone“ dropped it? I remember watching F1 back in those days and it felt like the team celebrated actually catching the bottle more than the podium because most of the time the bottles broke 😅
Really? It's getting quite ridiculous with the rules lately...
The fence rule is the most ridiculous thing of all time
I came here to make a joke about it being only a matter of time before the FIA ban this dangerous activity, sure enough here we are.  If we're to ban everything that could be dangerous we should keep spectators at home and not allow the mechanics to do pit stops
Love the airhorns on TV, at the track maybe not so much 🤣
Damn really?  I was eyeballing the  Hugo Boss 1/4 zip pullover
The team shirts are the ones that fall off from drying them. The actual lifestyle shirts are holding up well for me. I wouldn't buy anything related to team gear at the moment and if you do, don't dry it and hang dry it.
Also I'm not a fan of turning into a walking billboard.
Can‘t wait for his 2nd comeback to F1 after his 2nd retirement
I just hope the man can get one more win to cap off an amazing (so far) season.  It'll take a lot with those Red Bulls, but both he and Aston deserve it this year.
> It's really fun seeing him embrace the team and lift them up.  I was very skeptical of Lawrence Stroll, even before the Aston Martin purchase. I've very humbly eating my hat so far this year, and honestly I couldn't be happier.  I'm starting to consider Larry the "Anti-Zak." I don't think he'll be wiping the grin off Horner's smug little face anytime soon, but it's VERY nice to see them put McLoudmouth in his place.
Agreed.  Fernando has always been a good guy to have on your team. Helps the younger guys, knows when to support others especially after shit happens. It's a great thing to see.
I think he is also realistic and celebrates every podium as it would be his last.
Dude rolled out the tires for his car last race. What a nice man.
Downvoters should check events like the crashgate, the feud with Hamilton at McLaren or how he basically burned bridges with every team he raced for, often throwing hundreds of people working for him under the bus with his comments. He’s an amazing driver, but far from being a legend to my eyes.
*rubs eyes*
The act of solidarity we never expected.
I second everything you said.  Relentless.  It's all that comes to mind when I think of Alonso.
just one?
> He can be absolutely toxic when things don't go as smoothly.  This is the case with pretty much every other top driver in the history of the sport. It's just that Alonso is the only one who's spent the majority of his career in midfield/backmarker cars even while being amongst the absolute best on the grid, which will naturally lead to more instances of things happening.  People seem to forget the things Vettel or Schumacher did. Even Lewis. It's just part and parcel of having such an extreme winning mentality which separates the top drivers from the great drivers.
He's not wrong, alonso is widely known as a class act
Why poison a new fan like this? Let them discover that life isn't fair the way the rest of us have -- by suffering under the avarice of the FIA.
Which gate? Neither crashgate nor spygate were Alonso's doing.
Halo for the bottles when?
Built in diffuser for better pour when?
Yes it is! Remember the tradition of launching a brand new ship? They whack that sucker real good!
Rose water, I think
They usually just use rose water.
I can totally imagen those engineers of Ferrari in 2002 / 2004 celebrating the engineer who caught the bottle more than the race win haha.
It's been banned for years, can't remember the last time...I think it was even before the Vettel and Redbull time
It's not a recent thing. That Bottle is sponsored and said sponsor doesn't like it's product being dropped and broken
Bottle drops. Out comes the SC.
It is but I am surprised it lasted this long, they put an awful lot of trust in those fences that probably were not installed and rated to have that weight hanging off them.    But you know what they could have done instead? Just made it a requirement when building the circuit that the fence was strong and rated for that lateral load and weight on top so they could continue doing it without fear it falls down.    It must be due to some insurance liability concerns, stupid tho
Personally I have no idea how this was allowed for this long. They're employees at work and their employer has a duty of care to make sure they're as safe as reasonably practicable while at work. In oil and gas you can get written up for carrying a cup of coffee up the stairs without a lid on or not holding the hand rail.
not sure if its still the same but i remember a bunch of posts last year with letters falling off AM shirts really fast. maybe the hats are fine but yea.
They’re very nice just don’t get them caught on Velcro
With the redbull reliability being spotty in the past I'd fully expect mechanical failures being the cause for an Alonso win this year, but I'm excited either way honestly! I love Alonso on this Aston arc :)
I’ve really come to admire lance as well. He knew everyone thought little of him as the ultimate pay driver because daddy bought the team but he’s never gotten shitty about it, just head down and prove them wrong and now I truly don’t think he can be called just a pay driver, he’s got genuine talent and seems to be liked. Happy for the guy
Zak is going to be gone real soon
<Hamilton has entered the chat>
This is a fairly recent phenomenon.
spending those years at McHonda really makes him appreciate ~~F1 engines~~ greener pastures
Before this season, his last podium was in 2014. At the time, nobody would've expected that to be his last. That probably made him realize how hard it is to actually be up there.
Can't catch any other driver doing that, just made my respect for him increase.
Maybe he's just a fan of Really3d and wanted to embrace the meme.
Now this is a very *Sky Sports F1™*  way to look at those things
>the crashgate  Cleared of all charges, and still to this day there is absolutely zero evidence of him being in on it, and people who were in on it, consistently said he didn't know about it.   >the feud with Hamilton at McLaren  I mean, it's typical racing driver shit. 2 highly competitive and highly skilled young men in the same team fighting eachother for the #1 spot. It's not the first or last time its happened. Stuff like Hungary 2007 for example, people just seemingly remember Alonso holding Hamilton up in the PIT, but conveniently forget that it was a response to Hamilton not doing what they previously agreed to.  Doesn't make it right, but it was a 2 player game and it was the team's inability to control them that was the issue.    > he basically burned bridges with every team he raced for,  Alonso returned to renault in 2008 and 2021, and returned to mclaren in 2015, so no, I don't think this is true at all. His most controversial thing was spygate, which obviously damaged his relationship with mercedes, no doubt about that.  > often throwing hundreds of people working for him under the bus with his comments  Almost everyone that Alonso has worked  with in the past has only good things to say about him. He is currently working with a lot of people that was there with him in 2007. The whole "Alonso is toxic and turns the entire team sour" narrative is almost entirely baseless.
We're with Lewis on this one.
As long as they don't form a chain, we're good to go.
Several books' worth, honestly.  Same with Seb though. His last couple years on the grid he was Captain Wholesome but before that? Hooooo boy.
*when it’s going well for him
Not by Ron Dennis
Good point. Hey OP have you seen Ferrari? Nice cars, you might want to support that team!
I've heard 2027, but I could be wrong.
Would make a great handle unironically
The catering budget
Rubber bottles.
Kilometers per hour = km/h or kph
He knows.
Yeah, that's the one. Thank you!
That can't be the case, I got into F1 in 2009 and I've seen it multiple times, but not in a while
Yeah I can't really remember them doing that a lot since I started watching in 2009. Seems after 2009 they stopped doing that.
That sounds so dumb, the bottle and the sponsor get some prime tv time (see this picture)
The partnership for the champagne changed in 2021, so we’ll after any ‘ban’ on dropping it down to their team…
I mean ideally it should stop an 1800-lb car flying through the air.
Nobody is forcing them… God I hate people that want to ban other peoples fun, because they deem it to dangerous. These guys voluntary spend 70% of their life in airplanes and hotels so we can watch the sport we love, I’d say if they want some “dangerous” fun (aka no incident in over 100 years), we let them be grown fucking adults and decide for themselves.
No one in the very long history of Motorsport (to my knowledge) has ever been injured or close to being injured by this.
Stroll had mechanical failure so I wouldn't say AM is bullet proof.
There's no way there's not a single race that neither red bull finishes. The question is if Alonso is still on track and in position to capitalize on that.
I stopped watching/following F1 in the mid-00's, came back at the end of covid season.  My impression of Stroll then was a solid upper-midfield driver with some serious skill in the wet (not nearly the equal of Lewis/Max, but fucking good in the wet). He's continued to show that since (his start a few weeks back, when he tore through the field) and yes, he goes awol mentally sometimes. But that's why he's likely never going to make an all-time driver. Doesn't mean he can't be called a good driver (feels almost like my school reports "Spider is more than capable for this curriculum and has consistently managed to impress me with the knowledge he has accrued, when he applies himself fully to his work". On second thoughts, it's likely a good think me and Lance are a bit hare-brained, I don't think the world would be ready for Ultra Instinct Lance and Spider).
why would he, though? his job is to attract sponsors, and he does that very well
From your lips to god's ears.
Maybe he gave Hamilton the Whiplash treatment and it worked. Judging by Hamilton‘s career, Alonso was a great mentor.
Nando has always been like this. It’s just been completely overshadowed by media taking his bluntness out of context. He’s a very literal person; what he says, he means 100%. In the same way people hated him for being real in criticism, it’s the same reason people love him for lifting up his team - because he’s being genuine in doing so.
Not really. His public image may have been whatever, but the vast majority of people that have worked with him have a positive opinion of him. Honestly, his bluntness isn't even special in Spain. That's how most people here will say things.
Perfect pun
>Before ~~this season~~, his last podium was in 2014.  Qatar 2021
That’s my point of view from the surely limited info I could get when the facts happened. It may very well that much of the info came from Sky, although I always kept up with F1 with a variety of sources, from AtlasF1 to RaceFans.  Again, I’d love to see him on top of the podium again, he’s an incredible driver and great asset for the sport. People love this type of stories, the raise of Aston we’re seeing these days.   And I still remember how he could put those Ferraris where they didn’t belong, or that race with that McLaren on just a single wheel.  It just irks me when I read he’s a “class act” or “much respect”. As I’m free to do it, I don’t put him in the same “class act” box as Vettel or Lewis.
Would give them an incentive to keep a close battle going throughout a race. Pit stop will be the hardest.
Just Captain Wholesome?   What about Inspector, Firefighter, Mechanic and what not?
*only when you personally piss him off, then he will eat the juiciest peach you have ever seen next to you in revenge
Not really, everyone that has worked with him (ferrari, mclaren, and even alpine outside management) says he's a very nice dude.
Max and Lewis are exactly the same.
You mean the same person who re-hired him in 2015?
Confirmed, my dad works at Nintendo.
Reddit handle or bottle handle?
The Carbon champers that they used to serve comes in bottles covered in CF composite.  They won't break.
Big mistake
No idea...not like banning something makes people stop doing it... Unless the consequences are big they will still do it, and sometimes even in that case.  (Talking in general not this specific case)
If that's the case and these are built to standards to stop a car then this shouldn't be an issue IMO and it is a BS rule  But if its just a regular bog standard chainlink fence that could have been there for years in the elements without any maintenance, then I could see the concern
The fact that a gate was built to stop an elephant on one side doesn't necessarily mean it can stop a mouse walking from the other side.
These rules shouldn't be reactive though. We shouldn't wait for someone to fall off the fence and die before making a safety rule.  I can get not wanting everything to be "bubble wrapped" but the reasoning is sound.
Sure, Alonso needs to get lucky just once though
I wouldn't either. But so far I've heard of way more redbull issues than from AM
Even Williams and Haas can attract sponsors now, he needs to get the team making performance progress.
Whoops.
>I don’t put him in the same “class act” box as Vettel or Lewis.  Both these drivers have called our or said shit about their teams. Any top driver is going to be vocal when something is happening. The fact you choose to use it against Alonso when your flair driver has been just as "toxic" is hilarious.
No touching during penalties.
Fast =/= class act
Sir... What the fuck?
Boing.
Can't spell an abbreviation  "Stupid American"
And I made a joke, because of a typo. You must be fun at parties.
Literally 2 years ago, from 2021 and onwards
They are designed for capturing an f1 car, it’s part of the criteria for being rated as a grade 1 track.
I get your point, but that's not the concern. The only real concern is someone falling off the fence and cracking their head. I suppose some people have a ghoulish fear of someone falling on track and being struck by a car, but again probably more fear of the concrete.   The static load the mechanics are putting on the fence is nothing compared to the dynamic load it's designed to take.
Sadly all motorsport rules are written in blood, so the only way for it to be banned is for someone to actually fall onto the path of a vehicle
Ban all car racing then because someone may get hurt 🤷
Safety rules are ALWAYS reactive
Most rules in life are reactive
You are assuming that these guys don't know the risks themselves. For a commoner, shure there should be rules regarding where they could or couldn't go in a paddock, but these guys are experts who know what risks they are taking by climbing up the wall
Red Bull has 0 retirements this season while Aston has one so I’m not sure what your basing that on…
that’s the team principal’s job
You must be fun at parties aswell!
Yeh then this rule is very silly, maybe they should have given them harnesses instead 😜
I recall racing IS banned in some countries… Was Switzerland one of them? I seem to recall it was…
I think it’s because on broadcasts they’re always cutting to Max talking about some issue on the radio
Look at you go
Then why are you shitting on others for a joke? What's the point of the "you stupid American" part?
Damn, you are smart AF.
Kimi would be ashamed of you
I'm going to have one in your honor. We'll have all the best games, pin the tail on the donkey, spin the bottle, seven minutes in heaven.   Do concerned coming.
No, forgot how it's called, but racing in a circle is forbidden. So basically almost every major motorsport competition.  Rallying and mountain climbing are still allowed though. And they made an exception for Formula E.
Great example, because that ban was a direct consequence of the worst accident in the history of the sport: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1955_Le_Mans_disaster
"GP, my downshifts are gone"
Tbf every third punchline to a joke in my country is: "you stupid American"
Well, 50% right is good enough for me. 😂
Yup, that was horrifying. Just saw it on YouTube not two 2 days ago…

Already 22? Wow, didn’t know he was only 1 year younger than Lando. For some reason thought Piastri was 20.
When I was a kid I always dreamed of becoming an F1 driver. Now there's one who's a year younger than me (and another one who's barely a month older) on the grid, and that sort of stings a little.
I have the same birthday as the future goat. You love to see it.
I’m actually surprised by that. I don’t know why I thought there’d be more of an age gap between him and Lando.
Happy birthday !
I just realized I’m older than him. Not a fun realization
Today I found out that Oscar and I share birthdays. Huzzah!
Damn I’m 24 hours younger than him, I thought he was like 18 because he looks younger.
Happy birthday pastry boy
Getting old
Happy Birthday 🎉
What I would give to be 22 again….
He looks older
Lando is turning 24 in November, so 1,5 years younger, but yeah they are quite close
Crazy how Lando’s in his 5th season while Oscar’s a rookie. Lando is the 3rd youngest driver to ever start an F1 race after Lance and Max!
Lance is only 24 too, he’s the one that always surprises me at how young he is
Happy birthday current goat 🫡
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday!  I share mine with Lando haha
Happy early birthday!
Australians always do
Crazy, even Lando's been in F1 since he was pretty young.
Who's next after Lando? Kimi maybe?
Cheers sir 🫡
Verstappen has been racing in F1 for longer than Damon Hill,yet he's still 6 years younger than Damon was during his debut.  I know I'm comparing 2 extremes here, but thought it was a fun stat.
Strangely enough, it’s actually Jaime Alguersuari! After him it’s Mike Thackwell, who had two career starts in 1980 and 1984, then Ricardo Rodríguez, then Fernando Alonso.

if you're really interested in immersing yourself in a particular season of f1, you can find some 2000s-era season reviews narrated by ben edwards floating around on youtube. a lot of these are entertaining enough to watch by themselves without any controversies imo.  the most exciting seasons i'd recommend are:  2003 - 3-way title fight between schumacher, juan pablo montoya and raikkonen, and a heated battle between tyre suppliers michelin and bridgestone  2005 - fernando vs. kimi for the title, the tyre war between michelin and bridgestone gets explosive(literally)  2007 - hamilton's first season; he gets wrapped up in a 3-way title battle with fernando and kimi, and the spygate scandal
Spain 2012 birthday tyre conspiracy.  Allegedly Williams were given special tyres to be more competitive and then burned the garage down after the race to hide the evidence.  It is if course bollocks.  But good fun nontheless
2005 US GP  have fun
You didnt say exactly when you started watching F1.   I would like to suggest watching 2016 Russian Grand Prix and then the 2016 Spanish Grand Prix.
I recommend 2007 and Spygate just because 2007 is probably the most messiest F1 season in recent history and Spygate is the most messiest scandal ever. If you’re in the UK, the BBC have a podcast series about it.
The results will stand as it is, its almost 15-years ago. There is no way its going to change. Despite Alonso win, one must also not forget Felipe Massa worst pit stop when he exited the pit with the refueling nose attached.  From that point of time, he already knew the world title is over, this is not factoring in the crash gate controversy. Just the pit lane error itself cost his championship.
Bernie Ecclestone (F1 boss), Max Mosley (FIA boss), Charlie Whiting (F1 race director) all knew about the rigged race in 2008 and just covered it up. They knew about it because Nelson Piquet went and told them when they were in Brazil.  Usually the results of a rigged race are thrown out but because they covered it up Massa lost the WDC.
Check Germany 2008, race that happend 2 months earlier, and Piquet got his only podium. You'll see how they got the idea for the Singapore "strategy".
2017 Baku - Crofty repeatedly saying that Hamilton had brake tested Vettel. He never admits he was wrong even after Vettel gets a penalty,
1981 after reading how everyone, especially Jones and Ecclestone, sabotaged Lole's championship race.
Also started watching later... I had no idea that massa was good enough to beat kimi in the same car... I always thought of massa as someone like bottas
Thanks for the tips. I have already watched 2007. I'll take a look at 2003 & 2005.
Could you post a link? My wife and I got into F1 in the last few years and have been looking for good ways to watch some pre DTS history of the sport.
It's bonkers but I can totally get behind it haha.  This entire complicated sport and it's decided on a birthday gift haha.
"It's lights out and away we snooze"
Yeah I agree with this. It was a massive disappointment for Massa, but it wasn't the crash that ruined his race, it was a technical fault giving him the green light to go during the pit stop. If he had a clean stop he would have still been in the points and ultimately may have won the 2008 WDC. But it just wasn't to be. Whether the crash was rigged or not, all the other drivers had to respond to a change in the race circumstances. At 15 years on it's unfair to change it now.
The argument is that the refueling mechanism was broken which It was and the pitstop would have spiralled out of control anyway.   Also if you've watched Silverstone 2008 you can't tell me Massa was at his best that year, honestly a horrific effort
Results of a race cannot be thrown out. The rules don’t allow it. Bernie made that up.   Renault was charged under 151c. You can read the rules here there is no remedy involving nullification of an entire race. https://argent.fia.com/web/fia-public.nsf/917D67F70F1C5EE7C12573B7003DCEC5/$FILE/CSI%20modif%20ap%20AGO%20oct%2007%20ANG%20-%20Applic.%2001.01.08%20-%20clean.pdf
I wouldn't trust a word Bernie says to be honest. Blokes been a bitter and twisted old man for a good few years now. Think it was only last season he said that Massa should sue Glock.
>Usually the results of a rigged race are thrown out  can you name one example?  didn't think so
And Piquet only informed because Renault were not going to renew his contract....
> Usually the results of a rigged race are thrown out  When has any race been thrown out?  The guilty party are DSQ and everyone moves up a spot.  Yes you can envision a situation where the butterflies changed and massa won, but that never gets changed.
And he's not entitled to an opinion ?
Massa was very good until he took a spring to the face in Hungary 09. He was never the same guy after that. It almost killed him, so the change is understandable.
2007 is where you understand how incredebily good Ham is. Not only driving wise, but also mentally - being in a title fight for basically all his season in F1 (bar last year probably).
I’m late but watching Kimi in Mclaren is so nice. His raw speed was just something different, and him and Alonso are like the changing of the guard to Schumi  2012 is also a fantastic season if you haven’t seen it
for seasons 2002-2009, you can literally just youtube search "200X formula one season review", and it'll usually be the top result. there's a particular channel called 'F1 RETRO' that posts all of these reviews, they should be around 2-3 hours long  just in case, here are links for 2003 & 2005:  2003: https://youtu.be/7IHbRInCajI  2005: https://youtu.be/DYwmVQSENQU
I mean, everyone was going off that race, but yeah, Massa spun more than a figure skater. And since the race in question wasn’t the finale, it’s impossible to know how the remaining races would have gone had the results there been thrown out immediately.
Bernie made that up?  That would imply he indicted himself into this mess for what reason?? Bernie is a willy old fox, not the shoot himself in the foot kinda guy
There is precedent. In Rallye Sanremo 1986, Peugeot were robbed by corrupt Italian stewards. Peugeot appealed the result and won the case after the season was over and the result of that rally was deducted from the WRC.
If I remember correctly, it was Piquet Sr. who informed them.
which then cost him any chance of a seat at any other team, because no one wanted a snitch in their team. Sad but true probably.
And Lewis looked like who in Canada?  Lewis is a better driver overall by far, no doubts, but he has been far from perfect that year either, to put it mildly.  Talking on Silverstone, you have to know, Ferrari car was extremely poor in cold and wet conditions that year. The car was very fast on normal days, but it had an issue with tire warm-up, and keeping them up to operational temperatures. This is why they were so slow in wet, on cool days, not just just at Silverstone, but also later at Monza and other places. That season was unique and complete outlier because of big number of races and quali in such conditions. That saved Lewis and Mclaren chances.
Do you believe in alternative facts?
He wasn’t on the title fight from 2009 to 2013 though. Not even the WDC pódium in any of those years. So no “title fight all his seasons bar 2021”.  Tbf, when he doesn’t have *the* fastest car by a mile, he hasn’t impressed me as much as others world champions. Specially those that can put a “bad” car in high places, something I haven’t seen Lewis do.
That’s great thank you, any particular seasons you recommend?
not recently lol. Last year he said f1 should return to Russia and he’d take a bullet for Putin who is a great man. Then he got arrested like a week after that for carrying a gun. Then he got arrested again a bit later for tax fraud in the UK. Been doing nothing but self destruction for a year
different sport  different rules  different situation - it's the stewards who were corrupt, not a fellow competitor
The rules were not the same then. It was a different situation in general but again, read the rule book for 2008 there it’s not a thing. The teams agree to be legally bound under the ISC. There is no legal grounds to do it. Bernie was chatting his usual shit. He’s facing trial in a few months again so a good time to make headlines
Precedents mean fuck all, especially in a different sport, when the rulebook at the time does not allow for this. You're gonna have to back your claim with a line from the rulebook.
Nobody wanted Piquet because he wasn’t fast, the snitch part was just a little extra on top
That argument is just an excuse, Kimi was going to finish 2nd in that "extremely poor in cold and wet conditions" Ferrari, had his team not bottled the strategy. Even with that blunder he finished 5th, while Massa finished in 13th, the only driver to finish 2 laps down, after spinning *5 times*. That is incomparable to Canada.
Do you believe nobody should question stewards decisions ?
I think you're misunderstanding what is being said.  The previous user is saying that 2007 and 2021 are the only times Hamilton has been in the WDC fight for an entire season.
apart from the ones i've mentioned, '08 was good for obvious reasons, '09 was interesting because of brawn gp and the rise of red bull. i would recommend more recent seasons like 2010 and 2012, but iirc there aren't any reviews for those seasons uploaded on yt, so you'd be better off watching individual races for those(if you have f1tv).   on the other hand, if you're willing to go back a lot further, i'd recommend the season reviews for 1982, 1984 and 1986(assuming they're still uploaded), all narrated by the late clive james. they're pretty funny, but also interesting if you're into the history of the sport. 1982 had a rollercoaster championship battle, and was the last year before ground effect was banned in '83, so you'll get to see some instances of porpoising 40 years before it became a hot topic in 2022. '86 was also good because of the 3 way title battle between prost, mansell and piquet, with a few glimpses of senna occasionally in the mix as well...
That's great, all self-serving acts. Wtf  would he imply a statement that could land him in front of a judicial hearing for no reasonable gain??
Charlie Whiting said the same. He knew about it from Piquet told Max Mosley about it and they decided to keep it under the lid. It's never a good look when the FIA boss, F1 boss and F1 race director all decide to do this grand cover up.   What happened to Massa doesn't sit right with me. He had so much bad luck in his career but to have this against him as well. If I were him I would sue even if the chances of fixing this wrong are slim to none.
F1 and WRC are both under FIA.
I could understand that until the parenthesis. He seems to imply that Lewis has been in the fight for the championship in all his seasons bar last year.
What judicial hearing? There isnt going to be one because its BS lol.
I think you're right - I don't think the coffee kicked in for me while I was reading the thread. Sorry about that.
I'd say no as well. Just don't see Bernie's point in bullshitting
Don’t worry about it. I’m glad you could enjoy some coffee ha!

They’d be ordered to create similar tires to the Pirelli. Bursts may reduce tho
I don’t think it matters who they go with, the teams and fans will find a reason to complain and beg for something different.
The only thing Pirelli is guilty of is making a Tire exactly how F1 tells it to make tires.
Bring Michelin. Yes Bridgestone is good and durable but no one make better tyres than Michelin.
The problem, the fundamental problem is that the cars are too massive (mass; kgs) it is a feat of incredible physics for these tires to do what they do given the aero loads and lateral gs (ALO measured at 7+G this weekend). However Pirelli sucks, we all know it and just accept it - but if youve been watching for a long time, they are the worst. Goodyear, Michelin, Bridgestone; all better.
I don't see why not, depending on what crazy regulations the FIA puts on them. I honestly don't know how much of the tire issues are due to Pirelli and how much are due to FIA requirements. My gut tells me it's probably a mix of both, but I have no idea as to the proportions.  Meanwhile, Bridgestone, via their Firestone division, seems to have done an excellent job with their Indycar tires. Indycar does have a similar rule to F1 where you need to use two different compounds during a race, so it's not something Bridgestone would be completely unfamiliar with.  Edit: fixed typo.
The secret I think not a lot of people are not saying out loud is that Pirelli is hiding behind the fact that F1 wants them to make shitty tires, when in all the other series they were in they also made shitty tires when trying not to make good tires.
Doesn't really matter, everybody will have the same tires
F1 could really use a different tire supplier  The drivers have done nothing buy complain about the Pirelli tires from day 1. Arguably because Pirelli makes the high deg tires that F1 asked for.  Michelin arguably makes the best racing car tires but straight up told the FIA "We have no interest in making tires that degrade on purpose, it's bad for our public image"  I can't blame them, I've been watching F1 for a decade and the only thing I know about Pirelli tires is that I don't want them on my car.
Bring back the Tire Wars!
Of course Bridgestone would do much better job, no doubts about that.
Almost looks  like there are hundreds Pirelli's bots out there advocating for crappy manufacturer, not really understanding the problem at all.
How many tires have failed as a result of pirelli, I cant think of an example
no.. this is a grotesque oversimplification, and quite misinformed if thats a conclusion to type.
Michelin doesn't want F1. The FIA will die on the hill of making tyres that degrade intentionally and Michelin had been supplying endurance series or series where tyre changing aren't a usual thing. That's why they've been doing WEC, MotoGP and until last year Formula E.
The offered a tinder in the last request for a proposal. However pirelli won by offering an extra $25mm to ecclestone and co.. so they got the extension. Michelin has wanted back in for a while but on better terms for the tire manufacturer. They are better than pirelli, and everyone knows it.
MotoGP says hi.
Agree. Even for road tires, nobody recommends any Pirelli over the equivalent Michelin.
Pirelli have said they could make tyres that last the whole race no problem, infact they said it's harder to make tyres designed to lose performance and encourage pit stops than it is to make tyres where people can push the whole lap
F1 doesn’t want Pirelli to make shitty tires. But the specifications are quite strict and yes they use them as an excuse.
I’ve tried the Pirellis twice on my road cars — never again 👎
Can't wait to have half the teams off the pace due to tyre war
Absolutely not its was so crap, you could have the fastest car by miles and not win because the tyres
With strict cost cap on tire manufacturers, maybe. Still not convinced even with that.
With Ferrari’s usual luck, they will finally have a car that is at the top of their game only to be held back by being with the wrong tyre manufacturer. 🤣
What would they do differently?  F1 wants tyres that degrade, so pirelli obliged and now they get shit on all the time
Last time was in Baku? Idk
No it’s not. Michelin doesn’t want to make tyres that degrade. F1 *needs* tyres that degrade to make the race exciting. That’s why Michelin won’t return and Pirelli will sign an extension yet again
Michelin doesnt want to adhere to the tender. That’s why they get rejected.   If we has Michelin every race would be like Australia with no strategy. You just drive the whole race on 1 tyre and get the mandatory stop out of the way at the end or a SC. No degradation is extremely boring and that’s why it’s mandatory in the tender
This. Most car enthusiasts sell the Pirelllis on brand new cars and instantly swap them out for Michelin Ps4s..
But you take Pirelli when you see the price on the Michelin lol.
that's complete rubbish not even worth arguing about. they will say anything to produce a better image for themselves.
Have you even watched the last couple of races? Did you see degrading tyres?  Me personally not, I saw clear-cut one stop races with drivers pushing very hard for most of the race.  People actually completely forgot what the FIA asked Pirelli of initially. They wanted basically to have 2 stop (at least) races all the time. It was the case first few years. But these days it's  not the case anymore, more races are 1-stoppers anyway. No one told Pirelli to produce crappy tires for  1-stop race . That's absolutely NOT what the FIA asked for back then, in 2011.  So, what would Bridgestone do differently? Easy answer - quality.  Bridgestone's (and Michelin's too) pedigree in motorsport, R&D resources, technology level and know-how are incomparable with Pirelli's.  Bridgestone tire would simply provide more grip in all conditions, much wider operational window, better structural robustness(we wouldn't see so many unexpected tire blowouts without any reason as with Pirelli) with the same, desired level of wear and thermal degradation. Their tires would be likely less prone to graining and bubbling as well.  They are simply better at their craft, at producing high-quality high-performance race tire, any tire really. Pirelli aren't even close. They are the 2nd, if not the 3rd grade manufacturer in  fact.  Here is some basic numbers to study.  2022 Top 8 Tire Manufactures World Wide  [https://toptirereview.com/statistics-of-the-tire-industry-in-2022/](https://toptirereview.com/statistics-of-the-tire-industry-in-2022/)  R&D annual spending:  Michelin €683 mil  Bridgestone €640 mil  Pirelli €240 mil  So, Pirelli being already massively behind in technology, spend still almost three times less. They are doomed to be behind the top dogs, forever, no doubts.  One shouldn't have any illusions about that.  If there was a competition, a tire war, Pirelli would've been annihilated not only by those two, but also by Goodyear and Continental. Pirelli know that, this is why they weren't interested in fighting against  Michelin and Bridgestone. And they wouldn't supply their tires if multiple manufacturers were allowed in F1 now.  Added:  also I recommend everyone to study this Wiki page. When there was a competition, Pirelli never were competitive against others, except for very first few years of F1 in early 1950s , which is completely irrelevant in the modern days.  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula\_One\_tyres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One_tyres)
You might have me there actually.... Wasn't that debris?
Michelin withdrew because they didn't want high deg tyres, but funnily enough the FIA no longer request that. Once Pirelli secured the tender, the request became to develop tyres that allowed drivers to push hard whilst encouraging two stop races.
Pirelli is absolute crap. Just look at the tires fitted on Aston Martin Valkyrie, even if Aston Martin are being sponsored by Pirelli in F1. They respect their customers, they don't want them to mess around swapping the tires on their new car.
Lmao. All said and done I actually quite like their Sottozeros.
They are ordererd by the FIA to produce tires that degrade in a certain way to produce i teresting racing.
"66-year-old results are irrelevant in the modern days"  *proceeds to use 32-year-old results to try and make a point*  Okay. But you seem to "know" a lot, and a lot of very specific things too in how exactly other manufacturers would be better, so do you have any sources to back that up other than "they're spending more money" and "they were better 32 years ago"? Being better at some point in time does not in any way imply that this will stay this way nor that financial spending is a good indicator of quality. Back to F1, Mercedes were on top of the game until recently when it seems they kind of shat the bed and produced a (for them) very sub-par car. Are you suggesting it is impossible for any established tyre manufacturer to go down a similar path and produce trash tyres, and vice versa for a manufacturer considered trash by some to have started producing (relatively) good tyres? Even in just a few years' time, a lot can change, just look at Michelin 1977 vs 1981.  Thing is, there is no way to compare different manufacturers if they're not run side-by-side during the same year so it's also not really going to be possible once we have a different manufacturer. And even side-by-side comparisons can and will be biased by team (car) performance and number of customers if in reality both brands of tyre are very similar in quality. Back to Michelin 1977, based on your table alone you'd say they produced an absolute trash tyre that year, coming in dead last against Goodyear that scored all the wins. What that table does not tell you is that during that year, Goodyear supplied 28 teams (yes, twenty-eight) and Michelin only a single one that only started a handful of races and finished none of them, unrelated to the tyres. That's obviously going to massively skew the results. I'd bet that year more Goodyear tyres failed than Michelin tyres. And back to your 32-year-old stat of Pirelli vs Goodyear in 1991, that's a bit similar because Pirelli only supplied four teams against Goodyear supplying 14. And keep in mind that was in an age where more cars blew up than managed to take the chequered flag so you'd really have to go in race by race and analyse car positions when DNFing for non-tyre-related reasons. It's almost as if you can't just look at a single stat without any context and base your entire point on that.  Not saying you're wrong but almost none of what you wrote is backed up by anything.
Pirelli said it was inner structure rather than debris. But I cannot recall if Pirelli’s minimum tire pressure for the weekend was followed by the teams
No, that was carcass structure and the pressures were reduced for the rest of the season.
You can only make a 2 stopper if the tyres degrade. That’s the point. If the tyres don’t lose performance you can’t make up the extra stop over the 1 stop.
Are they ordered to produce crap as well?
yes, you said basically nothing interesting and valuable whatsoever. waste of time both for the writer and the readers. thanks a lot.
Yeah fair enough
Deg comes in many forms though. Thermal deg, tyre wear. And even then it's possible to have variations.  If you go back to 2011, the tyres degradated no matter what, hence why circuits like Monaco produced multiple pit stops. Over the years, the tyre wear and thermal deg properties of the tyres have changed massively. Even the current tyres are vastly different to the ones we had in 2018, and in 2017 we had very durable, hard tyres.  It's possible to have high quality tyres that have a bit of tyre wear. The difficulty is producing that with the facilities and testing available.
How would you improve the tires if durability wasn‘t an option?
Great arguments like these always give me a confidence boost because it tells me you weren't able to come up with any counter-arguments. So you have nothing substantial to show that a different manufacturer is definitely going to make a much, much better tyre as you claim?  If you clearly don't want to have a discussion, why participate in one?
Grip
To argue against such load of rubbish was never my intention. You won, hope you feel now even more confident accepting my defeat.
Can you explain why it is rubbish so that I can learn from it and revise my opinion?

> This would be including flight tickets, accommodation, transportation, and of course race tickets.      Flight tickets from where? I mean, help us help you.
Attending a Formula One race is very expensive. Not only because of the tickets but everything you would like inside the event is also quite expensive. It’s not like attending a baseball, basketball or football game where you can spend a few hundred dollars, some beers and have a great day.   Depending where you’re from and if there’s a race on your country, the costs can skyrocket quite quickly. Then finding a place to stay can be tricky due to price increases due to the event, even if you go for a less expensive option. That’s not even including things like transportation, food and drinks.   The price of the tickets is generally high, more than a couple hundred dollars on average. If it’s worth something, the tickets normally include access for the three days. General Admission tickets, which are the least expensive ones, are the ones sold out first. Of course, the better the seats you want, the more expensive they will get. You would need to check, but it’s pretty expensive overall.   Inside the events things are also pretty expensive and chaotic, from overpriced merchandise to unreasonably expensive water bottles and hamburgers. Also some races have “Cashless”, which means you have to queue yourself for hours just to buy food.   In my opinion and as a recommendation, I would not take your friend to a race unless you can genuinely afford. It’s really hard to give you a rough estimate because a lot of things depend on how much money you can throw at it, but it can easily rack up to thousands of dollars.
As far as I know the cheapest tickets available are in Hungary (21-23 July). However, don’t expect them too be much lower than 180 euros a ticket (if it isn’t sold out yet). Not even to mention flight (depending where you’re from), your stay, food drinks etc. It’ll be 500 per person easy. In that case you’re probably on a tight budget.
My closest race is Las Vegas, GA tickets are US $2,000 and hotels in the strip as asking $800+ a night. Plus expenses, I calculated USD $8,000 for 2 guys to go wich is nuts so im buying a racing sim instead and watching on F1TV.
We literally have no information to tell you anything. Like with attending any event, you need to calculate the cost of traveling to the event, tickets, accommodation, and the food and transportation cost while you're there.
I'm planning to take my mum to one of the European races next year and have budgeted £3k minimum for what we'd consider a 'comfortable' trip ie good tickets, good flights, nice hotel and easy transport (she's less mobile).
It’s kind of sad that F1 has really become a “If you have too ask you can’t afford it” sport.
You are such a great friend! Looks like Silverstone (which is the UK home race) still have some tickets available on the race day on July 9, 2023. You guys can take the train from Kings Cross to the circuit early morning, watch the race, and take the train back to London. Alternatively, you can take the train from any London station to Oxford/Bicester area and take a cab to the circuit. This way, you guys don't have to spend tons of money on accommodation and enjoy the train ride together (and maybe eat cake on the train)!
Hey OP   Instead of going to a race why not make an event out of a race at home ?   Get your friends favorite foods and drinks, place "bets" on what you think will happen (how many red flags, who wins, who has most overtakes)- maybe the cherry on top could be some merch from your friends favorite team.  I think it's very sweet that you want to be there for your buddy- they're very lucky to have a friend like you.
If your flying to the event and you get the 3 day pass I've found it's hard to do it for under $3000k/person (I'm Canadian).  I'm going to Austin this year and it's $1200 for weekend pass, $700 for flights, Hotel is $500, and that leaves $800 for any spending (food, activities, transportation, anything at the Circut).
Do you have a spare kidney for sale?
If I were you, I'd forget F1 at least for this year. Most tickets will be sold at most races now, within a distance you can afford I am guessing anyway.  20 years ago Spa was the cheapest race to attend in Europe, but I've no idea what it's like now. You are still talking many hundreds just for tickets though.   Have a look at [Goodwood Festival of Speed](https://www.goodwood.com/motorsport/festival-of-speed/) instead. It's not too far away from you, F1 people often attend, you get to see all sorts of cars going fast and it's meant to be an amazing party. I'd be so happy if someone took me there, honestly.
Where are you from?
Do some research. Hotel, tix package, food, drink, airfare, swag, drugs, etc.
My wife and I went to COTA last year. I bet it ended up costing at least $3000 and we stayed with a friend instead of a hotel. Everything from flight to car to food was way more than normal. It was a great time and I’m glad we did it, but I’d have a hard time justifying the cost of doing it again.
Belgium is the best place if you live near here. Most of their stands , those starting price or cheaper stands also are at good positions. I would really  recommend Spa. Back in 2018, I used young person entry or something like that for people below 25years, costed me around 250€ , stand was at Stavelot (turn 16). Not sure how costs at Spa are these days. I was living near Lille, France at that time, so I just drove to circuit.
Depends on where you are. Some locations have cheaper tickets than others, but you obviously have to factor in travel and accommodations. An easy way to get the "experience" is to buy significantly cheaper tickets to the Friday practice sessions. You can probably get a day-pass for $50 (again, depending on location). It's not the race, and it's not qualifying, but you'll still get to see the cars whiz by and hear the engines roar.
As an alternative, many tracks do trackdays where you can ride around in cars on the track. Much cheaper, and the UK has many tracks that do it.
You need about  €3k minimum.  European races are mostly sold out already with only paddock club or VIP tickets remaining, or resale websites going higher than face value (plus the risk of a resale website).  The cheap Flights on race weekends are gone and will all be 500-1000 Euro.  Cheapest option with tickets available would be Baku, but flight will be 1k.  Hotels are all super overpriced already.  It won’t take you long to realize this yourself: shop online for tickets first, flights second, hotels third.  Your other option would be to plan a road trip to Spa, with camping and general admission.  GA tickets seem to be sold out for now but it’s possible you could get resales from individuals closer to the date, or maybe more GA will become available.  That would be a fantastic experience to have with a buddy.  Good luck!
So I've only been once to monaco. It was a 3 day trip for us (2), saturday and sunday with grand stand tickets and staying at a nice hotel in nice. Total was ca. 3500 USD.  Most important is just that you buy the tickets from F1 and not a reseller.
Maybe try Silverstone GP (6-9 July), if it isn't already sold out.  It would save you flight money.   Unless you want it just for his birth month, I think this could be your cheapest option.   If everything fails, gift him an F1TV subscription (if not already owned) or throw a special race screening.
$3,476AUD
 Brands Hatch in Kent is a fine circuit with loads of good racing. The BTCC has a couple of rounds there and it is amazing racing action. The circuit also now runs a shuttle service from Swanley train station to the track and back for £5 each way (I think). Book online and save a few quid too.  A great circuit to spectate at with loads of good viewing areas without having to fork out on grandstand seats too. BTCC is one of the big events, and still a whole heap cheaper than F1. I am a big F1 fan, but have never been to a race and have no desire to due to the costs and crowds. Much prefer watching it on tv.   Another amazing race event... and it sounds weird until you have actually seen it, is the truck racing. Big noisy trucks with 1000hp race tunes engines that get up to approx 90mph along the start/finish straight and then into paddock bend three abreast... It is awesome.
Man, the experience would be great, but I don't think only seeing maybe 2 turns of a racetrack is worth it compared to seeing everything on TV. It is better to spend a bunch of money on good food and drinks and have a streaming party.
It would be pretty expensive unless you genuinely have a healthy savings, you sound like a great friend though so I really respect that!
£1,000 apiece to do it right imho
I go once a year and the weekend is minimum $3k, more like $5k all told in the US. Depends on the race though and if you’re down to really shoestring it.
If your friend likes racing in general and you guys are in the US, might I suggest Indycar?  Paddock passes are cheap as dirt and the drivers very friendly to interact with fans.
Cross Canada trip for Montreal is looking like $5500 for flight / tickets / 1 week hotel
I'd say get him a piece of Ferrari merch and watch a race with him. I assume he already has some way to watch races, but that's pretty cheap to get if not. Listen to him talk and ask questions. Getting to share his interest can mean a lot. You might find that you really enjoy it too. I started watching because a friend had it on when I went to his house. Now he's moved away, and texting about F1 is a lot of how we stay connected. I greatly recommend it. Depending on where you live, there might be cheaper (non-F1) races that you could see. Or, possibly going to an F1 event for just one day that wasn't the main race day wouldn't be too pricy.
IndyCar…. Same mamma, different daddy, waaaaay cheaper
You could potentially find a cheaper race, and make it affordable.  Example, last year zandvoort tickets were 700+ for a Sunday ticket. But when Abu Dhabi came around VIP weekend tickets were something like 450.  I love in NL and the train would have added another 50-60 to and from , but flying now seems like a much more reasonable event because the cost can be spread out, plus the wife and I can also stay a little longer and make it a holiday
I paid about $350 for two general admission tix to Monza ‘23. Transportation and accommodations would be whatever you choose.
You could also just drive to Le Mans in June for the 24hr race. It’s a blast, and there’s camping available.
I sometimes go to Monaco, I fly to Nice, can usually pickup cheap flights to there or any other major city on that coastline such as Marseille. Then find a reasonable priced air bnb or cheap hotel near Nice airport. What I don’t do is pay for race tickets, I’ll just go on day trips on the train to Monaco (train system is great) and soak up all the atmosphere, maybe pay in to see practice or qualifying if tix are cheap enough. You can also walk the racetrack after practice, qualy and the race, plenty of bars like the famous rascasse open to the public, look at all the yachts etc. qualy tix are just as good as the race to me, you see cars go past in the same way as the race so it’s not much different, it’s all about the weekend atmosphere. Usually fly home race day as it’s better to watch the race on the tv 😂
How about a BTCC race at Brands Hatch, weekend of 6th and 7th May? Its fairly close to you and a lot cheaper and accessible than F1  Or theres a couple of WEC races, Le Mans or Monza, that could be options too? Le Mans especially will be an experience of itself
You could also consider going on a Friday and watch FPs plus the extra shows around it. We did that last year (in Zandvoort) and it was great to see (and hear!) the cars go by and experience it all. It was also affordable, and we watched the qualification and the race as usual, from home, but it was still extra special, because we got to see where we were just the day before.
A friend of mine went to Imola, If I remember correctly he bought the cheapest ticket and was 90€ to stand on the garden on the hill of the Rivazza.   It was last year.
What about Silverstone? Since you are based in London you could go and be back within the same day, saving on flights and accommodation.
I found general admission tickets for imola this year in 100 quid. Probs try to to get them as flights will increase over time.
An option might be to take him to qualifying on Saturday in Zandvoort.  Price for two single day tickets : EUR 140 Two round trip flight tickets: EUR 200  Price for two nights in a hostel for 1 people: EUR 140  Transport to the venue for two: EUR 30.  Total price ~EUR 510.  This excuses food and drink of course.  It's not a full race weekend, but Saturdays at Zandvoort are lots of fun.  You might be able to significantly save on flight tickets by taking the ferry from Harwich, gong by train from London to Amsterdam or booking a flight early and get a good deal.
Hey mate, may be a middle ground but my first experience of F1 was not a race but instead a Saturday ticket for Monza. While I don’t recommend Monza for your first rodeo (organisation of the event is SHOCKINGLY BAD), I still enjoyed all the sessions to have on a Saturday. I would suggest, if your budget is ~£500 for the both of yous, staying on home turf and copping two Silverstone Saturday GA tickets, get yourselves some lawn chairs and enjoying all the Saturday has to offer, from F3 and F2 to FP3 and quali, taking the coach from London to Silverstone.  Saturday Silverstone - £209 x 2 = £418 Return coach from London - £40 x 2 = £80  Might go a little bit over budget but this is the best solution in my opinion :)
Take him to the Formula One Arcade in London on a race day, play some Sim Racing together, bring some friends, have some drinks and food. He will still appreciate that a lot, I would.
You’re probably too late with tickets for this year, but Hungary is one of the (if not the) cheapest GP in Europe, and travel isn’t too expensive (although probably a lot more than what you’re willing to pay at this age). If I remember correctly, general admission was €99 per ticket for this year. My bf and I are flying to Vienna, which is about a 2/3 hour drive to Budapest. We do have grandstands, but with travel and accommodation, I think I probably paid about £800 for the two of us
Around 500€ depends on which race
I don't know if it has already been suggested, but you could look into historic Grand Prix: I'm going to attend one this weekend in France, it cost me 30€ for a 3-day ticket which includes multiple races of 80's to 2000's F1, F3 and endurance racing, plus access to the back of the paddock where the F1s and others are parked between races for people to look at.  Travel will depend a lot on where you're going, but maybe there's a similar event in Britain, as it is mandatory for teams that operate old F1 cars to participate in a minimum number of events every year. Housing will also likely be cheaper than during a normal F1 event simply because there's less people. Overall though, much cheaper than an F1 weekend in every way and a much better sound ;)
Inside Europe you would need at least 500e per person and going super cheap, a normal trip would be 1k per person.  Get some merch and watch it online.
Have you considered the Hungarian GP? It's one of the cheapest in terms of ticket prices. Accommodation, food and drink are also really cheap in Budapest and it's a great city to visit generally. You should have plenty of options for flights from London to Budapest.
Probably be cheaper to go overseas to a race, but Silverstone GA is about £350 a head for the weekend. Sunday only pass isn't much cheaper. Accommodation will easily double that even for the most basic setup camping somewhere - if one of you has a license, though, hiring a campervan could be a good move (just find somewhere a few miles from the track that you can camp at).  I've not been to F1 yet, but I did MotoGP a few years back, split between 3 people including tickets, accommodation, we spent about £300 each all in. We managed to find an AirBNB which was owned by someone who works with F1, and the race weekend coincided with an F1 race overseas (seems to be quite common). Place had 3 bedrooms and a swimming pool, and cost us I think £450.  The cheapest way is probably going to be to buy GA tickets for somewhere like Hungary, and find a cheap flight to Budapest and some dodgy hotel. You'll likely struggle at this short notice though, as most GPs for this year are sold out.
It can be done for a lot less than everyone is saying. 200€/ person should be doable.   First, you have to pick a race that happens when there's not a lot of tourism in the region. For example, monza, 1-3 September, high season for tourism in that area, so it's a no go.   For example, to attend this year's Spanish gp, plane tickets would run me 48€ round trip.   Race tickets start at 80€.  Then all you have to do is figure out how to get to the track. Public transportation, Uber, etc. Let's say, 30€ for transportation.   You don't even need to stay at an hotel for the weekend, you can just go Sunday.
You could get tickets to a watch party at the F1 Arcade in St Paul's. They have a ticket for £99 that includes unlimited beer etc, and then get some merch too to wear? Or Goodwood Festival of Speed tickets, a lot of the drivers end up going and doing demos in new and old cars
I’m doing Singapore from the US. Flights, tickets, hotel for 5 nights is just under $40k USD.
Try going to Goodwood in the summer!  I hear its more enjoyable from a fan perspective than an F1 race.
maybe try getting drivers cards for him -- shouldn't be too difficult especially because you're in London, and a lot of the teams are based in the UK. I think that would be a thoughtful gift which is well within budget (and shows a lot of time/effort.)
You could look at aftermarket partial weekend tickets. For someone who hasn’t been, seeing practice and quali can still be quite exciting.
I went to the 2018 Austria race, general admission tickets (so you set up shop in the grass) with amazing view. We bought the tickets one month before the race (we didn’t even know the race would be around our holiday) and paid €85,- each. Then just bring your own food and drinks, they don’t mind. Some people brought entire picnic tables and tablecloth, coolers stuffed with drinks and sandwiches.   I don’t know what these tickets would cost today but certainly less than Silverstone/Spa/Zandvoort
GA at Silverstone was like £150 for all 3 days the year I went, and you can camp out there for pretty cheap. I think I stayed at a nearby camping site for under £100 for all 3 nights, and rented camping gear online for about £100 too.
Take your friend camping at Brands Hatch for the Masters Historic Festival at the end of May.
It is expensive as hell  if you talk flying to a gp, you'd be happy to get away with 1.5k. Why not take him to brands or silverstone for a GT race. They are fun to watch and cheap as fuck.
How much would it cost to be your friend?
Use the money to arrange an epic F1 race night at home.
I get you are from the UK it’s a shame WEC doesn’t attend Silverstone as it give a lot for your money. But they also have races in spa and Monza. Monza is great to see these cars. Although the 24h Le Mans is among the best races you could attend and still cheaper than most F1 races. Or well maybe not. Monza I see tickets to Spa are 50€ now so they have gotten more expensive but still 6h of racing and walking along the circuit. Take your hiking boots!
London lol sorry I definitely should have included that
Yeah sounds like too much if I’m honest I’m probably gonna have to reconsider
It depends on what he wants to do.   He lives in London so Silverstone would be by far the cheapest option. I also live in London and we did a day trip to silverstone for the race only. It was £1200 for 3 people for tickets and the train and bus there. So £400 each plus add food and drinks. Food and drinks were not anymore expensive than what you would see at other festivals.   So it was about £450-500 each for the race only and no overnight accommodation.
Australia just gone was very reasonable for me it was like 275 AUD for a 4 day GA ticket.  Accommodation about 30 minutes away cost about 150 AUD a night nothing fancy but was perfectly fine I even bought some Grandstand tickets once the came on resale for 100 odd dollars a ticket.
A different idea: throw a small party for a race. Invite some other friends of his to the party. Make or order food from the host country. Download and print out the “race bingo “ cards that people make to have some silly and fun things to watch for. Maybe buy him a Ferrari F1 T shirt and decorate the room with Ferrari logos. It’s more work but for a vastly smaller amount of money you can do something very memorable that will be a lot of fun and he will deeply appreciate.
Yeah thank for you for the response. €500 per person is honestly way too much i was thinking max €500 in total. I’m probably going to have to reconsider
That’s insane. GA in Australia is, like, $60AUD
800a night? Cheapest we saw were 5500 for a three night minimum!
Cota weekend in Austin is pretty decent and the bands on Friday and Saturday are usually pretty big. Last year my wife and I got to see green day and strike them off our bucket list and watched F1 at the same time. I have no desire to go to Miami or Vegas.
I read an article in a local Las Vegas paper that they are going to have 30k ga tickets starting at $500, with zero view of the track
I tried 3 different times to get standing room only. I was even using the presale and standing in the virtual lobby for hours before the sale went live. They weren’t even available to purchase lol.
3 day GA pass to Cota this year is $475 atm. Not cheap but not Miami/Vegas pricing. And you get to watch 3 shows if you weekend it, additionally the beauty about a race track setup is that you can move freely around most of the track, street races are more difficult to get around
I was looking for rough estimates or approximations from previous experiences which is mostly what I got. Unfortunately it seems like too much lol
Hopefully you guys have a great time!
F1 has always been a rich person’s sport as far as I can remember to be honest. In fact, right now the sport is probably the “most popular” as it ever was with F1 effectively trying to reach out to less rich audiences and being generally more accessible. Before that, they actually made sure their public was the elites. It was one of the issues that made F1 drop in popularity and viewership and then be sold to the Liberty Media, which made the changes to popularize it again.      That said, the dna is still there, it’s the elite of motorsport and there is only so many races and tracks a year they can race at, and with the popularity, demand increases prices so in the end, watching races in person has become impossible again for someone that doesn’t have a lot of money to spend on a hobby like this.
Honestly, my 10 dollar a month F1TV sub is just fine and I guarantee you gets a better view
Yes this is what I’ve done in the past. Do a day trip from London to silverstone for the race only. It worked out like £400 each for the ticket and transport. This was in 2021. This was for grandstands, general admission was cheaper. But it was for some of the cheaper grandstands. Hamilton straight which is popular was only like £150 more.
Where are you seeing tickets? Unless you’re okay paying £200 to see qualifying, they all look sold out when I’ve looked just now.
A lot people very reasonably raised this suggestion. If all else fails it would definitely make a memorable evening.  He and I have been there a lot for each other over the past few years, and I’d like to think this friendship means a lot to both of us :)
This is a very very good option. If you want to go above and beyond you could rent a screen and projector and do it in a yard, get it catered with his favourite food, get an F1 style cake prepared. So many great options that would still be WAY less expensive than going.
You buying?
London
Yeah honestly if I had a few hundred more I would but with my current budget it sounds like it’ll be a lot of penny pinching and cutting corners which would just put a damper on the whole experience. I’m leaning more towards merch or other less expensive F1 related gifts
Wow ok thank you so much the Friday tickets for silverstone (the race in the UK) are much more affordable, and most of the transport and accommodation costs are cut because it’s close to london. I think this is actually what I’m going to do.
Definitely go to Brands Hatch instead of a GP. Recommend the BTCC, American Speed Fest, trucks, CSCC, hell you could go to all of that for cheaper than one Grand Prix.
Unfortunately in the UK
For accom and flights to nice I probably paid £400 for 3 nights but I was sharing an Airbnb with 6 friends and I booked flights early. Q1 tix we’re free from someone who left early… just lucky. For an f1 fan just walking on the Monaco track would be exciting.
Yeah that’s what I’m thinking as well
3 years of emotional support🤪
Why not try formula E then? I know the atmosphere is not the same and the soundtrack may not be to your liking, but racing action is basically guaranteed, and it’s super cheap. My gf and I went to Monaco last year and every single grandstand was 30€  Also London is a double header this year so you can choose between 2 days
If he likes racing in general try a motoGP race. Tickets for COTA were like $45 compared to $500 for F1.
Check my updated comment. :)
Where do you live? Some races are more accessible than others.
There’s no way you get two (or more) tickets for that amount of money.
F1 is a rich man's sport.
Mate, you are out of luck in terms of F1 in person on that budget.
Yeah and I suppose I’m really on the low end with my estimation. I expect it to be a lot higher if you actually want to have a proper good time haha. You could consider (again: depending on your location) on gifting something like a year of F1TV or some Ferarri Merch.
If the budget is that tight, consider buying him some sort of track experience or auto cross in a supercar. I think you could get it for both of you for less than 500.
I spent double that to go to the Belgium GP 15 years ago.
lol
If you’re in Europe maybe try the NASCAR Euro Series.  It should be below your budget.
Spa is possible, but it’d be hostel/camping then sitting on the grass, I expect.
500 euros in total for two people is just not going to happen.  Silverstone is your cheapest option from London. I also live in London and When I went recently it was £1200 for 3 people for the tickets and train and bus to the track. So it was £400 each. Add some more for food and drinks there. So I would say £500 minimum each.   This is only for the race day and assumes you’re doing a day trip from London so no accommodation.
The Zandvoort general admission tickets for sunday are listed on a website as 170 euro each, the second you want to sit in even the cheapest grandstand you're already past your budget.
A ticket in the states is 500+. Just one, ticket.
That is impossible.
GA was like 275 Aud for 4 days for Australian GP and Kids are free with an Adult GA ticket
I think I got an email about how they were offering me a "special rate" at the Linq for that weekend of $3400 for three nights.  Fully non-refundable, of course.
I thinks best bet is try to get a reservation at a spot with a good view that is outside the track. And just pay for hotel parking and stay at a cheaper hotel outside the strip. Reservation prob gonna ask for like 3k in (mincon) but at least you get to eat and drink those 3000.
I'm in London as well, and to be honest, you'd be hard-pushed to do a Grand Prix alone for £500, once you take into account travel to Northamptonshire, tickets, accommodation and incidental spending. I've bought tickets to the Formula E in London, seats on the starting grid in line with the start/finish line, and spent less than £50. It's not F1, but it's racing so it'll be pretty good.
F1 travels all over the world so the expenses are gonna be wildly different based on where the race is and where you live.
I agree. USGP tickets that cost me $100 20 years ago would likely be triple that or more now.
I agree in spirit, but nothing replaces seeing it in person.
Plus rewind and slo-mo! My fridge is 10 feet away full of beer that would only buy you a pint at the track.
If only you could get it for £10 a month here. At minimum you gotta spend like 195 a year and that's with a discount.
This is what I would suggest, too.  Get some Ferrari mercy for him to open, and have a race day at home. Grand Prix bingo is fun - have a card of possible things to come up, such as Max doesn't win, Max argues with pit wall, a team double DNF, x number of safety cars etc. Winner gets a prize.   Get in drinks, his favourite snacks, if either of you/ your families have Sky Glass or whatever, set up the multi-screen options and settle in for the whole day.   Friendship is about the thought and the effort and it sounds like you have that in spades. Good luck.
If a GP is too expensive, you might consider going to the Festival of Speed, it is very good.
I not familiar with the silverstone race but in Canada, Thursday is free (with pit access) and driver signing sessions plus other fan activities. There’s also less fans so you get to explore the fan zones easily. If your friend is a big fan, Thursday or Friday sessions would already be an awesome gift!!
Count me in
If someone got me tickets to FE rather than F1 I'd be very dissapointed
I second that, London had good races in past. Would be probably one of the most budget friendly options.  Monaco E-Prix this year is also for 30 EUR (managed to get T1 seat for this price, such a steal). I know FE is not F1, but it's such an iconic track with so much history...
I’m not 100% convinced by MotoGP if I’m honest. From what I’ve gathered from talking to him over the years he’s more interested in stuff like the drivers and race politics than the races themselves.
London
I mean it depends on what you consider good enough. 2  GA/Prato tickets cost 250 euros total at Imola. Then you get 60 a night in a hotel near Imola, and if you budget food and drinks you can keep the budget closer to 500.
-To attend live? Kind off in a way, yeah.      -To watch on tv/streaming? Not so much. Sadly not for free anymore but also not stupid expensive. Depends on the country of course but more or less on average if you are a fan, seems quite doable in general.      -To buy team's merch and stuff? Millionaires Club.
Ferrari Merch is a good idea. I definitely want to get him something F1 related to compensate for it
Yeah this is something I’m definitely going to look into
Or MotoGP.
I got an email offering 14k package for three night stay + tickets included for two, in the grandstand at Wynn. Insane!
This seems like the best idea. I'd do some scouting, find out where you can see the track from a hotel area.  Vegas is going to be nuts.
Ill probably wait a few years and try and go. hopefully the hype dies a little bit. Luckily my parents live 70 miles from vegas so i can always be close by
Mmmmm I dunno. Like, what do you really get to see? A small portion of the track and the car speeding by for half a second? I just can't see how it's worth it.
If someone got me tickets to any race at all, I'd be happy to be able to go to a race as a gift. Even if it would have been a series I never heard of before.
Grandma gift: "you like that Formula racing right?!
FE races are actually quite fun to attend.
I've attended both F1 and FE races. Had a much more exciting time at the FE one.
Another vote for formula E. Yes, it's not quite the same but it offers plenty of racing action and like others said - it's really cheap compared to F1. I've been to the Berlin event and had a great time.
Yes! We’re off to FE. Thirty euros for the ticket, thirty quid for a wizzair flight to Nice, easy peasy. F1 I will be watching on the TV and listening to from my garden because I can’t afford to pay Silverstone prices.
Is your friend interested in endurance races?  WEC will have 6h of Monza (Milan) on 9th of July. Tickets for race are from 40 euro, for weekend for 45.   There are a lot of ex F1 drivers, Ferrari has its own factory team with Giovinazzi. Top class has very interesting teams this year: Toyota, Ferrari, Cadillac, Peugeot, Porsche and couple small manufacturers. They sound amazing.  WEC is always less crowded (except le man's), you can walk everywhere and paddock seems to be more open to fans.  Flights to Milan/Bergamo should not be very expensive.
Something like Goodwood Festival of Speed or Goodwood Revival could be good then? More a focus on the cars themselves rather than any race action.   London Concours and Saville Row Concours are also both coming up in London and focus on showcasing interesting cars.
gift him a Netflix sub then he can watch DtS
London e Prix still on the calendar?
You could try Goodwood Festival of Speed instead.
Then silverstone is probably your best bet. I think it is on the cheaper side for F1 at least, tickets at around 280. Plus you don't need a flight
If you are travelling from the UK, Spain would most likely be the cheapest option when you consider travelling costs.   General admission tickets for Friday – Sunday are £173.75 and increase to £535.83 for seats in Grandstand F which is at the first corner.   The advantage of the European GPs is that there are many options to camp around the tracks. If you want to be frugal and don't mind some adventure, you can plan it like a cool camping trip set around the race. I read your budget is around £500; that would be tough if you include tickets. Perhaps you can save for a year or two and plan for a future GP. I have booked airbnbs in Downtown Austin for $50/night by doing it as soon as the race dates were released. I'm sure you can find something similar in Spain or Belgium.  Hope that helps a bit. Good luck!
Try the Silverstone classic, they usually have F1 Masters on, which is a race with retro F1 cars. It's loud! And will be affordable.
Might be doable around 500 if you already live close to San Marino, if not, transportation could be a big extra chunk.     Unfortunately OP never replied where they are from, so they could be looking to fly from Alaska, the very lower tip of Argentina or South Africa. Honestly pointless without that crucial bit of information but it seems they've been discouraged by the ticket prices alone, which is completely understandable tbh.      Attending F1 live is expensive AF whichever way you look at it.
It really is quite country dependant. In my country (Austria) all of F1 is publicly available on TV and online livestream. Like all of it. Free practices, qualifying, race and even F2 and F3. Guess thats because the channel is owned by red bull so all sports where red bull is part of can be watched there.
> but also not stupid expensive.   In germany you need a sky subscription for 28€ per month to view F1 with ads...
Depending on where you sit you can see quite a bit.  At the USGP in Indy I sat in oval turn 4 and could see the entire front straight, pit exit, and the first seven turns.  Many tracks have stands that let you see multiple parts of the track and allow you to walk around to different parts of the track.  Street courses are obviously the worst case scenario for viewing.  That said the experience is worth it at least once.  Even a Friday is great to just walk around and check out different corner.  Get as close to the track as you can to get a real sense of the speed, the feeling and smells.  Get a good high view to really appreciate how well these cars accelerate, brake and change direction.  That was what really hooked me.  I stood by the fence at the end of the front straight as they screamed by at 200mph turning close to 20,000RPM, then brake for turn 1 at just before the 50 meter board and change direction in a way I didn’t thing was possible.  I doubt I’ll be able to afford going to another GP again,  but you can bet I’ll do it if I get the chance.
You get to go home with part of a HAAS rim, a badass scar and an awesome story to tell.
We got GA to Tickets for melb for five is us it was $110 TOTAL (2 adults and 3 kids). We walked around the track, and found really amazing spots to see the cars from. Our grandstand tickets on Sunday were also good. You truly have no idea of the power of these cars and their actual speed just from seeing it on TV. Nothing beats having one just metres in front of you.  Edit: general admission tickets were for Friday practice. In Australia, each GA ticket gives four free children's tickets.
I'm a Tifosa, my first presential grand prix was France 2022, I was sat in an Alpine grandstand AND I got to see Charles' crash + his mangled car + him passing in front of us on the back of a marshall's scooter. Also almost died from being crushed during the fan forum when Gasly came in. After all of this, still had the time of my life and I can't wait to go again when money shows up!
montreal grandstand 11 is directly facing the grid, we could see any individual car for ~ 10 seconds as they took the final chicane at the wall of champions, so a near top speed run towards us, followed by a couple corners. after about the 20th lap they were so evenly spaced on the track there was never not a car in sight. directly in front of us across the track was a large screen playing the TV broadcast, so we caught anything that happened anywhere else too and had standings. Yuki binned it off the end of the pit lane into the barrier directly in front of us. it was worth it.
I would feel bad for someone spending money on something to make me happy that actually doesn't make me happy
Can you expand on this? I would have never imagined that to be the case, but it would open up opportunities for me! I've always wanted to take my partner to a race event, so I am very curious what swayed you the other way! Also, if you don't mind, could you say what races the F1/FE races were held at? Or at least the countries?  Thanks!
Don’t forget your ear plugs 🙄
Silverstone has been notably one of the most expensive f1 races at least in Europe with ticket prices.
Aside from race day tickets but being sold out already
Idk why but you saying "living close to San Marino" and not "in Italy" which is the only place that is close to San Marino made me chuckle. Anyway yeah fair point but I wasn't counting air/train travel as that was a given and indipendent from F1
How’s the commentary on them? Does Austria have access to F1TVpro on top of the free to air transmission?
Damn. No, yeah that must be infuriating.
The closest race to me will be Vegas. I can guarantee you the cost of a ticket alone will be much higher than $110.
Then you and u/geeler olympically missed the point of giving/receiving a gift, dude.  I knew redditors were kinda dense and entitled but this takes the prize, lol.
Hahaha holy shit. Life's not gonna go well for you I can already tell.
Formula E is an electric open wheel racing series. One of the reasons that make it so much fun is that the cars are very similar to each other (but not completely similar like spec races) so the cars tend to stay close to each other throughout the race, which results in exciting racing. In F1, the high performing cars will peel off after a few laps and you get big gaps between cars. FE is also quite unpredictable. In F1 these days, you pretty much know who is going to win (barring unforeseen accidents). Not so much in FE.  All the past races are available on YouTube, so watch one (and the qualifying session too if you can) to get a feel for the series. The last race in Sao Paulo was excellent.  >  Also, if you don't mind, could you say what races the F1/FE races were held at?  I attended the Saudi Arabian legs of both series. So the Jeddah Grandprix and the Dirriyah ePrix.
Heh, fair enough - electric cars do sound boring compared to F1. But if high cost of Formula One means the OP could choose between going to an E-prix or not going at all...
Commentary is in german and pretty solid imo. Until this season they had Hülkenberg as expert on the commentators team.  Don't know if f1tv broadcast has this aswell, but the commentators can phone directly to the pitwall and talk to some of the team principals live
Sorry I meant just the cost of the entry tickets. We took our own food but did buy some additional while we were there. The public transport to get to the track and back was partially free. We drove to Melbourne from where we live and stayed with family.  It sucks that it's so unreasonably expensive in the states.
Ive been to Berlin 3x and Monaco and Paris races of FE. Great racing and there is much to do also as a spectator apart from the races.
Keep saving. It’s worth the wait
Yeah, skyF1 does the same. They are one of two English comms options on F1tv.
Try going to one. It’s quite fun. I go to F1 races too and while that’s great FE delivers more.  But for better price/quality do WEC races. 6h of Spa for 35€ is à steal. And general access so you can sit where you want. I looked up my seat where I also sat with an F1 race and the price difference was staggering.
The **Statistics** flair is reserved for posts highlighting interesting statistics. As a rule of thumb, Statistics posts need to inform readers through visualizations and insights that cannot be obtained from raw data alone. For example, a post containing a qualifying gap between two drivers expressed in tenths of a second is an easily obtainable raw piece of data and constitutes a bad Statistics post. A visualization of what that translates to on-track, or visualization of how that gap came to be would constitute a good Statistics post.  *[Read the rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/userguide).

Gasly over Stroll is highly debatable lol.
How could Alonso move down one if Verstappen hasn't changed position?
So what is this actually meant to measure?
Alright how is gasly 6th when:  Qualified Last in Bahrain and recovered to P9 in a very quick car  Decent weekend but behind ocon in quali and race in Jeddah  Crashed him and his teammate out in Australia  This doesn't make much sense..
Why is Gasly on this list?
I'm going to downvote every one of these rankings this season. Aramco doesn't need more exposure and the rankings are as per usual complete shit. Matt and Tommy P1 have actual realistic rankings that make sense
Man, the Fernando/Lance situation would be interesting if it's ever noticable. I'm sure if there ever is any rivalry it will all be behind closed doors but hoo-wee! That could get spicy.
Perez over both Mercs is a joke
Had it been a sc finish the rankings would be very very different
Where is Sainz?
What is a power rankings?
I agree, I am really not sure why Gasly is there at all honestly.   In Bahrain, his quali was diastastrous. Sure, he recovered to P9 which was a good run, but as a whole, a semi decent at best weekend.  Jeddah, completely average weekend... and he was also outperformed by his teammate.  Australia, good weekend until he made a huge error that disqualified both him and his teammate. Hard to really rate this as anything other than an F.   This is not a top 6 worthy performance in my opinion, so far.
With the car he's driving, he was about to finish ahead of Lance on pace. The crash is the reason he's not way higher.
Stroll has looked slower than his teammate literally the entire season
He had to leave the space
They shared the first place
We're they tied before?
>How could Alonso move down one if Verstappen hasn't changed position?  5 second stop go penalty applied just after Aramco did the scores.
Power. Idk, maybe horse power? I know 9hp is not a lot when it comes to engines, but a dude with the power of 9 horses sounds pretty impressive.
Nothing.  It's content made by some jabroni meant to get clicks and be slightly controversial to get people arguing in comments. And where Aramco gets to slap their name on for buying the souls of Liberty and Stefano. This endless need to make more content all the time is getting exhausting from F1.  If only we had some sort of ranking of where the drivers are based on the results of the race in the formula they compete in real life, if only!
Pretty good weekend up until the crash though, running and holding so far up the grid
Because it makes you talk about it. These scores are all completely meaningless and made up. But you’re talking about it, so it’s working.
Because he had a good race in Bahrain and was doing really well in Australia until the final 2 laps. How would you rate his 3 races so far?
Why?
I know, right? I know that three races is really too early to tell, but so far the gap in their performances is really starting to illustrate that Aston’s problems the last couple seasons weren’t just the car. Stroll isn’t a bad driver, but I’ve never believed he could be top tier.
He had a fantastic race in Jeddah and was alright in the other 2. This is a season average, not just for the Aus GP.
I mean this past weekend was his best for the season. The first two races, he was nowhere so it makes sense that he’s not on the leaderboard yet
“No Aramco. No. You have to get them to change it. Please!”
Where he belongs
Ignored as always
it’s a board of the leaders?
Meanwhile Stroll finished 6th in Bahrain while barely being able to hold onto the wheel in turn 1 lol. The paydriver hate is really something else.
It definitely didn't look like that. In the last laps he was losing almost 1s per lap to Stroll. Stroll was very likely getting him in the last laps.
His teammate is *literally* Fernando Alonso and the entire season is *literally* all of three races old.
Yes, and he is behind Alonso. The gap although has come down quite a bit since Bahrain. They were the closest teammates on the grid in Australia.
Yes, because his teammate is Fernando fucking Alonso.
[removed]
Ah, makes sense
Their power on Rise of Kingdoms
holy fuck what a sigma of a man. its like were back in the roman coliseum battle days
Preach brother. Sometimes I wish F1 didn't get that DTS/COVID boost of popularity, which seemed to cause this. All this "content" being posted here and upvoted is baffling. Like this post, it has 0 actual content, just arbitrary numbers next to names. What's the point?
Does that really matter if you crash into your teammate and cost the teams all their points
Because there is a huge difference in performance between the teammates. However, the teammate who's falling behind is the son of the team owner who has been very open about the fact that giving his son a seat has been one of the driving forces (heh...pun) behind him buying an F1 team.
What are you on about? Is this another ''oh look at Stroll's points'' when he had a mechanical DNF in Saudi-Arabia. He has been closing the gap since Bahrain which was anyways due to him missing pre-season testing and recovering from injuries. Stroll and Alonso were the [closest matched](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/129oxmn/australian_gp_race_pace_teammate_race_pace_gaps/) teammates in Australia race pace for example.
Yeah, he isn't a "doesn't deserve a seat" driver like Mazepin (and others depending on opinion) but if he doesn't step it up a little I can't see people staying quiet about replacing him. He has it in him to be a good support driver at the least. But if the gap continues to widen many eyes will be on him.
He had a good Jeddah race, but he was a whole pitstop behind his teammate in Bahrain and could barely catch a Mclaren in Melbourne and benefitted massively of multiple DNFs. Lewis and George have been the better driver if you look at all 3 races.
Somewhere between 5 to 10.
I feel bad because even who are behind him on points on top 10 and not him.
He will never stop getting hate, and that is perfectly fine, I am sure he doesn't lose any sleep over it, he understands what his position is and how he got to it.
Lance was also getting hunted by Perez, probably would have had to focus on that a bit
Well we can never know maybe Gasly was saving battery knowing he would need them to defend
With busted wrists and 1 DNF on top of that
Alonso is not in his prime anymore. Ocon matched him for pace last year and now looks dead on with Gasly again  >the entire season is literally all of three races old  Yes and that's what these ranking are judging?
Yes it did? He got shat on for 2 years, I can still like him. Now he's battering a teammate he's getting praise
Yuki performed as well or better then Gasly last year
The whole media valuation game works on eyeball statistics. So the more content you create, the more clicks you can generate, the more the numbers on some spreadsheet go up. The quality of that content is the least important aspect.  For these people who run F1, line on chart go up means F1 be good. BORING!
>	What’s the point?  To create conversation aout F1.
No lol
Is there though? The gap has been going down tenth by tenth since Bahrain and now they were the closest matched teammates in race pace. Where is even coming now, this narrative which is detached from reality? Are you sure you're not just using the points table and their gap in points to make conclusions?
Until he went off between the safety cars. Had the race continued, he would have been at the back of the pack
>But if the gap continues to widen  Race pace gap comparison kinda lacks due to Stroll's DNF in Saudi-Arabia but it has gone from **0,260s/0,265%** in Bahrain to **0,173s/0,211%** in Australia.  Qualifying pace gap has gone from **0,5s/0,552%** \-> **0,215s/242%** \-> **0,169s/0,219%**  No idea where you're getting the idea that ''the gap continues to widen''. It has literally been shrinking. I don't get why he's already getting this kind of lies said about him after 3 races... This just makes me sad.
He ruined his own race, he is where he belongs.
He wasn't. He just lost the DRS with Sainz which is the only thing that was keeping him at a fast pace. He dropped 3 seconds in 3 laps to Stroll as soon as he lost DRS.
>Yes and that's what these ranking are judging?  Sure, but I don't know what Stroll's performance vs. Alonso has to do with Stroll vs. Gasly.
>Alonso is not in his prime anymore  Wow, the excuses started quickly. I thought it would take at least half the season for these exact words to be said the first time. Alonso is still beating Stroll but it seems like Stroll closing the gap is making people nervous.
[removed]
The thing is this isn’t even a statistic. Power? No one knows what it means but it’s provocative, it gets the people going.
I was talking about a gap in performance so, yeah, the gap in points does factor in. It's the most important thing actually.  That's not the only thing of course. I was just looking at the image posted and commenting on the gap in performance between those drivers. Are you saying there isn't a gap? Because their definitely is and many seats have been lost for less.  Hopefully Lance will close the gap but if he doesn't, which is what I initially said, if the gap widens, things could get spicy.
Along with alonso.....
Dude, we're 3 races in. 3 races ago there was no gap. Now there is. I understand he missed some practice and DNF'd but there is a performance gap. It will fluctuate, that's how it works. If, in 3 races, the gap is larger then it will have widened, one could say that it will have continued to widen since there is currently a gap after 3 races.  Are you just arguing because you're bored or do you honestly not understand what I'm sayin? I'm seriously asking because I haven't "lied" about anything, just observed.
This is for all 3 races average. I think he drove Bahrain and jeddah well even though its was not outstanding its was decent. In Aus he drove well just the last lap ruined everything for him. Even Hamilton was ok for first two races and only in Australia he did really well. He is top 5
Sure that played a part but you don't know what energy modes they were running in
I really don’t understand the logic of that being an excuse the same thing applies for Hamilton vs Russell those older guys are literally past their prime it happens to everyone regardless of the sport.
[removed]
Stroll literally had a mechanical failure, so to hold points this much against him is ridiculous.  Their pace gap has literally been shrinking. Of course there's going to be a gap, not only because Alonso is just the better driver but also because Stroll missed pre-season testing and was seriously injured.
Alonso was punted off, Stroll didn't need any help
>3 races ago there was no gap. Now there is.  Wat...? What on earth do you mean by this?  Yes, there is a gap because Alonso is the better driver than Stroll and because Stroll missed pre-season testing and had serious injuries. Your original claim was although that the gap is increasing, which it is **not**. It's actually decreasing as I showed you.  I really don't understand your logic here as it makes no sense. It seems to be as if before the season you decided their gap was 0 and since there is gap between them now (even though it's decreasing) it means it has increased from the 0 before the season started. And you only do this analysis in 3 race intervals it seems as you ignore the fact that the gap has decreased from Bahrain to Australia.  Make it make sense, please.
[removed]
Jesus. I'm not holding anything against him. I'm not saying he's a bad driver. Just noticing a gap and saying that if it gets larger, things could get interesting. Why does it always have to be a love or hate thing? Why does my noticing a gap mean I'm holding something against him? He's either without blame or doesn't deserve a seat? Is that how you see it? Well. I don't and I was just commenting about a gap that exists. And it would be smaller but it would still exist without the DNF.
No, my point was that if it increases. Not that it is currently increasing. My point was that there is a gap. I get that you're hung up on the word, "continues" I was just saying that there is currently a gap and even though right now, it's decreasing, it exists. If it gets larger it will have continued to increase overall? Get it? Maybe I shouldn't have said "continues" I don't really care at this point. You know there's a gap, you said Alonso is a better driver, I never even commented on skill, I just commented on a gap. Drivers have lost their seat for less and  missed practice has never been a valid excuse to save a seat. I'm not saying it will increase. I'm not saying Lance sucks. I'm just saying *if* it increases, things could get interesting. Jeez, it seems like you agree with me, I don't get the animosity.
[removed]
You have so far claimed there's a ''huge gap'' and that ''it is increasing''. That's the problem. There is not ''huge gap'', they were the closest teammates in race pace in Australia. Of course you could say the 0,17s gap is ''huge'' but then gaps between the other teammates would be astronomical. And the gap has been decreasing since Bahrain.  It's not about ''love or hate'', it's about making false claims whether it's for or against someone. This time it was false claims against Stroll.  Please stop looking at the points table as well. It's obvious why driver comparisons should not be made based on points tables. Did you forget already that Ocon got more points last season than Alonso. That doesn't make him the better driver since Alonso had more DNFs. It doesn't although make Ocon a bad driver either.
You did say if the gap continues to widen when it’s been shown by the data that it’s actually been coming down. The point is simple. Stroll is not on alonsos level and no one is claiming him to be. The issue is that his pace and performance compared to alonso really isn’t the issue you’ve made it out to be. Bearing in mind he had broken wrists a month ago and missed the whole of testing so I think it is unfair to judge him so early on and if you did look at the data you’d be surprised.
I'm sorry but backpedaling was a bad choice of action for you. Should have just admitted you said wrong. There's even no need for this topic of discussion, especially since it's been only 3 races and we all know Alonso is better driver than Stroll. This is some forced issue being created here, to get to bash on Stroll.
>	No, my point was that if it increases. Not that it is currently increasing.  Then why did you say:  >but if the **gap continues to widen**  Earlier? Oh wait someone blindly started hating Stroll without using logic, that’s right. And now that you look dumb cause people are calling you out, goalposts are shifting. Nice mate  Admitting you were wrong and spoke without having information is a sign of intelligence.
I never said it was increasing. I said that if it continues to increase. Meaning there is currently a gap, that gap might be decreasing but if it stops decreasing and increases itg will have continued to increase overall. Get it? No gap, small gap, bigger gap. It will have continued to increase overall even though there are fluctuations in between when the gap got larger and smaller.  I honestly can't believe I have to explain it so literally. You want to believe I said something and read into it, go ahead. I don't give a shit. We're talking about race cars here, it's not the end of the world.  EDIT: why stop looking at the points? That is literally all that really matters! Yea, 3 races isn't enough to draw a conclusion but Lance is playing catch-up right now regardless of "fault". If he can't close the gap, most other drivers would be in trouble, maybe Lance as well. Points are important.
I'm not judging anybody! Jesus, you're reading a lot into one word: "continues". The gap exists, it doesn't matter why, if it "gets bigger" how's that? Is "gets bigger" ok with you? If it gets bigger, things could get spicy because drivers have lost their seat for less.  Man, I say "continues" and all of a sudden I'm unfairly judging Stroll. You really need to ease it back a little. You're not Stroll's personal bodyguard.  EDIT: BTW, if something gets bigger, it could be said that it has continued to grow, even if it shrank a little in the interim. I mean, I already explained this a few times. I'm not the enemy. I never said a bad thing about Stroll, not that it should matter so much. Holy shit.  EDIT: Hey! I thought of an analogy. Ok, global warming.has caused shorelines to receed. If someone says, "If they continue to receed, we'll be in trouble." Then someone comes along at high tide and says, "It's not receding, it's getting smaller. Why did you say 'continues'? You're wrong!"  That would be bullshit. because although the tide has made it smaller, it is receding. Get it? I'm not even saying it will definitely happen, I'm just saying.*if* it happens.  Ok, good. We can put this to rest and you can go defend Stroll's honor on a more deserving thread. Bye!
So you're just going to quietly downvote and back into the shrubs like Homer huh? I thought admitting you're wrong was a sign of intelligence.  Why didn't you just say that he was closing the gap, post your numbers and say hopefully he continues to close the gap and doesn't continue to widen it? Both can be true since he closed it in the last race but the overall trend this season has been a widening gap. You could admit you jumped the gun a little with the Stroll hating but overall neither of us were wrong we're just talking about different timeframes. I know this is reddit *and* F1 but neither of us needs to be petty. Come on, we both like F1, can't we just get along and hope there's some shade thrown between drivers? That's the way it should be.
I'll use the same analogy I used previously. But first, you need to lay off the "Stroll bashing" bullshit. I never said anything bad about Stroll, I just made an observation. And even if I did, he doesn't need the likes of you defending his honor. *Try* to be a little objective.  Ok. global warming has caused shorelines to receed. If someone says, "If they **continue** to receed, we'll be in trouble." Then someone comes along at high tide and says, "It's not receding, it's getting smaller. Why did you say 'continues'? You're wrong!"  That would be bullshit. because although the tide has made it smaller, it is receding. Get it? Just because it has shrunk a little, doesn't mean it won't **continue** to widen. I'm not even saying it will definitely happen, I'm just saying.*if* it happens.  So quit all of the me against you bullshit. I don't *hate Lance Stroll*. I was just making an observation.
Sure. Your words were indeed ''if it **continues** to increase''. And it does mean that you think it's increasing already and ''if it continues'' then ...  There is not a ''no gap'' situation to compare to from before the first race. That's something you came up all on your own. In the first race their quali gap was 0,552% and race gap was 0,265%. That's where it starts, especially when there was no pre-season testing comparison.
Just didn’t feel like responding to your word salad man. Soon as you started talking that nonsense about receding shorelines I just stopped reading, chuckled, and moved on with my day. It’s obvious you just assumed stroll was losing time to Alonso each race when he wasn’t, started back peddling, and now are making up nonsense analogies that don’t make any sense. Sorry someone downvoted you and hurt your feelings there but I stopped caring after reading that last comment cause it’s clear this wasn’t going anywhere worthwhile.

Going agressive with tyres in Baku has never gone wrong.  But seriously, especially Imola hopefully gets a bit more exciting with different strategies now
Baku has always been a straightforward one stopper. I suspect most teams will avoid the soft in race trim and run the bulk of the GP on the Hard.  But the tyre choice for the Sprint and late start for  qualifying should be good fun.
Rip Ferrari gonna pit on the last lap
Hopefully it at least makes Baku a 2 stop but I doubt it. Imola definitely gonna be a one stop anyway because that shit is hard as fuck to overtake.
FIA should really reset the goals for the tire compounds. Let's get back to 4-5 pit stops a race, and add some strategy back. Tires being able to practically last full race distances, Albon pretty much did last year, is slightly boring.
Wow that's very aggressive for Imola
RBR thanks you
ExperienceAzerbaijan flashbacks
Pirelli and Baku give some serious war flashbacks
2 stops should be the norm, not 1 pitstop     Because then we get double the strategy and pitstop excitement
Good. The tire compounds should be high deg anyways.
\#ExperienceAzerbaijan2.0
Sorry I don't understand, are they bringing the softest soft tires or  the hardest hards?
Kaboom?
The Baku track was resurfaced so it's smoother asphalt now which should be easier on the tyres.
Hopefully it’ll be blistering hot too
Stroll will have PTSD
Good time for this to happen… I’m sure Baku will be great.
\> Pirelli  \> Baku  Oh no. Not again...
Just bring back refueling
Has there always been a C0 for 2022? I only noticed during the introduction for Australia last weekend.
This is only going to help Red Bull even more.
Im already bracing for the “Bono my tires are …” comms
Why do they insist on playing with the tires at this circuit? Hopefully we don’t see another blow out like lance or max had.
Wonder when C0 will be used
Didn’t Max suffer a tire failure in Baku in 2021? Or was that Azerbaijan?
Good news for the new qualifying format at Imola.
Imola is weird since they will test new tyre selection qualifying format.
It's the same selection as Baku 2022
  #ExperienceAzerbaijan
Yeah not to mention Imola T1. This is not the excitement I'm looking for.
In before Max crashes out on lap 45 due to puncture
I expect a 0 stopper due to the 11 red flags
Charles we are going to pit every lap for fresh tires to overtake the Red Bulls, do we use wet tires or soft tires each box. Question.
-- TO SECURE THE FASTEST LAP SO CHARLES GETS HIS SECOND GRAND SLAM  (god please)
Baku has used the softest tyre selection the last 2 races as well, both were one stops so I don't see why it will be any different this year unless there is extreme temperatures or something
The layout of Baku has no fast, prolonged corner that would degrade the tire thermally. It also has street surface which doesn’t wear the tire mechanically. The pit is on one of the fastest straights so time lost in pit is also higher than compared to other track. So, it’ll most likely be a one-stopper no matter how hard they try.
agreed- go back and look at 2009-2013 and the first round of pitstops happened on like lap 9 and the racing was awesome. Now Days the leaders can last long enough on the first set of tires that they can build a 25+ second lead and dont even fall back into the field when they pit.
4-5 I would feel is a bit silly. A dream world would be one stop if you’re reeeeeeally stretching, two stopper standard, three stopper aggressive. Although I don’t know how possible that is. Would definitely at least like to see the norm shifted upwards a stop
I agree. 2 or 3 stops are great for racing. The best example of good racing and tyre strategy is Chine 2011.   More importantly, it's compound gap. Medium and Hard should be 3/4 seconds slower than soft.
But then the tire manufacturer will get the reputation of their tires are not durable (i.e. bad marketing).
Even adding one more standard compound available to be used in the race would change things massively
That's just randomness. The standard should be one stop with some cars going to two
Aston too
Won't this just make them even faster?  Tyre Deg is gonna be even more important now.
Lance and Max about to have that thousand-yard stare
Softest
Yes, kaboom!
No, last year's C1 compound was renamed to C0 for this year. The new C1 is closer to the C2 because they found that the gap between those compounds was too big last year.
[removed]
How?
It was a total different tyre back then, besides that I assume they won't make the same mistake that led to those failures. It is fine for them to experiment, that is better than 1 stop races.
Silverstone or Suzuka maybe? But probably never, it was dreadful when they used it last year hence the new C1
Nah that was in Azerbaijan. Baku was where Stroll had his tire failure.
Baku IS in Azerbaijan...
Yes
Oh I hadn't even thought about that. Maybe they we're afraid the drivers couldn't get the hards up to temperature fast enough for a flying lap, if it were the C2?
There is no saving Imola. It's hard to pass everywhere besides the home straight, which is extremely easy to pass with DRS. It's a complete snooze fest and I look forward to the day it gets off the calendar for literally any other track.
Out of the loop, what is this new format they to try?
Is there a reason they aren’t doing this tyre quali format in Miami?
This. How can Pirelli say things like this after Baku 2021? After what happened to Stroll and Max, and what could have happened. Pirelli still isn’t in a position with the quality of their tires.
yeah "straightforward one stopper" is an interesting tske considering that apart from last year there was always some shithousery going on with red flags and safety cars.
Charles box now, box box, do you want to stop in our box or would you like us to move down to another garage ?
Inb4 Charles gets 5 seconds penalty for speeding in pitlane
Then he comes out in front of alonso in p2, and gets overtaken, and alonso wins  EL PLAN   Spa 2022 repeat but its #1 & 2
You replied to or quoted the wrong comment
I think a major issue is there isn't enough of a performance gap in the compounds to make extra stops worthwhile. A softer tire needs to add enough performance to make up the time in the pits. Sure you can run hards for the 2nd 2/3 of the race, but a guy running an aggressive SMS strategy should absolutely trounce the former in pace.
Some of them last for like 50 miles currently lol
eh their road tyres are already pretty mid so its not like thats gonna ruin anyones perception.
f1 fans when something other than driving in a procession for 60 laps happens:
I think that's what (s)he meant
Finally. For the love of god I wanna see some fucking pit stops
Because they need the help?
Soft tires are more prone to degrading quickly, so more downforce➡️more load on tires➡️tire slides less➡️ less tire wear➡️more pace throughout the race.
😊
Just wait. Imola, followed by Monaco. We will be lucky to see 10 passes combined in both of those races.
It’s a snooze fest until a Ferrari driver sends it completely over an apex and bins it into the wall
Weirdly enough if the old layout was introduced it'd be much more exciting, and I guess the cars are safe enough now that it wouldn't pose a safety risk. Now if you want to pass around Tamburello you have to risk going around the outside, and there's an opportunity for a switchback up into Tosa since Villeneuve would be easy flat.
It's fun to drive in games, that's about it.
At least there is no sprint this time. That was such a stupid idea
It’s quick though
Literally swap Imola for Mugello or Sepang PLEASE
Different types for each q.  Hard for Q1 ... Soft for q3  Environmental reasons if i am correct.
Completely different tires. 13" versus 18".
Different tyres different cars
The compounds are different. They might still be called soft/medium/hard but the actual rubber is different since that incident.
Completely different tyres and in 2021 they were blowing up every other race because they were the tyres from like 2019. The teams voted to not use the 2020 tyres because they sucked so they carried over the 2019 tyres, IIRC. And then the pandemic made it so they couldn't make enough new tyres for the new season so they kept the 2019 spec.
>Pirelli still isn’t in a position with the quality of their tires.  How can you say that when they won 100% of the races for a long time now, GOATS!
And a 10 second penalty for "bad touching" of the car by the Ferrari pit crew.
Agreed. I don’t know why they don’t make a race like c1, c4 and c5. Just at least try it! Try on a low deg circuit first to see what the impact is at least…
Could they allow different minimum tyre pressures on the compounds to make the gap larger. For example the hardest tyre also has an increased minimum pressure to increase lap time.
I just like competition and not randomness...
Oh yeah, my bad  I read it as "RBR thank you", didn't notice it's "thanks you"
>Because they need the help?  Perez needs the help
More load equals more tire wear as the friction would rise between the contact patch and the road surface
Oh there will be plenty of passes at Imola. It will just be the most sanitized boring race ever because it's so easy to line up a DRS drive by that nobody bothers battling.
But history!!!
Start hard, finish soft. Relatable.
Yup, this way Pirelli needs to bring two sets fewer per car IIRC
Environmental reasons? Aren't Pirelli the ones that design the tires to grade more quickly? (Also our environment has much bigger fish to fry than rubber balls)
And who knows how much teams were playing with tire pressure too.  Like, are we supposed to go around in bumper cars because of these issues?
They tried skipping a step in melbourne last year. They went c2, c3 and c5. Nobody used c5 except Albon, and  Albon used it...one lap.
To be honest, you can read it both ways, but English is not my native tongue, so I could be wrong
Jenson button said more load, less tire sliding, less wear.  Applying your logic, less downforce cars would do better in race, and that makes no sense.  I would definitely take Jenson button's word on this.
Unless it rains again and makes passing off a small drying line impossible
Unless it’s Hamilton behind Gasly behind Albon.
Depending on how things go, Wet is also an option.
Pirelli dies that because that's what asked from them, for strategy reasons. They are perfectly capable of making tyres that would last the full GP. Hell they could design tyres that could run for whole season , but we want pitstops , so ...
Pirelli accepted the contract to do what f1 wanted  Yes environmental reasons. Instead of bringing an abundance of all compounds for teams, they can bring smaller and more standardized sets to those races which will cut down on manufacturing and freight. You can in fact google and learn about their projected environmental benefits from this
Yeah, whatever happened to the narrative that Perez brought over some tire pressure secrets from racing point, and that was why specifically those teams had the same sidewalk failures and blowouts? Was it ultimately just a rumor?
Fair call, maybe they should have gone for c1, c3 and c4..
Except that's the worst sort of race. What we need at Imola is a consistent rainy race, then we'd get a bit of action
IIRC last time it happened because they didn’t re-enable DRS for like half the race
Not for Ruseel George on Bottas tho
If they could design tires to last an entire race, I wonder if it would be possible to make the entire series of tires do that S1-S(6?). Maybe they could stop to fill up the drinks system or something
I'm not in Google, I'm talking about something that I didn't even read the article for with strangers on Reddit.   I wonder if the COVID limitations of teams not choosing their own tire allotment was a step towards this planned goal
Feel like it mostly to save face for pirelli who even came with stronger tires a few races later because they knew current ones weren't up to par.
C1 tire last year was dreadful mostly, wasn't it?
The track just never dried. Even with drs it would’ve been hard when you’re braking off line and on a wet surface while the defending driver got a dry track to brake on and the racing line
They used to stop to take fuel. But that didn't end well. There are many videos on yt of pitstop fire when they were fueling the car.    Back then teams had their own tyre suppliers too.
Checo told that before the race even started, so it has nothing to do with saving Pirelli face
Ahhhh I think I got it turned around in my head - c1 = softest? I might have been thinking the reverse
Would help pushing people to the softer compounds more. If they can't make soft tyres better, making hards worse also gets the same effect.
c1 is the hardest, and it was completely unusable because it would take a furnace to get it up to temps on almost all tracks
Ah cheers. What’s the point of it then? A Middle East daytime race that doesn’t ever happen?

I mean, bro is doing his best. It's out of his hands.
Wow a Yuki/Checo lineup would be CRAZY!! 🔥🔥
*Checo gets a contract extension until 2026  Yuki: AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH
It'd really help if AT wasn't one of the slowest if not the slowest car on the grid. Getting overtaken left and right because others are faster doesn't really give Tsunoda the chance to proof he's capable.
A better discussion would be who is replacing my boy De Vries next season?
Albon is my dark horse for that seat. But its still Perez's to lose, performance wise he's not given too many reasons to be dropped.
Or, another seat
Press x to doubt
“Who is Franz Tost?”
Yuki is really coming into his own lately, but I don’t think he’s at this level currently. By 2025? We’ll see…
Is there a reason why nobody mentions Leclerc to RB? Checo's contract ends in 2024, same as Leclerc.
What track is that? Anyone who was signed by Red Bull from Torro Rosso spent maximum 2 years wit Tosts team. Gasly, Kvyat, Vettel, Verstappen, Albon were signed before they completed two year in Torro Rosso. Daniel Ricciardo is the only one who spent exactly 2 years at the team, before going to RB.  Tsunoda is in his third year, and Tost talking about 2025 (his fifth year). He would spend more time in Alpha Tauri from this point on, then anyone bar Ricciardo spent in TR at all!  By 2025, at least one of Iwasa, Lawson, Maloney, Hauger or Hadjar will be in F1, beating De Vries won’t be enough. If I were Tsunoda I would be trying for other seats, especially that Iwasa is coming and being a token japanese for Honda won’t be enough.
Not seeing it, to be honest. However, there's still a very long time before that decision has to be made, and if by summer 2024 he has greatly improved then yes, it can make sense.
Why not 2028? Star phenom waits patiently and joins 7 time world champion! That tends to work out
Uuuuuummm...no way that fucking happens. I love Yuki, but that is wildly unrealistic.
"on the right track for a 2025 Red Bull drive"  "In F1 right"  "..."  "In F1, right?"
Consider the McLaren never gets its shit together  You think RB is gonna take Yuki over a Norris looking to move teams?
I don't think so, I think by 2025, Lando Norris will be more suited to be the successor of Checo, every time RB whisper to Lando in the past, McLaren jumps and adjusts his contract, but judging how things are right now with McLaren, Lando might now listen to RB . It's about that time he needs to be in a top team. It will be either him or Leclerc.
I'm still not certain if Yuki is doing really well so far, or if he's flattered by De Vries not being good.   I'm a bit afraid he he might have been put in a lose-lose situation though, kind of similar to Pierre after 2019, where everyone remembers the season he got destroyed, and then only being paired with unknown rookies so even dominating them might not be enough to raise his stock enough for a top team in the short-term. I'd like it if he could manage to hang onto his seat and perhaps have a good career, perhaps even following Perez' trajectory, the kid has grown on me tbh
Tost playing the F1 Manager game it seems.
Would love to see Alex back in it, he is doing such a great job at Williams, I am sure he can turn around his fortunes at RB given the opportunity.
yuki would look so right in the redbull racing suit
it will end up the same as with Gasły/Albon
That's a very bold statement, but it's pretty likely, I don't think RBR renew Checo
Franz Tost drop the wine flask please..
I honestly don’t think Yuki is ever going to drive for Red Bull. Has he improved across 2 seasons? Yes. Does he look talented enough to be a Red Bull driver? I really don’t think so. I certainly wouldn’t put him ahead of Checo.   I’m sure I’ll get downvoted for my opinion, but that’s what I think.
A *tad* premature there...
That’s hilarious
It's still  too early to throw out theories, but I would think the main contenders for the seat at this point are Yuki, Danny, Lando and Checo, of course. Yuki needs to keep improving if he wants to have a strong chance though, he's been fortunate to keep his AT seat for as long as he has.
Lando and hulk above max and alonso xd
Oscar Piastri drafting his tweets for 2025!
Yuki > Nyck for sure
Silly season came early this year!
I'm not feeling it, feels too premature.
If Yuki continues to outdo DeVries and possibly another teammate I can still only imagine him moving to a higher midfield team in 2025 before red bull would even give him a second look.
Franz Tost : Here Yuki, try this hopium
He will be lucky if he'll stay on grid in 2025
God I hope so
Yeeeeeaaaahhhhhhhh no.
But Riccardo fans.......
How much cocaine did the person that wrote this shove up his nose?
RB will poach Norris before him.
Are Red Bull planning on making it a challenge in 2025 by putting in their second rate drivers for a tilt at the title?  Tsunoda has done nothing to show he is fit for a top team.
that sounds more like a roast than anything
Considering how well RBR are doing with Newey and this era of regulations, Id assume Red Bull will scoop up Lando or someone similar. They will basically have their choice of anyone other than LH and George
Max and Yuki screaming to Horner.
YUKIIIIIIIII
Let’s go Yuki!!
No one, and I mean, no one, not Franz, not Yuki, not Christian, not Helmut, believes this.
Yuki will mess around be the Felipe masa of Redbull.
This would be a weird downgrade from what Red Bull currently has going on. What else can you ask about Checo? He’s getting wins, podiums. Defends Max when he has to, etc.  Checo is the perfect wingman. Yuki is not going to be in win contention week in and out.  He might shout on the radio though so I guess that’s the strategy here?
Hell no. Perez is the best since Daniel.
I’ll smoke what he’s smoking.
Hahahahhahaahha 🤣🤣😂
Lando/Yuki is an interesting lineup
Lol. Ffs this is his third race. He isn't better than Checo!
Because nobody sees Yuki in a 2026 Redbull without Honda powering it.
I will be my house he will never driver for red bull
I don't see Yuki replacing Perez unless Perez retires completely. Checo is just too good at the moment, the perfect number 2, wins races when Max can't.
What? Yuki will never get a seat in the main team.
Lol I don't think so, yuki still has extreme temper issues
ROFL, not in a gazillion years. He's WAY down the list, WAY down. He's not even in the second tier of drivers.
No fucking way. He sucks.
Lmfao
Hulk to RB 2025
If Yuki continues to grow like he has, hope he can get that 2nd seat at RBR.    But I think for obvious marketing purposes and team familiarity I think Albon is probably ahead of Yuki with his Thai Red Bull connection.
[removed]
is this /r/funny ??
No he is not lol  He’s getting better, but he’s not even better than Lance
🤨🤨🤨🤨
All-Japanese AT driver lineup with Tsunoda & Iwasa for next year. I'm counting on it!
Yuki isn't good, so no.
Yuki won’t drive for Red Bull
Pretty good shout, just get rid of Perez already and have Riccardo drive for the rest of this season and then Tsunoda or something
He does not have the right temperament, attitude or consistency to be at the front
He can’t drive the car he’s in. Will never happen.
There must be some hidden metric we haven't seen yet. Maybe a sensor somewhere in Yuki's butt where most of his talent currently resides. I'm sure RB cannot wait to put fragile driver in the seat to ruin future WCC chances. In the bright side he is not the worst driver out there.
Lol. Not a shot in hell Yuki makes it to Red Bull. They would put Danny Ric, a podium driver with Red Bull, in the car long before they let Yuki smash that car up.
I hope checo retires with dignity after his contract is up and does the Alonso thing of focusing on different disciplines and going after that elusive triple crown.
Toto Wolff is furiously dialling Perez right now.
Surely they'd rather buy out Norris' last year?
Nice guy, but I vote Lando.
Hahahaha hahahahahah....   Aaaaaaaaaahhahahahahahaaha  No.  Honda will be completely out of f1 soon and with that so will tsunoda. Not good enough.
Iwasa in for Yuki in 2024
RIP Checo
Isn’t tsunoda in mini Red Bull only because of Honda being Japanese?
Lol.  Such wishful thinking.  It seems like Perez's relationship with RB is starting to fray, especially when getting slighted by Max last year when it had zero bearing on his championship campaign.  Calling it for Riccardo to Red Bull in 2024.
yuki in rb. 😝 not going to happen. they were keeping him because of Honda. Now with Ford they need to get an american in AT.
How about 2023? Perez isn't doing much to improve and is holding RBR back. RBR should do the smart thing, cut Perez loose and promote Tsunoda.
To quote Princess Leia, “What!?”
The Redbull is called Toro Rosso, isnt it?
They really do go all in on the clear number 1 driver strategy don’t they. It works better than Merc’s “let em race” philosophy though.
So is Lawson stuck in Japan for a few years or is De Vries getting dumped at the end of the year?
No way
I love Yuki very much, but for the love of God do not place him at RBR.
I disagree.
I want the same stuff Tost is smoking.
I dont know man, Iwasa is looking super impressive in F2.
Horner to Tost : what you been sniffing dude?
Helmut marko has to be "on the right mind"  for that.
Michael Italano is working his magic
Would be bad if he was on the wrong racing track
Gasly was bad in the Red Bull. For Tsunoda to have any shot, he needed to squash Gasly. He didnt, this pretty much killed any hopes he had for a RB seat. Perez is too good to be replaced by Tsunoda.
It's not out of his hands at all lol
I wonder if Checo would be around until 2025 or would RB tap into their academy drivers.
Yuki/Checo Alpha Tauri line up
11/22
lol
Sorry Mr Verstappen, best luck in your future endeavours.
Tsunoda Iwasa for RB and Max Nyck for AT. One could only dream
Beat me to it
Danny Ric: 👀👀👀
Max leaves to go play something challenging though
This might be surprising, but the folks who decide whether to sign/extend drivers or not can tell if drivers are good even if all they do is pootle around at the back.
All he can do in that shitbox is to beat De Vries into submission on a regular basis, and so far he’s done just that.
And he’s still managing P11
Lawson
Probably either Lawson or Iwasa, depending on the latter's performance in F2 this season
Iwasa if he wins the championship
I like your thought here. It would be lovely to see Alex make a triumphant return.  But yeah. Despite the frequent suggestions to the contrary, Perez is a good driver, and the numbers back it up - not to mention a WDC and WCC since he's been there. I don't see RB rolling the dice without a big slump or a rookie literally named "Max Verstappen II."
I think of Albon like a really good prospect at a football club who has far more established competition ahead of him, but once he gets to show what he can without the pressure of playing for the big club, he shines.  Seeing a W logo in Q3 or top 10 just shows what he can do, if he keeps it up he won't be far off the George Russell path imo. Although George seems to have a cooler head when it's squeaky bum time.
He's RBRs Bottas. Good enough to win them WCCs but not likely to trouble Max and cause intra team drama.
What. Perez has been subpar for his whole stint at Red Bull
I mean P20 to P5 (which would have been P7 if not for being lucky on the restart), when 8 cars DNF:ed and he's in the fastest car on the grid by far, is underwhelming to say the least.  If Merc or Aston start to properly catch up they will have to drop him ASAP.
I’ve got my money on sainz coming back into the fold. He was RB academy, he’s obviously underperforming and stressed out about it at Ferrari. And we know Ferrari make dumb, expensive personnel moves all the time. I think they cut him loose and RB put him in w Max
Yeah I think Albon and Ricciardo have a better shot as long as they're willing to not make too much of a fuss that they're 2nd driver
Lol Albon had his chance
I mean I think the bigger thing is that Franz wants Yuki for 2024 in AT and then he moves on. The red bull bit is because it is the AT way. Who knows who is where in 2025, that is still 2 seasons away
XXXXXXXXXX
Feel. I mean the dude is fun, but I don't understand how he could be considered to be tracking the growth curve pace wise to be a 1st seat driver at a top team, or have the consistency and defense to command giving him the second seat.  As for the younger(ish) guys still at a feeder team, I have a lot more faith in Zhou and Albon as second seat guys than Yuki.
Lewis?
I had French Toast for breakfast today
If you’re mistaking who for what then its a piece of bread seared on a pan after dipping it into milk and egg.  You’re welcome.
Thank you translating what Tost said, I had trouble comprehending what he meant. /s
I think he has the raw talent if he can mature some with his anger and work ethic.
Because RB already has a WDC winner in max. Nobody wants want a Lewis-Nico situation
Because Leclerc himself is not interested. He wants to win in Red and bla, bla, bla, Forza Ferrari, bla, bla bla.
Because Leclerc is brainwashed to the point it's depressing.
I think they stopped with fast tracking after Gasly and Albon. On top of that they fast tracked when they didn’t have a championship worthy car. Now that’s settled down and Perez is doing fine, there is no need to push anybody through unless it’s Verstappen level talent.
They spent 1-2 years in Toro Rosso and look how they finished. Last year Horner said already that they are changing approach and they won't sign a driver to RB without at least few years to experience. Now RB is in a different place than few years ago. They need a driver who is 100% prepared, not to do an experiment like with Albon or Gasly. It's not difficult to understand.
He's talking 2025 because of Perez's contract. And at that point, I wouldn't take past pattern into account, especially since Horner publicly said that they brought drivers too soon to RB.
There were some other considerations about that though. Ricciardo got promoted because Webber retired, Gasly got the opportunity because Ricciardo unexpectedly left, hard to believe he'd have displaced him otherwise, Albon got rushed to RB because Pierre was underperforming, ... Vestappen is the only one who got arguably rushed into the RB from TR, but he is...well Verstappen, and there were a lot of criticism on Kvyat too at the time too.   Obviously, it can seem hard to believe for now, but if Yuki keeps developping and beating his teammates convincingly, the RB seat might not be out of reach eventually. It's not as if there were a lot of interesting vacancies in other teams for now anyway
I also think its unlikely, but for me the main thing from Tost's comments is how impressed he is w/ yuki   &#x200B;  The RB thing is a stretch, but let's see how things play out.
It’s clear he has improved significantly through the first 3 races already. If he continues to performs as he has the seat is his easily.
Lando would still have a difficult decision in 2025 as their facilities may provide the “what-if” that keeps him there.
Gasly wasn't paired with unknown rookies after his demotion. He spent a season and a half with Daniil Kvyat (half of 2019 and full 2020), then one with a rookie (Yuki in 2021), and then another one with Yuki, normally not considered rookie in their second season.
Yuki is extremely good and on par with Gasly, and would've had more posts if not for luck last year and two poor mistakes.
As he did in F2
I'd say that's what majority think as well. Yuki just isn't good enough for main team. If anything, I'd bet on Lando taking 2nd spot. At the same time, if Checo keeps doing ok, there is no reason to replace him at all really.
Completely agree.. they take Lando before Yuki any day
I don’t think Danny is a contender. I don’t see RB chucking him into that seat while out of F1 for 2 seasons. So either he finds a seat next year and proves himself or he’s out of contention for RB in 2025.
In no universe is 2023 Danny Ric a contender for that seat
Gotta remember the possibility that Verstappen dips after his contract. Maybe Red Bull decides to hire Tsunoda, have him race and learn from Verstappen in 2025 and 2026, then let Verstappen walk and have Yuki potentially lead the team. Either that or make him the number 2 while stealing someone like Norris, Russell or Leclerc and have them as the number 1. Who knows dude. Edit: Correction, Verstappen’s contract ends in 2028. Maybe there's a possibility Verstappen decides to end the contract earlier than 2028, but he will probably see his contract out if he were to retire in 2028
Danny lol
only reason he's kept it is due to the RB young talent pool being a bit dry atm, if there was someone else coming up i think he would've been booted after 22.
Why? They're just quoting Tost.
Lol what? If Albon/Gasly got the drive for RB I imagine Yuki has a shot of getting it in 2025 if he continues developing at this rate. It's not like it's an absurd proposal. He's rapid.
Oh, yes. I'm pretty sure that you are one of those people than think that he got the Alpha Tauri seat just because he's Japanese
He isn’t any worse than Max nowadays honestly. He used to have issues in his rookie season but he has worked on it massively.
Wouldn't the perfect #2 be someone like Bottas at Merc who on a good day could push Lewis for pole and even the occasional win on merit head to head without ever threatening WDC in a meaningful way?  Perez is largely just cleaning up scraps. He rarely pushes Max at all, which isn't great for Max (who I truly believe would prefer to be pushed at times to further refine his own craft) and isn't good for the sport frankly.  I for one look forward to someone else getting a shot in the second RBR seat. Nothing against Perez personally, I just think he's wasting the seat and several other drivers on the grid could easily do at least what he is in that car. I'd love to see them steal Lando away somehow.
show me examples of behavior different than other european drivers.
it's only what you think, but I guess you don't track his radio or races enough to know the truth. you also don't know what his coach says about him and his intent. he was working massively on every aspect and now he has everything in right place.
And you are an F1 driver with the right temperament, attitude, and consistency to be at the front?
Dude has improved so much in ethic and consistency since his rookie year idk what you've been watching. Unless DeVries beats him the rest of the year it's unlikely he's losing his seat.
What a DTS take
Gasly was put into RB too early. He had what, a season, maybe two in Toro Rosso before he was promoted and Danny Ric left for Renault? He wasn’t ready and neither was Albon - the RB driver’s academy was really cut-throat at that time, and they were both expected to be as good as Max but still play second fiddle. So, I think it’s unfair to use these examples to define the careers of Gasly and Albon, especially when they seem to be doing well now in Alpine and Williams.
To be fair Gasly is doing better now than in 2019
Transitive properties don't really apply to sports
Dude please. Where are you coming up with these takes from?
Yes, for Yuki to get an RB shot he had to outperform gasly as a rookie. Totally. And Yuki is definitely at his peak race craft right now and will not get any better. He should just quit now.
Just spare everyone of your ignorance.
Perez is likely going to retire after the contract is up. He doesn’t have the world championships for a second act like Alonso or Seb, and I don’t think RB is going to need a “great rear gunner” at the pace they’ve set.
Tsunoda would have 4 years of racing experience by 2025…I think he would have enough maturity by then to deal with the pressure of driving for Red Bull and against Max. I really want to see someone giving Max a proper challenge ngl.
Perez and too good in 1 sentence is so cursed💀
You're assuming people are static and don't improve.   Teams are trying to find what the ceiling of a driver is and if he fits the teams moment.  Tsunoda needs a clean 2023, showing his maturity and racecraft and without any kind of accident caused by him. Then, he might be able get a RB seat.
People are quite forgiving when it comes to top team drivers. Checo is not exactly the most consistent of the bunch. Sometimes he just isn't fast as usually and he gets stuck behind someone. Or he spuns 4(5?) times in a same spot, and that is too much with, or without car issues. Not saying that Checo is a bad driver, but make those mistakes in AT and you're done for the weekend.   So, what if Yuki continues to drive this good for the whole season? Also, Tsunoda matched Gasly in the 2nd half of the last season, so maybe he is already better than RB Gasly?
I doubt it will happen but it would be awesome to see danny ric back in the red bull
Gasly was not the true Gasly we saw after his RB exit so it's not a fair comparison.
Tbf the Red Bull is suited to Max’s driving style. Has been that way since 2019
I mean that he is doing all he can, and if he keeps like this, and it's up to Marko and Horner whether he will get the seat or not.
Yuki is really their only other option at the moment if they only look at their own young drivers.
Checo most likely going to be replaced by Yuki. They don’t have any other alternatives, plus he’ll have the necessary experience by then (since Gasly + Albon weren’t given enough time). Or Norris if they manage to snag him. Leclerc too loyal to Ferrari. George at Merc.  I can see Checo taking a similar route to Bottas, with being the leader of a midfield team in 2025. Probably with Sauber or perhaps McLaren if Lando leaves (pairs Sergio’s veteran experience up with Piastri’s raw talent). At the very worst, Haas is always available. Those are my top 3 guesses though (Sauber/Audi, McLaren, Haas).
He's contracted till the end of 2024 and they don't really have a reason to risk replacing him atm, so I don't see why not. If he starts faltering tho and Yuki takes another step forward it's possible that he could be gone before then, but I doubt it
I'm expecting checo to be around until they can get norris
My hot take is that Checo is gone after this year.
Depends. If he can still perform on a level and finishes P2 in WDC '24, he's keeping that seat probably for another year or 2, unless he chooses to retire. I don't see Yuki getting that seat, he's just not good enough. And RB doesn't have anyone else in the academy worthy of that RB seat. So either they keep Checo or they shop around for Sainz or Lando. Charles maybe, if they can afford him.
It’s about time they do. Helmut Marko has really shit the bed the past few years with his “driver program” - two outside hires instead of internal promotion.
This is more likely tbh
damn monkey paw
Yuki/Checo Alpha Prime Racing line up
Max/Danny pt. II
Checo is actually just two Yuki's standing on their shoulders.
Danny is likely never driving in F1 full time again without going to a midfield team. He’s not a consideration for any top team. People want to create false narratives about some Red Bull conspiracy to replace Checo with Danny, but it’s never going to happen.
Case in point Russel. It was pretty clear he was special imo.
I'm really not sure how accurate this is tbh. They have more data so probably can make better educated guesses, but I don't know how good those are, especially in those cases when unknown quantities are involved.   Typically, Leclerc and Russell shined because they had Ericson and Latifi as teammates, in a car that was historically bad but developped over the year(s) even, which gave them some moments when they outperformed compared to the very low expectations of the car. If we had had a Leclerc/Russell pairing in a backmarker team, with (let's imagine) both being pretty much even throughout their partnership, neither looking particularly good compared to the other one, how easy would it have been to spot their talents?
what if Tost signed De Vries, because he knew how bad he is so Tsunoda would look better?
What a driver does in a lower car may be different from how they perform in *the* top car *against Max*. Case and point is the two former Red Bull teammates Max has had recently.  You can't judge everything off of performances in a lower car. Different people react to top team pressure differently.
Oh wow, big insite 😱
Out of 12 finishers. He was on his way to 14th place, in front of Bottas who had a terrible race, and Sergeant and de Vries who started behind him and were put on a terrible strategy. Let's not give that AT more credit than it deserves.
I say give Herta a shot.
So far he's looking good, at least compared to his RB competitors.  Hauger is just Iwasa with worse luck Fittipaldi isn't as fast Hadjar/Crawford don't look super impressive Maloney has flashes of brilliance but need more time
> Despite the frequent suggestions to the contrary, Perez is a good driver, and the numbers back it up  God, it's nice to see someone else around here say that. I swear, Checo might be the most disrespected (not hated, disrespected) driver on the grid.  I don't know why F1 fans can't seem to get this through their skulls: RB DOESN'T WANT someone who can genuinely compete with Max. Not right now, anyway. They want someone who can win the races Max isn't able to, and come in as close as possible to second on the races Max does win.  Checo is literally that.
"Medium Verstappen"
On that note I'd actually expect George x Albon to be a good pairing down the line when Hamilton retires. Albon is usually reliable and quick but doesn't seem to have the push to fight for WDC too much
Why'd you say so?   Perez, although he's had his moments, has done exactly what was probably expected of him when RBR snapped him up.  Checo was never brought in to win races, give Max a run for his money and set the world alight, he was instead signed up to be Max's Bottas, to support him, a role which he has done rather well.
In Melbourne though which is quite difficult to overtake.
You're talking as if this race had happened at Monza, it was Albert Park, one of the most difficult places to overtake, for crying out loud didn't you see that overtake on the Hass?
> Who knows who is where in 2025  Be me, 31 years old, no racing experience, 6’1”/250lbs of flabby meat. So you’re saying there’s a chance???
We've got several people with long-term contracts, but the rest is silly-season-territory. Except Stroll.
Found my burner account
My comment was meant as broad support for Yuki but tepid doubtfulness that he is actually “on the right track” for a Red Bull seat
stop with that anger and work ethic bullshit. It's past from beginning of his rookie season. He works VERY hard and Tost, also his coach can say the same. look how vascular he became. you can't do it without work ethic. also driving and technical feedback improved a lot. it's a result of great work ethic.
He’s matured a lot but regardless I love his outbursts
While that's 100% true from a team principal's standpoint, from a Red Bull brand standpoint they'd get a shitload more screen time from a lewis/nico situation rather than Max driving off into the distance alone. I still think you're right though in that they wouldn't want to be throwing tens of millions at a potential competitor to Max when they could get a decent rear gunner for half that, but there would be some upsides too.
>Nobody wants want a Lewis-Nico situation  Well except all the fans, and maybe, however unlikely, RB will get bored of the chamlionship being a cake walk and fancy adding some spice to the mix.
If it was any other team I might agree with you, but RBR lives for attention and drama, any press is good press for them. I fully believe they would go after Charles if the interest was mutual and I don't even think Max would be upset. He seems like a racer who wants to be pushed and he might even enjoy putting an exclamation point of their life long on-track rivalry by beating Charles in the same car. I mean they let Daniel come in and push Seb out right after Seb won them 4 titles, is everyone forgetting that?   It would absolutely quiet down everyone bitching about RBR dominance as well watching those two go at it week to week. I think Lando could have a similar effect, but a bit less chance of keeping up with Max as often.   Edit: Definitely think the odds are higher they pick up a disgruntled Lando than Charles realistically.
Nonsense  RB were actively trying to keep ricciardo at his peak
Lando could challenge Max as well
Looks at Red bull juniors, ehhhh don't think there's any Verstappen level talent unless you're talking Senior Verstappen  Iwasa in terms of Consistency maybe? Lawson did very well in GT class? But didn't impress enough in F2? Hauger as many mentioned (although he have rotten luck and I still don't see him anywhere near Tsunoda's level during his F2 stint)
You’re right it’s an entirely different situation. But also especially Albon was a lot more impressive at AT than Tsunoda and never even stood a chance at RB. The point is more that Tsunoda doesn’t seem to be on that level he needs to be to replace Perez even with more experience.
Tost been impressed with Yuki ever since last season since Yuki got a lot more mature, moved to Italy etc. He doesn't hold all the power in AT but it is always nice to see that he wants to keep Yuki around
Well what's he gonna say "I'm not impressed with Yuki" ....  3 races in and a full schedule ahead with a pissed/demotivated driver?
He’s not going to publicly shame his drivers even if he wasn’t happy with their performance. He has to do anything he can to pump them up because it’s good to keep their heads in the right place. You aren’t going to see a TP shaming one of their drivers because it affects their performance and that performance affects the team.
Strongly disagree. Is this the best Yuki we've seen since his debut? Yes, but that doesn't mean he's ready to get into the Red Bull, much less the seat being his "easily." As we've seen in the last years, the RB is a completely different beast than the AT, and a very very hard one to drive. Yuki has shown potential, but I just can't see him being able to drive that car that soon.
Nah, Mercedes will cherry pick that McLaren driver to replace their current 7 time world champion to partner his long time friend who came from Williams.  :p
Mclaren haven’t been competitive in a decade  Redbull on the other hand have been dominating, redbulls current form will overshadow any “what-if”  mclaren might have
True, perhaps "not highly rated" would fit better
I doubt they'd keep Checo if Verstappen dips no? If anything they'd poach Lando and swap Checo with someone younger and with more potential.
Bruh Verstappen is signed on until like 2027 or 28 lmao
I mean that’s just silly.   I love Yuki and he deserves time to blossom but right now that’s not reality.
I think you'd be dussapointed.  Perez has a long history of being very solid in F1 against decent team mates.  Tsunoda would be a definite downgrade.
😂😂😂😂  At screaming on the radio?
There is one massive difference between Max and Yuki and why RB wouldn’t deal with it if they didn’t want to.
One person is Max Verstappen and the other person has the ego of Max Verstappen with the talent of Tsunoda.
I don't get it. If you were to ask anyone they would point at yuki for being the most explosively tempered driver in f1
If a pilot makes a mistake and crashes his plane while landing, i can still tell that he did a shit job. I don't need to be a pilot to tell.
i dont think its unfair at all. world class drivers perform immediately. lewis hamilton competed for the world championship and went equal with fucking alonso in his rookie season.   vettel scored points in his very first f1 race and won a race in a fucking toro rosso in his first full time season while not only outperforming his teammate but also the main red bull team.  max verstappen won the very first race he was put in the red bull and was really close to ricciardo at his peak and mind you, two years before that, verstappen was driving F3.   world class drivers perform immediately, they dont need 1-2 "warm up" seasons. If gasly had the potential to be anywhere close to verstappen, he would be shitting on ocon right now but he isnt.  and sure, you might say that those are some legendary drivers i pointed out there, but thats because red bull is the nr1 team, why would they not want the best driver in their line up?   red bull has always thrown drivers into the pool and see if they were able to learn to swim by themselves. drivers like vettel, ricciardo, verstappen, were able to do that. and those are signs of a world class driver. sure, its a brutal and scary situation but if somebody performs under those circumstances, you know 100% theyre destined for greatness. red bull has won every championship since 2010 that werent won by mercedes, theyre doing something right and they were right to stop believing in gasly and albon because those two are clearly not world class drivers. theyre midfield drivers at best and thats just not good enough for a red bull seat.
Sure, Gasly probably improved since he was at RB, but keep in mind that the benchmark is not him being a bit off pace, the benchmark is him crashing out or getting lapped.   And now, while obviously we can say he's a decent driver, he's showing that he's about on Ocons level. And still mistake-prone.  And we do know that when things are not going his way, he's not above throwing a hissy fit. That's not something a top team will be attracted to, especially with a driver who's generally supposed to be in a support role
Yeah - part of RBR hiring Perez was as a bit of a test. If he, this renowned solid driver was as bad, then maybe Albon and Gasly were fine.  An additional caveat is that by all accounts the 2021 RBR was *miles* more pleasant to drive.
They expected their young drivers to be as good as max while not receiving any of the help he had.  The car is literally purpos build for his driving style.
What you said is okay for someone who ends up at Alpine but not someone to get a seat in RBR. Perez is winning races and literally the second fastest man on track and even he doesn’t seem safe. He also brings the car home in one piece. Tsunoda is in his third season. If he had “it” we would’ve known two years ago.
He spent more or less the same time in torro rosso that verstappen did, but with a much more fleshed out junior career behind him. The time in torro rosso for him wasn't to learn how to drive, it was to just get used to the life of f1.   And what is this bs narrative that he was expected to be as good as verstappen? Literally no one expected that for any of verstappen's teammates since 2018. 2017 ricciardo was the last teammate who was expected to beat verstappen.  They however, were expected to show themselves to be worthy of a championship capable car. Ignoring Stroll, the only driver in a top car who might be comparable to albon and gasly is Carlos. While currently Carlos isn't definitely better than those two, I'd argue that two years ago he was looking like the best from the bunch of them. All other spots in top teams are filled by drivers clearly better than albon and gasly.   In the end they both ended up where they did because of what they showed in the RB. And that was an accurate assessment of their skills. Too good to not have a seat in f1, but not good enough for a championship contendor. Maybe towards the later stages of their career they could fit into a perez style role.
Gasly is a very talented driver, the only problem is that he wasn’t doing great at RB
Lando looks like he’s in elo hell, I’m sure he’d consider the offer if RB came knocking on his door.
I think at this point Red Bull would go for someone more like Lando. Friendly with Max, young and marketable etc.
The difference is that Checo spent most of his career at midfield teams. He’ll want to retire at a top one
Everyone thought Vettel was too loyal to leave Red Bull. Hamilton was too loyal to leave McLaren etc. And unlike Ferrari, Red Bull and McLaren were delivering titles.   Leclerc could bail if Ferrari can't rejoin the fight. Unfortunately for him, by the time he can, every seat will be a gamble with the new engine regulations.
They have Liam Lawson still under contract and racing in Super Formula this year. If he dominates that competition there could still be a path into the RB for him, or maybe AT first. Plus it's likely that if/when Checo leaves the team Horner will make a run at Lando or whichever other top veterans are available. But Yuki could be a solid backup option if none of those things pan out.
I wouldn't be surprised if Albon is reassessed. His recent drives have been fantastic.
This sounds as a more likely scenario, I think.
I have to agree. If anybody is a threat to Sergio currently id say its realistically either DR or Lando.
Sad noises for yuki
Not at all. Checo would retire with some dignity before going to AT.
Yes please
Checo Adultman
No need for a conspiracy, any team principal with half a brain cell will know that checo is absolutely doing what's required of him rn.   As long as he brings home the constructors title for RB and plays rear gunner for max (let's be real, he doesn't have the pace to match him unfortunately) it's all good.  Danny Ric's career has been going downhill while Checo is on an upward trend. Absolutely no reason to ruin a good setup by dragging in DR
His age is a huge deterrent as well. Checo was brought in because Red Bull had burnt through their junior drivers and needed to buy some time to stabilise their sister team. Their next driver would be a young driver who could potentially take over if/when Max retires.
They have tons and tons of data on how drivers compare to each other in the simulator and they know exactly what a car is capable of.   On track performance is really just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to these driver decisions
It’s a shame he went from a backmarker car to a car capable of fighting in the mid field. It would be great if he was in a 2020 Mercedes actually fighting Max.
Russell
I think it would have been the same thing, to be honest. They were just too good, you could tell that without looking at their teammates. It was clear they were outperforming their cars, regardless of what others were doing.
Yeah that's it /s
Iirc Tost was more interested in Schumacher at first, but Marko convinced him to give De Vries a chance instead.
Oh so we’re just ignoring the other two races then? Didn’t realize those didn’t count
Sad but true. He's been lucky until now to gain positions because of incidents. He's the guy who has been overtaken the most, and we have seen how he's trying so hard to defend his position.
Okay.
I don't think people think Checo is bad, the sentiment is more about how the amount of wins/podiums he amassed the last three seasons doesn't match his talent level.  Like he is likely to soon crack top 25 all time podium finishes for F1 drivers and he will continue to climb these ranks while he was literally out of F1 before Red Bull picked him up.
Exactly. Look back to the most recent consecutive championships before Max - all by Lewis and "wingman" Bottas. Look back to the early 00's, and you see it again with Schumi and Barrichello.
Except he's not. He has, on many occasions, failed to snatch victories when Max doesn't. Not finishing on the podium in that rocket of a car is inexcusable, he's lucky the red flag nullified the restart or he'd be what, 9th? Because he can't take right turns in Australia it seems. We all saw Max oass Lewis with 30kmh difference in DRS, Checo should have come P2 no excuses
Well he lost Red Bull the WCC in '21 for one
What race were you watching? 4 DRS zones for the RB to fly past people!
To be fair it isn't easy to overtake in Monza either. Spa is a much better example of a track easy to overtake.
I think you're ignoring that the circuit was changed and the straight line speed of the red bull is insane.  There are now 2 huge straights, did you not see verstappens overtake on Hamilton? That car could easily overtake the second fastest car on the day.  Perrez should have been able to fly past cars.  I also think you are ignoring that the only reason checo started p20 was that he dropped it on the third corner on the first lap of qualy.
You're exaggerating, last year Albert Park wasn't even in the bottom third of tracks ranked by number of overtakes.   Yes, that was good. Still not a great performance overall.
Yuki will have to start eating way more and train less, but there is a slight possibility
MEGA DOWNFORCE ON THIS ABSOLUTE UNIT, PORPOISING BE DAMNED.  AND IT’S BUMFUZZLED HOBGOBLIN FOR PROVISIONAL POLE!!!  BUMFUZZLED, DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY TO THE PEOPLE OF MIDDLE EARTH?!?
> Be me, 31 years old, no racing experience, 6’1”/250lbs of flabby meat. So you’re saying there’s a chance???  Holy shit, are you me?
At least someone gets it - you!  When I bring up how Yuki is looking so much better recently across the board all I get back from my mates is “he’s a hot headed little boy who doesn’t really work hard and crashes the cars”.  Like have you watched the same races I have? Dude is driving a tractor and making it look like mid field car, holding up much faster cars lap after lap.
[if there’s one thing women love, it’s a vascular man](https://youtu.be/FY4Rg2Vq9mE)
[damn Yuki okay](https://youtu.be/S9gzMAaZw8s)
What matters to them is the WDC and WCC. A second driver that allows them to win both is good enough.  Screen time in a race is for the minority of people who  watch races. The rest of the world reads the first pages of journals and magazines and the 30s night news showing the winner.
Rosberg Hamilton situation is not just having spectacle. It's make the employees tense too. Rosberg/Hamilton stopped talking each other.There is a reason every top driver duo fighting for a championship ended up badly and no one wants to bother with that anymore.
Did Merc get bored of that during the VB years?   They only let him go when he was unable to hold off Max
Is Ricciardo at his peak _now?_  And nobody knew back then how good the RB was going to be 4-5 years down the line
Exactly, so they can keep taking it slow. They have had this issue for a long time. That’s why Kvyat they let Kvyat come back when Ricciardo left and why Gasly was so long in F1. He would actually still drive for AT this year if Alpine didn’t buy out his contract because of the Vettel retirement
You're acting like Perez is sth special. driver who needs charity from Max to win sth. If not, he loses 0.4s per lap.
'confused Gunther noises'
I agree he isn’t ready to get into Red Bull. When I said the seat was his, I was meaning to say the AT seat is his for next season, I can see how what I said wasn’t clear though.   If he keeps performing as he has to start the season, the AT seat is his for the next season. You are 100% right the RB is an entirely different beast.
He’s been offered drives when they were at the front and still declined.
I agree with this. However, I also can't help but ask at what point do RB see Lando as something other than the chosen one? I mean I get that he's held back at this point. But OTOH at some point doesn't he have to at least meet expectations, however mid, if not exceed them?
In this hypothetical scenario, it would be Yuki becoming the number 2. If he goes to Red Bull and does good but doesn't demonstrate championship level pace, then yeah, get someone like Lando to lead. It'd just depend if Yuki is willing to stick with being a number 2 driver or if he'll bail for number 1 driver status at another team.  So you could have Yuki as the number 1 driver, whoever as a number 2, or you could have Yuki as the number 2 and have Norris, Leclerc, etc be the number 1 driver. It really just depends on how it goes.
Fuck, I thought it was 2026. That's my bad
anyone who? who watches all the onboards and radios? he honestly hasn't been any more fiesty than at least half the field since last season.
yes, and when I ask for examples as above, no one can point to any. the commentators have fooled you all and you believed without even thinking.
Yeah 😂. I should prefaced my message that Ok it’s just my opinion. But it’s certainly shared by others. Don’t think Horner will tolerate for one second his reluctance and apathy to training, or his outbursts.  And he certainly hasn’t done enough drive wise to warrant a red bull seat.
He was 9-13 qualifying to Gasly last year, rookie year was pretty much a sweep. Ocon and Alonso were pretty close and Gasly hasn't shown he's inferior to Ocon.   There's plenty of info on how Yuki is putting his head down to work, whether or not it's his training or effort invested in driving. No it's definitely not the last 3 races. There's no argument on seat risk but you can't scoff at "improved ethic and consistency" without a better argument.
> i dont think its unfair at all. world class drivers perform immediately. lewis hamilton competed for the world championship and went equal with fucking alonso in his rookie season.   Perhaps Yuki is both good enough to be in consideration for Red Bull's second seat and also not as good as Lewis Hamilton?
While I agree that Gasly and Albon are unlikely to be WDC, Hamilton isn't a fair comparison because when he joined he'd already been able to do a great deal more test miles than rookies get these days. Max is the only driver in recent history since testing rules changed to have come in and make an almost instant impact, and even he took a good season to become more complete as a driver. And when the call up to RB came, he was ready. If ~~Barca~~ Barcelona 2016 was his 5th race for real, I don't think he would've won it.  Edit: expanded Barca to Barcelona for proper usage.
no way u tried comparing gasly and yuki to three generational talents considered to be the in the greatest tier.
I mean tbf you're not looking to put a world class driver in the seat next to Verstappen, you're looking for a nice complement to him
> i dont think its unfair at all. world class drivers perform immediately. lewis hamilton competed for the world championship and went equal with fucking alonso in his rookie season. >  >   I don't disagree at all, but when Lewis debuted he had an entire seasons worth of practice under his belt.  Rookies simply do not have the time in the car to perform like Lewis had. I think having this belief that they will be dominating from day one is a little misplaced.
So can KMag have the RB seat?  He got 2nd his first race 🙂
I'd still say it's unfair as it's totally different entering F1 now vs then. Vettel, Ricciardo, Hamilton, I think even Verstappen maybe, were of an era where you could do unlimited testing so rookies back then had more mileage under their belt before their first race than current rookies do after a season.  Drivers like Yuki and Piastri had/have to get familiar with the car *during* the season on top of trying to make a name for themselves as opposed to learning their machine during endless preseason testing and entering their first race with a comfortable base to build off of. That's why I find it highly unlikely that whoever the next Hamilton or Verstappen tier driver is will be able to blitz the field as a rookie. Will probably take half a season at least.
In fairness, I think that Red Bull was a miserable car to drive. Red Bull have basically admitted as much.
>world class drivers perform immediately  At the beginning of the last season, Hamilton was struggling and Russell was consistently performing well.
>vettel scored points in his very first f1 race and won a race in a fucking toro rosso  Gasly won in an Alpha Tauri.
This is only somewhat true. They all performed immediately, but they all had way more experience through junior series and driver tests. Even max wasn't the same level he is now and there where still people who doubted him for some questionable moves
> i dont think its unfair at all. world class drivers perform immediately.  There are like 5 of those currently on the grid. How the hell is that fair? The guys who perform immediately are the exception, not the norm.
So....Hulkenberg to Red Bull?
Agreed, with the caveat that the Toro Rosso in Italy 2008 was somehow the strongest car that weekend. Anyway, kudos to Vettel for delivering.
Just point out that Hamilton and Vettel both started in F1 before the ban on testing in 2009. They both got opportunities to get accustomed to F1 cars before their debut.   Vettel beating the RB team in 08 is also because TR basically used the previous years RB and Redbull actually declined that year so TR had a stronger car lol.   Max is a generational prodigy fueled by parental abuse... He's the exception not the rule.
Maybe comparing anyone to one of the greatest drivers to ever step on the track is wild. Red Bull being the best team has nothing to do with it. You simply cannot expect anyone to compete with Hamilton’s career. Not every successful driver is instantly successful.
I agree with a lot of what you said, except the point about Gasly shitting on Ocon. Ocon was pretty close to Alonso the past two seasons, and while I’d ultimately say Alonso was the stronger driver Ocon managed to finish ahead of him last year and seven points behind him the year before. We haven’t seen Gasly at Alpine long enough to draw any conclusions about who’s the stronger driver in the pairing, but it wouldn’t be unrealistic to see Alonso stacking up similarly to how Gasly is for the first three races in a season. Unless you consider Alonso to be “nowhere close to Verstappen” I don’t think Gasly would need to be stomping him as much as you suggest to be considered a great driver.   Ultimately I think Ocon and Gasly are a bit of an unknown factor at the moment. If Alonso is as good as he ever was, as some people say, then surely Gasly and Ocon might be there or thereabouts. Gasly is five years out from his Red Bull stint now. That’s a long time to develop as a driver. We don’t really know how fast Yuki is, but I definitely think he has potential being able to match Gasly in his second year while Gasly was in his seventh. Realistically I don’t think Alonso is as good as ever, his performance relative to Stroll is about the gap Vettel had to him, and Vettel certainly wasn’t in peak form. I think if you put Ocon or Gasly in a top tier car they’d be a Sainz level driver, fast enough to disrupt the very best every now and then but lacking the consistency or special something to be a Verstappen/Hamilton/Leclerc. But again at the end of the day until they are in a top car it’s up in the air.
Red Bull don’t want a world class driver in their second seat.
So what's the answer then lol- let's not act like Perez has looked like a top 6 driver at Red bull. Does he need a change? He lucked into the Red Bull seat when Red bull was on the upswing and become competitive- Albon and Gasly did not.   Some people just peak earlier, some people need time to grow into a champion. I know it looks like it but Max & Seb weren't world champions overnight. They didn't hop into a F1 car with absolutely no experience as drivers. Hell when they were younger, the rest of the grid literally said you have to race Max different than any other driver. He was horribly inexperienced and crashed all the time with rookie mistakes.   Also let's be real here, Danny Ric hasn't looked good in years- in all honesty as much as I love him he's looked horrible for a long time now. He didn't just become shit overnight, he was just more comfortable with the Red bull car.  It's all about situations and timings.  Red bull is doing something right, the same thing Mercedes was: They have the best car by a longshot. Also they don't have Ferrari strategy. Literally the only two things you need for a championship.
Max won his first race with redbull ONLY due to the mercedes crashing into each other. That win is overrated.
And Red Bull won the world driver championship in three different eras
I don't think it's that straight forward. There are all kinds of driver development curves. Of course there are some that hit the ground running but that also depends on your prior experience and car/ driving style compatibility and having the backing to get the right machinery.   There definitely is such a thing as taking some time to bring out the best and 1-2  seasons before your first race win provided you get the right machinery is not that unusual. Rosberg took 5 seasons to register a win.  The drivers you mention are exceptions and not the norm and our sport has a bias towards quick results versus nurturing talent and bringing out late bloomers
Well said.
Lots of world class drivers performing immediately does not mean every single one is going to be that way. My favorite example is Joseph Newgarden, who looked bad-to-okay in his first couple years in Indycar. He didn't show his ability to win races until 3-4 years into his career.   Not saying Yuki is WDC caliber, just that the logic that a world-class driver HAS to show you what they have immediately is flawed
Yes very well said.  If you want to be considered for a top team then you need to show you are one of the best drivers right away.  The only other way into a top team is the Perez or Barachello route of being a consistent veteran who can support a title favourite and help the team win the constructors.
> i dont think its unfair at all. world class drivers perform immediately. lewis hamilton competed for the world championship and went equal with fucking alonso in his rookie season.  Not every driver has to be a 'one a decade' standard. It's okay for most drivers to not be at that level.
And Alonso was beaten by fucking Tarso Marques, and had to sit put a year of F1.  Hakkinen looked like a mediocre driver.  Other than Verstappen all the other examples you gave were of drivers with ten times the experience of Yuki when they debuted, even in F1 cars so those aren't fair comparisons. Do I think Yuki will become a 7 time world champion? Of course not, but if keeps on this form he can become a good and successful driver.
Even though you are making a strong point I really don't like reading this. I could come up with a bunch more examples. Button, Jacques or Kimi come to mind.
No world class driver would want to go to Red Bull just to play second fiddle to Max either.  There's a reason DR left them in the first place.  I can't see drivers like LeClerc, Norris, Russell being interested in going there.  So "world class" is off the cards, someone like Bottas/Barrichello type driver that is ideally what Red Bull would like.
I mean formula 1 always has an element of luck, sometimes the odds are in your favour.
> vettel scored points in his very first f1 race and won a race in a fucking toro rosso in his first full time season while not only outperforming his teammate but also the main red bull team.  The Toro Rosso was better than the RB that year because it had the Ferrari engine instead of the Renault
Lots of people act like if you’re not Verstappen you’re trash or something. I don’t think they realize that most drivers really aren't ready until mid twenties and then dont really peak until mid/late twenties.   Gasly has shown hes a F1 caliber driver and will have a good career. Yuki is developing as he should and hopefully in 2 years gets a  shot.
They failed to realise what Checo did in time, stop copying Max's setup.
Apparently that was always RBR's worry: they didn't trust that he'd be as good in RBR as he was at AT. Being Verstappen's teammate, you fundamentally need to accept you're Goose to his Maverick.
Uh yes it does. I don’t hate Red Bull as a team btw
Elo? Surely not Electric Light Orchestra. Sorry, what does that mean/stand for?
He already turned them down once
I don't think the McLaren is as bad as it seems. Look at the improvements to australia, and now there's a bit of time to review telemetry.  Give them some time, they'll show up.
Consider - sure. Whether he'd actually go there I'm not convinced.  As long as Max is there, I don't think the other seat at RB is as attractive as people think it is. With Max in the team, as long as they have a competitive car, he will be the one winning championships. Drivers surely are aware that going there there carries strong likelihood that they will be relegating themselves to a #2 role. They are more likely to win titles by being a #1 driver in a team that maybe eventually builds a better car  Even Alonso, who's probably the guy with the most self-confidence on the grid, said he wouldn't want to go join Max in the Red Bull
Free Lando!  Imagine a Max/Lando RB lineup. That would make for great viewing. Finally see what the boy can do.
Or Lando is just overrated 😐
I mean haven’t they tried like multiple times to get him? Obviously the situation at mclaren changed a lot, though
That friendliness would drop in a heartbeat if they were competing as teammates.
Is Lando marketable? Genuine question because he doesn't look like it to me but I might not be in the right market.
I think Sainz is probably my bet on next RB drifer
My guess is Iwasa, or Maloney will be the next rb driver if it's not yuki.
Honestly expecting this, he can retire with a bunch of race wins (more than chuck atm) or go to a backmarker
yeah people are framing it like red bull brought him in to position to replace checo. he’s an insurance policy, nothing more.
Issue is that he hasn't shown that he can play rear gunner for Max. Most races when there was another team with a competitive car he looked lost.  The races that made him look good last year as a rear gunner where when he was fighting Ferrari and Merc, but on those weekends RB18 was so fast they shouldn't have been even close to him and Max was in the next galaxy.  And I'm not saying Danny Ric would be any better, think it would be a humiliating way to a career to get decimated by Max.
> On track performance is really just the tip of the iceberg  Definitely more than the tip, more like the base. Overtaking and defending is super important and can't really be done in sims. Bottas is great pushing in the front and he does great in qualy, but he is not an amazing overtaker or defender. I would even say borderline bad at those. It cost him a lot of points in Mercedes.
Gonna have to hard disagree with that, on track performance is incredibly important, the teams just have more ways to measure on track performance other than simply how the driver finished.
(X)  How would you tell they were outperforming their cars though?  Even the fact that they reached q3 a few times was surprising only because 1) their teammates were very far from them, and 2) people still thought of those teams as hopeless backmarkers seconds off the pace, when they were clearly progressing.   If both had reached q3 together, or if everyone expected williams/sauber to be able to reach q3 a few times it'd hardly be seen as something that extraordinary. It's similar to how many people were congratulating de vries for a great drive last year despite doing no more than what was expected in that car, simply because Latifi struggled and "williams=bad" mindset stuck.
Which was also probably influenced by Max asking De Vries to ask Dr Marko ( probably even put in a good word for his fellow countrymen) and you know Dr Marko would probably do it to keep max happy
And I would argue that Checo is an even better number 2 (from the team's perspective) than either Valtteri or Rubens.  My impression of Bottas is that he had genuine WDC aspirations. I'm admittedly not the most knowledgeable about the Schumacher era, but I'm generally under the impression that Barichello wanted it quite a bit as well.  Checo, on the other hand, has never struck me as really giving a shit about the WDC. I think he absolutely wants to win races, but yeah. From RB's perspective, that's great. Checo gets what he wants, RB gets what they want.
Eh, you've to remember that in '21, Bottas was the better 2nd driver, especially when it came to hauling points consistently which helped Merc clinch the WCC.  Checo was just there when it mattered, coming home to a P1 in Baku, and his defensive displays in Turkey & Bahrain against Lewis.  Bottas ranks above Checo when it comes to overall performance.  However in the grand scheme of things, wouldn't say Checo's stint in RBR has been exactly subpar, although it could've been better.
Lmao. I wanna see fat Yuki wiggle his way into the car like a pudgy groundhog now.
“Yeah I just wanna thank Sauron my lord and savior for giving me a fast car, shoutout to my sponsors Saruman’s Sandwich Shop and Balrog Bowling Supplies for their continued support, and a big thank you to Gollum for crashing out Leclerc at Turn 1 during Q1”
his team pricipal and Marko know that and it's what matters the most. pseudo pundits don't decide who will be driving in RB or any other team.
And they definitely won't keep Checo for that long. He's probably on his final contract right now. Someone younger and more promising will definitely be open by the end of 2024.
No, you’re not allowed to have nuance and critical thought, this is a Reddit thread.
It’s also much harder for rookies to step in right away now with the limits on testing. By the time Lewis had his first race he’d already done thousands of km in the MP4-22.
Get out of here with your balanced opinion.  Your kind isn't welcome in these parts
not to mention lewis had the advantage of unlimited testing time back then, clocking more than 7000 kilometers, which is easily more than 1000 laps before his first GP
Sign of the times, everything is black and white and polarized.  Civil thought is dead 🫡
Yea but the two ways you get a seat in a top team are being one of the best drivers on the grid. Or being a consistent veteran who can support the title contender and win the constructors. Yuki is neither.
Leclerc was fantastic after 4/5 races in his rookie season
Dont wanna shit on hamiltons performance but the whole team and ron dennis wanted him to succeed i domt think alonso had the best treatment at mclaren.
Yea.. testing miles.. that’s what made the difference.
https://yourfriendsinbarcelona.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/barcelona_barna3.jpg?w=640
This is a dumb detail but "Barça" refers to the FC Barcelona team specifically, not the city of Barcelona. "Barna" is how the people living there refer to the city when they don't feel like saying the entire name.
youre still AT LEAST looking for an upper midfield driver like perez, bottas or hulk. gasly and albon partly failed to even make Q3 while somebody like bottas has almost always been there to fuck up ferraris strategies and chances to win. thereve been a lot more on track battles between bottas and vettel in 2017/18 than between vettel and hamilton because bottas was often used strategically against vettel. however you need a certain speed to even get into such position. now i realize the red bull albon and gasly drove werent as fast as a merc but gasly and albon could never even once be used strategically for verstappen, they were simply too far away.
didnt do too much after that though.
Verstappen definitely came in after the testing ban, not sure about Danny
The perfect example for this is Josef Newgarden, who joined Indycar after they lowered team practice amounts. It took him 3 years to show he was championship caliber because he had to learn on-track
Albon: go play Call of Duty, put the sensitivity to max, and see how you get on.
Gasly won out of circumstance,  took advantage of the chaos   Vettel put a TR on pole....and won the race
Do you really think they are the same?
on merit like vettel or by cheer luck?
Alonso, Hamilton, Verstappen and... LeClerc maybe?  But yeah, performing immediately is not a requisite to be a tier 1 driver - it's not how humans work. Our skill doesn't progress linearly, but rather with bumps and plains. As you practice something, there's times where something new clicks in your brain and the next few times you do it, you improve massively. Other times, your brain can't find new paths to develop, and you stagnate a bit - each practice helps you refine your skill, but doesn't add anything new.  There's nothing stopping any driver on the grid from suddenly starting to improve at a fast rate, and going from mediocre (on F1 terms) to tier 1. Conversely, there's been drivers that had been proving themselves like crazy in their early years but eventually stagnated and never reached the peak everyone expected them to reach. Ricciardo is a good example of this - people thought that by now he'd be a one or two time champion.  We just don't know if Gasly, or Albon, or even Sainz or Perez will vanish into oblivion in 5 years, or if they'll have an impressive season out of the blue and will be put in a seat that can contend for the title.
Shouldn't Red Bull aim to have a Top 5 driver as their #2? They are the best team in the world by miles right now. Their #1 should be the best (check) and their #2 should be just about Top 5.
Gasly still didn't perform after 6 months..
Actualy that would be awesome!
It was slower than the McLaren, Ferrari and possibly Bmw. So 3rd/4th quickest.
I don’t think it’s fair to say that TR had the stronger car in ‘08. Bourdais finished the season 17th in driver standings while Vettel was 8th. That delta is huge.
Due to having several great young talents like Verstappen, Leclerc, Norris, Russell at once, people suddenly act like you have to be fighting for the title at 22 or you are a bust.  Racing isn't figure skating. Age matters to an extent, but the window is much bigger. As you say, most drivers don't hit their peak until their mid to late 20s. People give up on talents way too quickly nowadays.
There's a big big difference in F1 caliber and Red Bull caliber. Just because you belong in F1 does not mean you belong at a top team, especially a team like RB.
> Lots of people act like if you’re not Verstappen you’re trash or something. I don’t think they realize that most drivers really aren't ready until mid twenties and then dont really peak until mid/late twenties.   It's funny that you see this in every sport. In football, there's a mentality now that if a rookie QB isn't instantly amazing, they're garbage and it's time to replace them.
Also, driving Max’s car is just hard.
Also the RB cars Albon and Gasly drove were worse than RB16B, 18, and now 19.
It’s a skill ranking system that originated from chess I think but is also used in some games.   Elo hell is when you’re stuck in a rank with people far below your skill. This happens in team games where your teammates just drag you down.
Elo is a chess ranking/matchmaking system. The term Elo hell comes mostly from league of legends as in its first few seasons it used the elo system, but because it was a team based game the term mainly came from obviously better players losing because their teammates are worse
It’s a fake thing people that aren’t as good at video games as they think they are tell themselves.   Basically they blame their teammates for every loss and tell themselves that it’s not their fault.
I was thinking the same
Because he had faith in McLaren, I doubt he has any now.
That was more strategy & luck than it was car performance though. They kept not pitting and taking free positions all the way up to the red flag.
I mean they landed in the points after EIGHT dnfs, pretty bad race to judge it on.
Yeah if you wanna beat max you’d want to have a better car and not the same car. I don’t think any of the top drivers that want a title would be interested in RB while he’s there. It’ll only be drivers happy with winning a race every now and then and grabbing a load of podiums.
Lando wins the championship, ruins his friendship with Max, immediately retires and becomes a Monaco-based YouTuber. It's all coming together.
Hugely. Not to me, and I guess not you either. But to a younger generation of extremely online people who enjoy twitch, fashion, sim racing and things like that he has a big market. And let's be honest, Max is about the least charismatic person on the planet and being a successful driver at RB was enough to build numerous marketing campaigns around. He's even trying to launch a clothing line, which would presumably just be RB polos with his logo monogrammed on them, so I'm sure that Red Bull of all companies could market Lando.
I found F1 because of Lando on twitch. Not sure if I love or hate him for it but here I am waking up at 2am to watch a race
Remember when he got Tom Holland to come to a race because his teenage girl fans said they look alike? Yes, yes he is marketable
20,000 people watched him build an IKEA shelf on Twitch yesterday evening.  Yes, he is incredibly marketable.
Behind DR he might be the most marketable F1 driver…
He is very personable. It's just that this season's news cycle is dominated by how much of a shit can that car is... But last season I'd say Lando enjoyed, arguably, more popularity than damn near the whole grid - he's very big with the younger generation.
Huuuugely. The guy is a walking meme and the (young) girls LOVE HIM
Immensely, he has a huge millennial and Gen Z following, is a gamer and streamer, runs an esports organization that he markets on his helmets and other areas, and has a big social presence that connects him well with his core fan base.  He’s probably up there with Max, Lewis, and DR, tbh.
I could see either case really.   On one hand his F1 career was already almost over without him having won a race.   Then Sakhir happens, he gets the RB seat and has 2 years getting some more wins under his belt.   So good spot to retire, once the RB seat will be filled with someone else.  On the other hand, while he is the clear no.2 driver for RB, he is also an F1 driver and surely has quite the ego. Seeing that he CAN win races once he finally gets a good car, it is also pretty obvious that he is currently really giving his all to actually fight Max. (whether that will happen or not is not the question here. The point is that EVERY F1 driver thinks of themselves that they're the best and could become if only the conditions are right.) So I could also see him having developed a hunger now, and wanting to carry on even after RB.  That said, it's tough to imagine any of the top teams actually going for Checo. While I rate him solidly, at the moment his performance is nothing spectacular/out of the ordinary, given that he also has a _really_ good car, and there's enough great drivers on the grid for the top seats to quickly fill up. And Should RB kick him and his best option is a team that is on the level Alpine is currently at for example, he oughta know that he won't make it back to the top, I think.   Given his age, I do think RB is Checo's best and only chance to ever get a WDC, sucks for him that his opponent isn't a weaker driver.
I don't think that's super fair. Last year it was commonly Max - Charles - Checo which is perfectly fine from RBs perspective as that will get you the WCC comfortably. If Mercedes ups their pace then Checo will struggle but even that isn't really an indictment on him...Mercedes has two top tier elite drivers and arguably 2 of the 3 best drivers in the sport.
And Zhou looks like a world beater this year next to him.
I guess I could have worded it differently. Obviously on track performance is the most important thing in the sport.   I’m just trying to say that teams have a much clearer picture than fans do when making these decisions
The specific areas where a car is doing well or doing wrong can be assessed regardless. That’s why not only drivers, but also technical experts can tell when a car has a specific issue that will then require its drivers to compensate by using the best of their skills. Just think how much of Alonso’s prestige comes from him being able to drive basically whatever car you throw at him, not from crushing his teammates.
If that was true then Nico Hulkenberg would have sat in the 2nd Redbull since 2021.
There was the thing about the "red bull is not a one car team anymore" after Jeddah, so he's not completely without aspiration. But he doesn't strike me as one to cause trouble once he's an obvious second on points. I think he'll just want to win races when he deserves it without having to hand over to Max everything. If they give him that I think he can be happy with how his career panned out - maybe no champion, but definitely a well regarded driver who on his day could swing it with the best, perhaps like David Coulthard.
Ideally you want your no 2 to routinely keep the no 1 on his toes and occasionally outperforms him here and there on merit. Perez is yet to do that so I would actually rate Barrichello and Bottas as better no 2.   And Perez absolutely does have WDC aspirations. One of his first interviews as a RB driver was how he believes he could challenge if given the right car.
Rounder surface, reduces drag
I don't think Alonso will leave Aston Martin.
When he learned what F1 cars like for setup, he was amazing to watch. Sometimes best of the rest with that Alfa that didn't belong there often
*Very* different teammate, although the point does stand indeed that Leclerc is probably the best driver other than Verstappen/Hamilton. I don't think anyone sees Albon or Gasly that way.
Yeah, Lewis is an amazing driver, but hadn't it been for the whole team working on his behalf, Fernando would have probably eaten both him and Kimi alive that season.  They decided Lewis had to be champion in rookie season and messed things up by signing Fernando. They would have had a much better chance by keeping Pedro De La Rosa instead because the winner of the two last WDC would never agree to such a deal...
Sure Yuki is no Lewis but experience does make a significant difference in F1. I doubt he performs as well as he did then with the way rookies have to get their driving time now.
Yea... Nothing to do with him being one of the most talented drivers of all time...
Noted!
Not dumb at all, I appreciate being educated
Interesting. The city was founded by Hamilcar Barca, father of Hannibal Barca.
Imo if you put Checo in that 2020 RB, he doesn't do that much better than Albon. He got 3 more podiums than Albon in a WDC car vs a car that was over 100 points off the WDC and, while I think he's a strong wheel to wheel racer, he's not got the overall pace and makes lots of mistakes for an experienced racer especially in qualifying
> gasly and albon partly failed to even make Q3 while somebody like bottas has almost always been there to fuck up ferraris strategies and chances to win.  I think this is what matters the most to Horner and Marko
They weren't planning for an eventual Verstappen retirement in 2019 lmao
Pole against Max in Brazil.
Gotta love how people give raw stats without any context as if that proved anything. I'm sure these people look at a chart of drivers by # of wins and decide that is the exact order of best to worst.
Same goes for Verstappen. He was lucky front drivers wiped eachother out.
If they want one, the best way to do that is to sign a known commodity, which they have tried to do. Doing otherwise and expecting the same result is setting yourself up for disappointment because elevating an unknown into a seat is going to be underwhelming 75% of the time unless you're a Max or Lewis or Michael-caliber driver. Those guys don't just grow on trees. But you can develop a Gasly or Albon or Tsunoda into a Perez or Bottas. They need time to grow though, and RBR did not give it to them.
Over the season RB was quicker and better then STR.  You have to keep in mind that yes, from round 6 onwards they had the same chassis and an engine with more HP (although behind in other areas like drivability, it was also a 2007 spec engine that also was put into a chassis made for a Renault engine) but it took until around round 10 for them to actually understand the new car, and before Monaco they had a backmarker car.  Webber and Couldthard had to cling on to something though, a 20 year old rookie beating them was quite embarassing.
And then there’s Alonso, who instead of having a peak, he has a freaking mesin or plateau
Age matters in that you want to get in on young talents when they're young so that you have first dibs on keeping them when they get older.  Most people just want to skip right to the get older part right away
People used to be considered young world champs if they were under 28-30. For example, generational talents (or close to that) such as Häkkinen, Prost, Nico Rosberg or Jackie Stewart were 30 or older when they got their title, Hunt, Piquet, Clark, Button were 29, hell Manssell had to almost tutn 40 to finally get one.      Drivers like Lewis, Fernando, Seb, Max for titles and Lando, George and Charles for being considered good enough are very much exceptions to that rule. Sure, this could be a trend towards younger peaks, but it could also be an exceptional crop of drivers that are already ready for challenge very young.
I agree people are too harsh. Specifically, I feel like more older good midfield drivers deserve more chances. Perez was great for Red Bull, and now Hulkenberg is doing fantastic for Haas. Guys like them deserve more than being replaced by a mildly exciting rookie.  But I'm also not sure which talents have been given up on too early? Maybe Hulk for a top team? Ricciardo was horrible in McLaren and deserved the boot. In terms of younger drivers, Latifi was bad, Mick was not good enough and not progressing enough, but I also blame Haas. Vandoorne maybe got short-changed by being up against Alonso, which is not dissimilar to Gasly and Albon vs Verstappen.   There are only 20 drivers in F1, and to give someone a chance at all, means you have to give up on someone else.
Sure, but they looked bad as their teammates was challenging for wins and they were struggling to stay 6th
It’s also usually just bad players huffing copium so they don’t have to examine their own mistakes.
Oh, okay! Thank you very much!
Elo is a very real ranking in Chess though.  It's team games where Elo hell becomes more fictional
3 races in and we still haven't seen an incident free weekend to get a representative sense of what the McLaren is actually capable of.   Bahrain was a technical disaster for both cars, a complete wash, but Lando qualified P11 despite the team having already acknowledged that they botched the initial concept and stopped development in favour of a B-spec chassis.  Jeddah Lando made an error in qualifying and then both cars had lap 1 damage that ruined their race before it even started.  Australia they were slow in qualifying but appeared to have at least adequate race pace, but the interruptions pushed them further up the grid and we have no way of knowing what would have happened without them.  So we really won't know until Baku (at the earliest) what this MCL60 is really like.
Lando was only 2,5 tenths slower than Checo on race pace though, that's really good.
They were already ahead of the dnfs
Lando and Max didn't grow up competing though did they? A better analog would be Max and Charles.
I don’t think Lando has enough ties to Monaco for that. He would probably become a Bristol-based twitch streamer
Nico is that you?
Great insight, thanks. I know that he has quite a big twitch and youtube presence but it always seemed a bit over the top for me but that's fine.
Max is funny as hell wym least charismatic person on the planet
And people even kept watching his empty chair when he went out to get some groceries!   I agree, he is very marketable and with his Quadrant thing (which is a group of some YouTubers/streamers, but also has a clothing line and also has some esports teams so idk what's even happening there) he is getting a pretty big, young fanbase.
I think it’s lewis, max, DR, charles and lando. In that order. Charles because Ferrari and he looks like a Disney prince.
Gen Z yes, but wouldn't say he has a huge millennial following
He probably wouldn’t have gotten the drive if it was a weaker driver. Max has dominated every team mate since ricciardo, and he has truly come into its own as a driver. If he was weaker I feel like redbull would have gone for a stronger driver than checo, and I mean no disrespect, I root for checo every weekend.
He can win any race where the only guy with a car that compete has issues.
Top teams are looking for the next Verstappen and seeing Perez getting thoroughly outraced by Max isn’t gonna solidify the feeling he is their next WDC.
I'm more worried about races like Paul Ricard 2021 where it's a full 2v2 or 2v1 strategy battle with closely matched cars. And he did perform great that race, so if he could replicate that kind of performance more often he would be a perfect 2nd driver.  I really hope Merc steps it up this year and going into next year and we see Max vs Lewis and Max vs Russell in closely matched cars.
Yeah if this keeps up Bottas is gonna get the sack. Same for KMag too.
DC is a perfect comparison, honestly. I think DC is one of the most highly regarded F1 drivers to never be WDC - I personally consider him a legend, anyway.  I could see that being Checo's legacy as well, fifteen or twenty years from now: one of the greatest who never managed to nab a WDC. That's probably where Bottas is heading, too.  And honestly, dude, what a legacy. Most F1 drivers would kill for that kind of record.
That's fair. I just think, when you're number 2 to Max Verstappen, it's a pretty tall order to be able to really compete on his level and push him. No matter who you are.
He made Marcus Ericsson look like a random backmarker half paydriver.
Point to the exact point where I didn't say Hamilton is a talented driver. I said it's an unfair comparison referring to their starting points as a rookie. Hamilton had more testing, that's an undisputable fact. And he nailed it out of the gate in Melbourne 07
Nope. The origins of both Barcelona and its name are unknown. There's a legend that says that Hamilcar Barca founded it and named it after his family name (Barcino, from Barca); but there's zero historical evidence confirming or denying that legend.
Absolutely. But people want to ignore that. It's really hard to say who's best from checo, gasly or Albon. Checo simply had the most experience when he joined the team.
yeah  despite some inconsistency   checo has his own things that makes him valuable in a #2 RB over say a gasly.   in the clutch moments, he has excellent racecraft, strategy and defense.   lets not forget he basically got max his 2021 title by going toe to toe with hamilton for 2-3 laps   checos also really great at lighting a fire under his own ass when he screws up quali.   he’s a specialist in street tracks which is at least adds some diversity of strengths to the team instead of just being good where max is already razor sharp
He did finish 3 spots ahead of Albon in 2020 while driving for Racing Point. My guess is if Checo joined RB in 2020 he probably does a little bit better than he did with Racing Point that year but he'd still likely finish 4th with a significant point gap between the merc drivers, Verstappen and him. But he would probably outperform Albon by a wider margin than he did with Racing Point in 2020
Getting destroyed by Hulk who has been out of f1 for years.
Dude Verstappen won 30+ races after that race and more than 60% of them on pure pace
>If they want one, the best way to do that is to sign a known commodity, which they have tried to do.   It worked, so maybe they should just keep doing it. That doesn't help Tsunoda's case.
El Plateau
Man’s peak is T H I C C
Still World class 18 years after his first title. That is nuts.
Hell they were struggling to not get lapped.
Its not usually this, its always this.
Oh yeah, I misread the comment.  ELO is definitely a real rating system.  ELO Hell is the thing I was referring to that people who overestimate their ability commonly claim they are stuck in.
No way he's from Bristol? Never striked me that he would be from around here
ha!
Now *that* is funny
Unbelievable sights Indescribable feeling Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling Through an endless Ferrari nightmare A WHOLE NEW WOOOOORLD…
objectively his stock is higher than DR.
Max himself isn't marketable, his trophies are.
Nah that's underselling him.  In my mind there's a bunch of drivers who are obviously better than Perez! Still I wouldn't rate him at the bottom. Probably somewhere around the middle of the grid. From where I stand his most obvious weaknesses lie in One lap pace, consistent race starts and the agressiveness/hunger that a Charles or Max have.  And yeah that makes him look weak sometimes! But on the other hand you have to realize that he is pretty good during races. His tyre management could be argued to be among the best on the grid and even in racing point we saw that he can do really well when in the midfield. Now at the top of the field he is going against  some actual legends. Hamilton, Max, Alonso and even Russell or Charles are of an insane caliber.  But is he actually shitting the bed there?! Fuck no. He is holding on. He has a strong car, no question. And he doesn't outright demolish the legends he's going against (pikachu.jpg). But then you see some of the races where he pulls an absolutely solid job all weekend. You see his strength on street circuits and you see the types of overtakes he makes.  Yeah, all in all I think people just like to bash on perez for no reason. Is he in the top 5 drivers on the grid? I wouldn't say so. Is he in the bottom 5? no way.  Where you rate him is up to you, but anyone saying he is outright shit is not paying attention to the sport if you ask me.
Yes exactly, that's why I believe RB is his only chance. Is it likely he will beat Max over a season? haha no. Sadly not. But it's the only chance he has got, imo.
Did we watch the same Paul Ricard race? He was apalling in battles in this race, defo not his best drive
Bottas had a great drive to get points in Bahrain, had damage lap 1 in SA (no fault of his), and had engine issues for the majority of Australia. He’s fine.
The same can be said for Schumacher and Hamilton yet their no 2s were able to push them.
The same Ericsson who wasn't far from Kobayashi, tied with Nasr and was on equal pace as Wehrlein who everybody was crying he didn't have a seat. Charles came in and booted Marcus out of F1 even though they became good friends lol
You didn't but you could give Lewis the same testing miles as any current driver and he would still be clearly better.
I said "one of" numnuts... And I would still argue it's Senna. If he had half of Schumacher and Hamilton's drive and committment he would have twice as many titles easily.
Yes but that experience is why he is best. Consistency comes from experience. Which wins constructors championships.
I would say overall Checo isn't inconsistent at all.  Certainly more consistent than every driver between him and Riciardo.
I know. Just making a point about luck in F1.
I was trying to be charitable, but yeah
He's from Bristol? Quick! Give him some heroin!
His dad is one of the top 5 richest people in Bristol too
You never know what gonna happen though. On pace he isn’t gonna win, the odd race maybe but Max is almost robot like consistent especially when the pressure is on. But if the RBR car stays the clear best his worst position would be second and if Max has a few dnf’s the title isn’t that far away.
He was deacent especially compared to his other performances in 2021. And while he wasn't great in battles he did have enough pace to have impact on the race because RB could have him go long and beat Merc on strategy.
He just sucks at low grip changing surfaces (especially rain) which happened in Australia. Always been a weakness of his
He didn't have engine issues the whole weekend.
Didn't he lose them the WCC in 21 and lose 2nd in the WDC in 22?
They lost the constructor's in 21. And almost lost WDC. If Checo was better that year they would have won both easily.   Its possible Albon or Gasly would have done better we will never know. The car was way easier to drive than what either of them dealt with and Albon gave a lot of input into the development. Its all speculation but I don't think its unreasonable to say Albon would have had at least a similar year to Checo in 21.
I also don't believe elo hell is real, but I still think it's funny and use it to humorously joke about a specific person's situation. With that said I 100% agree lando is in elo hell lmao
Are we talking about the same race? He finished 4th behind the 2 mercs

Massa had Villeneuve, Schumacher, Räikkönen and Alonso. That's 11 championships. Although Villeneuve was hardly at his prime in 2005.
Alain Prost was teammate to:  John Watson, Rene Arnoux, Eddie Cheever, Niki Lauda, Keke Rosberg, Stefan Johansson, Ayrton Senna, Nigel Mansell, Jean Alesi and Damon Hill. That is a remarkable list of teammates including five world champions. And what is most remarkable of all is that, over their entire time as teammates, he outscored every single one of them.
Is Alain Prost and without any doubt he had 5 Different WDC as teammates and won 4 WDC.   There is an unofficial stat that is:  If today’s point system was applied back then, Prost would have 8 WDC and would have never lost against any teammate
Alonso has had Trulli, Villeneuve, Fisichella, Hamilton, Piquet, Grosjean, Massa, Räikkönen, Button, Vandoorne, Ocon and Stroll. Four of these have been WDCs, Massa was a WDC contender as well, and Fisichella and Ocon have won races as well. But obviously the level of his teammates varied very widely.  Hamilton has also had Alonso, Button, Rosberg and Russell (the first three being WDCs), so these are some really tough teammates. But of course there were Kovalainen and Bottas, who were not all that impressive.
Prost BY FAR. Arnoux, Lauda,Senna,Mansell,Hill... It doesn't get better than this  Even Hamilton who's had Rosberg,Button and Alonso doesn't come close.  The fact that Alain won four Championships with those teammates and with Piquet and later Schumi on the grid is why he's is in my GOAT Convo.  Prost is very underrated
Prost
Prost might actually be the goat
Button had Ralf Schumacher, Fisichella, Trulli, Jacques Villenueve,Barrichello, and of course 2 of the best, Hamilton and Alonso.  Sato, Magnussen and Perez were no slouches either.
nico rosberg had alex wurz, mark webber, nakajima kazuki, micheal schumacher and lewis hamilton. he beat all of them.
I don't know about best but my favorite is definitely the bromance between Vettel and Räikkönen.
prost had watson, arnoux, cheever, lauda, k.rosberg, johansson, senna, mansell, alesi and d.hill. not bad
Lewis Hamilton is his career has had Fernando Alonso, Jenson Button, and Nico Rosberg as WDC winners. George Russell is a possible future WDC
It's gotta be Prost doesn't it?  Watson, Arnoux, Cheever, Lauda, Rosberg, Johansson, Senna, Mansell, Hill  Prost beat them all.
Kimi and Alonso were a pretty deadly combo.
Some I've not seen mentioned:  * Fangio had Farina, Fagioli, Taruffi, Sanesi, Bonetto,  Collins, von Trips, Moss, Lang, Parnell and others.  *  Farina had almost the same teammates+Hawthorn and Villoresi  * Lauda had Peterson, Regazzoni, Reutemann, Villeneuve, Watson, Piquet, Prost.  It depends if you mean all in their prime or not.
Lance Stroll has had pretty good team mates. Vettel and Alonso were WDCs, Massa came a close second, Perez is also a great driver. Only Sirotkin wasn't good.
Nico Rosberg
Easy - Graham Hill. At varying points, he had Jo Bonnier, Dan Gurney, Tony Brooks, Richie Ginther, Jackie Stewart, Jim Clark, Giancarlo Baghetti, Mario Andretti, Jochen Rindt, and Carlos Reutemann.
Of active drivers I lean Lewis. Alonso, Button, and Roseberg is a hell of a top three.
Schumacher Barrichello. In my lifetime. I doubt Michael would have won 7 in the modern era. I remember a race in Melbourne Barrichello led 99% of the race then let Michael through on tram orders.   IT WAS THE FIRST RACE OF THE SEASON
Don’t forget Ricardo Patrese - his team mates include Alan Jones, Nelson Piquet, Nigel Mansell and Michael Schumacher.
Mansell has been teammates with Andretti, Rosberg, Piquet, Prost, Hill and Hakkinen. There were seasons when he only joined a couple of races tho'
Add to those Heidfeld in 2002, Fisichella in 2004, and Bottas I'm 2014-2016, and you've got a very difficult overall set of teammates.
I will never forgive the Senna documentary for giving everyone the impression that Prost was a backstabbing layabout who was never on Senna's level. The guy was a handful of points away from being an 8-time champion.
More proof that Prost is genuinely a top 5 OAT, The man was good at *every* team and didnt win most of his titles (if not all) at 1 team like several other goat contenders
I just want to point out one thing and that it’s stupid to use current point systems to see how people did. A point system and championship standings dictate tactics and aggressiveness.   It’s all well that he finished more races than Senna, but since the championship was decided by the best results and not all results, you can’t say “hey if they had the current points system Prost would have won”.
Lauda, Senna, Mansell, and who else am I forgetting?
This is the correct answer. Prost is an incredible driver, and when stacked against his teammates, his abilities are even more well represented. I really think he doesn't get the flowers some of his peers get. Truly a legend
Ham and Mag were teammates?
Good call on both fronts, I completely forgot about Jenson, both about his teammates and him.
>Fisichella and Ocon have won races as well.  >Kovalainen and Bottas, who were not all that impressive.  Haven't the latter duo won quite a lot more races than the former?
Just a small comment: Alonso WON the race for OCON
He's definitely top 5 of all time easy.
Maybe not easily, but he's there for the debate for sure
Ralf, Trulli and Fisi never got the cars they deserved.
Rosberg did not beat webber. They had one season together that was 06 Webber finished 14th Rosberg finished 17th  [06 season](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Formula_One_World_Championship)
There was a bromance? As far as I remember Seb liked Kimi because he hardly spoke, while Kimi was indifferent to everything outside the cockpit so had no feelings either way.
Wow, that's crazy to think that he really has had some impressive teammates despite pretty much always being midfield. Good shout
Webber (race winner, WDC contender), Alex Wurz (one of the most regarded development drivers of the 00s), Kazuki Nakajima (rather weak F1 driver, but currently having good days in WEC), Michael Schumacher (7 times WDC), and Lewis Hamilton (7 times WDC). Not bad, isn't it?
On paper maybe but Schumacher was washed in his 40s, so in practice probably not.
Russell is on par with them
Stroll in 2017 too
Yes, if you give him 1982 for terrible reliability due to a single part which he himself wanted to change but Renault refused, 1983 because the Brabham was probably running illegal fuel in the final few races, 1984 simply because he was a lot better than Lauda and lost simply due to bad luck, 1988 because only the dropped points rule prevented him from being champion, and 1990 because Senna should have been disqualified for that outrageous move in Suzuka, it becomes clear that Prost could easily have been a nine-time champion had things fallen his way just slightly.  That is not me saying he deserved nine titles. 1983 and 1990 are the only ones of these which you could genuinely make a case that he was robbed, and in the former example it isn't even totally clear there was anything wrong with the Brabham anyway. But Prost was just unlucky not to have won more titles, and considering the list of drivers he raced against, I would say he is, along with Fangio, the statistical Greatest of All Time, although Clark and Senna were slightly better when including context.
I'm with you on the top 5, but he kinda did win most of his titles for one team. 3 with McLaren, 1 with Williams.
>Prost is genuinely a top 5 OAT  It’s funny how they always forget about the French wizard, look how they didn’t even include him in the [list](https://www.tastingtable.com/829906/oatmeal-brands-ranked-from-worst-to-best/).
It was 5 sorry, Hill and K.Rosberg
Damon Hill in 1993
Sorry, my bad. Magnussen debuted for McLaren as Hamilton's replacement - they were never racing for the same team.  Edit: that was also not quite right, see the comments below. This is what I get for talking from memory. :P
I had no intention to compare them. My only point was that Kovalainen and Bottas aren't names that seem quite as strong as the other four teammates Hamilton has had.  However, since you're interested, I'll say that they seem to be a fairly comparable pair. Kovalainen in particular was quite mediocre and only managed to win one race in 2008 after Hamilton had an engine failure, so he's very likely the worst of all of Hamilton's teammates. Fisichella may not have been the worst of Alonso's teammates (I'd personally give that honor to Piquet), but he only managed to win two races, and in both Alonso had qualified down the order through no fault of his own. So they both seemed rather comparable.  Meanwhile Bottas and Ocon both seem like stronger drivers who occasionally outperformed Hamilton and Alonso (with the caveat that Alonso might not have been at his prime during his time with Ocon as a teammate). However, the number of wins really does not feel relevant to me as a comparison because Ocon has never driven a car capable of fighting for race wins, while Bottas found himself in the fastest car on the grid for five seasons.
They were also never in cars as good as the others.  Ocon matches Kovalainen's tally without ever spending a race in a top 3 car, while the latter had two seasons at McLaren, one in a championship year.  And while Fisichella drove championship winning Renaults, he did that for two years, whereas Bottas spent 5-WCC winning years in Mercs, for two of which they were easily more dominant than the Renaults.
Only Trulli. Ralf had fastest/second fastest car in 2001-2003 and didn't prove himself as top driver. Fisichella was in 3005-2006 Renault and was destroyed by Alonso.
yep no you’re right got a little excited, but the point i was tryna make is that nico rosberg basically drove  against and beat the 2 drivers who might be the consensus goats. (schumi wasn’t in his prime but still it takes balls)
Yes. Kimi said Vettel was one of the only drivers on the grid that he ever considered his friend. And if you see interviews with them together it's clear they like each other. Especially after being teammates a few years.
Erm what?
Nakajima retired 2 years ago
Even if he was past his prime, it was fucking Michael Schumacher. I’d say he was still one of the harder teammates.
Yeah but he was still amazing at Ferrari, and I *think* he would have won the title with them with the new system?
He would have won with Renault, but reliability fucked him hard and almost with Ferrari
Well but that’s true for almost all champions.   Schumacher with Ferrari, Hamilton Mercedes, Vettel RB, Alonso Renault, Senna McLaren, Piquet Brabham, Brabham Cooper, Stewart Tyrell, Lauda Ferrari, Hakkinnen McLaren, etc.  Only Fangio won with more than 2 constructors and Schumacher is the only to win 2 outside of his main constructor.
🙃
He was great but I’m more than comfortable making it known I don’t think he’s at that all time Senna/Schumi/Lewis level off all time elite driver. His lack of one lap pace has been discussed ad nauseam, but even his race results in the races where both he and Senna finished were very lopsided in Senna’s favor.
I had forgotten Keke Rosberg. Prost really did have tough teammates
Actually Magnussen debuted in 2014 so he replaced Perez who had himself replaced Hamilton
It was Sergio Perez who replaced Lewis at McLaren. Magnussen then replaced Checo the following year.
Ocon had disruptions to his driving by having no seat, I honestly think he's a little underrated
Kovaleinen also beat Fisichella straight up as teammates.  My point was more that it's weird to hold up Fisichella and Ocon as race winning teammates for Alonso, but then say Bottas and Kovaleinen are weak teammates for Hamilton. They're all race winners.
All good mate, the mind games Michael played with Nico probably helped him with giving the tools he needed for his title win against Lewis in 16
You forgetting Lewis in 2008? They were McLaren Mercedes but definitely not the same team he's at now.
Come on now, he wasn’t a bad Oat.
People forget Keke because he wasn't that good.
true true (love that locked out of the bathroom story) lmao
Then make your case buddy. Don't just reply with "erm"
*”Majority”* almost all these guys won one WDC af another team but the rest at their “main” team
You feeling OK?
He annihilated Mansell in 1985
Ah get your point now, thought you meant Schumacher won with two constructors, not two titles with more than one constructor, my bad
Don't be weird
Did you read the thread title? The question is "who had the strongest team mates"?   Senna doesn't qualify for me. He spent 4/10 years with Cecotto, Dumfries, Nakajima, and Andretti. Prost's team mates were significantly stronger on the whole.
I’m convinced they have so much footage of Arthur for the reasons of having an excuse to show Charles more. Idk why all I see over social media is Leclerc. F2 has some interesting drivers /F1 seat contenders who deserve some attention as well.  I guess being marketable is more important in f2
As a certain Prema engineer said on here - if Arthur is half decent in F2, they will get him into F1 for marketability, just like the Marquez brothers in MotoGP. Even though his racecraft and consistency are shoddy at best.
Arthur needs to show more pace but if he does, even with Inconsistency he occasionally shows that Leclerc magic and that with Charles is enough to get him in

Lawrence Stroll is Jewish, isn't he?
ARAMCO
Its Ramadan now, soon it will be Easter.........the Abrahamic faiths are converging!  Edit: Passover, Ramadan and Easter  overlap only happens three times each century........according to Jeremy Cobyn on Twitter
The replies and quote tweets on that tweet are depressing
Wishing Jews a happy holiday with a big ole Aramco logo on the bottom. Irony is fucking dead
Can any Jewish fan explain to the rest of us what the significance of the festival is?
Twitter comments classy as always
Literally sitting here eating a nice piece of matzah pizza. (Literally just cheese and tomato sauce on matzah thrown in the oven)  chag pesach samech!
Wow Kanye West is going to hate this
happy passover! ✡️🕎
This is such a fresh change. Sporting community only cares about Christmas and Islamic festivals so kudos AM. ❤️
Isn't this what Borat says?
Saudi Aramco has a pretty much don’t ask/don’t tell relationship with Jews.   Saudi still asks for your religion on your visa form. I flew from Bahrain to Dhahran (where, ironically, I was born as the child of an expat Aramco employee). I was there for transit, never gonna leave the airport, just change to a different airline to fly to the US.   I left that question blank and when asked, told the guy it was none of his or the Kingdoms’ business. Bad move. And I was traveling under a U.S. Official Passport. Almost didn’t make my plane and had to call the Consulate office.
Yep, they are originating from Russia
So is Lance I believe
The first thing I thought was… Aramco must love having their logo on this post
Lmao
Came here to say that 😂
Fucking climate change!
Ramadan is on the lunar calendar so it moves 11? days each year iirc
As someone who vehemently despises Zionism I agree. People too often conflate a single government with a whole faith.
I hate to be that guy, but I am pretty sure Aramco (and Saudis in general) don't mind that post at all. The conflict is with Israel, not the Jews.
I feel super appreciated /s
Pesach is Passover. You have a seder which is a little like Jewish Thanksgiving I guess. It's a big family dinner. Then the rest of the holiday sucks if you're devout. If you're not, the seder is pretty much the only thing.  TL;DR: It's a religious holiday.
TL:DR:   It's a festival to commemorate the Hebrews escaping slavery in Egypt (this is no archaeological evidence that this actually happened though). It's the story of Exodus, from the Old Testament, with the 10 plagues and the Pharoah with a heart of stone and the "let my people go!" and the parting of the red sea and all that jazz.   More detail than you could ever possibly want to know:  It's an 8-day festival (7 days if you live in Israel). Jews don't eat "leavened bread" (bread that has been allowed to rise) for the duration of the festival. This is because, as the story goes, the Hebrews left Egypt in such a hurry that they didn't have time to allow the bread dough to rise. They just put the dough on their backs and carried it with them. To remember what our ancestors went through, we remove leavened bread from our diet for the duration of the festival. [Matzah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matzah) is your classic example of unleavened bread. It's awful.   The definition of what counts as "leavened bread" is incredibly broad, and in practice, orthodox Jews will restrict their diet to special "kosher for Passover" food for the duration of the festival. They'll even have a special set of cutlery, plates, etc., which are "kosher for passover" because they've never touched leavened bread. Essentially, we throw out all of our food, or seal it away, and restrict our diet to "kosher for passover" stuff for 8 days. It's such a faff.   Prior to the beginning of Passover, orthodox Jews will give their house a deep clean (to get rid of all that pesky leavened bread), and then ceremonially walk around the house searching for any leftover "chametz" (leavened bread) with a candle and a feather. It's quite an interesting custom. It's also customary to hide bits of chametz around the house, wrapped in tinfoil usually, to be ceremonially discovered (kinda like an easter egg hunt, now that I think of it).   Another interesting custom is that orthodox Jews will ceremonially sell all of their chametz to a non-Jew for the duration of Passover - a literal contract which says "you now formally own all of the chametz in my house".   There are also "Seder nights", which are ceremonial dinners held on the first and second nights of Passover (only the first if you live in Israel). Various songs are sung, various ceremonies are held (for example, a special piece of matzah is hidden somewhere in the house, then the kids run around trying to find it). We eat horseradish to remind ourselves of the bitterness of slavery; we consume salt water to remind ourselves of the tears of our ancestors; we eat "haroset" which is a strange apple-based food that is supposed to remind us of the cement used by the slaves in Egypt; and there's loads of other customs that I won't go into.   The tradition is that everyone stays up really late discussing and interpreting the Exodus story. Oh, and also, everyone drinks four glasses at wine (each one is drunk at a specific time in the meal) while leaning to the left, for a reason that I forget. At the very end, everyone says "next year in Jerusalem!"  It's a whole shebang; it's a pretty important festival for Jews.
Pesach is the Hebrew name for Passover (of Rugrats fame). It's probably the 3rd biggest Jewish holy day after Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur (new year and day of atonement respectively).
It’s Passover that’s all.  Celebrating the supposed release of Israeli slaves from Egypt.
How long and what temp in the oven? That sounds great!
Hey cmon now, he watched 21 Jump Street
AM has a Jewish chairman and driver after all. Happy Passover indeed! ✡
A lot of what ‘borat’ says is Hebrew, mixed with some polish. So…maybe.   Sasha Baron Cohen relied on it just sounding ‘foreign’
Borat just speaks Hebrew so it probably sounds like something he said
Curious… i damn well know saying atheist would be evil… but for my religion if I said “agnostic” would that cause trouble too?
What if you say you are atheist?
It’s their business as long as you’re in their country whether you agree with it or not.
I think Croatia. Strolovich is the real name, I believe
It's hard to be Jewish in Russia,yo
They don't care lol. The Saudi family would sponsor the LGBT+ movement in the West happily if that helped them whitewash and promote their country and their state companies.
I mean dont get tricked by the fact that most of Arabic world started to give zero fucks for Palestine. Saudi's, Bahrain, Egypt, UAE are all normalazing relations with State of Israel
The conflict has not been with Israel for some time now.
[removed]
If you've ever spent some time in Gulf countries you'll know that the conflict is very much with the Jews. The anti-Semitism is open and unrelenting
The reason the conflict is with Israel is cause they are Jews, The gulf is vehemently anti-semitic.
The conflict with israel mainly comes from them bein jewish for most gulf countries outside of palestine. Most of them were happy the way the British divided up the ottoman empire, house of Saud gained massive territories from that. Their main issue wasnt the “division” of palestine. It was the division of palestine into a jewish state.   Thats why they formed an allegiance and invaded, remember Israel hadnt done any of the colonisation/capture palestinian territory or any of the atrocities prior to the first invasion by the gulf states.
wrong, a ton of muslims are extremely antisemitic
The conflict with Israel stems from religion. You think anybody would give a shit if they were an Islamic nation?
Naw it doesn’t suck. Matzoh can be used in many ways. It really just takes a bit of attitude adjustment. Kinda like driving for Ferrari.
Happy first night from our Seder to your’s!
>At the very end, everyone says "next year in Jerusalem!"  I'm assuming this is a European Jewish custom, so what do those in Jerusalem say at the end?
> It's an 8-day festival (7 days if you live in Israel).   Can you please expand on this part? Thanks!
Forgot the part where it’s called Passover cuz God’s “angel of death” hand or whatever “passed over” all the Hebrews houses on his way to slaughter all the first born Egyptian babies.  Weird stuff
> Another interesting custom is that orthodox Jews will ceremonially sell all of their chametz to a non-Jew for the duration of Passover - a literal contract which says "you now formally own all of the chametz in my house".  I always wondered what happened if the non-Jew refused to give it back at the end.
supposed?
I put mine on 200C and I took a shower so maybe 10 mins? Depends how you like your cheese cooked but it was perfect for me. I added some herbs on top too it was delicious
arent the only "polish" phrases borat uses "jakshemash" (a heavily slashed pronounciation of "how are you" in polish) and "chenquieh" (which is a heavily slashed pronounciation of a polish word for "thank you")?
They might suggest a week in a Saudi jail, praying 5 days a week, would make your believe.   J/k at some point they brought this old Religious Police dude (long gray beard) who went through my stuff again and then started to tear open my orders which had low level classified information in it. That’s when I told them I wanted to call the consulate. Then they said ‘run for the plane’ and I go out to the tarmac and my luggage and another guy’s (who bought a fifth of Johnny Walker Red at the duty free shop in Bahrain) was laying on the tarmac. We ran up the stairs and they buttoned up the plane and pushed it back and there was the luggage…  The plane stopped and a few minutes later, after hearing reassuring thuds, we took off for an 11 hour flight to NYC.
I think you can be beheaded for being an apostate. But they wouldn’t do that. To non-Saudis. Or to Saudis who are of African extraction.   I suspect that if I put Atheist it would have been better than saying ‘None of your business.’ I think I put too much faith in that Official Passport. It had its uses, but not there.
"Their country their rules" tends to fall apart under any scrutiny at all. There will be native Saudi atheists who are deeply harmed by apostasy laws, in the same way that there will be gay Saudis and Saudi women harmed by morality laws.  If you wanna hold up this ideal of every country keeping their customs to themselves you might wanna look up Wahhabism and how much the house of Saud spent spreading it around the world.
Triggered much? I just find it funny that the Championship sponsor of a racing series that is supposed to be promoting inclusion and diversity is an oil company owned by the country whose Crown Prince ordered the murder and dismemberment of a journalist in Turkey, that executes (by beheading) an average of 120 people a year, including for apostasy, for distributing leaflets, for being the wrong color, for being gay, the wrong sect of Islam.

It would, yet they don’t.
I don't know what you mean by "normalizing" but afaik to this date Saudis do not recognize Israel as a state.
Many gulf states have already normalized with Israel, Saudi isn't much different, the only reason why they haven't publicly done so is because they like to think of themselves as leaders of the muslim world. Most muslims do not support Israel.
Which of the two countries do you mean?
Which one?
Jews have been there for a long time. There are still Jews in the Levant, Egypt, and Yemen. It’s not about them being Jewish. It’s about the British kicking out lots of Jews from Europe and dumping them there as part of a deal.  Those were European Jews that stayed in Europe for generations. Imagine sending up lots of African Americans and dumping them to suddenly rule an African nation. Oh wait think that already happened, and look at the consequences.
Lol. You're right. I was being judgmental. There are certainly worse things in the world than Passover and driving for Ferrari. :)
It’s part of it for all diaspora not just Ashkenazi (European), which until 1949 was effectively all Jews.
All Jews say it, not just European Jews.  Jews in Jerusalem say it too.
A lot of holidays are different for diaspora vs Israel as the Jewish/Hebrew calendar is lunar based.   The holidays are based on the new moon in Jerusalem, but that could not be known with accuracy throughout much of the Jewish diasporic period (ie the last 2000 years).
A little bit more on this from what oyrrahoy said, since it’s pretty interesting  A new day according to the Jewish calendar (and maybe the same lunar calendar that I think South Korea uses?) begins at sunset.  For any holiday, Jews are prohibited from doing certain types of work from the moment that sunset occurs, including Passover, the sabbath, Rosh Hashanah, everything really.  One holiday will last about 25 hours.  As an example, let’s say that a few thousand years ago, Passover began on a Monday night at 7 pm (19:00) and ended Tuesday night at 8 pm (20:00).  Briefly, the Jews in Israel were able to confirm that Passover had ended, because there were witnesses that saw the moon on Tuesday night.  Starting from the center of Jerusalem, a series of communicative fires were set, such that the first fire would cause watchers to light the second fire on what’s known as the mount of olives (a super old cemetery also in Jerusalem).  This second fire would cause others to light more fires throughout Israel and extending into neighboring countries, and eventually others living outside of Israel would see these fires.  Seeing the fire meant that Passover had officially ended.  Holidays do of course occur outside of Israel, but the timing, for a lack of a better word, was dependent on the moon in Israel   What happens if Jews inside and outside of Israel didn’t see the fires?  That meant that they had to celebrate a second day of Passover :D.  This means that the Hebrew calendar a couple thousand years ago was flexible and changing.  They knew the holidays had to occur at a certain date, but at that date with respect to the moon.  It’s more complicated, but one reason that a holiday was extended to a second day was if the moon did not show on Tuesday at 8 pm  There are different generations of Jews, with each generation coming about by a very significant event.  The holocaust marked the changing from the previous generation to the current one.  The further back in time you go, the generations’ decisions become more weighted and more important.  Back a couple thousand years ago, the highest court in Israel, the Sanhedrin, composed of 72 judges, had the ability to say okay, the holiday is over - light the fires.  The Sanhedrin doesn’t exist anymore, so we don’t have the ability to end a holiday   To say the least, Jews have gone through many, many pillages, destructions and exiles, to the point where exile was not only expected, but they they would keep getting worse and Jews would lose more and more of Torah-ruling capabilities.  Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, the absolute top rabbi of his time, the president of the Sanhedrin if you will, decided to create a calendar for Jews for the rest of time, aka until the Hebrew year 6000 (which is the final year that the messiah will be able to come, but that’s a massive entire thing other thing).  For reference, the Hebrew calendar is at the year 5783.  How could Rabban Gamliel decide whether the moon was going to show in Israel and cause a second day of a holiday after the Sanhedrin arrived to its inevitable doom?  He didn’t.  Concurrent with whichever holiday they had just finished, he made the decree that every Jew living inside the land of Israel would celebrate one day of each holiday inside the land of Israel (excluding fast days such as Yom Kippur).  However, due to the uncertainty of the moon in Israel, more reasons blah etc., he said that every Jew living outside of Israel has to celebrate 2 days  This is kind of a side note, but still interesting.  Nobody living inside the land of Israel has to celebrate two days, but people living outside still do.  What if someone living in Argentina is on vacation in Israel and celebrates Passover there?  Should he only keep one day of Passover or two?  He celebrates two, but there are some more relaxed opinions saying that he would only have to celebrate one day.  However, these opinions are very few, and the vast majority of the rabbis say he should keep two days.  At the end of the day, it’s his life and his choice to keep one or two.  If he’s pretty into the religion, he will do what his personal rabbi tells him  I hope you enjoyed this!  tldr holiday days used to be flexible and change; bc of this, a rabbi set the holidays into the calendar and said bc we don’t know when a holiday will end for those outside of Israel, they have to celebrate each holiday for two days  Edit - Related side note number 2: is the world different in that the days of the Hebrew lunar calendar are no longer changing?  They never really were.  The ancient times just had the ability to decide where in the calendar they truly actually were based off of the moon.  For example, a new moon occurs on the first of each Hebrew calendar month.  Rosh Hashanah is on the 1st of Tishrei, so no moon would show up.  In Israel, if they saw that there was still no moon showing on Tuesday at 8 pm (marking the beginning of the second of Tishrei), then they would say that the second of Tishrei is Rosh Hashanah and keep celebrating.  It’s not really any different today.  We just don’t have the ability to make that ruling, since the Sanhedrin doesn’t exist.  That’s why Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel made the decree
Because they smeared lamb’s(?) blood on their doorways as a marker to that hand of death that the inhabitants were Jewish.
They never get encrusted to take the bread again.
Not trying to get too into this, but that's probably the right word to use since the general consensus among historians and archeologists is that there isn't much evidence to support the Exodus having occurred and that it's more of a founding myth than a representation of an actual event.  I think to a lot of people though, religion isn't something that is meant to be probed too deeply by archeologists and historians who aren't affiliated with the faith, and while I disagree with that, leaving it ambiguous is probably the best way to describe it from a neutral point of view.
Yes, supposed.
Well I am sure the roughly 25-30 million Jewish people believe the story.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Exodus
Thank you!
I mean a week & 5 days prayer isn’t that bad if you leave compared to what you describe happened lol.
So it's better to say you are Christian for example?
No thanks.  When I go to other countries I’m not stupid enough to think that I don’t have to abide by their rules.  I like my freedom, so I’m not gonna take “moral stances” or whatever that guy said he was doing when asked to state his religion.  Anyone that goes to another country thinking “these rules are dumb I don’t have to follow them” is risking their life.
Triggered? They triggered you with a *simple question* on a form and almost threw you in a dungeon.  You almost lost your freedom being triggered lol Get a grip on reality!
Dutch jumpscare warning needed
I took me some time to understand, it was not English
VITCH TITS
It wouldn't lol. The people that support LGBT causes actively are the same that know Saudi Arabia is full of shit.
Officially they dont, because it would be very unpopular in their population. But behind closed doors, Israel and Saudis have been cooperating for years.
He's talking out of his ass.  Edit: a lot of clearly very uninformed people here... Read all the headlines you want, it won't change the fact that almost all Arabs hate Israel and many of them don't even recognize it.   Egypt, for example, has notoriously recognized Israel and established an embassy there for decades, that doesn't stop Egyptians from singing a song literally called "I hate Israel" and praying for their downfall every major conflict. During the last such occasion the Egyptian Government announced $500M in aid to Palestine and it was met with cheers despite the fact that it was (still is) a very difficult time, economically, for the country.  The only significant exception to this behavior is the UAE, and they've faced a lot of popular backlash because of that.  TL;DR: **arabs hate Israel, always have and always will**
Hell, lots of jews don't support Israel either.
Yes
I was thinking of the one where leaving the state religion is a crime, and which has executed people for witchcraft.
> the British kicking out lots of Jews from Europe and dumping them there as part of a deal  That's simply not true.  The Zionist movement saw lots of Jewish Europeans voluntarily move to Palestine -- as it was then known -- in the first half of the 20th century. This can be seen in light of both growing anti-semitism in Europe in the late 19th century, and the rise of romanticist-nationalist movements across Europe at the same time, for example the Gaelic League in Ireland.  Unlike the latter, Zionism did receive popular support from the British ruling classes, and so they facilitated immigration into Palestine by imposing an open-door immigration policy on the region.  This then led to what should be a familiar conflict to us in the 21st century: locals complaining about surges of immigrants coming over, taking their jobs, refusing to integrate into their culture, etc. This led to riots in the 1920s which the British, then controlling Palestine under a mandate, failed to adequately control.  Greater and more significant violence occurred in the late 30s when locals, upset with being a vassal state of Britain rather than being fully independent, and upset with continuing immigration, staged an attempted revolt for independence.   This was quashed.  After World War II, for obvious reasons, Jewish Europeans moved into Palestine in even greater numbers.  Since the stated aim of Zionism was a Jewish state for the Jewish people, this was always going to end badly, and so it did in the late 40s. At this stage British soldiers were being attacked by both Palestinian and Zionist terrorists seeking total control of the region.  Eventually, exhausted, the British pulled out in 1948 and let the UN put in a plan. Almost immediately mass civil war erupted in Palestine with David Ben-Gurion and the Jewish People's Council declaring the establishment of a Jewish state in Eretz Israel (The Land of Israel), to be known as the State of Israel.  The outcome of that war, roughly, is the unhappy mess we have today with a state of Israel and Palestinian territories.
This ^^^ I’m not trashing Judaism just the consensus that it’s based on a myth.
I'd take another look at some research. There's a ton of evidence that it actually happened.
Except we have real evidence that the Jews escaped slavery in Egypt
You would be wrong. For one, that estimate of the number of Jews in the world in total is probably too high, for another many Jews don't take their religion literaly and would be fine with historical evidence suggesting it did not happen. (Indeed many are atheists, and Jews only in a cultural sense.)
Nah Jews are a lot chiller than Christians. We were basically taught that the Torah is just stories and we can choose whether to take it literally or not.
Jew here, it is a cultural thing. Only Orthodox and Hassidic Jews believe the stories in the Torah. Most of us are atheists, from my experience.
I think they prefer something more concrete: Roman Catholic, Episcopal, etc.
That was a moral stance. I recognize their right to ask the question, but I don’t recognize their right to expect me (or anyone else) to answer it.
Some weird ass opinions and down votes coming our way.  Americans and their "freedom" are weird.
[Is this better?](https://fy.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lance_Stroll)
Same. "Lance stroll, beter beckend"  Me: "hmm, I didn't know 'beckend' was a word in English"  "als"  Me: "ok something is going on".
I swear down on me nans grave
And somehow “the people that support LGBT causes actively” have no clue that the corporations that give themselves a rainbow makeover for Pride don’t give a single shit about the LGBTQ community.
No. They’re probably referring to reports from last month that Saudi has begun to engage in talks about normalizing relations in a “for the right price” kind of way.
Check Abraham Accords from 2020 regarding other gulf countries, Saudi begun to engage in normalization of relations + Iran (Saudi's biggest rival in region) is financing Palestinian Hamas. Here in this region you would do everything opposite of your enemy
You’re generalising massively.  Plenty of Arabs despise Israel sure, but then so do many non-Arabs, and a growing number of Westerners. The human rights abuses that Israel carries out regularly are starting to lead to a realignment of views, even amongst diaspora Jews. Netanyahu appointing Jewish supremacist nutjobs like Ben Gvir and Smotrich to his government is causing a long-term shift.  But there’s plenty of Arabs who hate the Palestinians too. The reasons for this are complex; the Israeli colonization led to a wave of Palestinian refugee migration into other countries- there’s a large group of Palestinian Arabs and their descendents in Saudi for example, leading to resentment from the native populace. Also, lots of money that was donated by Arab countries to Palestine went ‘missing’, embezzled by corrupt PLO/Hamas officials.
The overwhelming majority do.
No, there is not. The archeological consensus is that there was never a stable population of Israelites in Ancient Egypt at all. Ever.
But but but ChatGPT said 25-30 million 😂
A lot of modern orthodox don’t even believe it literally.
Also a Jew here. You're wrong. We're literally celebrating a holiday about a historical event.
Bless your heart 😂
You seriously think answering a simple question on a form has anything to do with morals? Lol.
I’m American lol.  It’s not an exclusively American thing.  It’s the vestiges of imperialism.  It’s “wherever I go, I make the rules because I’m _____!”  Give Americans a break though. While I do suspect he’s from Alabama, it’s also quite possible that he’s Italian.
He's got so much beckend
“Lance Stroll, utter bellend”
Sometimes I too, swear down on RPM’s nans grave    RPM or as I like to call him, Max Verstrappen’s British redneck twin
They know lol
Looks like the sportwashing is working on you
> We're literally celebrating a holiday about a historical event.  Look, arguing over whether or not there were ever Israelites enslaved in Egypt is one thing. If you're claiming the biblical story of Moses and the Exodus is based in historical fact, though, as someone raised Jewish I can tell you you're absolutely wrong there.    Not only is there zero historical evidence for Moses, the Exodus, the parting of the sea, or any of that, there are in fact *much older* myths that include many (if not all) of the same elements.  The story of the Exodus isn't just myth, it's not even *original* myth.
I guess you are too young to know about people who burned draft cards, refused to appear in front of the House Un American Activities Committee.   A small version of that.
Yea good point. Definitely some British, French etc people do it too.  And I have absolutely no idea why concealing your religion from a country has anything to do with morals. They are not asking you to denounce it.
Max verstappens British redneck twin is an elderly petite asian woman?
this guy fucks. it is a fairy tale.
I'm not American for a start...and it's kind of weird you would assume someone in the Formula 1 forums is tbh.   And I'm not young either.
Curious, isnt it
In case anyone's curious, Moses is most closely based on an earlier Egyptian/Syrian myth of Mises - also paced in a basket on a river as a baby to be found by adoptive parents, performed miracles with a staff, led followers to freedom by parting waters, and received laws on stone tablets.    Again, many parts of *that* story aren't even unique.  Krishna in Hindu mythology was also placed in a basket on a river by his mother (as was Sargon in Akkadian mythology); Nemo the Lawgiver brought laws on tablets down from the mountain to the Babylonians; etc., etc., etc.  Obviously this phenomenon isn't unique to Judaism; don't even get me started on Jesus, son of Zeus....
Oh, so another “Americans don’t know anything about F1 or care about” comment. That’s why the US will have 3 GPs this year.

Red Bull-Ford Le Mans please
I’d sell one of my friends nuts to see Danny run one race in Aussie Supercars
>	Daniel Ricciardo – who will make his return as a support driver for Red Bull next year after taking this season off   What?
That Stewart-Haas ride is around the corner.
\*Angry Holden fan noises*
Hes well used to driving cars that don't work.
This pretty much confirms Dany as a full-time test driver.
That would be pretty cool
Danny Ric is exciting...EV is the opposite
Yeeee haw!
How long do you think it'll be before he jumps ship?
With the Adrian newey designed hyper car
Le mans 66 starts playing in the background
Good lord 💦 what an idea
They are just getting into GT3 racing now. Could totally see a red bull sponsored GT3 mustang with Danny in it.
I’d sell one of your friends’ nuts too.  Seriously though, that sounds like a good time. (Not the nuts part)
Bathurst 1000 wildcard entry dear god pls
Is that something you can a Ford?..
Now would it be an honor to be chosen as the person who loses a nut or would it be bad? I could see it going either way
I don't have any nuts but I will sell yours. Setting up my eBay account DeezNuts immediately
I think he’d tear it up… but still be behind SVG.
He can't even drive a Formula 1 car that don't suit his style, why are we assuming he could swap categories?
I think they were just sloppy copying the original article: https://www.drive.com.au/news/ford-to-tap-daniel-ricciardo-connection-in-the-future/  —Australian Formula One ace Daniel Ricciardo – who is taking a year away from racing as he returns to Red Bull in a support role after a dismal two years at the struggling McLaren outfit – could put his name to future Ford Performance models.—
Ricciardo to the #4 confirmed.
Are we still angry? I thought we were at the acceptance stage?
Holden lost the fight brother, it's over. Just accept having a bow tie on your cars.
I want Alan tudyk to start racing in Aussie super cars for the joke
I find it funny that in a sport like F1, where everyone misses the V10/V8 days, and where the ***VAST*** majority doesn't even watch Formula E, people will downvote anyone who isn't interested in EV's.  Imagine someone having a different preference, unacceptable right!?
My thoughts exactly
Please dont do that. Dont give me hope. Have any of you saw 2023 Ford GT? The Blue one? I'm pretty sure Newey can create a beast from that.
>(Not the nuts part)  No need to pick and choose.
I can definitely a Ford to give up one of that guy’s friend’s nuts.
AI
Pretty much what I was thinking.
Shootout with Button for the seat
One thing is clear, I'll never let fake internet points dictate if I should speak my mind or not.
They already had a Ford GT GTE car and it won Le Mans.
Ford mustang newey? Another legendary car is born.
Last time I sat through the whole 24 hours was with Mark Webber, and I will for sure be there as much as I can if Danny is running…!
I’d rather he went to RFK if Brad ever wanted to expand. SHR has been awful inconsistent of late
Same, but I've gotten downvoted just because I said I don't want F1 to turn Electric because its just gonna be Formula E, and I don't care for Formula E.  In the gas guzzling world of F1 and the entire circus around it you're not allowed to be against EVs in any way, shape or form >:(   You must and will like it! >:(
Ford gt isn't a Mustang
Yeah, it's really weird how Stewart-Haas has fallen off over the last couple of years outside of Harvick.

Unless you get to drive the car around the casino, I doubt it's as 'once in a lifetime' as they're saying.
I've walked through that hallway I don't even know how many dozens of times, in the last year. I don't feel like this is to scale. That car seems awfully big.
Is this a gambling thing?
How did they not do this one with Paris?! How did the Venetian not partner with Ferrari?! So much missed synergy.
Death is also a once-a-lifetime-experience.
Really bad photoshop job lol, the perspective is all wrong
Bring back the pink car you cowards
All you have to pay is a kidney or lung! And Also our timeshares
As the French team, surely they should have partnered with Paris Las Vegas. Ferrari and AT can partner with Italian-themed Venetian and Caesars Palace. The British teams can partner with Luxor since its Egyptian-themed like all the things in the British Museum
Venetian is amazing. Curous about other collabs. This will be first of many.
When I see the photo above, I though they are going racing in Venice. The venetian grand prix.
Link: https://www.venetianlasvegas.com/entertainment/f1-grand-prix.html
They should actually change the team name to The Venetian Resort Las Vegas BWT Alpine F1 Team. Gotta compete with Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant F1 Team and Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team somehow right?
They need to get that car back after their two car pileup in Australia.    And in hindsight, we should’ve had a contest to guess which race Gasly and Ocon would be crashing into each other
Once in a lifetime teammate crashes?😂
How did they get that into... It has to be Photoshop huh?
I wish I was a multi millionaire. Then maybe I could enjoy F1 in any place besides Reddit
Everyone is making so much goddam money off this race
How would this look with RTX off?
Seems like a missed opportunity that they didn't partner with the Paris!
this has to be one of the maddest photographs in the history of photographs
I stayed there when I was in Vegas a few years back. Thoroughly enjoyed the place.
I’m staying at the Venetian right now. Definitely not here
By once in a lifetime they mean that it will cost the average american a lifetime of work's pay to cover the damn thing
Wow! I’m in
With so many hotel-casinos at Vegas supporting this race, will each team partner with 1 hotel chain to further help promote this event?
Never been there so I don’t have any real appreciation of Vegas. But it seems very kitsch, doesn’t it?
I wish the Monte Carlo never rebranded. The idea of F1 drivers who live next to the real Monte Carlo being near the fake Vegas one would have been funny.
Nothing as American building something new to look old and distinguished.
I’m in Vegas right now and there’s basically no mention of F1 anywhere lol.  No merch on the strip.  No signs.  Nothing from what i can see.
All these ‘once in a lifetime’ in ads are just bs to scam more money lol
Given the ticket prices you’ll only be able to buy it once
You get to ride it instead of the gondolas.
I mean, it's "once in a lifetime" because you won't be able to afford it many times. It's nothing new.
Photoshopped by somebody on Fiverr
Must be Alonso’s 2021 Hungarian Grand Prix car.
I have only walked down that hallway half a dozen times, it's definitely shopped.
I was thinking the same thing. I was just there in November and the November before that and it seems off.   Excited for my visit this coming year.
Kinda curious how they got it in there
You think it'll be one of those slot machine things? They put the car on top of a giant novelty slot machine and instead of never winning a Corvette you can never win an Alpine F1 car?
Put in a dollar, won a car. Put in another dollar, won another car. Another dollar, another car.
Because business doesn't work that way
Ferrari doesn’t advertise
Tbf, the Venetian is a much nicer resort than Paris. So while the “geography” might match up, it may not match up in a lot of other ways.   I think McLaren has a thing with the Wynn, there was a McLaren Elva in the Encore before.
> How did the Venetian not partner with Ferrari?!  I hope that Ferrari won't ever do anything like that. This trash should be an insult to any Italian person or company.
Because Ferrari isn't going to to lend their brand's power to the Venetian unless the check is fucking massive.
Fooled me lol
It hurts my eyes, so sharp
Looks like a 3D render but yeah, perspective not quite there and the cars too big
I’d assume someone will do a Caesar’s group collab and someone will do an MGM group collab at minimum. Wynn or wouldn’t surprise me either.
Package is hotel stay, event tickets for all 3 days & special events. Starting at $3k per night, minimum 3 nights.      I think.
This is as vegas as it gets. It's the tackiest city on earth
I doubt I could even afford it with a life long mortgage. The prices are insane.
Made in Gran Turismo 7
The one he put in 16:9 mode?
It always the lighting you should focus on in case you’re in doubt. The air intake above the cockpit is too dark compared to how light the rest of the hallway is
tbh it's not like a regular F1 car is usable if you can't afford to have a mechanic 24/7 with you. They are not built to last for years, they are built to last a single race.  Rich people that buy F1 cars with the intention to drive them informally, usually have most of their internal stuff replaced with more normal stuff that lasts longer.
Cars all the way down.
Their team is their advertisement
Not entirely true. I got a Ferrari SUV YouTube ad a few months back.
I remember when I was in high school, a teacher told us that Porsche does not advertise, because the fact that they don't proves that they are so good they don't need ads to get your attention.
Oh I understand. You would rather Ferrari partner with Caesars.
I think Wynn might have something with McLaren already, I saw an Elva in the Encore and I heard McLaren F1 cars were on display at one point.
Red Bull at the cosmo.
It's $3k total for 2 nights, it's min 2 night stay at $1500 per night.
Just look at the cars reflection in the marble floor compared to the pillars.
Haha yup and now with the cap they’re raking in more than ever, it’s a solid marketing strategy
you sure it wasn't from a dealer?
Porsche definitely advertises but they probably have the best reputation anyways
Yes that would be less trashy /s
Zoom in and check out the dude on the reception desk at the end of both images  https://media.cntraveler.com/photos/59d796d221242a5a194864f5/master/w_1200,c_limit/Entryway-TheVenetian-LasVegas-CRHotel.jpg?mbid=social_retweet
Yeah, depending on the package it’s $1500-$3000/night.  $1500 gets you a room with a Strip view.  No tickets.  ~$3k gets you a room (non Strip view) and tickets.  Actually, depending on the room, you can get that package down to $2200/night.  If I’m being honest, for the accommodations, if you can split a room with friends, you can get it down to like $1300/night for room and tickets.  That’s actually not terrible when compared to other offers that I’ve seen.

Verstappen 8.6 Alonso 8.4 Perez 8.0  Perez weekend: Disaster qualy. P7 before second red flag. P10 after restart. Gifted P5 thanks to Sainz penalty and Gasly racecraft.
Good to see Hulkenberg up there, well deserved
Gasly absolutely shouldn't be in the top 10 with how he ended the race. It was 100% his fault and incredibly clumsy, dangerous move.   Sainz' mistake was smaller and he had just as a good weekend as Gasly, if not better, yet he's nowhere to be seen.
I can't understand how Perez and Gasly make it into the Top 11 and Sainz doesn't.

Perez with every session horrendous, not really slicing through the field as you would expect with the fastest car, and then only finishes as high due to the chaos of the red flag for an 8? No way. He should be down just above those that crashed
I’m only here to listen to people moaning about this
These are the worst yet
I gather they asked Toto to do this.
it's a yoke
would have thought Alonso would be 9+
Why’s Hamilton at the top? The only thing I remember from his race last week was being overtaken by Max (he’s not the driver I support so I don’t pay much attention to him)
Nico on the PR Podium!!!!
Might as well have a rating out of 5 if half the grid qualify for the top quarter of the system.
Why do people keep fucking posting these. They are literally nonsense ratings. STOP POSTING THIS SHIT HERE
This make me really laugh when I see those bs ranking with max being not even in the top 3 although he didn't do any mistake.
Leclerc, Albon and Russel DNF’ing also helped.
Well the last restart was also him just trying to avoid everything. Still probably would have fallen back to p7-8 though.   So yes 8 is too high but not everything was his fault. Just most of it
Perez had a brake bias related problem in FP3(after they worked on the rear of his car) which wasn't sorted before qualy. That's not his fault.
"Gifted"  lol
also the most overtakes on track in a race this season so far, with a good handful of them pretty daring. rating feels okay all things considered.
Gasly drove almost the whole race in p5 in an alpine while sainz drove almost the whole race in p4 in a ferrari
Lol what? Sainz didn’t do anything special all race and then caused a crash at the end. He shouldn’t be in the top
"statistic"
F1 "who's line is it anyway" is generally answered by someone ending up in the gravel.
rightfully so, tho.
The full media ratings were worse.
Eh, I would say Max, Hamilton and Russell (till his engine died, so can't give fair comparison) were doing better job
He didn't do anything. If anything he should have been P2 based on previous races so underperformed.
Alonso isn't British
He did make a mistake by sliding on grass for a few sec but I'm with you.
I don’t think there was any circumstance where Albon would finish in front of Checo tbh 😅
It's not lol, he just braked too late
It wasn’t, it was his own mistake independent of the other nonsense
Perez had trouble overtaking 2023 McLaren in that psychotic beast of a car. That's an automatic -8 points right there. Like if you don't just blast past Lando so quick that his car falls off the track from wind, you don't even deserve to have a seat in a top team, let alone a ranking of your performance.
The best car Perez overtook the whole race was Ocons Alpine. After 2 red flags. With the best car on the grid that has an op DRS.  Thanks to Gasly he ended P5 instead of P10 in a race where only 12 cars made it to the end.
That's the least expected with the fastest car on the grid starting P20.
Right? Saimz pulling that tractor kickimg and screaming into the top5 makes him a driving God.
I would only rank Russell higher. Hamilton lower or same as alonso as he got out qualified by Russell and Russell performed better. Max definitely lower than alonso as he lost positions at the start and locked up and went off track.
How? What could have Alonso done better?
Yeah, it's not like performances of the cars were super close. It's not like Max, qualifying higher up(of course he should), well, in this case losing couple of position only had to overtake once. it's not like Sergio had to come through the field, manage tyres alongside. It's not like Lando is a good driver...nooo. Sergio is a shit driver.  Look, I am not saying Sergio can beat max, ever. But the fact is, Red Bull picked him, he is still driving for them. They can fire him any time they want... but here he is. So clearly things are not so black and white.
You forgetting why he was P10 in the first place? Yeah, that was “thanks to Gasly”. He actually had a good start, if Gasly hadn’t foolishly locked up then he would’ve overtaken him from the outside. Most likely would’ve been P6.  P5 was only “gifted” to him due to Sainz and Gasly making idiotic mistakes. Which isn’t really luck in my opinion, because it was Sainz and Gasly’s self-inflicted mistakes.
There was one thing for him to do during the race- pass Lewis.  He couldn’t do it.
Watch the replay.. Perez locks as well lmao and was already in the gravel before the drama in front.  Your first paragraph is bullshit.
Well with hards on and tire management, he still drove well and kept the gap to a max of ~2s iirc
Bro there were 3 red flags. He got as close as eight tenths. Also since everyone was on hards, everyone was saving tyres so that they could attack at the end. I'm sure he would have atleast fought Lewis towards the ending 10 laps. He was already getting closer and closer till the first red flag.
No he didn’t lock up. Gasly’s lockup forced him to go off-track into the gravel or else he would’ve ended his race right there.
Nobody said he didn’t drive well.  But he admitted himself, he couldn’t force Lewis into any mistakes (Lewis only locked up once in 58 laps on turn 13).    Lewis drove a better race, Fernando admitted it without hesitation.
Bro did you not watch any of the post race interview?  Alonso didn’t even make the excuses that you’re making for him.  He didn’t even mention the Red Flags when asked directly about passing Lewis! Cut it out!  Lewis was saving his tires as well
Also had a very solid first restart but he was pushed to the grass.
Yeah, but what does Nando know that we don't?
I may be wrong but i genuinely think they would have fought. I don't know if Alonso would have passed him or not but before the first red flag Alonso was in the drs zone and was hunting Lewis down.
Exactly mate, you can tell who actually watches the races and who merely goes by narratives/highlights.  On the first restart, he had a mega start too and gained 4-5 positions flying up the inside before De Vries dangerously shut the door on him, forcing him off-track.  His race was hampered by others. If people want to go by luck/unluckiness, then the ending where he got “gifted” positions was just payback for the other times he got screwed over.
I’m more curious about the desperation people have to make excuses for a man that didn’t feel the need to make any excuses for himself.  This is getting weird.  Lewis drove a better race than he did.  We can move on lol!
Uhhh he was driving the fucking car lol. It's okay to admit that Lewis did a good job bro it's not that big a deal. They both drove great races.
I’ll take Alonso’s word for it.  He said no matter what he did he couldn’t pass.
Apart for quali, the only part of his race under my persecutive that wasn't that solid were his free air laps while catching Norris, not sure if he has was saving tyres or it was just Norris having a mega race but it took him more than I expected to close those 5.5 seconds.
You have such a biased opinion. Perez race was mediocre at best.
I agree, and I should have added a /s :D  These ratings exist to generate klicks and buzz. Just look at The Race and their bonkers takes.
Should have added a /s :) Of course Nando has way more experience and insights that anyone of us here combined, so if he says Lewis did great, he did.

The **Statistics** flair is reserved for posts highlighting interesting statistics. As a rule of thumb, Statistics posts need to inform readers through visualizations and insights that cannot be obtained from raw data alone. For example, a post containing a qualifying gap between two drivers expressed in tenths of a second is an easily obtainable raw piece of data and constitutes a bad Statistics post. A visualization of what that translates to on-track, or visualization of how that gap came to be would constitute a good Statistics post.  *[Read the rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/userguide).

This is an awesome list.  It's worth mentioning that Lauda's performance relative to Prost is actually really strong. The points gap can be explained largely by 1985, where Lauda's season was completely derailed by 10 mechanical failures and 2 DNS due to injury.  1986 looks really bad for Keke, but it's also worth mentioning that Keke also had very poor reliability relative to Prost (9 mechanical failures vs 3 for Prost). His 1986 season was not **that** bad. Prost was also insane that season.  Mansell-Piquet is fascinating. Im personally of the opinion that Piquet was the stronger driver, but had a subpar 1986 season (and Mansell overperformed). In 1987, Piquet spent most of the season with a significant loss of depth perception due to a nasty accident, and still won the WDC, albeit with some poorer reliability for Nigel.  Schumacher's performance relative to Nico's was  also pretty damn good for being in his 40s. He was quite a lot behind in points, but Schumacher had 9 mechanical failures to Nico's 2 which explains quite a bit of that gap.
I know everyone will say 2012 was Alonso’s best season, but watching him utterly dominate Kimi in 2014 was something to behold.
1334 to 1195 in points really puts into perspective how close Rosberg was to Hamilton. Never would have thought that the difference was this small
Alberto Ascari should be talked about in the same breathe as Jim Clark. Incredible driver and the most underrated legend.
Jenson's numbers vs Lewis are so respectable. Loved that pairing...Lewis has the edge on raw one-lap pace but Jenson made up for it in absolutely sublime racecraft and very solid race pace.  Lewis in 2010 and 2011 was prone to getting penalties, getting damage from contact with other drivers (he had this knack for specifically running into Felipe Massa in 2011 lol), and subpar tire management. Button seemed more comfortable in those cars.  Always thought Lewis was far better from 07-09 with McLaren then again in 2012 he seemed to figure out the car and mostly got screwed by reliability and team strategy calls (Hamilton's 2012 was the template for Leclerc's 2022 lol). Then of course he maintained that 2012 form revival into his time at Merc.
There’s an awful lot of Button, Alonso and Hamilton in recent years - 7 of the 9 most recent pairings included at least one of them, and they’ve all teamed against one another at some point.  Also a lot of Ferrari, McLaren and Mercedes in that same time period.    If Russell becomes champ at some point in the future, that would be an insane run of both drivers being WDC.
Andretti and Jacques getting waxed in these head 2 heads.
What is this exactly?
OK and....
Quality post!
Kimi got Vandoorned before Vandoorne.
For real, when that lineup was announced the hype was palpable.  The equivalent would be if Leclerc and Russell were teammates next season and one of them absolutely crushed the other
When you are finishing 1 and 2. It will be close
Yeah. We all owe Rosberg a debt of gratitude for those three years.
I maintain that 2010 and 2011 is where Lewis learned to manage his tires. He definitely picked up some skills from his partnership with Button as his smooth driving style was super easy on tires.  Lo and behold 14 years later and Hamilton is the best tire manager on the grid. Stark contrast from his days at McLaren.
As James Allen said after 2012: the stats reflect nicely that Hamilton had him *down* in qualifying but Sunday had far less of an advantage.  I can't recall the exact number, but from 2010-2012, Button won more rain-affected races than everyone else *put together*. To the extent Force India's official wet strategy was: follow Button. Do what Button does, no questions asked.
Name 1 wdc driver pairing after 2018
What about 2013?  Rosberg ahead 8-7 in races  Hamilton ahead 189-171 in points  Rosberg had 3 mechanical failures. Hamilton had none.  Incredibly close. In fact one could say that Rosberg had a small edge in 2013. Hamilton had the edge in 2014-16.
Well their pace was also really similar, in 2014 it was 0,098% difference in favour of Lewis. In 2015 0,071% in favour of Lewis and in 2016 0,022% in favour of Rosberg.
He indeed said as much. McLaren told him he wasn't as good as Button there but by 2012 he was on-par. Explicitly.
lewis was faster in qually avg and race pace avg in 2013. The biggest gap they ever had in qualiy avg was that season.  Nico did well, though.
Good u/whatthefat analysis once that 2-1 titles is a very fair outcome.
Can you show me?  That sounded aggressive but didnt mean it to
What are you talking about.... You have to be trolling
bro, do you understand the term "wdc"?
I don't understand what this has to do with your main point about it being close when they're finishing 1-2.   And I prefer to look at results, since an F1 race isn't about just being the fastest. A host of factors is what gets you the complete performance. Pace, tyre management, strategy calls, ability to not make mistakes, ability to recover from mistakes, ability to recover from bad luck (such as SC), ability to drive in the rain, etc. All of these contribute to a driver's performance, which shows in the end results. You can't just look at laptimes and say "yeah that driver was better" (which btw, Hamilton had just a 0.032% advantage according to this methodology)  https://f1teammatestats.herokuapp.com/f1analysis.php
https://f1teammatestats.herokuapp.com/f1analysis.php  Go to the bottom to select a year and team. Don’t forget to check the “racepace analysis” box
I know. Probably is when you only look at results, you miss the process.  Ocon beat Alonso last year. Results can be flawed
> Ocon beat Alonso last year. Results can be flawed  Yes, because Alonso had 7 mechanical failures to Ocon's 3. Therefore, it is reasonable to make a conclusion that Alonso would come out ahead with similar reliability.  But in 2013, it was Rosberg who had the brunt of mechanical failures.
Yeah that's a good point that those factors influence your average laptimes. Except for the fact, in an albeit extreme example, if you're constantly gapping your team mates but are also constantly putting it in the wall, it doesn't really matter how fast you are.
That's why I mentioned reliabilty DNFs.  when you're comparing two team mates, mistimed SC/VSC or reliability slow-down in races isn't that significant and also tends to even out over time. So the bigger the sample, the less these in-race factors matter. For example if a backmarker crashes into Verstappen whos leading, and as a result he finishes 12th, while Perez wins, this will be completely insignificant in an end-of-season analysis as long as Verstappen performs as usual at the 22 other events, even if nothing like that happens to Perez.  Almost always, the stronger performer will get better results over time than the weaker performer, reliability DNFs aside. I can't think of any example where that hasn't been the case.
As usual, as sober, factual analysis from Palmer, who also points out what people don't want to hear: these late restarts happened before and worked out just fine then. And nobody had a problem with that.  So I guess this voice of reason will be ignored.
Drivers forgetting cold tyres are a thing, and baiting each other into braking too late
The risk:reward balance is dramatically different  Making a risky move at turn one at the start of the race is largely pointless, if you sneak a few positions in a slower car you're almost guaranteed to lose them over the following laps anyway.  When you do a restart with two laps to go, the chances of holding on to a position against a faster car is much higher.
Palmer is the race analysis GOAT. Always the most level headed opinions with details you'd never even think of.
What Palmer is omitting is the story of the entire weekend - how difficult it was to switch the tyres on. That was not the case in other late restart races. At the very least 2 warmup laps and two racing laps was needed.
Baku 2021 called and it wants its clean two-laps- to-go restart back. I don't know how to use this old meme.
Did you watch the entire video?
FIA =/= FOM
no, this is reddit
Yeah, the only thing I've gotten from this post is "workday" and it means I have to work.
Iirc the not finishing under sc was a decision made by the teams with the FIA.

This seems cruel to make them drive a car that was actually good.
Side note. The massive amount of time it’s taken to get to 3 races and soon 4 this season is rough.
I really miss the look of 2021 cars. The front wing being so low to the ground looks soo much better imo.
Bet they wish they could use that car again.
God I really miss this car
What do they learn by running an older car? Serious question
They must have turned a lot of laps and really pushed as well, Lando’s tires are destroyed
Finally gonna feel what a McLaren with straight line speed is like
The front left tyre in photo 6... ouch!
The question is, is that car faster than the current one?
They posted a video of the MCL35M on track and it’s still quick. Looks eons faster than the current car.
Just shows how important sponsors are in F1. Hell, that livery looks so dead without any logos...
Shame they had to paint it that way. Was a beautiful car in 2022.
Smiling through the pain
Driving it more often won’t make it competitive
There's not enough testing in the world......
On the old 13” wheels too 😭
It's not that unusual.  2 races in a month is fairly normal until recent years. We've had more and more back-to-back Grand Prix periods since 2020, including one time where it was something like 6 races in 8 or 9 weeks, so it probably feels longer.  2 weeks in-between events and 16-18 races a year used to be the norm. Plus I think there's too much in a season now anyway. As a viewer, sometimes I just think I'll care about a race less because the championship is so packed much of the time.
The season is terribly organised.  We have multiple triple headers, but a 3 week break after the 3rd race.
What massive amount of time? Look at these dates, the last race from 2000/2022 and the first three races from 2001/2023:  2000 / 2001: 22 October - 4 March - 18 March - 1 April  2022 / 2023: 20 November - 5 March - 19 March - 2 April  The offseason is super short nowadays. And you don't even have to wake up at 4am for the first race anymore.
Definitely underrated how good they looked. I have a few models of the 2021 cars and they are wonderful to look at. Especially the Monaco McLaren livery.
I think it’s wind tunnel correlation work
Pretty sure it’s something to do with the new windtunnel correlation. They announced a while back that they were using the MCL35M so it would make sense that this is somehow part of it. Probably why it’s a closed test as well.
Some of the handling characteristics between this McLaren and the current one might carry over (the McLaren is notoriously weird to drive, said so by Lando and Danny Ric), it could be track acclimatization for Piastri since he's never raced around Imola before, or simply just a practice session for the entire team (they can't use last year's car or this year's car for those).
Yeah, the 2021 cars are faster than the ground effect ones
Except its slower
Funnily enough, there current livery would actually look great sans sponsors
I'd say that this car which was able to get a pole, a 1-2 and 3 other podiums was reasonably competitive
a 4 week break mid-season that isn't the summer break is unusual.
Pretty much every two weeks in the 90’s unless the countries were like bordering one another. Id imagine the partnering with shipping companies and advances in shipping / logistics helped
Couldn't disagree more. I'd happily watch F1 every weekend. I understand for the teams that's not practical of course, but as a fan i'm all for more races.
I think 20 races is probably about right, and double headers should basically only be in Europe where they can pack up Sunday night and be at the track the next day.
Because it wasn't supposed to be a break, though. They weren't allowed to plan for a lack of China.
It's because China dropped out
Well, you do if you live in Australasia. Bahrain’s at 2am Monday east coast Aus, Jeddah at 4am Monday.
LOL. Man had to go back 2 decades to prove his point.
4am?
Aston and Haas disagree. Williams too possibly.
Wouldn't they be running rakes for that?
Or maybe a confidence boost to see your lap times around a circuit with a car that isnt shit.
Not sure this is true. Pretty confident that the lap records are being/have been set on the new ground effect cars. I’d have to check for proof though and currently on a break at work
It isn't mcl 25 was very quick in imola in quali trim and race pace wasn't that bad too around 2-5 tenth to redbull and merc. 2021 cars are still quicker than rb19
Not in a straight line.
Yeah but that's what you get when a GP drops out multiple times and they fail to fit another in.
I recommend F1 TV, if you don’t already have it. Throwing on a random old race is like my version of listening to a podcast.
I'd watch it every weekend if they could actually find interesting circuits. They don't have enough to fill the current schedule.   Like, either you're running multiple weekends at each track, you're going to end up going to dumps like Jerez and Paul Richard (Oh wait...).  I actually wouldn't mind multiples IF the layouts were very different, like the Bahrain outer loop, or the handful of modern circuits that are actually certified to run in both directions - don't think any of those are Grade 1, though.
Watch other series or bygone seasons
True.
No, 2021 cars are faster, lap record are being set because of track being modified for better racing like Australia and soon Singapore
Nice they’ll be flying next time they race on a drag strip!
I will agree with this. I do stick on old races sometimes.
But it is still terribly organized?
no, i said that because im upset about the long break and forgot about china.  there are so many scheduling variables that they would have to work around and I didn't think about it.

No.  All that extra energy would be used to defend against attacks as much as it would be used to attack. It wouldn't make a difference.
If everyone has DRS, noone has DRS. Same applies to ERS
So, 2009 then? No DRS and Kers for a handful of cars. Didn't quite work most of the time
Been done. Anything that the person in front can also use makes even 2 cars a "ers" train. At least with drs the lead car is always at a disadvantage straightline speed wise.
Indycar has this with push to pass don't they?
ERS has a deployment limit, so the battery capacity isn't limiting use, the restriction is (for 1 lap).   DRS doesn't exist to give slower cars behind a temporary boost to promote overtaking, it exists to limit the effect of dirty air. A car following closely will be effected by dirty air and will as a result be slower, so they are given DRS to make them slightly faster than the car ahead, balancing the two cars over the lap. You can tell it's to balance the cars because fatser cars with DRS easily overtake slower cars, but slower cars with DRS can't overtake faster cars, even though it looks like they have an advantage. They only have an advantage on the straights because they have a disadvantage in the high downforce sections.   Also without DRS the following car will be unable to catch up and pass the car ahead. You need that DRS advantage to overtake. In Austria 2022, Hamilton was unable to overtake Mick when they both had DRS, but when Mick lost DRS Hamilton was able to overtake easily. So this means allowing every car to have DRS or removing it entirely will make overtaking harder.   DRS trains exist because the car in front doesn't get DRS and the cars behind do, making the car ahead slower on the straights. Normlay the car ahead is faster to still have pace and not get overtaken on the straights. And the following cars are slower. They form naturally. And if a faster car is behind a DRS train, they can still overtake the train.   Basically DRS is to combat dirty air, and it's currently the best system available to do so. And on tracks that are difficult to overtake, how do you expect any ovetakes without DRS? Look at Abu Dhabi 2010, the race people claim is the reason DRS was introduced into the sport. Is that considered better racing? A fast car unable to overtake a slower car and losing the race and the world championship because of it.
I think as a concept, more ers reliance could work as push-to-pass, which is a good thing if drivers are forced to use it differently from another.  The issue is if everyone deploys it the same way defending cars will just use it to counter overtakes and you’ll have a stalemate.  My solution would be to allow teams to trade certain performance attributes for others, such as going with awd deployment but with the same amount of cells / capacity as a strictly fwd or rwd deployment.  Tradeoff would be better corner launches for worse aero efficiency and weight
How is adding more weight to the car more 'eco friendly'?
The removal of DRS in any sense would make for much better racing.
Push to pass, but instead of a set time like the Indycars, you can only use it when your battery has a charge. It can also be used anywhere on the circuit. Need to get out of turn 6 faster, you have power in your battery from harvesting down the backstretch, hit the button and drain it to the next breaking zone. It becomes more of a race strategy for everyone as you can’t see how much power the others drivers have.
No. Best thing about DRS is the instant visual. We’d never never know when drivers were or were not using their extra battery power and I think that takes a lot away from the spectacle.
F-Duct era!
Eco friendly?  The tyres on my car last 10,000~ miles before I need to make a pitstop.  F1 really only has one problem. All other problems pale in insignificance.  The absence of the glorious exhaust note :(
I think allowing DRS for anyone no matter the time delta for one deployment per lap for 30 seconds.   Then each driver, without the pit wall input, will have to decide when and where to deploy DRS.
No
Not sure if there is energy enough to charge the larger battery (without a load of lift and coast/early braking)
Why not simply remove DRS detection lines and give drivers a set amount of DRS uses? Either a number of activations, or a total length of time they can spend under DRS.   If the goal is simply to give some cars a top speed/acceleration boost, it seems much more efficient to me to use DRS/active aero rather than increase battery size which would add weight, cooling and packaging concerns  RB also really showed that there are differences in how teams incorporate DRS, with varying levels of efficiency depending on how teams design it; if DRS becomes used much more liberally, it'll be another differentiator up to the teams engineer. And it might also force driver to think strategically about how/when to deploy DRS, like they already have to do with their battery
NNNOOOOOOOSSS
We witnessed a great battery battle with Hamilton vs Perez in Abu Dhabi 2021. I’ll take a bigger battery battle over DRS at any time, it’s much more spectacular.
Not unless the energy is used differently in concept / design, the closer a series is to a spec series the more processional it gets imo, so long as the teams have to trade performance in different areas in a constructor’s championship
Not if it's a finite resource.  Keep it so that the capacity is not quite enough for a full lap but recharged through skilled driving. Make it slightly more powerful on discharge to compensate partially for loss of DRS boost. Drivers will have to board energy and use it at key moments. It will be on driver skill to unleash the power where and when it's most needed.  This will serve to 'unlock' more overtaking points on tracks as crafty drivers like Alonso will hit the go button in unexpected places. This kind of cat and mouse competition would be fun to watch!  Right now, DRS gives an unfair advantage to the following car making driver skill largely irrelevant and dependant on the car.  For me, overtakes with DRS are just as boring most of the time as DRS trains.
Well, the leading car doesn't have DRS.
Alonso losing a World Championship because he spent 35 laps behind Petrov in Abu Dhabi 2010
So if you can design rules where teams can choose how to deploy the energy or packaging differently you’ll get great racing.  It would be hard to pull off, but pretty much the teams should be allowed to add a motor to the front of the car but sacrifice packaging and weight in order to pull off the traction advantage of powering the front axle.    Or to have a simpler tradeoff, you go for a bigger motor but have the same battery and a specific minimum weight tied to the motor.  So your deployment is more powerful but you can’t use it as long as the competition
There's no deployment limit in the rules. As long as the battery state of charge doesn't exceed 4MJ at any given time over a lap, they can deploy as much as the ERS is capable of, this is why Honda says it can use more energy than the rest.  A couple of years ago they gave a breakdown in one of the Japanese magazines where they talked about their nanotube tech battery and showed they sent recovered energy from the MGU-K to beef up the MGU-H, which under the rules can supply unlimited energy to the ES and MGU-K.  I believe Cowell of then Mercedes also talked about this in some YouTube video where he mentioned 60 or 70% of power to the K is from the H and the battery supplements it.
Adding these optional performance attributes are unnecessary, and they already exist in Formula 1. There are different engine suppliers, and they have minor differences, in 2021 Mercedes had the most powerfull engine, but the RedBull Honda engine was more efficient with air and was able to produce more power in higher altitude races like Mexico. This is also seen with wing and suspension tuning. Higher wings give more downforce, allowing you to take corners faster and get on throttle faster, but they increase drag and make it slower on straights, with suspension you can change how stiff it is, the camber angle, impact how it takes corners and rides kerbs, making a trade off each time. You can even vary the car's length and shape. Redbull traditionally used a shorter wheelbase and lower rake, making it faster in the corners because it's more agile and the diffuser can produce more downforce, and Mercedes traditionally used a longer wheelbase design, allowing it to have more downforce producing elements and faster in the straights, but less agile as a result. And then there's the different car concepts introduced in 2022, RedBull have a downwash effect to make the diffuser more effective, Ferrari use its sidepods to channel air into the beam wing, and the Mercedes 0 sidepods make it more aerodynamic.   We don't need to introduce different components or optional powertrain elements, that just makes the sport more complicated when there are better ways to change how a car drives.
Great idea actually
So you pretty much just suggested something like BoP ins WEC. It sounds good on paper but it doesn't work well in reality. You will always end up with a solution that is slightly better and your BoP will always be playing catch up to try and balance out all the variables you've just introduced.
Because electric.... Powered by gas.... Kinda like all the coal fired electric cars on the road today.
https://youtu.be/OscqgBj1HCw&t=115s  There’s a reason F1 cars have DRS now
You mean exactly like it is now?
Inb4 they use them on the straights. Also they completely ignores the point of DRS which is to offset dirty air
> Not unless the energy is used differently in concept / design,  At which point 1 way will come out on top as the best way and every other engine manufacturer will follow suit.  > the closer a series is to a spec series the more processional it gets imo  Your opinion is objectively wrong. The more equal cars are the more driver talent matters and the more even racing will be. We can see that in many series across the world.
F1 is not a spec series, nor is it the intention to make it a spec series.  If you want spec series racing, watch a…
> Not if it's a finite resource. Keep it so that the capacity is not quite enough for a full lap but recharged through skilled driving.  This is complete and utter nonsense.  It already takes more than a lap to recharge the battery if you want to use all of it. It's already a limited resource. Drivers use it in defense all the time because *it's the obvious thing to do*.  In defense you see drivers charge everywhere they can around a lap so they have that extra boost on the straights. Verstappen famously got his first win in Spain in 2016 by cleverly saving all his energy for the start of the main straight to deny Raikkonen an opportunity to overtake him.  Everything else you're writing is just fanfiction, imaginary scenarios in which the driver in front is blissfully unaware of the basics of racing.
This would see more drivers use the power to go around the outside etc, rather than just use it down the straights
Exactly!!!
Which is why drs actually works to promote more overtakes.   It's mostly to give the attacking car an advantage to make up for the loss of downforce from dirty air elsewhere. If you're car/driver isn't faster though then you won't pass.   Now the effects of DRS aren't a 1-1 replacement for downforce loss dude to dirty air. But it's close enough.
Or, ya know just leave it more like it is now instead of making horribly convoluted
Why would this be introduced? Everyone will just adopt the same concept and no progress will be made to improve racing. The current system is simple and effective.
Let's have a development war in a budget capped series.   Some will fuck up and it will make for less spectaculair racing.
Ngl, I don’t see why adding more ways to differentiate concepts is a hinderance to build diversity, the more tradeoffs you have the more likely teams will go down different paths.  F1’s already so complicated, not sure why we need to draw the line here, especially when engines are getting more spec in 2026 and it’s more about ers anyway…
BoP has far more success than any conventional constructor’s championship in terms of reaching parity, particularly the sro and gtp regulations which are simpler than the lmh regs but still allow for quite radical differences between chassis and engine concepts.  So we’re damned if we keep the same regs and find an “optimal” solution and we’re damned if we try to readjust the power distribution between concepts.
And yet in Australia there was no fight for the lead because Verstappen was able to click a button and just drive all the way around the outside of Hamilton. That's worse than what happened in Abu Dhabi.  Obviously it would be better if the dirty air effect was negated further, but will only happen if cars are designed not to have DRS.
Good catch. My explanation is lacking.   Get rid of DRS, give the battery the same power so it will increase the speed of the car to the relative level of opening the flap in the DRS zone. But it can be activated at any point on the track. Is that a better rundown?
Sure, but certain spec series are better for racing than others.  The draggier and slower the cars are, the better the racing is in general.  So yeah it’s more about how vulnerable a car is to dirty air vs slipstream, so my statement was too generalized, but I also see how other high downforce series struggle to pass without some form of push to pass.  I mean, look at formula regional and other high downforce series where there’s no drs / push to pass, most of the time the racing is pretty processional.  The alternative is bahrain 2022 ted bull vs ferrari, where concepts were fundamentally different and thus traded different strengths and weaknesses to have amazing racing.  You can have more than one concept work, you just need the regulations to be open and optimized enough to do so.  Continuous improvement and maintenance of the rules will provide good racing, it’s not an objectively wrong take just a different one.
What?  I’m arguing for the exact opposite, what do you think I meant by allowing for different concepts?  The guy above is more in line with the narrative that one solution will always be faster, I’m the opposite, I think multiple solutions can be fast you just need the right kind of regulations to facilitate different approaches.  The more deregulated the series is the more different the concepts will be, but different concepts can be attainable with prescriptive regs the regulators just need to take more of a conscientious approach to designing the regs to include these intention forks in the road in development that force teams to trade one piece of performance for another.  And this has occurred previously in f1’s history too: 1.5l blown engines vs 3.5l naturally aspirated rules was intended to make naturally aspirated cars more competitive against blown engines than what would normally occur
Make it like you can only deploy ERS like you would DRS, only when within 1sec of the guy in front and only in DRS/ERS zones.  It's DRS with more steps!
With adjustments year on year the weight vs power tradeoff could be hard to definitively give a superior concept out, so if the best team uses a larger motor which can draw more power then just increase the minimum weight for larger designs.  Power vs weight should be more of a thing in this formula, it’s too easy for teams to converge to the same weight and the issue is teams start converging everywhere else
Yeah, even with how prescriptive the regs are now there’s some teams which are cursed to be on the back foot for the rest of the regulation period and will need to catch up as a result.  But the reason why it takes forever is straightforward: your own concept is so fundamentally wrong you need to spend a year / years understanding the best solution.  By then you’re too far behind to make the same performance advancements and it will be too late to converge or overhaul the top team.  So now I ask, why are people for this idea of more stable regulations with less wiggle room when a team is so far ahead?  All anyone else can do is copy the best solution and be a year behind in development, what kind of a championship is that when nearly everyone keeps giving up to start early on next year’s car?    To shortcut the process, the regulations should be designed with failsafes, where if certain teams are too far behind then they can choose to wait for a new area of development to open up which simultaneously pigeonholes a top team’s design.  In a regulation period, the rules should be tightest in the first year so everyone more or less chooses a similar approach.  Then the following years add amendments to the rules to allow for more freedom in other parts of the car.  The ers deployment could be relaxed in stages so that designs aren’t so crazy at the beginning someone gets the worst solution possible, but year on year more freedom is given with the rules, especially in areas which compromise the best team’s design so lower teams can focus on finding more pace from the newly relaxed section.  But I do see a bigger issue I guess, customer teams would lag behind so ideally this regulation philosophy is more for chassis and aero vs power unit packaging
I don't know why you keep jumping from one extreme to another extreme. It feels more like you just want to argue for the sake of arguing.  Whatever we have now is fine, there's absolutely ZERO need to add in optional parts and trying to balance all the "trade offs" because it's impossible. If you've actually watched WEC, you will realise it's is impossible to achieve a BoP that makes all solutions viable. To make it worse, you've now introduced the possibility of sandbagging so the BoP can swing your way which is downright stupid, difficult to police and bad for viewership. If you think what we have now is a spec series, then you must be new to motorsports or you have no idea what a proper spec series is.  The most simple and effective solution is that they just need to fine tune the DRS length and positioning on DRS detection/deployment zone. Some zones are way too powerful while some are ineffective.
Agreed  DRS is far too powerful, it's ruining the racing if a driver can push a button and get an overtake on a straight. They should be battling through successive corners for overtakes.
>And yet in Australia there was no fight for the lead because Verstappen was able to click a button and just drive all the way around the outside of Hamilton  There wouldn't have been a fight either way, Lewis would've just let him go because the Red Bull just is that fast
>  The draggier and slower the cars are, the better the racing is in general.  Lower downforce, not draggier. Draggy cars create a lot of turbulence and dirty air which is bad for following other cars. F1 cars are the draggiest racing cars on the planet.  >The alternative is bahrain 2022 ted bull vs ferrari, where concepts were fundamentally different and thus traded different strengths and weaknesses to have amazing racing.   These are exceptions and we have seen they didn't hold for more than the occasional race.   >You can have more than one concept work, you just need the regulations to be open and optimized enough to do so.  This is a fantasy. Unless you introduce a BoP system to balance out concepts you'll end up with a superior concept taking over.
And now youve made the cars 600 hp and slow as shit
Its too easy for the teams to converge? Last season the top 3 teams all had drastically different sidepod concepts, and this year they all still are using those concepts.
The 22/23 regulations are probably the tightest in the sports history and we have one of the most dominant looking cars in the sports history as a result.
My bad, don’t want to sound too harsh.  My take was basically a response to the idea of BoP rather than wec BoP, and I agree right now that toyota even with unfavourable BoP has a concept that works better over every sort of environment and in the end more unconventional designs (9x8 ground effect vs conventional air dams like the oreca and toyota concepts) are just not competitive enough.  The non-hybridized cars suffer the most where they’re just completely off the pace no matter how many handicaps are introduced for the hybrid cars, but honestly there was still some decent battling between the cadillac and ferraris at sebring, and I think the new crop of cars is too new to truly judge BoP until we have a few more normal tracks under our belt.  But also with the idea of chasing the top team, Imo that’s how you get better and better racing; you continuously improve the regulations until you get parity.  I think going for too much of a BoP strategy in f1 where you directly target the best design and inflate everyone else may end up backfiring or may be too extreme, but the end result of cars being more different to each other can give us more alonso vs hamilton bahrain and less drs-assisted passes.  And that’s my goal, because it can be done and has happened before, just needs some tweaking
What’s your answer to other seasons in this championship with several winners / pole sitters then?  There’s always a better design but the difference can be milliseconds vs seconds, and it can be track dependent.    And I do mean draggier, how do you think slipstream works?  For a guy hellbent on proving people wrong, you prove to only know just as much as the other guy.  You make your opinions sound like they’re facts when they’re just as naive and simplistic as mine.  What’s your degree anyway?  Are you an engineer / engineering student like me or just someone who thinks they’re smarter than everyone else but in reality is just arrogant and dissmissive lol
sorry I wasn't clear. Make it so that the extra battery goodness that replaces the DRS gets deployed under DRS rules. The normal ers etc stays as usual.
Now one concept is a second clear of the rest, looks at least at the moment one concept has more of a ceiling than the others.  That needs to be less of an issue for future regulation periods imo, and that comes from tuning the regs year on year
Yeah that was part of my point…
It actually doesn't, BoP are done after you have gathered data, so you will always be one step behind because F1 development moves so fast compared to any other series. It can also devalues the idea of pushing car development because it takes away the incentive to build a monster like the RB19 because you know it will be nerfed. Then it turns everyone into a race to game the BoP rather than race to develop and innovate.  Also, everytime you mess up a BoP, it devalues the racing, the drivers, the cars and the series. Imagine having Verstappen racing in the mid field in the RB19 because the FIA completely messed up the BoP. You have to admit that it will always be easier to mess up the BoP than to land a good BoP.
> And I do mean draggier, how do you think slipstream works?  I do, you evidently do not understand the relation between drag and downforce. More aero = more drag, faster car = more drag. Lower formula cars with low downforce are amazing for slipstreaming but they are not draggy cars. They're just low downforce and slow in the corners which means the following car doesn't lose out so much or destroy their tyres to follow.
There isn't an extra battery goodness. There's (currently) a ~160hp unit and from 2026 onward a ~450hp unit, but if those don't deploy there's no hybrid power.
True, I do agree that it has the potential to ruin both the spectacle and the credibility of the championship, especially if it backfires.  But at the same time, I just want to clarify these kinds of changes would only happen to the set of the following year’s rules, not from race to race like normal BoP.  It would then basically act as a way to throw a curveball to better designs so it’s less easier for a top team to focus on only adding performance.  Does that change anything about your previous viewpoint or is it still the same?
This is just ridiculouy wrong. Wtf is even “more aero = more drag”? You talk with all the conviction of a clueless person, better to stop it.
The OP question is about replacing the DRS flap with extra battery boost, and that is where my comment is coming from.  OP asked if adding extra electrical power to the cars _on top of what we have already_ to replace the DRS system.  Then the comment I originally responded to said that if both the car ahead and behind in am overtakr scenario has an "electric boost overtakr button", overtakes will be impossible because as soon as follower tries to overtake, leader also pushes button and we have a DRS train guaranteed.  I then said that if DRS is replaced with a battery boost overtake button, the concern about both cars just boosting and causing a drs train scenario can be alleviates by keeping the rules about using drs the same. E.g: the car behind can use his overtake button if he is in the 1second window, and is in a designated drs zone etc.  _Then_ the comment above the one YOU responded to said I just made the cars only have 600bhp and made them slow, which makes no sense because the whole thread is about adding a power boost on top of what we have already.  I then clarified that I clearly was referring to an extra boost on top of what we have.  Amd now we are here, with you saying "there is no extra boost."  I. Know. That.  The whole thread is about replacing DRS with an _extra_ power boost mechanism.  I really wonder of you guys read the thread or just came to the comments to fucking piss on what people said in an attempt to look smart.
If doing this on an annual basis you will still end up with a scenario where one solution being the best solution because it will never be truly balanced. Therefore whoever gets it right will still dominant the season. It is also harder and costlier to make changes to the powertrain mid season compared to aero components.  I will say it again, no need to over complicate things and try to reinvent the wheel. They just need to fine tune the DRS zones.
Every aero part on a car that is there to create downforce also creates drag. The more aero parts on the car and the bigger the wings get the draggier a car gets.   F1 cars, as I said above somewhere, are enormously draggy cars because they have such high downforce and are so fast. The slipstream in theory is great but the reasons they're draggy also make it very hard to follow in the corners.  If you want a car that's great for slipstreaming having a car with little downforce is far more important than having a draggy car. You need something that's relatively slow in the corners. Sure the theoretical slipstream effect is smaller but cars can actually be close so you can use it unlike in F1 or other high downforce series.

"under threat"  Yea... no.
We went clickbaiting
Massa to get Singapore void to win the title, Hamilton then gets his Spa penalty rescinded to win it back. Alonso officially disqualified and will win in Baku on his 100th podium.
Sure is gonna be fun hearing the constant bickering over this during the break.
It's not gonna result in anything, 100% guaranteed.
>Had the investigation been started when the sport's bosses actually known about the wrongdoing, the result of the Singapore race would have been nullified and the race scrubbed from the history books, giving Massa the title by five points.  How do they know it definitely would have been nullified and not just Renault disqualified from the results or something?
Yeah no lmao, best Massa can hope for is compensation in some form
>Had the investigation been started when the sport's bosses actually known about the wrongdoing, the result of the Singapore race would have been nullified and the race scrubbed from the history books, giving Massa the title by five points.  I've asked in every thread on the subject and nobody yet has pointed to the rule which says if a team cheats the result of the entire race is voided. It appears that everyone's just accepted that Bernie is 100% right in saying that.
From morning probably its 4 th post regarding the same topic. The headlines get more desperate and different spin. Its gonna be a long break.
Why would they nullify the whole race. I feel like that penalizes everyone on the grid who raced well or got points but didn’t have anything to do with Renault.  It makes more sense to strip the win and points from renault and move everyone up a spot. Renault cheated, they should get penalized, not the entire grid, especially when that disproportionately favors the drivers who had a bad race even though everyone except Renault raced fairly.
bruh, didn't change the result of a race they knew the race director broke the rules in, 1 hour after the race.  They won't be changing a race from 10 + years ago due to a 3rd party "crashing on purpose"
It’s not and will never be “under threat”.
media is having too much fun with this... nothing is going to happen to the 2008 title, it's not going to be overturned, it will remain in the record books as is.. if anything happens at all Massa gets some money for his troubles and maybe an apology
Can we add gpfans to the list of banned media (for being shite)?
Whatever is the case, I feel for Massa. Just got caught up in forces outside of his control. He could have been remembered as a great of that era with Kimi Alonso and Hamilton and had his name in the record books.   What a shame.
No precedent to wipe an entire race off the history books. Michael Schumacher was DQ'd a few times for cheating - no reason to think this wouldn't happen if results were changed a decade and a half later. Zero reason to ignore the entire race. Hamilton would be P2 and win the title by more than 1 point.
All I learnt from that article is Bernie is a weirdo especially when it comes to Lewis and that isnt a new revelation so what a waste of time.
At best a tidy compensation and an admitance ecclestone knew what happened is that max that could happen
When they said Ferrari had gone backwards this season I didn't think they meant 15 years.
Incredibly silly headline
It doesnt put his win under threat EVER.   It may even be too late to even get compensation from the FOM/FIA.
Hamilton's title is not under threat, as he wasn't involved in that plan, and giving him a title was not the purpose of that plan.   However, Alonso win was a main purpose of that plan, and he is the main beneficient of that plan who somehow managed to got away without any penalty, soo... 🤔
As much as I don't like Hamilton, this is getting ridiculous. It's been a decade and a half, just move on. I highly doubt anything will come from this anyway.
Ham’s  08 title is not under threat. Lol
Yeah The wait till baku got a little bit interesting even tho everyone knows nothings gonna change.
If there was any legal basis that would pass the title to Massa, surely that would mean Lewis could sue over 2021?
This whole thing is a joke. No race has ever been nullified. Worst that would happen is Renault completely disqualified.   Nobody would even be mentioning nullifying the race if that cranky poisonous old man didn’t mention, mainly to stir shit and try to cause more issues for Hamilton, who he despises.
Yeah, it was expected - https://old.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/12bhiof/_/jewvs93
This was before I started watching f1. What happened to Hamilton in Spa exactly?
And nothing happened at Hockenheim 2018. Right? .... Right???
And then Mclaren get their rightful ban for multiple years after spygate so Massa is champion again.
Mini offseason this month and the journalists are starved for attention
The people who hate Lewis need zero excuses to drag his achievements so this is their Christmas
Bruh never say 100% with these clowns invoved.
nullifying the race would be insane. Renault cheated, they were disqualified, done. To everyone else it was just a race with a crash and a safety car
I haven't seen any regulations that allows for nullification. If there is one, then that changes things... at least from a perception standpoint. legally who knows.
You're forgetting the "Its Bernies trainset and he can do what he wants" clause that previously existed ;)
He’d wrong. The rules don’t have that remedy in them . He made it up as far as I can tell here is the ISC from 2008 https://argent.fia.com/web/fia-public.nsf/917D67F70F1C5EE7C12573B7003DCEC5/$FILE/CSI%20modif%20ap%20AGO%20oct%2007%20ANG%20-%20Applic.%2001.01.08%20-%20clean.pdf   Renault was charged under a breach of 151c
If FIA declared the race fixing during the season, do you think they would have gone with "But it's fine. We just penalize Renault and let the rest of the Singapore standings as they are. Yes, the unprecedented fixing screwed up the entire race, led to an unexpected standing shuffle that wouldn't have happened otherwise and totally decides the title fight. But nobody cares, amirite?"  Voiding the Singapore results would have been the only way for FIA to avoid a major scandal. Or they could pretended to know nothing and hope it doesn't get known before the end of November 2008.
Especially not when a punishment has already been given and is in the books. Won't go back now and say "On second thought, maybe we need to ensure a stricter punishment. Sorry Hamilton!"
Arguably if Renault had not crashed he still would have had issues when he pitted. The result would end up the same with him losing the WDC by a point, despite winning at home. I feel sorry for him but so much water has passed under the bridge for anyone to worry themselves about it now. Though maybe I should seek a refund for my Singapore 2008 ticket!
no team cheated in 2021
No Team Cheated and if he would, the Race would be „nullified“ also.  That means Max and Lewis back on same points, Max has more race wins and therefore takes the Championship.
He was ordered to let Kimi past. He did so but then tucked right back into the slipstream and re-overtook at the next corner.   He was ordered to let Kimi through again but then Kimi spun and crashed out of the race before Hamilton could do it. Hamilton got a penalty and the win taken away.
It's a bit of a different scenario. Races/titles decided by incorrect/poor decisions from Race Control/the FIA versus driver error.
There's no direct precedent I'm aware of for the race being nullified and everyone's points being taken away. The closest thing I can think of is when Schumacher was disqualified from the championship in '97 and that didn't change anyone else's points at all.
Serious question though; Bernie was in charge of F1, but would this not have fallen under FIA/Max Mosley decision making? Would this really have been up to Bernie? Cause I thought he was in charge of the commercial rights, while Max Mosley as FIA head would have been responsible for enforcing punishment on sporting regs?
I've also found nothing in the ISC or Sporting Regs from 2008. I don't know if there's any other document which governed the rules at that point though.
> Voiding the Singapore results would have been the only way for FIA to avoid a major scandal  why should it be voided? to everyone not involved in the cheating it was just a race that happened to have a crash and a safety car, that could have happened for a many other reasons
You keep saying this but there are written rules for what can be done and voiding a race result isn’t among them. All teams are legally bound by the ISC and the penalties simply don’t include that
RB did with the cost cap
I’m pretty sure there is already precedence of races ending on lap count back so no, that Abu Dhabi race wouldn’t just be canceled. I wager Mercedes would argue for the last 2 lap to be annulled. 2014 Japanese GP ran for 46 laps and was consequently reverted back to 44 laps completed and race ended. Spa 2021 also awarded points for “two laps” ran. None of these races were canceled.   So this talk of that race being nullified is nonsense. Specially when it was basically completed.
25 seconds.   Insane
Minor correction, McLaren told Lewis to give back the position and asked the FIA if it was enough. They said it was, and then later gave him a penalty anyway.
Wasn't even ordered the first time, he did it of his own accord and Race Director said that it was fine.
I couldn’t believe Kimi wasn’t able to hold that lead. Lewis had the worse exit from the busstop but still outbraked Kimi going into La Source. If there was ever an overtake on merit, that was it.
I haven’t seen any other documents on this. I can’t imagine if they were charge under the ISC the remedy would come from elsewhere either. So far this seems like classic Bernie. Attention grabbing drama but with no factual basis
Not only that, but 179b (Right of Review) says that "The period during which an appeal in review may brought expires on 30 November of the current year". So even though this new information's come to light, he can't challenge it through right of review or appeal. Basically, the title ain't going nowhere.
And you keep making the mistake of thinking that voiding the race is a penalty. Nothing of the sort. It doesn't even fall under that category.   What FIA would have done is essentially remove it from the calendar as if it never happened. Just like races drop from the calendar in the past years, including China this year. But the removal would be retroactive and that would have been it. Literally no one would have dared to argue against it.
How on Earth are people still talking about having this reversed? We're 3 races into 2023 for crying out loud.
That amount of time was for a drive-through or stop-and-go penalty equivalent if they are given within five laps of the end of the race. Under current regs it's 20 seconds for drive-through or 30 seconds for stop-and-go.  Timo Glock also got a post-race 25 seconds for overtaking under yellows.
The race already happened.There is a clause for scheduling and removing races before they occur.  There is no legal avenue for that. No one would accept that because it's not legal lol. Theyd get laughed out of court
I mean…if we’re discussing reversing a championship from 15 years ago, reversing one from two years ago is comparatively minor.
Yeah, this whole post is nuts.

Yes and no. Italy has plenty of engineers and Ferrari has virtually no competition, whereas British teams all steal talent from eachother.  Italy also has [motor valley](https://grrrltraveler.com/motor-valley-italy-emilia-romagna/) with a lot of different engineers in different companies outside of F1, but in motorsport.  However if you want people with experience in F1 they can only realistically look at AT and maybe Sauber or people really don’t need to mind the problems you describe. Top level people can often be persuaded by a boat load of cash and the prospect of living in Italy for a few years, but for “normal” engineers it’s worth it for about the same pay as they already get, which often isn’t all that much.
You lost me at top teams and AM and especialy Mclaren.  Ferrari has good enginers and they have recruted from elsewhere in the past. Still do.   Is it a bigger challenge to get people to move to Italy? Sure. Does that mean Ferrari doesn't have any international workers? Not at all. There are many people from around the world working at Ferrari. And that includes the UK.
Ferrari have build good cars in 2017, 2018 and 2022. Those cars are certainly better than anything AM or McLaren have build in the last 6 years or so. Only Mercedes and Red Bull are better than them, not every team in the UK.
It would be easier for European born engineers to work in Italy than the UK, would it not?
You really put McLaren in there?
They tried with a technical office in the UK when Barnard returned to the team in the 90's, but I guess it didn't worked too well, since Ferrari eventually replaced him with Byrne.  From Wikipedia:  > *After working for a short time on the stillborn Toyota F1 project, in mid-1993, Barnard returned to Ferrari, who were once more in a slump, having failed to win a single race since 1990. Once more Barnard was able to name his terms and opened a new technical office in Surrey named Ferrari Design and Development (FDD). From his UK office Barnard began work on the 412T1B which ultimately returned Ferrari to the top of the podium at the hands of old team favourite Gerhard Berger.*  > *Barnard continued to design Ferrari's Formula One racers for four seasons, including the 412T2; which took Jean Alesi to his only race win. By 1996 however major changes were underway at the Italian team. With Berger and Alesi removed, and reigning world champion Michael Schumacher installed as lead driver, team manager Jean Todt set about building a design office in Maranello. Unwilling to re-locate to Italy, Barnard's 1997 F310B was to be his last design when Todt appointed South African Rory Byrne as Chief Designer and Englishman Ross Brawn as Technical Director. In the summer of 1997 FDD was purchased from Ferrari and became B3 Technologies ending Barnard's association with Ferrari. Although no longer part of the team, the designer's F310B chassis took Michael Schumacher tantalisingly close to the title and his victory at the Japanese Grand Prix was to be the last for a Barnard car.*  To answer your question, yeah maybe some British engineers are less willing than others to move to Italy (perhaps even more if they have family, kids, etc.) but after all I suppose that working for Ferrari (despite the current, long, streak without titles) is probably still a dream for most drivers & engineers, plus Italy is obviously not an ugly place to live.  Probably it also depends from the salary.
All the engineers in Italy went to Ducati, I think...
No, it's the catering department. Hence RB's success.
I do not necessarily agree. What Ferrari lacks are good engineers in general, not because of the country their hq is in. The cars that dominated from 1999-2008, (with the exception of 2005), where made in Maranelo. The quality of the current techincal team is just bad, and needs a complete overhaul. I find it unacceptable, for a traditional powerhouse in F1, to not be able to solve their problem of race pace and tire management for 6 months . And what I find even more unacceptable, is the fact that the team thought that the SF-23 would be the fastest car. So, either someone fucked up on the simulations, or someone presented false numbers to cover for the fact that the car is shit.
I agree with your theory that it’s a potential disadvantage. Sure Ferrari is one of the top teams in terms of resources and infrastructure but the added distance and cultural difference could possibly discourage some from making the move. Ferrari could try to compensate with more money but then it’s also less efficient under the budget cap now.   However the biggest factor is probably the upper management often getting too involved and intervening with their own politics causing added pressure and instability on the team.
Dump Leclunk.
> Italy has plenty of engineers and Ferrari has virtually no competition  They also offer shit pay if one of my colleagues is to be believed. However this is not for a real engineering position, but software development. (Still quite important I'd imagine with all the simulation work that's done these days)  He's a big F1 fan with an Italian wife so he was very excited when he got an opportunity to work there. In retrospect he says he wishes he asked about the salary after a trip to Maranello.
Yes it's a challenge to get people to go to Italy for work. But that usually doesn't apply for Ferrari.   Most people in racing dream of working for Ferrari, THE team of F1.
Ah yeah i fucked it up with putting McLaren on the list
Yes, but most of the F1 Engineering talent are UK citizens.
Yeah, honest mistake
You can hardly blame Barnard for not wanting to move to Italy. Guilford Technical Office (GTO, get it?), that was the office that birthed the type 640/641. Barnard wanted an isolated office away from Ferrari politics, which lead to the conditions where a secret second car was being developed in tandem by Harvey Postlethwaite and even shieled from Enzo by his son Piero.  https://ferriscars.com/ferrari-secrets-politics/  So maybe lesson not learnt when FDD was set up for the 2nd time, but the honest truth of those years was Ferrari really did lag the other teams badly in terms of human capital and talent, plus the stubborness of not dropping the v12's.
Ferrari catering used to be quite famous. I mean, I only recall people talking about their dishes, so I'm guessing there's no competition. Given that's an Italy Vs UK culinary comparison, I'm not surprised at all.
Every team offers shit pay, especially since the budget cap. Only if you are really talented and wanted you can ask for more.   Especially Ferrari can find plenty of people who accept this since they want to work for them even if they earn less than elsewhere
“Not for real engineering, but software development” oh dear lord.   But it is a pretty well known thing that F1 pays pretty low conpared to what you can earn in that field elsewhere
They also, relative to the sway UK teams have over UK engineers, have huge pull over the engineering talent in Italy. I think it's more likely a top engineering mind in Italy ends up in Ferrari than a top engineering mind from the UK ends up in a specific F1 team- where the UK engineer has to decide between all sorts of industries and THEN between 6(and a bit) F1 teams.
And it's not just Ferrari, Minardi was known for making the best coffee in the paddock, back in the day.
Ah that's sad. One of the real downsides of the budget cap.
The budget cap only includes the top 3 highest paid employees?
Dude literally ended my entire engineer career in a few words
It only excludes the top 3 highest paid employees

Ironic that the brand name is Celsius and they are sponsoring US only races. When the US is one of the only places on earth that does not use Celsius haha
I have personal beef with Celsius Energy.
Finally, a way for the team to get the best temperature for their tyres
So what is Celsius? They've been sponsoring multiple Nascar teams this year (sometimes multiple cars across different teams in the same race), they must have money coming in from somewhere, but I've never seen or heard of anyone actually buying it.
I feel cursed whenever I see Celsius because all I can think of seeing that word these days is that crypto company 🫠
Holy shit the energy drink wars have begun. I love my redbull it keeps me productive but… Celsius is so much better for you (most flavors are shit though).
Everyone thought Rick Ware Racing was going to take over motorsports we let Celsius slip under the radar./s
What? I wanted Fahrenheit instead
Celsius was bought by PepsiCo in August 2022, so basically it's Pepsi entering in the ring
The Rich Energy comparisons in comments here confuse the shit out of me. I can walk into Costco and buy a case of Celsius. Definitely more legit than Rich Energy.
[Direct link](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fs9T4I4XwAMF7t5?format=jpg&name=orig) \- Original Resolution Photo (1188x1136)
That reminds me, what happened to Rich Energy claiming they were returning?
Still wondering how long until Prime gets in on the action.
RB all the way
Energy drinks companies trying to sponsor in f1 seems like an odd choice there is a whole ass team based on one. I dont know how marketing works but why would celsius sponsor a car when red bull gets name dropped 100 times a race. And right now it even gets name dropped in combination with “the best” “winners” etc. Wont their energy drink be completely in the shadow of red bull?
Vape, crypto-currency and energy drinks, eh?  Other than Red bull, I wonder if these dodgy companies will become an iconic part of F1 history like Shell, Marlboro, Gulf, JPS etc. Somehow, I doubt it...
They’re already on Cup cars that don’t win, figured might as well get on a couple of F1 cars that aren’t winning either.
Lol.... I thought it was the Crypto shitcoin.
Rich Energy flashbacks
BIG RICH ENERGY 2.0
I thought it was David Stern 😩
They saw the gap in the market
They knew the name wouldn’t be taken
Why?
They make sparkling water and energy drinks, though they do seem to be more legit than Rich Energy
It's a pretty popular energy drink. I think it must be more popular with younger people because a lot of people my age love it.
It's just a regular seltzer or sparkling water with lots of caffeine added. It supposedly has 0g sugar and 200 mg of caffeine.
Seems to be quite popular in the states. Haven't seen or heard of it here in Canada....aside from temperature readings.
Live in the states and it’s by far the most popular energy drink in California, even over red bull at the moment. It’s sold at every gym, gas station, etc.  It’s advertised as a healthier, low sugar, fat burning energy drink. We all know it’s not true but it tastes amazing! Great pre-workout and pre-gaming drink
Celsius is *extremely* popular in Hollywood. As far as energy drinks are concerned, for celebrities and young professionals, its all they drink.
Pre workout/energy drink. Taste wise the best of energy drinks ive tasted.
Swedish energy drinks company. Makes pretty decent energy drinks. The raspberry Acai version is one of the best I've ever had.
I see them all the time in college
Swedish energy drink. IIRC first on the market here that have a lot more caffeine than a Red Bull/standard energy drink.
They sell them at Costco. They’re fairly new but not a vapor ware company
They should jail Alex
Why is it better for you?
Just wait until the FIA announces the acceptance of a new American F1 team in a couple months... Rick Ware Racing!
probably did some coke and forgot
They saw the gap and they went for it. If they didnt, they wouldnt be a true business.
A couple of years ago one of their factories must’ve had a big issue, and they sent out a bunch of mislabeled cans. Every flavor was mismatched and it was an issue that persisted for a long time. I tried contacting the company a bunch of different times both privately and on social media but was ignored. AFAIK they chose to not recall any of the drinks or do anything about it. So for several months in my area if you bought a Celsius energy drink, it was going to have an insane ginger taste that was very bitter and basically not drinkable.   https://www.reddit.com/r/energydrinks/comments/rgply0/its_not_just_you_your_celsius_tastes_like_ginger/  https://www.reddit.com/r/energydrinks/comments/rwx792/does_anyone_else_only_taste_ginger_when_they/  Here’s some other people complaining about it
Yup, it's a pretty common drink at my school.
I was about to comment that I haven't seen anyone my age drinking it, but I still sometimes forget that I am now too old to be considered one of "the youths" anymore
Huh. I’m in the states and this is the first I’ve heard about it. I’m not the target demographic tho, I don’t drink energy drinks so I never think to look at the selection.
I’m in my 20s and it’s wildly popular with just about everyone I know. I see it at the gym as a pre workout pretty frequently too.
I see it at gas stations and walmarts all the time but I've yet to see a single person actually purchase a can
I'm in California. Pepsi and Coca-Cola are more popular than a drink named after a temperature scale.
As a university student in Canada, where energy drinks are extremely popular and common, I have never seen it.  But now I’m curious to try it!
Something they can teach Ferrari race strategists .
Marketing department are racing drivers confirmed
>AFAIK they chose to not recall any of the drinks or do anything about it.   They were checking but never came back with an answer, true Ferrari moment.  jokes aside that sounds pretty disturbing, making a mistake is well... annoying but not fixing is just unbelieveable.
Normally in these threads when someone claims to have "personal beef" with a company I dismiss it, but I see you kept the receipts.  Step 1: accidentally mix massive amounts of ginger in every batch of your product   Step 2: ship it anyway and attempt to gaslight any customer who discovers it  Step: ???  Step 4: profit!  Someone who's good at math help me budget this my energy drink company is dying
>AFAIK they chose to not recall any of the drinks or do anything about it.  So, a perfect sponsor for Scuderia
Very interesting. Doing this in the US or Canada is grounds for prosecution, especially if they knew what was printed on the ingredients list didn’t match what was in the can.
Very scummy of them to not.afdress the issue. But the fact that people kept buying the stuff is hilarious.
Just like ferrari pit stops tyre sets
Lol your good. I think it’s most popular with high school and college age kids. Maybe they want to expand their market base.
That's fair. This was my first time hearing about them too lol. The only energy drinks I know are Monster, Red Bull, and Lucozaid. The first two cuz they're everywhere, the third because I used to chug their Gatorade type sports drink when I visited London 10 years ago.
Yeah it seems to have taken over the gap in the market Bang left when the company imploded.
Someone linked a thread in here about their "accidental" ginger flavoured drinks. There's definitely a market for them.
Well there’s no surprise two of the most recognizable drinks on earth are more popular
You just need to do more motocross stunts and ski down a cliff in august. RB does it all the time should be easy
> the third because I used to chug their Gatorade type sports drink when I visited London 10 years ago.  How popular was Lucozade in London 10 years ago?! I ask because they were a pretty prominent sponsor on the McLaren's back then, and I was kinda surprised, because I assumed it was kinda like Gatorade in market share? Or was it very popular and available a lot?  Thanks!
I wasn't old enough to know lol. That said, I did see them a lot at grocery stores.

>EX FERRARI BOSS SAYS NEW FERRARI BOSS HAS LOTS OF WORK TO DO.   Pretty much it, right?
Translation  Ferrari's start to the season has not been as expected, the Scuderia hoped to take a step forward and be closer to Red Bull, but the reality has been very different. Former Ferrari manager Luca Di Montezemolo assures that the Maranello team needs to rebuild to reverse the situation and points out that it is not a short-term crisis.   After three races, Ferrari only has 26 points and occupies fourth place in the Constructors' World Championship. The Scuderia's best result so far has been a fourth place for Carlos Sainz in Bahrain and the first reliability problems of the season already appeared in Charles Leclerc's car in the opening race. In addition, the SF-23 has shown a lower pace than its rivals in the long run, especially on the hard tyre.   Luca Di Montezemolo, who was president of Ferrari from 1991 to 2014, regrets the situation that the Scuderia is going through and assures that it is not a short-term crisis. " It's a knife in my wound . Ferrari is, together with my family, the most important thing in my life. It's painful for me, I'm sorry to see them like this," Di Montezemolo said in statements on the Italian television channel La7.   "I don't think it's a short-term crisis, it's a matter of reconstruction and we need to bring together the best coaches," the Italian pointed out.   Di Montezemolo remembers how he incorporated different new figures into the team to take a step forward and increase the Scuderia's record after a dry spell. Something that Ferrari considers should also do today.  "I brought Todt, Domenicali, Brawn and Byrne, Schumacher came later. There was also a serious crisis at the beginning, but a good team was built ," he commented.    "Even going to recover some technicians of different nationalities in the market, it would be necessary to bring culture to the company in the sectors where there is a need", he pointed out.   In addition, Di Montezemolo has highlighted the attitude that the team showed during the presentation, which he considers "incorrect" and has been disappointed at the lack of evolution of the car compared to 2022. "The triumphalist speeches at the presentation seemed incorrect to me " , Di Montezemolo has stated.   "I expected a car that was an evolution of last year," he indicated to close.
Gestures vaguely at 2017 and 18: No Ferraris problem really aren't short term anymore.  They are so systemic that right now I'm not even mad anymore that Maranello doesn't challenge Red Bull.  I genuinely have more hope for a Mercedes WCC fight then Ferrari winning more then 2 races. And I don't have any hope for a Merc WCC fight.
Yes, and I fucking hope top management is giving Fred freedom to do what he sees fit, otherwise it's bound to not work out again.....as it has previously  There is a reason why since Enzo's death, Ferrari was only winning titles when top management stayed away and let TP do his job
So... it's not next year then. It's the next-next year. Let's go!
Says the guy who started the whole crisis at Ferrari by sacking Schumi-Todt and Brawn in 2006...
they say that every 5 years
[removed]
I think many forgot that Ferrari weren't any good for the majority of its history. The early 00s success was an outlier and boy what a dominating outlier that was, it even manage to fool a large part of the generation into thinking Ferrari = winning. Just look at stats, for such an historic team they just didn't win as much as u would have thought. Being bad is what they do, being bad is the norm, what we are witnessing is Ferrari performing up to its standard.
It's simple, ferrari not interested in f1, they don't have the hunger.  Something is off, not money or drivers... must be upper management
Yeah, yeah, we've heard this every year for the past 15 years. Move along...
As long as they keep their strategist it will always be long term whatever else they do.
Reconstructing since 2009
Ferrari and reconstruction is a tale as old as Enzo.
Ferrari needs less italians
Ross and Jean ain't walking through that door.
Death, taxes and LdM
Ferrari will be competitive after the “prancing prince” is long gone
Well he’s the one that hired the right people in the ‘90’s and left them alone even when things didn’t go well or even outright wrong. That paid of about 8 years later when Michael won them the first title in 2000.  I think he can criticise the current leadership that keeps thinking short term
Ferrari has been in reconstruction since Montezemolo deliberately destructed the winning team, just so that he could feel that he is still the guy in charge.
Ted related something Leclerc said to him after 2022: Ferrari is 5% off everywhere. That's not the work of one winter or a light-switch. Leclerc said the step from 21-22 was required *again* to finally do the job.
Largely what Marko said before one car had turned a wheel.
Probably a slow build up towards next decade...
Next-next year has been working marvelous at Haas.
I was just about to say that. The guy destroyed the most successful team in the history of Ferrari just to placate his own ego.
And rejected plans for a new wind tunnel as well.
They don't need to de-italianize. They just need to get Mario Draghi
Strategy is not their only problem, it's a gaping hole in their aresenal, alogside their inability to read anykind of weather forecast, but they have so many much deeper issues then just that.  They lost multiple chances to win drivers and constructors titles due to bad updates. They lost 3 years of engine development due to either cheating or not clearing their ideas with the FIA as other teams have done for years.  These issues date back at least 3 managment changes for the F1 team, so either they got unlucky 3 times or the issues are not in the managment.
Part of F1 kid, if you don't, you end up an also ran in the pages of F1 history. And there's been a few
Yes but he is also the one who forced the destruction of that dream team of Todt Brawn and Schumacher.   2006 Schumacher was forced out because of politics with Montezemolo.
> Well he’s the one that hired the right people in the ‘90’s  Montezemolo is a fool that got lucky.  He fired Todt in 96, after the French GP, and Schumacher gave him an ultimatum that he is leaving with him   or Todt comes back.  And let’s not talk about how he destroyed the winning team just to feel that he is in charge.
Montezemolo has a long relationship with Ferrari. He was part of the team which took Niki Lauda to the championship in the 70’s. He left, and then came back in the early 90’s.   He was Ferrari’s president during the Schumacher era, but his team at the team wasn’t trouble free. There were a lot of issues before Todt and Brawn came in, he also mismanaged the team during the late 00’s and early 10’s.   One great achievement doesn’t erase his missteps…
He's also the fool who fired them all in 2007/2008, and possibly made Schumacher retire in 2006.
They were, are, and will always be Italian. They need to get away from power struggles within the ranks and work as a team. They build a chassis and the engine and have done so since inception, by no means an easy task from an overall engineering perspective. Ppl always shit on them when they don't do well, but just being in the hunt after so many years is a great accomplishment
It was the same after they threw the 2017 and 2018 championships, and Arrivavene was axed. Binotto was the man to lead the multi-year project to get all parts of Ferrari functioning again. Four years later and we're at the exact same point again. It's groundhog day in Maranello.
Well was he wrong? Schumacher cost about 100 million a year, meanwhile Kimi took the title in 2007 anyway.
I think you might have missed the joke. Just like ferrari, italian politics is a shitshow of internal struggles and getting nothing done. So then some two years ago the politicans collectively decided this was not working out and decided they would instate Mario Draghi as prime minister. Draghi was not connected to any party, he had been the head of the european central bank and was selected to bring some braisn into italian government, very succesfully so. That is was ferrari needs aswell, a team principle with some sense in his brain
And Arrivabene was (if I remember correctly) brought in to get order into Ferrari after the defeats in 14 and 15.
Michael would have won 2008. Ferrari's downfall started with Michael leaving.
Kimi took that title with luck since Mclaren was too busy fighting itself.  Schumacher would have won 07 and 08 quite easily, the car made also  a huge step from 06 to 07.
Kimi "it's just a hobby" Raikkonen checked out after that one title, Michael would have kept going for more.
Username does not in fact check out.
You think michael wouldn't have won in 2007?
They need to abolish political in fighting and get on with the job that they are very capable of doing .
I mean so would Massa if Renault literally didn't rig a race lol, their "downfall" from perennial champion to getting P2s and P3s began when they committed too many resources to the 08 championship battle and were behind the 8-ball for the 09-13 style cars - after which the turbo hybrid regulations made to keep Mercedes and only Mercedes winning did their job
Yeah I doubt Michael leaving in 2006 did anything really for Ferraris downfall. In 2007 Kimi won the championship. In 2008 Massa was a pit stop and a slow Timo Glock away from the championship. In 2009 the new regulations meant that Brawn and RB got a massive head start on everyone else and the Ferrari was only ever the 3rd/4th best car that year. Then in 2010 Alonso came in. Realistically firing Michael did little to nothing, except maybe delivering the 2007 championship more dominantly and possibly delivering the 2008 championship.
In his McLaren days Kimi was seen as the fastest driver on the grid with Alonso. He was seen as one of the best talents in F1 according to Michael himself. He was younger, cheaper and didn't get into politics. If you don't ignore the context, it is very understandable why Ferrari went with him.   Also he was there to pick up the pieces in 2007. You win as a team, you lose as a team. Ferrari and Kimi won as a team, Mclaren and their drivers lost as a team. Simple as that.
Maybe, maybe not. He checked out after 2006 too, because any team would have signed him immediately if he wanted too. I’m not saying he lost his edge at all, but clearly Ferrari were fearing he was becoming bigger than Ferrari
Btw, I delved deeper into this and it was Michael’s own call to leave. He wasn’t pushed out.  https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-news/3849/why-michael-schumacher-quit-f1-and-why-he-returned/
Of course he would, but for at least 60 million more than Kimi.  Don’t forget Kimi was the prodigy at that time along with Alonso. Nobody expected he would just kinda check out after winning a WDC.
Massa made a lot of mistakes which a close to his prime Michael would never make. With him it wouldn’t come down to the last race because Michael was way more consistent than Massa.
Don't forget Hamilton got robbed in Spa. And I am a Massa fan, but Massa didn't lose just due to the crashgate race.
It made Todt leave as he signed agreements together with Schumacher, and since Brown dint get promoted to TP he left as well, then all this made Stepney unhappy which resulted in spygate.
  Kimi and Fernando were seen as the fastest drivers of the new generation. Schumi was still around.   Also kimi going to ferrari was a powerplay by di montezemolo, because he felt he was "not  enough " in charge of the team as chairman of ferrari.    Besides his role as TP and GM of the racing division of ferrari Jean Todt was also  appointed CEO   of  ferrari by the  agnelli family in 2004.   Ever since that date Montemelo wanted to break the dream tream. He hired kimi in 05 for 07 without anyone knowing about this.  Schumachers task in 06 besides  winning the championship was to prepare Massa to lead Ferrari in the future.  When kimi was announced Schumacher had no choice but to retire or force Massa out.  Ross Brawn was also  fed  up with this and left at the end of 06  with Schumacher.  Todt was the only one left and he wanted out as well, he made one more year to prepare Domenicalli for the role as TP.  And retired as CEO and special advisor immediately.   Even Domenicali said some years ago that with Schumacher or Alonso in the car they would have easily won 07 and 08.
> In his McLaren days Kimi was seen as the fastest driver on the grid with Alonso. He was seen as one of the best talents in F1 according to Michael himself.   Kimi was seen as unrefined diamond. The expectation was that he will get better used to working with people, become a leader and then he will be the finished package. The latter never really happened, at least no to the extend Ferrari expected.
Well arguably he was bigger than Ferrari because him leaving did the team no good. But imo there wasn’t really a problem with Michael being bigger than Ferrari because he was very loyal and his work ethic was great. But power hungry higher ups usually don’t see it that way especially at Ferrari.
But why taking your chances with a prodigy when you have The Michael in your team? He didn’t show any serious signs of decline and no TP worth his salt would replace him. You only do that in some twisted powerplay and it was good to see karma bit them in the ass.
Many close championships have controversial decisions. 1994's title deciding crash, 1984's red flag at Monaco, just to name a few. It's part of it.  Only one has an actual rigged race in it, the existence of which was known to those in position to annul it but kept under covers to not damage the sport's reputation.
It seems people nowadays are rewriting history. Consensus 10 years ago was that he left on his own accords  https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/10igek/what_was_the_reason_behind_schumacher_leaving/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1  https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-news/3849/why-michael-schumacher-quit-f1-and-why-he-returned/
Because he outgrew any control. You can call it a twisted powerplay, but Schumacher had too much power over Ferrari. In the end “nobody is bigger than Ferrari” is very important to them.  And nobody knows how he would perform in those years. He quit the sport immediately and his eventual comeback wasn’t what he hoped it would bring
Well I didn’t know that. If brawn is saying it I tend to believe it. Thx for the info!
> and his eventual comeback wasn’t what he hoped it would bring  This is not really relevant because he hurt his neck in a motorcycle accident and it took a few years to heal. And while he needed a lot of time to adjust to the new cars his last season he was getting faster than Rosberg but because of his horrendous luck it doesn’t show in the points table. And seeing how close Rosberg could come to a prime Lewis I would say that a 40+ Michael would be close as well so still a top tier driver imo.
I believe it's due to articles like [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/22m9fd/the_story_of_how_luca_di_montezemolo_came_to_push/) often being shared. Alongside rumors and gosips everytime a Ferrari driver exit the team this century (Raikkonen-Santander wanting Alonso, Raikkonen-Maurizzio losing power, Vettel-Binotto, etc) ironically Alonso's departure was free from such rumors.
You kinda disregard what I say. I said it wasn’t what he hoped for, which are his own words.

Read the article on the BBC earlier and it felt a bit out of touch with how far F1 Academy is from actually being in Formula 1, it kinda felt like it was written by someone who had no idea of how the junior series work
I wish she would drive F3 and then go from there if she is as good as the article makes her to be, combined with ambitions to make it into F1.
Calling someone who came 9th in British F4 a future F1 star is pretty silly.  Gotta get those clicks though I suppose.
Vettel couldn't rent a car in Europe in 2011 as the sitting world champion.
Ah another worthless article written soley because she's a female and not male.  Can you drive? Literally all we care about...
Biased but we do need a Scot back on the grid
> if she is as good as the article makes her to be  9th in GB4 last year with no podiums or poles. Which doesn't seem so bad [until you see that there were only 9 full time drivers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_GB4_Championship#Drivers'_championship) and she finished behind someone who only competed in half the races.  The woman who finished 6th in GB4 last season did 1 season in W series in 2019 and had a best finish of 14th.
Not even British F4, she raced in GB4 which has a lower standard of drivers than British F4 (and uses the old F4 car/isn’t eligible for SL points).
Correction - can you drive fast is all we really care about.
Would have liked Dario Franchitti to have more of a go once upon a time. Sadly it'll be Paul Di Resta as the last Scottish driver for some time to come.
 #PerthDreams
Sir Jackie Stewart's clearly itching for a comeback!
She isn't even the highest ranked GB4 driver in the upcoming F1A season.
Tbh I am pretty sure it was her first year in open wheelers right?
Well shit. That’s even more damning. I just misread it as the (far more legitimate) British F4 because I didn’t know what GB4 was. Turns out it was formed last year. Yikes.
True! Lol
We are checking
Even GOATifi drove fast. Really really fast. But wasn’t as fast as the others. She’s not even on Raghunathans level at this stage…
It was but F4 level is full of first year open wheeler drivers, including 3 of the top 4 of that season.

Out of all teams I hope Aston Martin continues to improve, based on the simple fact it's always nice to see a different team at the front, specially one that hasn't won championships in any form before. Closest for Aston was as Jordan in the 90s.
Fernando Alonso podiums could bore fans
Fernando winning a race is basically the only thing I'll watch the season for. I think a 42 year old winning after being in the sport for more than 20 years is good story for the history books.
Translation :-  **"We are in the wind tunnel every week and there will be new parts in Baku," says McCullough, head of performance. By regulation they have more time than Red Bull, Ferrari or Mercedes.**      Formula 1's three-week break before heading to the Azerbaijan GP (30 April) will allow the factories to put the first aerodynamic evolution packages in place. AS chats to Aston Martin performance director Tom McCullough about his predictions for Alonso and Stroll's AMR23 in that development race against Red Bull: "Their car is very strong on efficiency. The DRS effect is quite strong. But it's also very strong on the straights. Albert Park has a high sensitivity to DRS because there are four zones in a relatively short lap. It's a strong car in the corners and very strong on the straights."      "It's more likely that (the RB18's advantage) is fundamentally aerodynamic efficiency. I don't have all the data, if you look at the other Honda-powered cars," says the British engineer. That efficiency or low air resistance will be crucial in Baku or Miami, but not the whole season will be guided by those standards: "The Red Bull was already efficient last year. Baku and Miami will be circuits where efficiency is very important, but later on there are low efficiency circuits like Monaco or Barcelona. The first three circuits of the World Championship are not typical throughout the year. Now we have a lot of Grand Prixs on high efficiency tracks, but throughout the year we will have more low efficiency events and we have designed the car for the whole season". So far, that's three third places for the two-time Spanish champion, who is also third in the championship behind Verstappen and Pérez. In the constructors' standings, the Silverstone-based team is second behind Red Bull.      Aston Martin has more time in the wind tunnel than Red Bull, Ferrari or Mercedes; because they finished the last Constructors' World Championship in seventh position. "It's definitely an advantage, we try to use it as much as we can. The more time you have, the more sessions you do and the more things you can analyse," acknowledges the engineer. "We are every week in the wind tunnel looking for development avenues that can bring significant performance, keeping the cost ceiling in mind. From Baku onwards, parts will come in. It's really the process that everyone is doing right now," he explains. And what is the AMR23's weak point, and what are they looking for? "Lap time compared to the Red Bull. In the corners and on the straights".      ***The trade-off between cost and competitiveness***      Regarding the other podium rivals, the situation is even: "Mercedes, Ferrari and we are close since testing. There are small differences between efficiency, slow corner, medium corner, fast corner. The cars do similar times but they do it in different ways. In any case, the single-seater trends may be a consequence of strategic decisions due to the cost ceiling, so we have to wait for the World Championship to visit more varied circuits. "Our car is more about cornering than straight line speed. Last year we made a lot of rear wings to have an optimal rear wing for many circuits, but that's very expensive. This year we have had the same wing for three races. We will introduce a rear wing at Baku, where a lot of efficiency is required, but we plan everything from a cost ceiling perspective," he concludes.
I hope they beat Mercedes and Ferrari to 2nd this year...give them a big ol' slap in the face, especially to Ferrari
I’m ready, buy the top speed upgrade! It’s like NFS right?
i hope alonso wins at least 1 race this year
EL PLAN!
It feels like Benetton in the 1990’s kinda, even though I never watched those races live it felt like they were consistently the “outsider” vs the big 3 (williams, mclaren, ferrari) until their acquisition of schumacher and innovations such as the refinement of the high nose concept.  Maybe aston can be that team leading into the next few years and continue to grow - I hope they can encourage even more red bull staff to jump ship, especially technical leads so that simultaneously the midfield gets stronger and the top team gets weaker
Let's see for how long Papa Stroll keeps the big bucks flowing.
They won’t beat RB but I’d love to see them come in 2nd. So many egos to prune at Mercedes, after 7 years it’ll be lovely to see.
Max Verstappen’s cool-down room podcast with co-host Fernando Alonso

Alonso podium domination will kill the sport.
He will end 3rd in every single race this season. 345 points is enough for the championship.
I want to see Nando [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZdy8EvRmu0) again, if not this year then maybe in the next two. I know the clock is ticking for him but it would be great to see this type of passion again on top of the podium which has become rather rare since the Hamilton/Verstappen era of domination.
What if I want to be bored?
I think it’s the RB19 right?
This might be a hot take after 3 races, but I don't see Ferrari recouping enough points and positions to beat out Aston Martin.  Come November, Aston Martin will finish ahead of Ferrari. Unthinkable just 2 months ago.
I can see them finishing above Ferrari considering how disaster they can be, however I don’t see them above Mercedes, specially when their line up is more solid
1995 was their real top dog season. Before 1994 they were consistently third/fourth best, in 1994 they had a slower car than Williams but *gestures at what happened to Williams and Adelaide 1994*, from 1996 on it was a slow decline
For a long time as he seems rather passionate about the project of making AM champions. The real question is how well they can turn the allowed budget into performance.
ft. 2nd place

Sebscri.....nope. He's gone now :(

It’s named the RB19 but it’s really an RB18B
Yeah, then kind of rebounded after the renault acquisition.  Makes me think, with increased investment from the top 7 teams I think we’ll see more parity in the future.  What’ll give midfield teams a disadvantage in the budget cap is an inability to spend over the cap and fund offshoring projects like advanced technology divisions such as aston’s.  I think as these cost cap regs mature and loopholes are sealed it’ll be easier for outsider teams to gain pace, so I’m rooting for the likes of aston alpine mclaren and sauber to close the gap.  Aston made a huge jump this year because of their acquisition of top red bull and mercedes engineers and I hope other midfield teams continue to follow suit
Was Benetton's slow decline primarily down to losing MSC + engineering talent to Ferrari and other teams?
I actually read an article a few weeks ago after Bahrain that said that Aston Martin stock price actually spiked after Alonso's podium. If it's really related, then Lawrence's investment might be more than just passion. Not sure how true this is, though. I know absolutely nothing about finance.
Essentially yes. The 1996 car could've probably challenged for the title in the hands of Michael but the team lost him and anyone else who knew how to make a car tailored to Michael work (Johnny Herbert and the engineers). I'm almost positive that if they had retained Herbert alongside Al*si 1996 would've gone differently, but we can't play what if
I know even less about finance but success = fame and fame = money makes sense to me I think
It certainly did spike after the first race, since then has been trailing back down again.

As a big fan of both I would love to see it but I have a really hard time imagining how it would work logistically (ticket prices, having both Dorna and FOM doing TV production, FIA/FIM stewarding and race direction, how would it work with team garages, motorhomes and many other things).   It would certainly be a massive event. With how tribal motorsport fans can be it would be interesting to see how people in the grandstands would behave lol.
Throw in *Same Time* for the funny.
Wonder how much those tickets would be.
Run both races simultaneously, and in opposite directions, you cowards
Would this like skyrocket the ticket prices? Would be a bit tricky if you there only for MotoGP or only for F1
Would be quite difficult to achieve safety wise, not going to lie here.  The amount of rubber left down by F1 cars in areas that aren't part of the traditional MotoGP racing line would be downright dangerous for MotoGP bikes to race on the same circuit at the same weekend.  I love both series, I would personally prefer they be kept separate - as someone who watches in the wee hours of the morning for most of both seasons - can you keep them on different weekends please so I don't have to pull an all nighter and a full day on race weekends?!
fantastic idea
If this was to happen, its gonna be one hell of an event no doubt about it, it would definitely be a standout event of the year, but where would you host it?
As a fan would be great but the issue imo is Moto GP, they'll need to drop moto 2 and 3 that weekend. But as a spectacle for the fans it would be Pinnacle of Motor racing.
Awesome. Now sell those tickets at MotoGP prices, not F1 prices please and thank you.
Likely not ideal for F1, people will see what actual racing looks like. I was an F1 and motorcycle fan, but never watched GP. Now that I do, F1 is nap time time from lap 3 until 5 laps before finish.
Hmmm, sounds good in theory but...
Oh God, that sounds expensive.  Cool,  but expensive
Same time
Multi ~~class~~ discipline racing let’s go!
As someone who has never liked bike racing im not interested in seeing both.
You also have to consider the junior categories. With F2 and F3 it’s a bit easier, just don’t have an F2 or F3 round. But Moto2 and Moto3 are joined with MotoGP at the hip
Doesn't spa have a 2nd pit lane for endurance racing? That could work surely
Also, different layouts needing potentially different wall setups  Could work at silver stone or spa where there’s a whole extra set of garages
Scenes when Russell hits Bagnaias moto and sends him flying to the other side of track
F1 multi class.
Project Gotham Racing 4 flashbacks.
A lot. More than that it they do it in the US.
Funny that my first thought was "I'd buy those tickets"  Then my secong thought was "Damn, those tickets would be mad expensive"
RED FLAG  RED FLAG   RED FLAG  RED FLAG
Are there any fia sanctioned figure 8 tracks?  /s
Including ramps, for both types
Wreckfest with F1 cars and bikes, take my money.
Probably would be super expensive, but Motogp tickets are pretty cheap compared to F1. You can get VIP stand Spanish GP tickets for €190 for 3 days
Doesn't more rubber mean more grip? What would be the problem for Moto GP lines? Of course if it rains it's a whole different discussion with rubber spreading everywhere.
Thank you! As someone who raced bikes at the club level and marshalled tracks at the pro level, the amount of safety issues that would arise from the marbles and other possible debris is completely unacceptable. The amount of lean angle MotoGP bikes are running is absolutely insane. If you see that up close no way anyone with a shred of sanity would think you could run both events on the same weekend.
Would probably need to either be spain or Malaysia for it to not just completely be F1 fans. Motogp will have good racing basically everywhere so it would probably just be where F1 is good as well
Indianapolis
They do it for Laguna Seca no? Because of California's ban on 2-stokes.
Laguna Seca was a Motogp only event due two the 2-stroke engine ban in California.
Silverstone as well right? Doesn't MotoGP already used the alternative one/not one used by F1.
As fun as spa would be, I think the bikes really lack the downforce for that track. It’s doable, but not exactly the safest thing in the worldvv
*Blimey. It's like he's riding for his life.*
Bagnaia does not need anyone's help to crash, unfortunately.
I actually don’t know if “in the US” would make that big a difference. F1 is outrageous here in terms of tickets in the first place, but MotoGP is pretty far down the list of motor sports Americans are interested in. If anything I’d bet that it’d be less expensive than other countries as a way to draw more people into the sport
Suzuka, lower the straight with the bridge to make the intersection. Flat surface single piece front wings to make launching the Moto GP guys safer.
This would absolutely fuck over moto gp fans.
They'd want to be cheap, everytime I watch moto GP the stands are not full. If kinda empty stand is out of reach for fans who is the market for that ticket?
MotoGP riders don't have the same racing lines as F1 drivers do in their cars. Regardless of who would go first, the grip gained and then suddenly lost would probably cause issues. Probably less so for the F1 guys, but the MotoGP riders would probably be in a real pickle if some of them fell off their bikes mid corner.
A rubbered in track is good for grip, however F1 leaves a lot more rubber down than motorcycle racing does - doing a club trackday on a bike after stock standard cars have rubbered in the track is sketchy enough into some corners, let alone the massive marbles of rubber left by high downforce F1 cars which shed so much from their tyres because of the force applied to the tyres.  Also, motorcycle racing lines are gonna be different to F1 racing lines (as F1 cars can brake later and carry more speed through corners), which means the rubber will be laid out mid-lean and has the risk of destabilising the bikes in their cornering. Not so much of an issue in a four-wheeled car, but an open-cockpit two-wheeled machine becomes a lot more dangerous.  That said, I'm not a safety engineer for motorsports, so I imagine this has been floated by the respective safety commissions before going public?
[CIRCUIT DE CATALUNYA INTENSIFIES]
Agree. I have a huge respect for the Moto GP but I’m not interested in it the same way I like cars. I rather see other race series like they have now on a lot of European stops with F2, F3 and Porsche Super Cup.   I think in my country there’s even some rivalry between racecar or motorracing. So it’s not necessary that they are equally interested in the other one.
The issues is having too much people in the paddock, between moto GP and F1 there is going to be plenty imagine adding the feeder series it would be mayhem.
Isn't moto2 and moto3 now 4 stroke?
wow that's dumb
Of course it's California
They ran super cars,f2/f3 and F1 in Melbourne on the same weekend just a handful of days ago. It was fantastic too. You might not love moto GP but if you're in the stands you'll get a hell of a show that day
I imagine the FIA, FOM, the FIM, and Dorna could all work out some kind of special week where F3/F2 and Moto2/3 don't attend and it's just the MotoGP and F1 sessions. Idk I feel like the cross pollination would do wonders for both sports. Not to mention expose more people to MotoGP and potentially bring them more profits.
I actually don't know lol 😅 it's been a whiles since I've watched!

Best bet for this is probably the FIA document at the beginning of each race weekend that teams have to fill out stating any updates to the car if they have any.
[f1technical.net](https://f1technical.net) has threads on each car and upgrades are typically noted in them, though might be hard to find the upgrades specifically within the other discussions
That's pretty handy. Follow-up question... Is there a way to tell which of the 2 cars (per team) the upgrades are applied to?
Where can you access this? Is there a link?
Usually he tweets more details as a follow up, or you can check Scarbstech as well for that!
Albert Fabrega always posts all the upgrade sheets on his Twitter page on Fridays during race weekends.
I think only media has access to it so your safest bet is following someone like Albert Fabrega on Twitter
Cool thanks.

Assuming their cars remain neck and neck, I believe Stroll will be the deciding factor. Russel, Hamilton, and Magic are definitely going to perform well. He needs to have his best year yet for AM to win
'Sainz being on Leclerc‘s pace now' – hard disagree on this, unfortunately.
Mercedes imo. Aston Martin have the better car at the moment, but in my opinion they still have to prove that they can keep an advantage over the course of a season. And Merc is really good when it comes to developing their cars.
Mercedes because considering how well they developed last year by the end, i think they'll outperform aston because as a team they have a lot of experience and knowledge as compared to aston
I'm gonna guess Mercedes because Russell and Hamilton are neck and neck and Stroll is usually quite a bit behind Fernando.
Mercedes because I feel Stroll will hold Aston back as the season goes on.
I’d go for Merc
I'll go for Merc over AM, because of the drivers.
I would say Mercedes.   More consistent driver pair compared with Aston Martin. Stroll isn't stable enough in terms of performance. And Mercedes still has a better car then Ferrari currently. It's not half as bad as Toto and Lewis try to let us believe it to be
Mercedes. They're already taking points off Aston Martin and they have the better pairing such that I think, even if both cars are fairly equal, that George and Lewis will always be ahead of Lance and that Charles will mostly also be in front of Lance. The point difference between those positions gives Mercedes the advantage. I think whether or not this comes to fruition will be known very quickly in the next few races when Mercedes brings out their new car.
Aston Martin if Alonso keeps getting 3rd place every race of the season, how great that would be?
Mercedes, they are already matching Aston on race pace, they will outdelop them in all main areas during the season. But I think Aston will stay ahead of Ferrari and the rest
Mercedes, I think Merc can outdevelop Aston and Ferrari and also have better drivers than the other 2. The fact that Merc are close to Aston now means they'll be ahead in 20 races time
Is it not wild that we have more faith in AM, a team that has designed its first top 3 car, over Ferrari?
I have a feeling it will be Mercedes. I would like to see Aston Martin get up there but I have a feeling that Merc is starting to get their stuff in order. Their driver line up is a little more solid. Not to say Alonso isn’t. I trust in Fernando. It’s Lance that seems a little more unreliable.   My guess is Red Bull, Mercedes, Aston, Ferrari (barely), McLaren. Not a lot different from what it currently is but we’ll see.
Ferrari, their pace was strong in Melbourne. Results dont really show though.
Aston Martin, assuming they don’t channel their inner Ferrari and fall off of a cliff after the summer break
Redbull /s
Ferrari will have an awakening starting in Baku and will steadily chip away at Aston's and Mercedes' lead to be 2nd overall by season’s end.
Merc or Aston. Those 2 will battle for 2 and 3.
Mercedes and I think there will be a considerable gap to third place
Merc.
Mercedes. Nothing wrong with the car that they can’t make better, and two top drivers. AM has a great car, but not convinced they can make it better, and have one great driver, one good one. Ferrari has two great drivers…but it’s Ferrari.
Merc
Ferrari. Hope springs eternal. But seriously; if the Baku rumors are true, it’ll be interesting
Mercedes, I think they'll out develop Aston as the year goes on. Ferrari are hard to read, they'll either get it together and suddenly become competitive or stay 4th best.
I’m way too scared to call it at this point. I think there’s a chance of AMR being out developed plus Stroll needing to be consistent is a risk. Equally, have we seen the best of Ferrari? Absolutely not. Mercedes look like a good candidate though.
I'm giving Stroll the benefit of the doubt at the moment because of his injury, but starting next race he needs to bring in more points. There's no reason to assume Mercedes can't finish second given last year's season.   Alonso isn't going to have a great race every weekend for the rest of the year. If Stroll doesn't start getting big points while also reducing the points Mercedes brings home, Alonso will be having a very hard fight outscoring them by a big enough margin to carry Aston.  Ferrari is a bit of a dark horse, but it seems to be too slow for 2nd.  Races like Melbourne aren't representative on a whole, but they sure as heck are making it harder for themselves for the rest of the year. I'd be almost shocked if they stay in the fight for second.
Verstappen first with enough points to win the constructors by himself and perez in second with enough points to come second solo.
I want AM to do it. Just because I'd enjoy the humiliation of a customer team beating their works team.
Aston Martin. They got more wind tunnel time than Mercedes, so when Mercedes bring upgrades so will Aston Martin.
Way to soon to tell based on 3 races.  Once the 3 teams start bringing upgrades it should become clearer.
Red Bull
Ferrari
Mercedes. Russell/Hamilton is a very balanced pairing. Alonso/Stroll isn’t.
Mclaren if they can keep the australia results throughout the remaining races and add the time with the baku upgrades
The Old Man
Ferrari. Charles has not had a single clean weekend yet and he has much more race pace than Sainz
Perez on his own, then Aston Martin, then Mercedes.
Verstappen probably will end with enough points for that too.
Mercedes, Ferrari and AM 4th.
Lol that Ferrari have got about 10% of the vote here.
Probably Mercedes, though I wouldn't rule out Ferrari if they can shake off this horrific start and actually start finishing races up to their potential.
I think Mercedes, their two drivers are very solid and last year its car evolved a lot, I assumed this year won’t be different at all.
Mercedes. They have two solid drivers and generally speaking less mechanical issues than any other contender.
If Ferrari can sort out their TD39 hangover issues quickly and they actually progress with their upgrades throughout the season, I can’t see them finishing lower than 2nd.
I have a feeling Mercedes will be better placed than AM to improve over the season and end up second
Ferrari or Mercedes
Probably Red Bull
Mercedes. They have two top drivers in Hamilton and Russell.  Aston Martin might run them close, but while Alonso is still in top form and capable of matching and beating the two Mercedes drivers, I'm not convinced Stroll can do that often enough. The one positive is that Stroll is consistent and races well.  Unless things improve quickly, I don't see Ferrari challenging for runner-up.
I like how everyone assumes Ferrari will win the title
I’ll eat my girlfriends panties if it’s Austin Martin
I think it's still too early to say but if I had to bet: Mercedes. It's a tall order for Fernando to carry Aston Martin to 2nd place. Stroll just isn't on the same level as him or the Merc pair. I also doubt Aston Martin can out-develop Mercedes to the point that it compensates for it.   All I'm hoping for is a good battle between these two teams, which I'm sure we'll get.
Aston seems like the safe choice but given those odds I'd probably wager my fiver on Ferrari if I was forced to bet.
Mercedes  Their experience and budget will take over later in the season
I think Mercedes is just gonna out-develop AM tbh.
Merc or AM
Mercedes.  It's a better driver lineup than AM offers I think AM are also at their peak level right now, I don't think they'll be able to keep ahead of Mercedes' development.  I actually think AM are going to end up 4th overall by the end of the season, provided Ferrari get their shit together.
Mercedes because Stroll is no Alonso.
Mercedes.   They are always really strong at developing their cars.   Ferrari usually lose it in the second half of the season. Aston Martin won't be able to keep up the pace with an organisation like merc
If he doesn’t it’ll be like 2020 where his underperformances (but he had great races with some bad luck tbf) handed mclaren 3rd place when the rp20 was realistically the 2nd fastest car for a number of races
Sainz outqualifies Leclerc by less than a tenth and all of a sudden he’s “on Leclerc’s pace now” lol  The bar people set for Sainz (and Perez for that matter) is so low.
Thought I was the only one to see that lmao
Merc is also strategically and operationally solid, they rarely make mistakes or underperform. That gives them a massive edge over AM and especially Ferrari.  Although when they fuck up it tends to be real big fuckups.
I agree. Last year Merc went from actually mid to winning a race, the year before Redbull solidly showed up with a better car before Merc out developed them throughout the season. The same applies to most of the Ferrari challenged that Seb had around 17/18, where Merc just got better than everyone.    Additionally, Merc has a better pairing.  You can weigh Lewis against Alonso and argue whose better, but there is no debate Russell is better than Stroll (until someone shows up talking about how Stroll beat him in F3)
I agree- starting a season strong has been done by dozens of teams, finishing strong is harder. Mercs development and drivers should shine through. Ferrari could yet get it together and push in the points too tho I’m not ruling them out yet for 2nd
" Merc is really good when it comes to developing their cars "  Idk why put this feels off 🤣
What is the record for most 3rd in a season. I want nando seal a 23
They were top 4 in 2020 so they at least have some experience at the pointy end
I agree with all you said except I think it would be Alpine at 5th, not McLaren.
>"Ferrari (barely), McLaren. "  I want the shit your smoking.
Alpine ahead of McLaren
Agreed. Early season DNFs make them look worse than they are. Ferrari is Ferrari but their pace is still strong and the rest of the season won't be as bad
I don't think Stroll will add enough to the points for that, I think Ferrari is still gonna be 2nd and Merc/Aston fighting for 3rd.
About that car going boom? I think so.
They could do that finishing third as well. Wouldn't that be even better, in terms of humiliation as well?
Their wind tunnel time will be decreased significantly at the start of July already. So the advantage they currently have won’t be a guarantee I reckon.
Thats why its a prediction
RB gets both 1st and 2nd. Possibly 3rd
2nd fastest ≠ 2nd best  Reliability played a big factor for Lance, both mechanically and with his tyre failures and incidents that weren’t his fault.  The guy is still driving with broken wrists and toe, so he’s done pretty well to keep up, all things considered
Lance had shit luck after the mugello crash he: got Leclerc’d in lap 1 at Russia, got COVID and didn’t do Nurburgring, DNF at portimao, no points finish in Imola (first race he finished after the crash) and then turkey where he had an awesome pole position but RP fucked up his front wing balance and he finished P9. Then Bahrain where kvyat flipped him at the restart so another DNF, P3 at sahkir and he forgot how to overtake at Abu Dhabi 2020 so that is the only one on him.   Again, he had shit luck after the mugello crash. That’s easily like 50 points they lost just with him. McLaren lucked into that P3.
>where his underperformances (but he had great races with some bad luck tbf) handed mclaren 3rd place  IMO Stroll didn't underperform in 2020 at all. Midway through the season, after the Italian GP, he was leading best of the rest.  Then came a streak of horrible luck. In Mugello, his tire failed. In Russia, he was crashed out by Leclerc doing one of his desperate moves. In Germany he had COVID.   After that, his mojo was somehwat gone: In Portimao he collided with Norris which was deemed a racing incident, but tbf that was one of those moments where Lance just drives as if there is no other car around him. In Imola he just did not have a pace. Then came the infamous Turkish Grand Prix, where he scored pole but failed to deliver meaningful points due to undiscovered front wing damage. In Bahrain 1 he was crashed out by Kvyat.  In Bahrain 2, he scored a podium. Probably the performance that I found most disappointing was Abu Dhabi 2020, where he was stuck behind Ocon with little creativity to overtake.
To be fair, Perez's engine blowing up in Bahrain cost them 3rd place. McLaren got a bit lucky with that.
Didn’t racing point get points deducted for the pink Mercedes incident that cost them P3?
They were also disqualified from a few results, dropping some of their points
Yeah, really haven't had a chance to see this, have we?  Leclerc was way ahead of Sainz in race 1, and had a failure.  Grid penalties in race 2. And didn't turn a race lap in race 3.  So kind of hard to say what Leclerc's pace would have looked like had he actually run a normal race.  On the other hand Leclerc could be a head case at this point and Sainz will have the better of him this year. But that has yet to be shown.
>strategically and operationally  This is key here. So far, Stroll has been several places behind Alonso and AM prioritized Alonso due to him being in podium positions.   What's gonna happen when it's Alonso vs Stroll for a podium position? We have seen how they treated Seb in terms of strategy.
A lot of the people that didn't make mistakes at Mercedes are now at AM, and have a lot of wind tunnel time.
During the season.  Have to remember last season Lewis literally wasn't making it to Q2 in quali.  Then they won a race and Lewis got on the podium 5 races in a row.  And that car looked a lot worse than this one.
I could see it. I’m a fan of what I call the original 3. Ferrari as my front runner, McLaren as my best of the rest, and Williams as my back marker.   I would say Alpine has the driver talent and car to do it. I believe they’re the only engine supplier that hasn’t had a DNF due to an engine related issue so far this year so it shows great reliability. They just need to get their act together.   I’m hoping we’re already seeing the change in McLaren after a rough start to the year and they continue to get stronger and stronger. Is a podium in their future, probably not. But I believe they can scrap a 4th and 5th spot every so often and continue to strategically get the points.
I have to belief with all the resources that the Scuderia have that they are able to pull their heads out of their asses and do what they were created to do. Don't get me wrong, I'm a Ferrari fan. I'm pulling for them. The last 3 races have been absolute pain. I believe they can do it.
> the rest of the season won't be as bad  Reminder that we are talking about Ferrari.
I thought that ferraris going boom was a garentee...
AM beating Ferrari after being THE backmaker team last year would give me a week long orgasm.
Red Bull #1. Verstappen #2. Perez #3. Aston #4 due to a Russell-Hamilton 'inchident', Mercedes #5, Ferrari #7 having bottled it so badly that Alpine caught them somehow.
Yeah fair enough
Fair enough, I gotta rewatch that season
Yeah abu dhabi 2020 was what I remember, and some weak racing in austria.  So it’s probably true that stroll was good in 2020 but for one reason or another it felt like his season was less impressive considering what the car was capable of under his hands in certain instances.  Also the fact that hulk out qualified him in silverstone painted him as not extracting as much pace as consistently as other drivers if hulk was able to find pace that quickly
Yeah but stuff like that happens on both sides, I thought norris’ engine in germany conked out in a favourable position too.  Too me the rp20 didn’t seem any less reliable than the mcl35
Both Bahrain and Abu Dhabi. Those two alone cost atleast 25 points.
Yeah, but to me the rp20 seemed faster than the mcl35.  15 point deduction is quite a bit but it just seemed like the rp20 could go for higher positions on a ton of tracks, notably hungary and sakhir.  Mclaren wasn’t 3+ tenths slower but they looked less consistently fast, and in 2020 it was the top 3 drivers then everyone else, allowing for huge points hauls for smaller teams
They weren't disqualified, they were handed a 15 points deduction.
True, even then it was a lot closer than maybe it deserved to be.  But then again comments like mine are very hard to validate so it’s hard to place blame on one driver or another.  To me stroll did an okay / good job, got 2 podiums and a pole position.  I just feel in races like portimao or abu dhabi he had performances that showed the car had pace but there were either lapses in pace or judgement.  Some incidents like mugello were out of his control, but it just felt like norris and sainz were doing more to fight for p3.  Not sure how else to describe it
Maybe the copium talks from me, but seeing Sainz pace in Australia, maybe the Ferrari isn't that bad(also Sainz got fucked by SC-Redflag), just Saudi was a bad-race (maybe wrong setup, unlucky SC) and they are the 2nd fastest team on the grid.   High chance if Leclerc manages to stay on track, he might have finished 2nd or 3rd this weekend.
I mean on strategy (and driving). Lewis and George are very reliable drivers and while Merc strategy is often conservative they rarely blunder.   Meanwhile AM has had more suspect strategy calls and while I like Lance he is rather error prone.
Yeah. They might have botched the new regs (although other teams would love to have their level of botched), but they are a force to re reckoned with over a season.
>But I believe they can scrap a 4th and 5th spot  Okay now I really want whatever you're smoking. Mclaren hasn't been close to any points so far on merit let alone 4th place. Only reason they have so many points is because literally 6 cars crashed out/got penalties.  I mean I'm not saying it can't happen but this is more wishful thinking than predictions made based on real trends
Merc strategy is weak tbh. Somehow I feel only redbull maximizes all strategy calls.  Aston seems like a distant #2.
Yes. But I’m still predicting McLaren 5th above Alpine. I don’t see anything remarkable coming out of Williams, Alfa, or Alpha Tauri. I think Haas will continue to be Haas and keep there head above water and the bottom of the pack. So then it comes down to Alpine, McLaren, and Ferrari. It’s not that I don’t think Alpine can do it, I just think McLaren is going to throw everything that have at solutions to get off the bottom.   No, I’m not going off any data but they definitely found some pace from the beginning of the year. I believe they were working on upgrades for Baku and I feel like Zak Brown has to be feeling the pressure if this recent restructure doesn’t yield some noticeable change.
lap 26 Sochi 2021, worst call I have ever seen
I mean even if they threw everything at it Alpine are already solid enough, well firmly below Ferrari, so McLaren have a lot of catching up to do.  Well, Zak Brown can feel all the pressure in the world, it doesn't mean they can come up with a better solution faster if the upgrades don't work as intended
