Sheesh, why are there so many AJ posts lately?
The tinmanator
Honestly, most youtube boxing channels are trash except a few like Rummy I dont know why people bother to share, some of these guys spam dozens of videos of non news or repeated topics and then complain that fighters are greedy lol  In most cases I just prefer to read a comment from the people here, it's more honest even if the takes are bad.
Boys, stop making excuses for AJ. Hes made over 100 million dollars to be a juiced up mediocre HW with great marketing and promotion. The man has made like 200+ million bucks to have shit fight after shit fight and you people keep making excuses for him. Its pathetic, he is what he always was. Feel bad and make excuses for guys who didnt get that lucky.
Hatman has made some good videos recently.
Every time he puts in a less than stellar performance the following 4 weeks on this subreddit seem to be dedicated to making sure everyone knows just how bad it was.  Its probably the same dozen or so people making all the posts though I'd imagine.
Because he’s a new breed of heavyweight   HIP HIP!
Casuals don't watch many fights, so when they do it gets discussed to death.
The British fans still think that the 2017 AJ is going to magically reappear. They got Jedi mind tricked by Eddie Hearn into believing that AJ was a world beater, when all he was doing was beating up 40 year old Eastern Europeans and domestic talent.
When I see immature comments like this my mate, I always just think "I hope for the person's sake that they are no older than 16"
Bang on fella and I'm a Brit! AJ is overrated and always has been. Muppets who know nowt about boxing lap up the Hearn bullshit shows. There are so many fighters out there, in all weight classes, that are far more deserving of accolades than a fighter like AJ. He isn't the worst fighter at all, he's just a bit above average fighter with huge physical attributes in a poor era of heavyweights. He's been exposed several times. Hearn has been fooling the public for yeasr into thinking he's a great and putting on these big shows against fighters that are less than stellar.
Whether it's the haters or the nuthuggers of guys like AJ, Canelo, Fury or whoever, the amount of posts about them just get a bit unbearable.
I'm British, but I never expected AJ to be the Heavyweight king at the end of the road. But he had a good reign as champion.
Pretty lame take. He's beat everybody he's faced except for Usyk but was competitive in both of those losses. He has several quality wins
Stop being biased cause you from Uk. I’ll tell you most of our American fighters suck too. Joshua won a belt from Charles Martin and Joe Parker where a ref stopped the whole fight from happening. He’s decent, looks the part but never was. Heads too small too; you don’t know boxing bruda.
Most underserved champ too. Got a gold medal that he didn’t win. Got Charles Martin for a belt lol. But yea, these fanboys don’t know fighting lol. Everything you said is spot on
It’s a valid take. Klitschko, Pulev, and povetkin were all 40ish and past their prime. Dillian Whyte is a bum. Ruiz KO’d him…
>except for Usyk but was competitive in both of those losses  He wasn't really competitive in the first fight bro. There's an argument for the second fight.
I'm not being biased towards anything mate, I've actually been very critical of Joshua on here numerous times in the past, my point had literally zero to do with an England USA thing, just to do with how stupid your comment was.
You’re glazing rn bro. I swear no one is reading what you’re typing. We just downvoting it coz we know you’re a troll😭😭😭
Dillian Whyte is not a bum. He's a top 10 heavyweight in the world.   Charles Martin, Dominic Breazeale, Eric Molina, Carlos Takam, Joseph Parker, and a win against Andy Ruiz. Those are all quality wins. His win against Franklin last weekend wasn't bad either.  You're more of a bum at boxing analysis than Dillian Whyte is at boxing
The first fight scores:  Viktor Fesechko 112-117  Howard Foster 113-115  Steve Weisfeld 112-116  One judge gave Joshua 5 rounds, two gave him 4. That's competitive
They rang the bell early in the 12th round to save him from being KO’d.
Truth hurts buddeh, the big Dosser Robot didn’t even know how to clinch..he had to hire a coach to show him to clinch LOL. He looks to his corner at 33 years old for help. He’s not that good, Eddie Hearn just good at talking but knows nothing about actual boxing somehow.
I apologize for hurting your feelings. You’re right. Dillian Whyte is a stone cold killer. Remember that time he beat Chisora…? Or that big white guy. Dude has an ultra impressive résumé. I also apologize for forgetting about his huge career wins against the dangerous Eric Molina, and 280 pound taco eating champion Andy Ruiz. Oh… Dominic Breazeale. That guy turned out to have a huge career.
Brother, judges will never be reliable in a game where corruption exists. How many times have we seen robberies and questionable scorecards in fights? This first fight was in Joshua's country, of course they would try and score the fight as positively towards AJ as much as they can.  I scored the fight myself and I saw a 118-110 or 117-111 fight for Usyk. The average of fans had this sort of score and the most common score I have seen is 117-111. Every judge's scorecard needs to be taken with a grain of salt.
That's nonsense
Again, your boxing analysis is pathetic
No shit, but those are the official numbers. I myself gave Joshua 4 rounds
I thought I was on r/boxingcirclejerk
Lol .. I legit looked up to see where I was too I’m ngl .
What a non story story
I mean, if we were to assume that Ali was trained and started in MMA then I guess it’s plausible.   Although I can’t help but imagine Ali as still the type to manage distance but utilizing kicks more.   Honestly though, the only boxer I’d be interested in seeing how they adapt to MMA would be Roberto Duran.
He did not against the japan guy always lying flat.
He's talking about his world famous legend of a grandpa who some people believe is the best heavyweight champion of course he would say that
Ali has a grandson?   They kept that quiet.
Reminds of that story about Ali nearly losing a leg after an exhibition. That shit would be unthinkable nowadays.
Jon Jones? That man is made entirely of HGH.
In a boxing match he’d probably win. /s In mma zero chance
He probably wouldn't have just like he also would've gotten smoked by LeBron 1 on 1 lmao who cares it's two different sports,
You guys are delusional, an untrained in MMA Ali would decimate Jon Jones within the first 90 seconds  He’d sweep the leg, get off 3 phantom shots before he hits the floor, and would catch Jones in a submission, easy W….
Read the article. He said if Ali trained everything he’d do great because of his mentality on top of the training.
Did Nico okay this? He’s stepping on someone else’s grift
Joe Rogan said recently that Jon Jones would destroy Tyson Fury in a fight. What do y’all think?
his inside fighting in mma would be amazing to watch.
Plus gas station penis pills, and creatine tainted with liquid bull shark testosterone.
“Probably”  Lmfao he’d definitely win in boxing just like Jon would definitely win in MMA
Yes, the arguably greatest heavyweight boxer of all time would *probably win against the mma guy
>“I think just his mentality alone would take him very far,” Ali Walsh told reporters. “You know, if he obviously wrestled, did jiu-jitsu, and did all these other things that are pretty much required for MMA, I think he’d do great.  >“Jon Jones actually looked up to him, as far as mentality and stuff like that,” he continued. “So, if Muhammad Ali was an MMA fighter and he was fighting against Jon Jones, it’d be a great fight because they both have that mentality. So yeah, I think he’d hold up pretty well.”  Did you actually read the article? What he basically says is he applies the same mentality and training to mma then he'll do well, not that he'll just pop in and smoke Jones.
Domino Reyes beat him by decision imo
Matt Hamill took his 0 😂
I exist
Reyes and Santos: am I a joke to you
He’d suck more
Ya I was trying to be sarcastic about it aha. Of course he’d win lol. Different sports. Poorly worded cheers
No I did not lmao my bad, thanks for quoting it for me, and yeah I do agree with that
I'm wondering who'd be worse to have as a boss? The tomato, or Don King.
Why do you use the Puerto Rican flag for Shakur?
I still don’t understand how Shakur does what he does. He is somehow always out of range even against taller fighters but still in range for him to hit them. He never seems to make any big or flashy moves , but somehow no one has been able to close that distance.   It really feels like he is somehow predicting what the opponent will do and responds to it before they even finish making their move.  Even in this clip, often Shakur takes a step back before Nakathila even manages to finish his forward step.
This dude is the real deal in my opinion. I can see everyone running from him at 135, I just don’t see a more complete fighter than him.. I mean, I’d feel he’d run over tank.
I think Shakur was a little freaked out by Nakathila's power. He caught some flak from the announcer team that night for fighting overly defensive.
I'm assuming this Shakur fight will be almost identical to the Jamel H fight.  Yoshino will definitely try his hardest but is just going to be eating hard shots all night with very little success of his own. If his corner cares about his health they'll probably stop it around 10 or 11. If they let it keep goin for his pride, he'll have 2 swollen eyes and Shakur will look like he just finished a warmup.
Such a beautiful fighter to watch. A real riddle to solve for someone with that out of range for the opponent but somehow in range for himself style.  A hell of a talent.
Beautiful performance, one of my favorite fights to study while under the influence
One of his worst fights. Legit the highlights for this fight is almost 2 mins long. That’s how boring it was. Performance was good ig.
He and Boots are the most dominant fighters since Floyd. Inoue is up there too.  We are in a super talented era of boxing
Is there any highlights of Stevenson getting hit?
Is the Shakur fight on PPV tomorrow?
We are blessed to be able to watch Shakur do his thing in the ring.  High IQ, cat like reflexes, and just styles on his opponents.
What are Yoshinos chances tomorrow? I'm gonna be watching the UFC card with a buddy of mine, but I may set up the laptop and pull double duty if yall think it'll be semi competitive.
With the shortage of great Puerto Rican fighters these years you just gotta take whatever there is
He is part Puerto rican
It's apart of his heritage
Its scary how good he is.
It’s because he puts his weight on his back foot & fakes his stance. He makes it look like his weight is balanced but he fakes the distance. Like how Mayweather fakes his range before he shoots the straight right sometimes & the only time that got found out if when Maidana countered at the end of a round.
There’s a dark souls pvp term called “out-spacing” that I always use now for boxing. Basically if someone has a big ass weapon, and you had a smaller weapon, you’d wait for the guy to attack and step back just barely out of range and then step in while he’s recovering for the attack and attack with your faster, shorter weapon. I like to think Shakur Stevenson does the same thing
I love his style. He isn't even particularly explosive, at least not on the level of Money Floyd, but he moves so efficiently. You're right about his range traveling. He accomplishes what Beterbiev does without the threat of massive power.
fights nobodies thats how. Oscar Valdez coming off a loss is your best win you know havent fought nobody
Only fighter I see running from him is Isaac cruz apart from that everyone at 135 seems to want the tough fights. I  do think shakur clears out 135 though.
I'd like to see Shakur take the belts from Haney. Haney gonna run to 140 if he activates the mandatory though.
I just wanna see him hit harder. That’s the only thing he’s questionable in. Not that he doesn’t have power, cause he’s dropped guys and gotten KO’s and obviously bears up opponents faces, but I wanna see that 1 or 2 shot knockout power like tank Davis.
He doesn’t have the resume to put him in any category of best right now, but the eye test he looks like he might already be most skilled fighter in boxing right now.  He just looks so natural
lol. I would never bet on Shakur to stop anyone, especially not at his debut in a bigger weight class. It will be a complete schooling by him though.
Or it will go the same way almost all his fights go.  Being overly cautious and potshotting his way to a unanimous decision. Totally lost interest in him after the Valdez fight.
I really hope you never get banned from here lol
Pizza slice in one hand and a little bit of myself in the other. The best way to watch King 'kur fight. #BoxingArtist
Explains why you put the pr flag in the post.
I love boots but he hasn’t faced the necessary competition to be considered yet  But I will say the outrage after his last fight was funny, imagine getting called a hypejob after you still practically 120-208’d a guy who fought the fight to not get knocked out.
I need to see boots fight a legit solid welterweight before completely drinking the kool-aid. I have been impressed with him since 2017 though.  If he can dominate crowley, villa, rashidi, stanionis, benn, ugas, mean machine, thurman, james, barrios, butaev, even abel ramos or rocha ill be more sold.  Weltwerweight is really deep with all those names not including bud, spence, and vergil.
Conceição fight  is thee most hes been hit, tho I might be wrong. If you include Olympics,  then his fight against Robeisy
It's called a check hook sir
😂 at least ur honest about it
A heritage he was not interested in until he realized how boxing business is and that he needs to capitalize on this market
Idk how many boxers we got in this Reddit, but if you’ve ever tried fighting/sparring leaning on your back foot, at least for me, my leg starts to burn after a round lol. Can’t believe he can keep it up for 12 rounds.
This take makes no sense. He beat both Valdez and Conceicao without breaking a sweat . So it doesn’t matter who you think “won” Valdez vs Conceicao fight, he beat them both. There was literally no one else at 130 that would even be considered a challenge for Shakur.
> Haney gonna run to 140 if he activates the mandatory though.  what do you mean "activates the mandatory"?
>but I wanna see that 1 or 2 shot knockout power like tank Davis.  What on earth makes you think you're going to get that?
I'd trust Shakur to get a stoppage more than Devin would though
You must've watched a different fight because Shakur beat the fuck out of Valdez
Karen doesnt get enough credit here. He did quite a few times tried to counter boots hard.
Literally
How do you know that to make that claim
His father is Puerto Rican and recently came back into his life  EDIT: This is false, my bad.
After Shakur wins his fight he will be Haneys mandatory challenger. Haney can then accept the mandatory title defense or vacate the belt.
Power is trainable
Shakur has a lower KO ratio than Haney. Mind you, he's about to move into his 3rd weight class, while Haney looks like he belongs 2 divisions above his current one, yet still can't crack an egg.
He could have stepped on the gas and stopped him easily, but instead continued being defensive for no reason whatsoever. In one of the later rounds he was literally running away from him.
Before the Valdez fight he didn't even bring the Puerto Rico flag with him. But whatever, I'm tired of discussing about this
No, his PR birth father passed away.
none of that explains your comment  if stevenson wins, he doesnt get to activate or not activate anything  so what do you mean "activates the mandatory"?
Why does he need power? He has power that makes people „oh shit, gotta not get hit too much“, ye it’s not like Tank‘s pose „fuck, was that a Hammer?“ but it’s still decent.
If Shakur gets a stoppage tomorrow, his ratio goes back to 50%. Haney's next fight will make him get a 50% ratio, win or lose. Imo, Haney will not get any more KOs going forwards unless he finds himself fighting journeymen. I can see Shakur getting the occasional stoppage in the future.  And besides, KO ratios can be deceptive. It wasn't too long ago when Jermell Charlo used to have a ratio lower than 50%, and we can all agree that he is currently the biggest puncher at 154. In fact, it used to be 42% before he linked up with Derrick James!
> he was literally running away from him  Are you talking about the last 10 seconds of the 12th round when he was just showboating
He got hurt to the body by Valdez
Casual
You didn’t grow up with dude lol you don’t know if he was interested in his heritage. That’s very common In boxing anyways, tons of fighters do it.
Ah man my fault, I mustve heard some fake news
He doesn’t need it that’s not what I’m saying. He’s one of the best fighters In The game. Just imagine the draw he would have if he had 1 punch KO power. One can dream
Its weird people care so much about this but reddit gonna reddit.
The DAZN documentary about that fight is pretty good. Has Sylvester Stallone, Mike Tyson, and even the ref in it.   https://youtu.be/k9ZcXVnmWxQ
Andy can really throw hands. I was so sad to see how he wasted that champion run by partying.
And AJ was never the same fighter again. Such a shame Ruiz turned up massively overweight for the rematch.
Goddamn, what a moment  That left hook to bring on the bambi legs is unforgettable
Never forget Ruiz coming in 15 lbs heavier in the rematch (nearly 300 lbs) and completely blowing his opportunity to bury AJ
It’s one of the greatest aspects of the sport, the triumph of an underdog. Remember thinking Joshua was gonna destroy this man, next thing you know am screaming at the top of my lungs rooting for Andy! Lol
Pretty disappointing Ruiz never lived up to this performance afterwards.
Joshua’s “WHAT!?” face afterwards, like he wasn’t looking for a way out hahaha
Pretty hilarious seeing Ruiz waddle to the corner every time
Ruiz let himself down massively in the rematch. The whole world loved the little fat guy who beat the champ and changed his life forever. All he had to do was not lie to the public and refuse to train and he’d still be loved.
You can see Eddie Hearn's concerned face in the background.  🤣🤣🤣
Ref: Do you wanna box   AJ's mouth: yeah   AJ's body language: FOR THE LOVE OF GOD STOP IT
I remember going back and watching Ruiz fights leading up to that fight and thinking AJ had picked a really difficult opponent who wasn’t gonna be a walkover. I didn’t think he’d beat AJ but I knew it wouldn’t be easy. AJ has said that Wilder’s 1st round KO of Breazeale was in his mind when Ruiz went down and he wanted to make a big splash with an early knockout of Ruiz and tried to put him away as though he had Ruiz hurt and he didn’t.   To me I still see it as the freak occurrence that can happen in heavyweight boxing of a single punch changing the course of the whole action. Ruiz isn’t a great fighter, he doesn’t have the mentality or work ethic needed to be great, but he could still have a great night against a champion and change the course of modern heavyweight boxing with that night.   I think AJ has shown great growth since this, I think his fights against Usyk are A level fights, he really improved his accuracy and his footwork and just happen to be going up against a guy that does A+ level work at all times. Can’t fault him for Usyk just being better. He’s not the fearless knockout artist he was when he was younger and probably won’t ever be again, but I hope he continues fighting because I like watching AJ fight.
This happened during Ramadan, I was up at like 4 or 5am after the sun rose. Watching this fight had me so dehydrated because I was talking so much whilst watching hahaha!
Props to the ref for stopping the fight, truly. From the mouthpiece getting spat out to him lazing around on the ropes he was just trying to stall for more time to collect himself.   So many refs would have let him get away with that bullshit.
Never looked at a fat Mexican the same after this.
I met Ruiz after this fight and before the rematch at the Cross Border Xpress. Let me tell you, Andy was walking around with the fattest head and was a dick to everyone.   I saw someone take a picture with him and he told them "to stop wasting the Champs time" because their phone wouldn't work.   All dude did was let the belt get to his head. No wonder he took a shit in the rematch.
This prime aj that everyone goes on about is a bit of a myth. He was more aggressive but swinging shots in with his chin wide open was what got him knocked out in the first place. Klitschko should of put him away when he had him out on his feet.
I'm not an AJ hater, but there's something very satisfying about watching Ruiz batter him
Y’all think Ruiz didn’t train hard enough for the rematch bc he thought he had Aj in the bag so he didn’t take him as serious ?
I feel like this fight is under rated. It had everything needed to be a classic.
Where does femi come from?
“Watch this”
AJ really is just another Frank Bruno.
That's the truth Truth!
He closes his eyes and turns his head, puts his hands up, everytime someone throws a shot now. Joshua is done
Feels like this gets posted every month.
This was AJ's first and only away fight.
Hold the phone while you throw the hook AJ
He took his belts, 0 and soul. 3 wins in 1.
RoadmanFemi to WastemanFemi
Ruiz 'femi'nized him and then shamelessly pigged out on the trappings of success
Everybody uses this fight as the example of when Joshua started fighting more cautiously and scared of getting hit but it was really the Wlad fight that done it.
AJ hasn't been the same since
Huge W for the PBC. Sent AJ packing and made him scared to ever step foot in the US ever again.
Cute the way he spat out his mouthpiece lol what an absolute failure of a man. I look at fights like Brook vs Spence and I understand why Brook took a knee because if the fight went longer he would have probably been blind in one eye.  But this? AJ is a quitter. He had no excuse there he had absolutely no fight in him left. A world champion should not be doing that at all. He let himself down, he let his promoter down, he let his family down and he let his fans down.   The only thing left now is for him to fight Deontay Wilder who will banish him into retirement.  AJ after fighting Wilder: Yeah I did get punched by the Bronze Bomber, it's not nice inih  HIP HIP
Ruiz is a fighter. AJ just doesn't have what it takes to be a champion, much less a feared one, and his name should never be mentioned with any decent heavyweights.
Punch was weak as hell that wobbled him too. AJ making Andy Ruiz look like George Foreman lmao
You guys must be kidding me. That fat fuck wouldn’t be a top 20 fighter in my day. (Ali, Frazier, Norton, Foreman etc.)
He looked so strong there.
Please run the trifecta for the love of god
Slovene explain femi
That was an amazing upset!
what is femi?
can somebody tell me wtf Femi means?
what's Femi?
What’s the concept of femi?
My family watched this in the living room at a family party, we cheered so loud when the ref waved it off lmao. This was a great day for Mexican boxing fans, it was definitely my favorite moment as a boxing fan.
I watched this fight so many times lol. I had been following Andy Ruiz since the Parker bout, and it blew my mind
What does Femi mean?
Appreciate Ruiz childlike happiness with the jumping
That was the day it all fell apart for Eddie EARN, sorry hearn, I mean Anthony Joshua sorry
And what is/was the concept of "Femi"?
This fight shook AJ, but Ruiz hasn’t looked nearly as ferocious since then either.
You can tell he's big but Jesus Christ the black dude is 6 foot 6!?
Aj definitely quit in that fight no one can tell me otherwise
most people know this but this fight most definitely gave AJ ptsd. getting finished in your american debut by a late replacement against a guy who a lot of people unfortunately label as just some “fat mexican.” on such a big stage will definitely fuck you up mentally. didn’t even just fuck up AJ’s style but also his mental, he’s been very fragile mentally ever since ruiz.
This guys post history is crazy lol
Solving the Femi Paradox
What does Femi mean? Never heard that term before.
Such an amazing fight! Joshua was on top of the world at this time. Ruiz put on a show!
Ruiz has great hands, he really shouldn’t be in that weight class though. He’s a big dude but the other guys are monsters.
David V Goliath
So odd. All he had to do was get behind the jab and cruise but he stepped in the phone booth.
Femi?
I think you mean, “Andy, the destroyer “
I think this was more about AJ making a huge mistake rather than Ruiz being good.  Up until the first knockdown aj had been fighting perfectly, keep it at range and wait for opportunities to throw combinations and get out.  Then the knockdown and suddenly he thinks his man is finished and he can brawl with him.  Big mistake.
I just love that AR is a fat fuck like me. So if he can do it than so can I? 😂
My first amateur fight i remember. I was a featherweight and the guy i was fighting was at least a foot taller than me. I had family and friends in the crowd that i didnt want to let down. My trainer just before the bell rang told me to punch him in his chest.   It was only 3, 3 minute rounds. The First round i was up on the score cards but then my boots started slipping. It was like i was on a polished floor wearing socks. Everytime i tried to throw a right over hand my foot would slip from under me.   I started to flail so much i forgot about punching his chest so i started to go for his head instead. During the second round i gassed out and from then on it was basically survival mode. I could not use my footwork because my boots were sliding. It took all my energy away. It was a horrible experience. I managed to stick in there until the end and lost on points but from the second round in i really felt like i was drowning.   Even after the fight i felt shell shocked, id done a year of sparring but never been so disadvantaged to a point where im fighting a bigger guy with glass shoes on. I learnt from that that so many minor things can change the dynamics in boxing, from the canvass, to the gloves, to the boots. It really is a matter of life and death when you dont have the right equipment or support.
I’ve never respected Joshua the same since! Ruiz humiliated that man! Joshua won rematch off points in a very boring rematch. Ruiz still got the better of Joshua 💯💯
AJ ain’t want want it fr lol
Back when AJ was throwing with heat behind it
Everything about Ruiz reminds me of a bear. The way he would start flailing and slapping out flurries when he could smell blood, and then the way he jumps up and down like a toddler when he wins. Reminds me of Kuma from Tekken when he does the victory dance
I’m just waiting for the day when the real reason what was wrong with AJ in this camp is revealed. I know there was a hand injury but there is more to it.
I love this video so much.
That first knockdown changed everything. Going into this fight I was thinking AJ was the best currently active boxer with a real shot at GOAT status. It was such a shock.
     X x.          C
Great day for Dad bodies
That’s that Mexican style boxing right there
I wish andy woulda lived up to the hype simply for more moments of him jumping up nd down happily
I wonder if the Wilder fight would've happened if AJ won. I feel AJ would've steamed rolled Big Baby Miller.
[Live footage of Ajs soul leaving his body.](https://youtu.be/bfsHljwtuoM?t=46)
Lucky punch fo the back of the head and ear charged AJs fate forever
It looks to me like Joshua is doing everything right to continue after the knockdown. Idk about that stop.
It always seemed like an ear injury to me but I'm stupid
AJ with the weak chin
When it comes to boxing, there's a few things I know. One of those things is, never bet against a mexican.
Everyone complimenting how great this watch was and i'm there with "not available in your country"
I’m not a big documentary guy but this one was well done and worth the watch!
That was great. Thanks for the link.   "It looked like there were eight arms coming out of him." lol great line and so true.
When they played the succession of people talking about how great AJ's body is I kept hoping Fury would be next.  "I like the guy.  He's doing well, he's got a good body..."
Guess I need to get that VPN as dazone hasn’t made it available to Auatralia
Thanks for that, was well worth the watch!
"this mothafucka came to fight tonight"
Watching now. Thanks.
It’s like a lot of people say (paraphrasing) that it’s difficult to win a championship/title but it’s much more difficult staying up at that level. Consistency is needed.
He really did destroy him. Joshua hsn't been the same since
That's part of the difference between champion and contender, many win the world title but less keep it long term, many years.
His hand movement really is so nice. It looks so natural. Some of the most fluid looking punches in my opinion
I actually think he changed a little after Kiltschko too.   The way he talks about the Klitschko fight sometimes sounds like he was close to dying.   Klitschko + Ruiz changed him forever.
> And AJ was never the same fighter again.  was just about to say. what difference that aggressive, attacking AJ was to today; slow, lumbering, afraid and hesitating. he should probably see a head-trainer as well
Nah dude, he had weights in his sombrero
Ruiz would have been outboxed in the rematch in the second fight regardless of the shape he came in. He ruined AJs aggressive style, and in doing so destroyed the only version of AJ he had a chance of beating
If he was focused, he would have won the rematch too. Even overweight and slow, he was *still* landing shots on Joshua.
He was fat before and he was fat in the remarch. It made no difference whatsoever, its just a thing people push to protect their overrating of Ruiz.  Ruiz fought an identical fight. Its just that he is incapable of cutting of the ring, he just follows you. He is great and exchanges and showed that in the second fight too.  He is just one dimensional, thats his issue. Not having gained some weight.
What’s up with this Femi nickname? We never called him that in the U.S. and who had the balls to tell him he needed a better name? It sounded kinda 🌈
Part of being a champion is living the professional life. Not everyone is up to it, and that's one of the differences between elite and world level. It is rare for folk to bounce back like Fury did, still impressive, despite the shenanigans with Usyk.
Honestly the fact that the fight went the whole 12 rounds to decision is telling about AJ too.
Ruiz is an easy to beat fighter. Literally fight on the outside, and GG. Mans a plodder.
He wouldn’t of buried AJ 15lbs lighter anyway. AJ had a camp for Ruiz in the 2nd fight and schooled him for 12 rounds.
Didn't matter how he turned up, Ruiz wasn't winning that fight with AJ maintaining the distance.
I in *no way* want to claim that I predicted  Andy Ruiz winning this thing, but I remember seeing the discourse before the match and thinking “Ruiz actually has some power… people might be underestimating him.”
The visual contrast between the two of them, the moment after that first big shot wobbling AJ, and Andy and his trainer hopping around in the center of the ring were amazing. Will always remember this one fondly and really cool upset to be watching live on tv.
I fondly remember laughing like a little girl as Ruiz delivered knockdown after knockdown on Joshua. After Joshua survived the first series of knockdowns, I assumed he would play it safely and cruise to an easy point decision, but instead to his credit, AJ went straight back into the fire. That was the last I saw of him.
Well Ruiz trained his hardest and got in best shape ever and 40 year old Chis Arreola still whipped his ass and dropped him twice and Ruiz never rattled Chris once. AJ just overrated as it gets, he was running around scared vs Joe Parker with no elbows the fight before Ruiz Anyway and didn’t throw a punch for 3 rounds after Wlad dropped him. Ruiz didn’t break him, this is who he is. He know he’s vulnerable since amateurs and even Price and Dubois dropped him in sparring. Hes like Overeem; knows he don’t got a good chin so it’s easy to come back and win some fights lol. Not like he lost it and all of sudden has to be a different fighter.
He was given a 15 or a 20 count.
Haha he was not wanting to go on
Ruiz isn’t little lmao but he did fuck himself over. Aj also did what he should of done the whole time, he can’t brawl with a guy like Ruiz and he didn’t in the second fight
Lmfaoo I never noticed him until now
Call me racist but I'm convinced all Mexicans are born with the ability to bang
Younger wlad would’ve battered him
It's the classic underdog tale
No. Look at his social media and stuff after that fight. He was loving being the heavyweight champ, loving it way too much. Went straight to his head and he decided to eat and party instead of train for the rematch.
Everyone talks about ruiz shitting the bed, but i dont think we give enough credit to AJs adjustment in style for the second fight. Only problem is he never went back lmao 🤣😩
The fame and fortune got to his head, simple as. It's not about him taking AJ lightly.

Eh, AJ is a lot more skilled than bruno was for my money
Another shite take
At least Bruno lost to Tyson and Lewis not short fat guys
I posted it a few weeks ago with like the same caption lol
Yep.  Saudi doesn't count because they were still Matchroom shows with everything stacked in his favour.  He even said he preferred it there.  The pressure got to him here, badly.
Fought twice in Saudi Arabia...
Wilder has never fought outside the US and pretty much every other American hypejob in history hasn't either. Also Joshua has fought 11 times against legitimate top 10 heavyweights, half of which were top 5/3 and 2 of which were pound for pound ranked(klitschko and usyk)28 fights with 12 world championships. Surely the fact he hasn't fought ''away'' doesn't matter as much compared to Fury who has fought away but has only fought 3 ranked heavyweights, 2 of which also beaten by none other than femi. So what's this obsession with him not fighting ''away'' matches? He's never had a corrupt decision going his way(unlike Fury, Wilder and most others) and he's had the toughest and most respectable career out of everybody(besides Usyk).
That's a really interesting point. I guess the pressure can get to people. This was supposed to be AJ's big moment where he cracks the American market but he ended up dominated and controlled by a (relatively) short, obese, slob.
he got caught between shots tbf
This is literally so basic and taught to children. I know little 6 year old Mexican kids that do this out of pure instinct it’s so basic
Lol, this is why I actually love hearn as a promoter. I mean, the fighters in his stable are always paying the price for his inability to match them up well against other fighters while he tries to build their brand…but seeing how this fight played out, and the head butting punisher Josh warrington’s adventure against Lara, well they were just a joy to watch unfold.
Too harsh.   Boxing like any other fighting sport can bring the fear of God in any man.  It takes courage to step in the ring at all.
Boring troll.
For all we know Ruiz hook might have scrambled his brain lol
the two time champion of the world who unified and made multiple defences doesn’t have what it takes to be a champion yall! 😂😂🤦🏽‍♂️
Wilder fought Audley Harrison in the UK
Usyk travelling record at cruiserweight is incredible.
Your day?
It’s an abbreviation for his middle name I believe.

In the words of the late great Marvin Hagler -   “It's tough to get out of bed to do roadwork at 5am when you're sleeping in silk pajama’s."
Ruiz really let himself go after that fight…
That’s something a lot of new fans don’t understand. It’s common now for champs to drop belts fast. Sometimes they relinquish the belt right after winning it.  In the 80s and 90s there were many champs who were on 7-8 year runs. In all the divisions. Just not as valued today since the biggest money fight may not be for the title
Klitschko fight gassed up, he thought he was the man, because of casuals, even though he got schooled for 8 rounds by a 43 year old man... Maybe 44 who had beenout of the ring for 2 years too
Yeah I think he said that if klitschko had kept up the pressure after dropping him he would have been stopped. However, Vitali advised Wlad to save his energy and that allowed AJ to recover and eventually stop Wlad. If Klitschko and Ruiz changed AJ, Usyk definitely broke him.
Joe Parker fight was dumbest thing I ever watched ever. He been scary. And Beating drug addicted Charles Martin and running around vs Parker for your HW belts doesn’t mean much. These belts mean nothing
I believe Klitschko fight changed his aggressive combination puncher approach and made him into the more defensive fighter he is today. Parker fight was deemed boring and he fought similar against Povetkin but got the KO in that one so previous rounds kinda forgotten I guess lol  Ruiz fight was the fight that ruined Joshua's killer instinct. It's the last time he has been intent on finishing the job but that cost him his first L so since then, he just doesn't go for the kill anymore. Even in the Kubrat Pulev fight, who was ripe for taking for an early KO when he turned his back against Joshua, had managed to last up to the 11th round.
He should, he seems to really be in his own head.   you could see the fight drain out of him on the final knock down, he just sort of looked lost and like he didn't want to continue. The ref saw it in his face.
And it happened in one punch from Ruiz to the side of the head. It's like AJ knows now that a single punch in the wrong place can end him and his sole priority in any fight is to avoid it at all costs.
Egg weights in his belly!
Aj came in a completely different fighter in the rematch.  He hid behind his jab and superior footwork the entire fight. He refused to engage Andy whatsoever. He stuck to his game plan of point off the jab then get the hell up out of there.
A fat person can be even fatter and more out of shape. Nobody's saying he had all the tools to be a decent champion, just that he would have had a better chance against AJ if he came in better shape for the second fight. We see this in NFL and NBA all the time, a 250-300 lb guy might come in 15 lbs heavier and out of shape at start of pre-season and he's so much slower with no endurance.  Same with Buster Douglas, had the training camp and focus of his career for Mike Tyson fight, then for Evander Holyfield, he was back to his usual shape/training.
nah lol he turned up like 20kg heavier and didn’t train
Your tripping if you think Ruiz wasn't a whole different level of fat in the rematch. Here he has mobility, in the rematch he moved like a walrus. Just say your a massive Aj fan and you're hurt ruiz exposed Aj'S flaws. Btw this comes from someone who thinks Aj is still a threat just needs to get his head right.
I think it's his middle name. It's usually used jokingly as the dark side of Joshua haha.
His full name is Anthony Oluwafemi Olaseni Joshua.
Riddick Bowe and James Toney are two examples of extreme talent not always working the hardest
Ruiz has a granite chin
People don’t say anything when Fury goes 12 rounds with plumbers
Ruiz has never lost by KO in his professional career and the first fight with AJ was the only time he's ever been knocked down. Dude knows how to take a punch.
The narrative around this fight and the rematch is insane tbh. I was cheering for Ruiz  because I like the underdog to win, but it seemed obvious that AJ stupidly went for a knockout that wasn't there and got hit with a devastating shot which fucked him for the rest of the fight. In the rematch he took an incredibly risk free approach and won easily by jabbing away.   The idea that if only Ruiz had put a giant lock on his fridge he'd have won the rematch is wrongheaded; his problem wasn't being too fat, it was being 6' tall (no way he's 6'2") and having his only chance of winning, fighting on the inside, totally nullified.
Completely agree but I would say he's more simple to game plan against, literally just stay outside he's fat and too slow to give you traps like Pacquiao.   Simple but not easy! Sucks seeing him party away his reign
You may not have predicted it, but I (sort of) did.    https://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/bvm00l/[PREDICTION_THREAD]_Anthony_Joshua_vs._Andy_Ruiz/epqeaft/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button   Can I get a "Good for you, whooptie doo."
This is  the only one where I correctly called it. I saw Fat Andy demolish Dimitrenko earlier that year and when I heard Ruiz got the title shot against AJ my first thought was 'uh-oh, Ruiz is going to fuck him up.' Watching Ruiz demolish AJ had me jumping up and shouting. Fluke call, every other time i pick an underdog they get fucking wrecked lol
His handspeed is unbelievable. Probably one of the most naturally talented boxers there is, imagine how good he could be if he was 100% focused.
Everyone gets dropped in sparring, it’s heavyweight boxing lol. Do better
I agree with some of what you're saying, but Overeems main issue was that he used to fight at 205 when he was young. He cut a LOT of weight and then engaged in some absolute WARS at that reduced hydration. He left his chin in the Pride ring back in Saitama Japan in 2005. He went up to Heavyweight after that for a handful of fights, then he went back down below HW in 2006 and fought Vitor Belfort in Strikeforce. He won that fight with Vitor, and then lost by tko three times in a row. He was knocked out by little Nog in July of 2006, then came right back in September and got stopped again by Ricardo Aronas ground and pound attack. Five months later he fought prime Shogun Rua and got knocked out again. That was the end of Reem's chin. It's amazing that he was able to hang around and have so much success for years after that. His chin was suspect, but he still took some big shots and fought through it a lot of the time. I remember him taking some huge shots when he did that K1 tournament at heavyweight during his peak horsemeat days, and many people already considered him washed up before that point.   AJ could take a lesson in perseverance from Overeem to be honest. If he gets his head right he's still got time to get some more good wins due to the division not being all that stacked.
- turns his back and takes 5+ more seconds to recover - doesn’t respond to ref to walk forward - body language screams “IM DONE” - mumbles his response when asked “do you want to box?”  Ref stops the fight.  Joshua - “wHaT ArE yOu dOiNg???!!”
I just mean figuratively, the fat 6ft2 guy KO’ing the chiselled 6ft6 guy
Watch the whole fight.   He is there in the back looking constipated throughout.
"He's a big old Mexican with a big old head "
There's no doubt in my mind about that either. Joshua won because he had a second wind that wlad could no longer get.
Nah you’re right Aj came in crisp and focused made the proper adjustments and if they fought again I’d pick Aj. But I think if Ruiz would’ve took him serious he might’ve been able to do it again. I also think Aj kinda over looked him in the first fight which lead to his downfall as well.
Bruno usually out-boxed his opponents before his chin and concentration let him down.
Did you watch his last fight????
What do you mean? They’re both black, British and have amazing physiques! Basically the same person!
Deffinatly.  Probably unfair on Bruno to compare the two.
Short? He is 6'2.
Ruiz is taller than Tyson wtf kinda shit take is that. Having a bodybuilder physique doesn’t = good fighter
Also because Ruiz is a Mexican and Usyk is Ukrainian.   Saudi Arabia is not home territory for them therefore not away for Joshua.
Neutral territory.   He never fought a Saudi Arabian in Saudi Arabia.
Name the 10?
Wilders fought in the UK, Mexico and Puerto Rico
Yea but if he’s throwing and keeping his other forehand up like everyone is taught that lowers the chance of getting caught significantly. esp when hooking at mid range like that
It's nothing like that.. Eddie Hearn does the perfect job of matching up his fighters early in the career which gets them the world title shot when they aren't always up to that level. But there isn't anywhere else to go because he's sheltered his fighters to the top.
seriously i don’t know how the matchroom matchmaker even has a job still 😂
Yeah it does take courage I'll give him that but he's been doing it for a while at that point.  He's been in the ring with people like Klitchsko and Whyte. There's no excuses here.
Yeah mean hater, not a troll.
Name a top heavyweight he has beaten? He lost twice to Usyk. I'd like to see him fight Wilder, and I think he'd get carried out of the ring.
Yes my day. I was a heavyweight fighter back then but all those guys I mentioned were ducking me so you’ve never saw or heard of me.
Great quote from a great boxer.
That's why I sleep naked   Er, I mean, great quote!
And before it too by the looks of things.
Isn’t it because they charge ridiculous fees to keep the belts? Screw that.
Where do you keep your heavyweight championship belt?
Weakness Johsua has is he can't do intelligent aggression the way say Lennox Lewis or Wlad could.   He did wild chaotic  aggression that left him open. He never figured out how to turn the screws the way LL or WK could at their peak.
superior footwork 🤣
Looking at my high school graduating class and can confirm   Fuck
Interestingly (or not), Ruiz gained the same amount of weight between the first Joshua fight (268) and the second (283) as Buster gained between Tyson (231) and Holyfield (246).
Agreed with your point, but Buster Douglas looked like a true world class fighter, who stood a chance against anyone, for that fight. Ruiz fought his normal fight and exposed specific flaws against Joshua. Then he a fought a buttered version of his normal game in the rematch against a Joshua who compensated for those flaws. In that sense, I see the pushback against the "fattening" thesis. Peak Ruiz was just marginally better than the fatter version.
Ruiz is a flat footed plodder at every weight. He had a great night at MSG but he is not as talented as AJ is. AJ healthy and with the proper gameplan wins 9/10 times no matter the circumstances.
Dude I'm such an idiot. I thought it was kinda short for Anthony, but spoken in a British accent as in _Anfemy_.  I'm just gonna see myself out...
I think it's a slightly harsh label for Toney honestly. I mean of course he didn't make any effort to stop eating and he famously refused to do any running but he definitely did plenty of work at least in the form of sparring - I mean it's not exactly an easy approach to a career  Like I say I'm aware Toney prolonged his career somewhat by ballooning in weight but I don't think you can have a career of being competitive with top level opposition for as long as Toney managed (at least 10 years longer than Bowe did) by being as lazy as he's made out to be. I mean like his fights with Nunn and Peter were 16 years apart, there's no way anyone in history is talented enough to pull that off with absolutely no hard work
Toney accomplished far more than Bowe and is an ATG. Bowe's entire career is based on beating a cruiserweight and he should have lost to Tony Tubbs.
Recently bias, fury 5 KO/TKO in last 6, Aj 1 KO in last 6 fights
Hey now, I know some real tough plumbers! Hard men, the lot of them!
> and got hit with a devastating shot which fucked him for the rest of the fight  And he got unlucky with that shot fucking him like that.  That's the bit I've never quite understood with him.  AJ took a very similar shot from Ruiz in the rematch and he was fine.  He's eaten big shots before and come through.  He got unlucky with that one as it gave him a concussion and affected him the rest of the fight instead of momentarily causing him to be a little unsteady like that kind of punch would 99% of the rest of the time.  So yes, there's always the chance of a punch screwing you up like that at heavyweight, but most of the time he has a pretty solid chin he just doesn't believe in it.  And that lack of belief has him fighting cautiously which leads to him being caught more often as the other fighters are throwing more and have higher expectations of the benefit of taking risks with him.
> his reign  No reign, he was buster douglas.
Yeah, people act like its going to be just as easy if Ruiz was in better shape. He has his flaws but better cardio and speed would still make him better at chasing AJ down.
Hip, Hip!
Good for you, whooptie doo!!
Good for you, whooptie doo.
He actually has a good style for this era, because he explodes in the clinch, and modern fighters are bizarrely helpless in the clinch (except Fury). However, I don't think Ruiz has a hidden upside. He was always a technically sound, basic fighter who lacked the creativity to adjust when opponents adjusted.     The Joseph Parker fight was a good example, because Parker was lost on the inside. He was highly vulnerable, but pulled out the win because Ruiz doesn't have any layers to his game.
He had 0 chin at HW too,he was KOed at all stages of career. AJ would have a glasss chin in MMA too with small gloves, knees, kicks and elbows, I guarentee you that. Heads too thin
Ref even said this is not a break.
It was a good and proper stoppage so kudos to that ref
The list of fighters appealing to the ref from outer space is a long one.
He spit his mouthpiece out when he was on his knee too.. he was trying to buy as much time as he could
Aj made the mistake of being greedy for a ko. I agree but like I said I think aj could always outpoint Ruiz like he did in the second fight. Brawling with a stocky fighter who had the fastest hands in the division was very dumb.
AJ almost screwed up the rematch. He was ballsy in or around the 10th round and started trading for about 10 seconds with Ruiz, and started taking shots to the head again, realized he'd fucked up, and went back to jabbing Ruiz's gut from range. He was a couple of blows from getting KD'd again.  Folks joke about AJ's chin, but his chin is solid. Its the side of his head which can take no punishment. Just club him on the side of the head for the win. Its a terrible weakness because it means all the mediocre boxers who don't throw stiff right hands but instead swing haymakers at the side of the head - they all have a shot to beat him.
I agree. AJ didn’t look right even during this fight. Whenever AJ had an opponent hurt he’d usually come in at angles to finish the job and confuse his opponents. Here he just walked in a straight line.
It was by no means the terrible performance that people are making it out to be
Losing to a guy who looks like a plumber is embarrassing. Wind don’t compare Ruiz to Tyson ever again.
People downvoting?  How is Saudi Arabia away territory for Joshua?  Are Usyk and Ruiz Saudi Arabian?  Its neutral territory.
he got timed perfectly he tried to bring his hand back up after he missed the right hand but Ruiz was too quick for him
Losing twice to Usyk is not the own that you think it is. Usyk is a generational boxer who will go down in the HOF. Thought he atleast was competitive in the second fight too. But I guess this is the culture around boxing today, you lose a fight and all of a sudden you were never good
Ok
John Fury?
We need a name.
😆🤣😆
He showed better ring generalship from the outside while Andy has good feet on the inside, but Joshua refused to let it come down to that in the rematch.
I agree, although imagine if he had the discipline of a Klitschko or Marciano.
But who has fury been fighting? Can you compare the calibre of opponents fury has fought vs AJ? Before you shout “Wilder” please note Wilder is known to be a one trick pony and is famous for poor boxing technique
His corner should have stopped it.
I just think it was terrible matchmaking by Hearn to be honest. If AJ KO’d Ruiz in round 1 then your casual fan would say they’re not surprised, Ruiz is out of shape etc, but anyone who knows boxing knew Ruiz was a dangerous contender. It was a lose/lose outcome for AJ in my eyes.
“Chin” is used by many as just shorthand slang for punch resistance.
Try watching it again
Well you said short, Tyson is shorter than Ruiz, so I will compare them there.
I never said he was no good. He did nothing in the last fight to show me why he is a top heavyweight, and he's not beaten a top heavyweight. Wilder first. Winner fights Usyk. Winner of that fights Fury. Let's see if Joshua can even beat Joyce.
It's probably Ronnie Pickering. Man was a legend on the scene *underneath* the underground scene.
No I was mad about it but not furious
yeah but not superior footwork. It was more because of Ruiz TBH and not AJ adjusting that he won the rematch. Old dogs can't learn new tricks. Ruiz has good footwork for his size, it was his mobility and handspeed that fucked AJ up, coming in unprepared and heavier, he lost that.    Footwork was his demise against Usyk as well. Even the old and small Povetkin gave him fits because of his mediocre footwork (which actually why people thought Ruiz had a good chance against him) but his size and power was just too much.      Great boxers was able to rely on their other skills when they got old or was able to adjust because they actually have something to fall back on.      Foreman never lost his power, but when he got slower he relied on his good defense, heavy jab and granite chin. Duran on his footwork and boxing skills was able to compete despite being older and smaller. Floyd on IQ and superior defensive skills when he lost speed and fucked his hands. Pac with speed and footwork when he didn't have enough KO power fighting big WW, the minute he lost that he looked lost.    AJ got scary power, but footwork nah. That's why Usyk beat him. If he doesn't improve or recover, he'd go down in history along of Buster Douglas, Valuev and Golota - HW Champs who gave their belts to Cruiserweights.
yeah we'd be talking about genuine best ever level lol, presumably at light heavyweight or so. honestly though he's one of my absolute favourite fighters of all time and his heavyweight career is a huge part of that, and none of that wouldve happened if he had any real discipline so im satisfied with how it panned out
Wilder fought somewhat intelligent in that fight. But Wilder nearly had him in the beginning of the fight with his one trick. The first few rounds have not been easy for Fury. But once he got him gassed out, it was an easy win.   But I agree: He should have fought Usyk, AJ or even Ruiz. Nobody needed the Chisora fight.
Many heavyweights before us that are idolized are known for punching power over footwork, defense, counter etc. And Wilder compensated for his lack of technical ability for a long time and did it best for a while. He could end a match with a more talented boxer with a single good connection. He was a dangerous fighter. And a good win for Tyson Fury for being able to neutralize him accordingly and do his thing.  So yes. Wilder is an inferior boxer talent-wise, but you have to be ignorant and stupid to write him off like he was some pushover. He's a one trick pony. But that one trick brought him to a world class stage he was pretty damn good at it. You don't get that far by sucking. Wilder was a good win for Tyson Fury.  Its a common thing in sports albeit less common in boxing. Peyton Manning had way more tools than Tom Brady and is a more "complete quarterback", but in sports its not always a matter if having the most tools, but rather how elite you are with the tools you already have and the success you can bring from it.
He was a late replacement for Big Baby Miller who had failed a drug test.
I’m not saying it was a good performance. It wasn’t awful, either. He was completely dominant throughout
Who?
I know mate, but at the time Luis Ortiz, Kubrat Pulev, Michael Hunter, Manuel Charr and Adam Kownacki were all potential replacements and all (apart from maybe Ortiz) would pose considerably less risk
He looked better against Jermain than Dillian did
[Ronnie Pickering!](https://www.sickchirpse.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Ronnie-Pickering-1.jpg)
Damn bro, I thought he didn't want to be undisputed. What a surprise!
And the NEW! Marlon “Marinding Nightmare” Tapales!
MJ Kaka.
Hopefully he takes care of business with his mandatory and doesn't have any promotional issues to make a fight with the winner of Fulton-Inoue (presumably Inoue). He's pretty good and it'd be exciting to have an undisputed fight with either of them.
What a shock!
Jesus, that was brutal! Mouthpiece flying KOs are so satisfying.
nice to see Dokes not on the receiving end of a brutal KO for once.
No feet on either of these guys.  Just standing face to face slugging it out.
Dokes Holyfield is one of my favourite fights . Dokes had exceptional handspeed.
Dokes was a p4p undefeated in style though. [Not boxing style, his actual style.](http://media.gettyimages.com/photos/michael-dokes-at-public-hall-feb-12-1983-picture-id860181072?s=612x612). Sorry I can't provide a better example, dude was  dripped out in late 70s  (I used to have a Photobucket account with a bunch of pics saved in it from the late 70's early 80's and Dokes was always dressed dapper AF hitting clubs with a bad woman on each arm.) ....(guess it got erased after not logging in to it for 15 years...)
Dokes hands speed was unreal for a heavyweight, that snapping jab was faster than Holmes one.  Too bad he had a lot of demons out of the ring.
When the mouthpiece goes flying, that means the fogh is just about over.
surprise motherfucker!!
I'm an AJ fan and i don't think the performance was as bad as people make out but the lack of knockout wasn't the only probablem   He also wasn't throwing combination punches like we saw in the past   He was too scared of getting hit and wasn't committing  I see the start of something great but he did bring it all together yet
Whyte actually threw with intent and pressure for one round and Franklin was hurt and shook. Someone will stop Franklin if he keeps fighting high level guys.
It’s not that he didn’t get the KO. He looked timid and didn’t win dominantly.
He looked scared to fight on the inside and he struggled to connect his outside game to his inside game.   An awkward point fighting exhibition is not how he leverages his strengths to beat the top fighters in the division.   When people talk about AJ, they talk about his speed, power and vicious combination punching. That's what he had an advantage against most HWs.   He fought a motivated Andy Ruiz who had great upper body movement paired with good combination counterpunching and now it seems he's scared to use that side of his game against anyone else, even when they don't possess the counterpunching skills of Andy Ruiz.   It's baffling because AJ actually fought his best fight against Usyk in the rematch so I'm quite confused at the level he showed against Franklin. It could be initial growing pains with Derrick James but AJ has a tendency to throw out the baby with the bathwater when he's making changes to his game.   For now I'm staying reserved on his chances against the top heavyweights until I see him leverage his strengths and improve his understanding of fighting on the outside and inside and how to leverage those two modes together like the greats do.
I'm not disappointed with Joshua because he didn't KO Franklin. I'm disappointed with Joshua because it was a poor performance.
Franklin fought an awkward, safety 1st fight. Folks are being too tough on AJ
Bro, no ones hating him for scoring a ud vs a tough, game opp. Peoples gripe w him is the fact that he always fights like a goddamn 🅱️ussy. Never seen a HW so scared to get touched on the chin.
I mean its not that bad as it is. Joshua did not look ready for elite opponents but you can hardly expect that from him given his recent losses and the fact he has only recently joined his new trainer. He needs to take at least a year where he fights regularly and builds his confidence back up before he steps in against the top 10 again
It'll be remembered as a mediocre performance. It wasn't the fact Franklin wasn't knocked out, but more so AJ failed to commit to the fight and didn't really trouble Franklin   The severity of how poor the performance was will also depend on how Joshua moves forward. Couple of solid wins, people will forget
It wouldn't make any difference. The main takeaway is that AJ hasn't regained his killer instinct yet. He didn't looked too bad either, but it's not like he was expected to.
Haha! Cope what? You're the one clearly having a hard time coping with the fact that we don't love Fury like you love Fury..  it about who's an AJ fan boy. These are boxing fans talking boxing. You brought emotion into this. Check yo'self
People here are like: AJ did good...   NO! He could  have done better. Don't be those YES  BRILLIANT AJ man and be honest;  he did pass the test but it was far from impressive.
Hahaha aj fans cope
I think only Joyce stops Franklin. Every other heavyweight in the division is overrated. Joshua's revealed some weaknesses, and a lack of fighting ambition, but Fury and Wilder aren't that good. He still has a decent chance of beating them. Usyk would decision everyone else the same way he did Joshua.
Im not the one that was going around promising a "KO in 6 rounds" on interviews before the fight m8  Its disappointing because they didn't deliver what they promised
I know people want to find anyway to salvage this for AJ, but I'm interested in what hapoens if Franklin gets KOed in his next fight to someone like big baby.
We'll never know because Franklin is not at a level where any contender who isn't signed with Eddie Hearn would bother fighting him.  The problem wasn't that there was no knockout. It was that he coasted for 12 rounds and didn't demonstrate any of the power/combinations that was suppose to be his style (pre-Ruiz)
Probably as much as AJ's win over Kevin Johnson. Kevin Johnson went the distance with Dubois, Fury, Vitali, Hrgovic, Ruiz but AJ stopped him in 2 rounds  That win is only going to be significant if Franklin beats someone of note, otherwise I think Franklin going to be another tough gatekeeper guy like Takam that tests(or even beat) prospects for world level
Honestly if he could fight out the clinch better he probably would’ve got the KO late. Franklin was clinching  a lot
100% agree, there was times when he was clinching where he really looked like he didn't want to be there.  People are saying Franklin was tricky and spoiling, but from what I saw, Joshua just didn't want to go for the kill. I truly wonder if he has PTSD from the Ruiz fight
He did dominate... He literally won every round without taking any damage himself. Is that not dominating to you?
Exactly this. Yes there are some people being too harsh for AJ not getting the finish but AJ still seems scared to trade
>The severity of how poor the performance   The performance where he could easily be given 11 rounds comfortably, landed twice as many punches, had twice the accuracy, and was never in any danger. That is one that is severely poor . . . .
One of them is a drug cheat that's been destroying his body for years, and the other one has zero sense of accountability and a superpower for knocking out bums. I don't see how Joshua doesn't have a good chance. I can't even imagine the toll on Fury's body, ballooning up in weight and then having to lose so much of it time and again. As someone who's just 6'4, running at 50lbs more than your fighting weight is crazy.
Which round do you think he should have gone for the kill in?
I just think he’s low on confidence generally. I thought he looked mostly fine in the Pulev fight. It’s pretty clear the Usyk losses have fucked with him just as much as getting KOed.
Sorry man. I have higher standards for a dominant performance.
It's hard to say what I would say about Fury in that scenario.. he really only fights bums and Denotay Wilder! 🤣🤣
If AJ didn't underperform, why did he push Franklin's head at the end? He was clearly frustrated with his performance. He was unable to really hurt Franklin
The lad who destroyed his body for years still has an infinitely better gas tank as the heavier man lmfao
It’s so strange to me that you guys can watch Joshua basically regress every fight yet still give him a chance to beat Wilder and Fury. Joshua doesn’t even have the cardio to go 12 with either of them.
I agree, Joshua could beat Wilder Fury and Usyk maybe 1 time out of 10
Probably after around the 4th, Franklin tried early to test AJs whiskers and hadn't succeded and AJ was getting on top around then.  Anyway it's not about a specific timing, it's the fact then when AJ caught Franklin with a good shot, he never followed it up, not once really all fight. The AJ that rose through the ranking, would of pounced on that, this AJ doesn't have that killer instinct anymore,  or doesn't want to act on it.  I know he got caught in the Ruiz fight, but catching an opponent with a good shot and then jumping on the opportunity of a KO was how Joshua became a world champion and arguably the no1 heavyweight. I feel nowadays he's trying to be something he's not, and it's not doing him any favours
True never thought about that, after Ruiz could put it down to getting caught, but after usyk outboxed him doubted his chin and boxing ability
Sounds like you don't know what you're talking about to be honest with you.
I hope Wladimir Klitschko doesn’t use Reddit
Infinitely better? Then why does Fury keep pricing himself out of fights?
Are you banking this on Fury's 4th fight with Chisora or Wilder's knockout of a guy who's going nowhere in the division? Joshua fought and lost to someone who's arguably top ten p4p in the world. Usyk's skills translate to lower weight classes and he's a decent size.
Yea but Fury is ducking Usyk, that makes him HW's biggest bitch. How you gonna call somebody a middleweight and then avoid a 70/30 fight you proposed?   Nothing worse in boxing than a duck. A duck is worse than a loss imo. Pure cowardice
I think most in this thread will agree that the Chisora that fought Usyk was NOT the Chisora that fought Fury for a useless 3rd time.   Also... they may agree... Fury got his arse, thoroughly handed to him by Otto Wallin... but got a gift from Bob Arum and ESPN with biased judges and a countdown of the scorecard, and a gift with the ref and Dr. Not stopping the fight.   @ me bruh!
Fury rightfully won a wide decision there  The issue is whether or not the cut was bad enough to stop the fight. I reckon if fury cut wallin that bad the fight is stopped
Fury ducked AJ and Usyk, so he is a double duck. It's embarrassing. Absolutely disgraceful stuff
It's not like bad scoring isn't an issue in boxing. I wonder if I'm the only one in here that saw it from the perspective of Wallin getting robbed. If we go to twitter.. I know I'm not the only one lol! But... that's Twitter!
I have a difference of opinion. Fury landed a few more punches, but Wallin worked his body like a drum, pushed him around, hurt him, cut him... if that fight was on any platform besides ESPN, Wallin would have had his hand raised - IMO  Remember points/rounds aren't just scored on volume - but on EFFECTIVE punches in the pro ranks!   Solid debate here!
Yes.. I'm saying that. Time for you to look in the mirror if a disagreement about your man crush makes you resort to name calling. 🤫
It’s been a while since I watched but I thought fury landed more and more meaningful shots, then got cut and after getting cut didn’t look in any trouble in what was a cagey affair  I do think though that if fury cut wallin that badly the fight would have been stopped and it would have been a fury win  So simultaneously fury deservedly won but wallin also got robbed
Nah Fury was putting up artificial deadlines that didn't apply to Charr and Chisora, only AJ. We know now thanks to Usyk that this is how Fury ducks, he complicates negotiations and goes on Insta   Either way he's stopping undisputed, so he's a coward. The Usyk duck is the biggest duck in hw since Bowe threw the belt in the trash. Holding up the whole division ffs
Not weighing in on the discussion, just wanna point out that anyone saying 'cope' instantly erases any semblance of maturity they may have had
> "I am The President, not of the United States, but maybe president of the world."  - Ike Ibeabuchi
Ibeabuchi any day of the week
I watched Ibeabuchi vs. Tua last week after catching the "Darker Side of Boxing" podcast about him. Forgot what a total beast he was. I don't think Joshua could hurt him or keep away from him for 12 rounds. Ike all day. Sad that he blew it all. Most likely some undiagnosed bipolar or something.
Ike all day
Who is Ibeabucha? What fights should I watch of his?
Tough to call. Ike operated in Mid Range, Anthony pre Andy was a mid range operator, nowadays he prefers long range which would definitely favor him in this match up. Keep in mind we never seen Ike against the Giants, who’d put that jab on him. This is a toss up Pre Ruiz it could go either way post Anthony wins a Punch and Clutch decision.
Yeah if Ike could catch Chris Byrd flush, he'd have no problem with AJ.
Ibeabuchi was literally a psychopath. AJ wouldn't be mentally tough enough to stay in the fight with the aggression and stamina Ike would be bringing. Ike's war with prime David Tua showed just how much leather he could fling over 12 rounds without tiring.
Ibeabuchi is Joshua’s worst nightmare. He’d maul him and stop him in 6 rounds
We talking about Anthony Joshua or we talking about Femi?
Ike would put AJ in the hospital
>He was huge (6 ft 2 and 235- 245 lb), heavy handed, had an iron chin, had crazy stamina despite his muscular build, was fearless in the ring, and put relentless pressure on all his opponents    Which is why he'd go the way of Miller and fail the VADA tests. Like many I don't think any of them are clean, but he was beyond the limit of what you can get away with now.
Personally, I think Tua won that fight and that Ibeabuchi was pushed by the commentators. Joshua has almost all of the attributes necessary to be an ATG heavyweight, he's just lacking in a trainer and the will to take risks. Derrick James is okay, but none of his fighters are worldbeaters like Emmanuel Steward's.   You can't really fight safely against a certified insane man, who loved fighting. I think that's the biggest difference between the two of them, Ibeabuchi loved fighting. Ike wins.
Well, porcelain chin Joshua trading power shots w Ike is out of the question. So lets assume he employs the hit and run tactic he used in the 2nd Ruiz jr fight. Ike was able to put away the orders of magnitude elusive Chris Byrd who also has a proven iron chin. Its an impossible fight for a feeble mortal like Joshua to win. Ike was literally god-tier HW that could only be troubled by Ali, Holmes and Foreman.
Ike would walk through him and KO him. The end.
AJ.
I’d imagine AJ outboxes him (he’s faster imo and longer) for the first half of the fight, the question is if he can survive ibeabuchi’s relentless pace if ibeabuchi is given the opportunity to apply it. If he does, I’d imagine ibeabuchi wins a late KO, if ibeabuchi isn’t given the opportunity to work, I suspect an AJ UD.
I don’t see how AJ wins, it’s a bad matchup. He doesn’t have an elusive enough style to deal with the pressure, and definitely doesn’t have the chin to deal with the power. Meanwhile we know Ike can get to elusive fighters (Byrd) and has the chin to go toe to toe with practically anybody (Tua fight proved that).
Mr President would put quite a whopping on Femi. Even the best version of AJ couldn't fuck with Ike unless he just tried to unload on him early. Ike was incredibly hard to hurt though, so that's not likely to be enough.
AJ stands no chance. ESPECIALLY psychologically. Ike was so mentally deranged that it made him an absolute fearless juggernaut in the ring. Polar opposite to AJ
Scary matchup for AJ, I see the President stopping him pretty early
Ike goes through him like a freight train
Not even close. IKE by KO. Somewhere around 3 rounds would be my guess.
Ike. Could fight all ranges. Has some ring IQ and would force AJ to brawl inside.   AJ runs out of gas if he doesn't KO Ike very early, which Tua couldn't even do.   That KO Ike gave Byrd is one of my favorites. Hit him so hard Bryd decided to talk to the Ref as he was getting beat up. He had no idea what planet he was on.
AJ gets caught while looking over to his corner and starts the chicken dance
Ike murders him
Seriously? Ike would destroy him.
Joshua would be the weakest demon for Ike.
Ike takes it but his brain is even more scrambled
That would be a complete massacre-I would have an ambulance on call for AJ
U serious right now, bro?
AJ gets KOed 100/100 times
"AND TWICE ON A SUNDAY YOU BIG DOSSER" - Donald Duck
It didn’t help that Ike’s mom encouraged his delusions, she’s the one who suggested the AC in his hotel room was blowing ghosts inside
Is that podcast on YouTube? That sounds like it's right up my alley.
Ike ibeabuchi Vs David Tua is one of greatest heavyweight fights of all time
The best prospect of the past 30 years. You name it he had it. Speed, power in both hands, technique and an iron chin. All the talent in the world but he was legit crazy.   Byrd and Tua were two top 5 heavyweights those are Ike’s best fights
Good analysis! Yeah, it would be interesting to see him vs someone as big and athletic as AJ.
Joshua doesn't have an impressive jab. He is unique for being a lanky, powerful guy with a solid mid-range game, but he is less special at distance, and surprisingly vulnerable up close.     Ibeabuchi knew how to fight taller men, as he showed against Calvin Jones. He applied steady pressure without grinding through punishment. His footwork was nimble despite appearances.
And he couldn’t be knocked down by David Tua. I like AJ but he’s get demolished
The strong one.
I think police one founds a ton of steroid vials in his car
I think ATG is a stretch and recency bias.  He could have been better, but he still had some serious flaws that would be hard for any coach to iron out.
Don't know why the downvotes....I think you're on point. A hw couldn't ask for better physical gifts than Joshua, I just don't think he has that crazy savage instinct that you see in fighters like Ike, Hagler, Holyfield, etc. Not heart, which he has, but straight up killer instinct. Ike came to put a hurting on people.
Porcelain chin? Joshua has flaws as a fighter, but the idea of him having a weak chin is rubbish. The guys taken flush shots off big hitters, including Wlads straight right and Povetkins left hook, and never actually been KO'D.   His main problem is his mental fortitude.
>Ike was literally god-tier HW that could only be troubled by Ali, Holmes and Foreman.  Man, shut up. Man had 2 fights of note and then his career ended after that. Don't try and hype him up like that.
Byrd didn't have a proven iron chin. His attributes were his speed and he was known to be almost unhittable. Until he fought Ibaebuchi anyways.   Also scraping by Tua, who I thought won the fight,  and catching Chris Byrd does not make Ike God tier.
Ike also said he started seeing demons after the Tua fight
Why’d this guy stop if he beat Tua and Byrd?
Same. Do you think Lennox would’ve beaten Ike? I can see allot of parallels between Lennox and Anthony it’s a shame they don’t get along.
Joshua is more battle tested. Ike never faced off against Giants like Lennox or the Klitschkos. Anthony has great fundamentals and with his new style I think he’d dull the fight to decision. I’m an Ike fan but he’s not tested, he remains mythical.
Total BS.
Ike doing what he did and getting incarcerated is perhaps one of the great tragedies of the sport. What he could have become...
You're right, mentality is 90% of it. I was listening to the Rocky Marciano interview tapes and he said after training camp, he could punch the fly off of a person's body. I don't know why, but I believe him.
AJ was definitely blessed physically. I remember seeing him race Mo Farah in 100m dash, and the man ran like 11 seconds flat. Ridiculous body.
AJ's chin is solid. His heart is not.   Watching him vs Ruiz it was obvious he had no idea what to do when rocked.
Bro pls stop. Both guys were way out of their prime. Even if his chin was solid, he would eventually crumble by virtue of his weak 'mental fortitude'.
Ike definitely passes the eye test as a dangerous fighter, but his resume is far too thin for him to be put up on such a pedestal.
No you shut up. Two wins over PRIME Tua and Byrd is a greater feat than anything Joshua has done in his dumpster fire career
First he kidnapped his girlfriends son and tried to kill himself (and the son) by plowing into a concrete pillar. the son would never walk normal again, and he got 4 months.  A few months after that, he raped a lady, and then it came out that he raped another girl a few months prior  Was deemed mentally unfit to stand trial, then spent the next 2 decades in prison.  Gooood riddance.
Just look up his wiki page or watch a YouTube video. But long story short he was always a bit crazy but after he made a name for himself he really lost it and he just faded away into obscurity. He has YouTube channel where he teased a comeback 6 or 7 years ago but nothing came of it.
He was an extremely disturbed and dangerous man, had an awful upbringing. Also really smart ( especially for such a brutish dude from such an impoverished background with no education iirc), he got several college associate degrees while in prison.
Exactly. He's used to being the hammer, not the nail.
Power is the last thing to go. And Povetkin wasn't out of his prime.  Explain in detail how Joshua has a "porcelain" chin. The guy has never been KO'd and has taken big shots. That's facts.
Yeah, better than beating Wladmir Kitschko. Delusional.
OH SHIT. I did not see this coming
He has a little YouTube channel nowadays, if you were interested. Definitely an awful dangerous mad-man like you said.
He has a little YouTube channel nowadays, if you were interested. Definitely an awful dangerous mad-man like you said.
That happens to a lot of undefeated power pinchers that don't spar hard.   You have to train those situations, and some never been in them before.   It's like, I love Iron Mike, but we never saw him have to come back before. As much as I liked his early career, I can't place him that highly because we never saw his heart need to pull his ass out of a fire.
Povetkin was absolutely out of his prime, he was 39. This being said, pretending like he was shot and still not a good fighter (he was world ranked no3) is dumb and not true, it was a good win.
Power may be the last to go but efficiently delivering that payload deteriorates. Joshuas been dropped a few times which in itself is not a sign of a porcelain chin but had Joshua continued to fight Ruiz jr in the first bout, he eventually wouldve got kod cold. He also always seems stunned whenever het gets hit even by non power hitters like Usyk.
Over the hill, out of prime, washed up, shopworn Wlad. Chris Byrd fearlessly fought PRIME wlad in the pocket.
He's a big dude, I'm sure his pinches hurt like hell
>Over the hill, out of prime, washed up, shopworn Wlad.  Gotta love the exaggerations. So over the hill and washed up that he was one fight removed from being unified heavyweight champion for nearly a decade.  Imagine hyping up a guy who only has 2 good wins and then got locked up for rape and act like he's and a better career than AJ. This is what happens parents don't discipline their children, they say and do dumb shit.
Yes, and Byrd got beaten the first time by decision, and then brutally stopped in the second fight. He said  Wlad Klitschko hit brutally hard too, much harder than Vitali.
Lol
In fairness, wlad was literally 42 years old
And complaints about HW the last 2(?) Decades: no action, no big KO artists scaring everyone.
If that sort of thing exists and is public you’d most likely find it in Google Scholar, scholar.google.com, rather than regular google. You’ll need to learn how to formulate your keywords though
I have a sizable database (50,000+ fights), and have looked at this informally. If I recall correctly (it’s been a couple years), there is a decent correlation between size and win probability.  If you like, I can get you more concrete data later (I will try this weekend), but my database is far from a random sample, so my data is going to be skewed.
Getting baader meinhopf phenomenon. Was just pondering data science in boxing today. Maybe a few redditors could help compile a database of fight records for analysis. At least then we can continue to grow the database and study the subset we already have. Discernable amount of man hours though, would need to be a big bunch unless there's already an open source one
It wouldn’t be too hard to look all the past heavyweight championship bouts. You could gather that information in a day for lineal, WBC, WBA, IBF and WBO.
there's some really interesting statistical analysis to be done in boxing. as far as im aware there's no public database - i would be v interested to look into it too.   OP you into stats? had to do a data analysis presentation for a job interview recently and forgot how much i sincerely love doing that stuff, really tryna do more for my own personal interests. if you've got any leads pm me, would be massively appreciated  interesting on that 1 study that says >10% weight difference has no discernable difference in performance
haha good old chatGPT, both those papers are bullshit. The link isn't even to a paper of that title and the first link doesn't exist.  This is really a good type of question that chatGPT is just going to make something up. No one is studying this. Who is going to get their PhD in this or fund this research? No one.  You could do this real easy though if you had a connection to boxrec. Take all heavy weight fights in box rec, subtract draws and count the wins by the heavier fighter divided by the total number of non-draw fights. End up with a pretty meaningless and uninformative statistic in regards to a fight this weekend.
I feel like there would be a lot of important information missing if you just scale it. there would be a lot of meaninless wins and losses.  Too much noise.   I think boxrec has barriers in place but you could write a simple script, that coild scrape the database.
Heavyweight boxing blog has great data, iirc. As I recall, the gist of it is there is a huge correlation between weight and winning in HW.  Not as big a correlation with height, but still an advantage. Weight is as likely to be fat as muscle..
Holy crap! Do you analyze boxing for a living?
What if I told you Archie Moore had that *dawg* in him?
God damn. That probably would've been stopped with today's standards.
The mongoose is my all time favorite
THIS is the fight that really got me into boxing as a kid. Came across it one day flipping channels on ESPN 2.
Probably the greatest comeback come from behind victory ever seen. Top 5 fight of all time as well, the fight is one you'd see in a rocky film but for real.
Absolute slug fest!
Ugas won against Porter. Travesty that the knockdown in the twelfth was called a slip
Brown stopped making any effort to win any of these recent rounds
In case y'all don't know, ESPN+ has the Japan card at 2am CST.  I'll be up all night
This Schramm dude is nasty. Brown's volume is impressive.
Good fight tho
Time to take a nap and set the alarm for the Japanese card.
No fight thread for Shobox?
Terry is going to be a fun one to watch in the future, his counter punching is great. The only issue I see could be him not being that active in some round like the first and third.
Very entertaining round
Nice pressure and constant changing up of shots Schramm. Lets see you double up on some of those uppcuts
Commentators have been dog shit not even recognizing the good work from Schwarmm
Schramm has a good chin, too.  Hope he doesn't get robbed
98-92 is insane 💀
97-92 O.o
Day 5 of asking: Does anyone know what happened to the WBA’s plan to move HQ to Houston? Did it get scrapped? I haven’t heard anything since last year.
I used to follow the sport closely. I boxed, I ran a boxing club for five years. I adopted a couple kids and I sort of focused on the kids so much I fell out of the sport.   I used to get my boxing fix from Tuesday Night Fights, Boxing after Dark, and the pay per views.   This was from the pre-streaming days.   My question now is, as a Canadian what should I do to be able to watch the fights again?  As a rural person my internet sucked but we just got fibre optic cable in the neighborhood.  Is there a streaming service that is worth my time?  I don’t have cable anymore.   What should I do in order to watch the fights again ?
I noticed there are 3 fights this weekend at pretty much the same time. Which one are you guys going to watch or which one would you recommend watching?  Shakur vs Yoshino  Bam Rodriguez vs Gonzalez  Sebastian Fundora vs Brian Mendoza
These guys are rabbit punching the shit out of each other.  Edit: It's actually just Garcia but that's pretty blatant.
The new all access episode for Davis-Garcia is sick. I hope they give us 4 episodes for this fight
Best round from Schramm
Second half was all Schramm, it’s either a draw or a win for Schramm.
98-92 was really wide but not mad. Need to watch some Boxeo de Primera, these Argentinians entertaining.
Fundora family always game and fun to watch.
406 amateur fights? That's insane if true
What time is Shobox?
Brown reminds me of Chris Tucker
Schramm picking up the pace..so many right hands to the body.  still dropping his right hand too much when Brown counters.
Still very close..
I'll say it again: Tank-Garcia better start at 1:00 AM local time. We in DC had to deal with that; those in Vegas can.
I don't like calling fighters ducks but I find it impressive that Jose Ramirez has managed to avoid fighting regis for 5 years.
Did abel ramos save al haymons life or something?  His fights with ugas, james, and crowley now were all scored alot closer than they should have been.
Just remember something , now that AJs original boyfriend has left. No Skinz No Winz, it is what it is.
Any chance mods can pull their finger out and provide some modicum of utility and get a fight schedule sticky
AJ is on The One Show right now.
Honestly I think this is so overlooked. Ugas might not be a *super* top tier competitor but he deserves more credit than he gets.   People try to discredit Ugas so they can say Spence didn't accomplish anything by beating him. But that guy is a solid 147.
forgot about that thanks for mentioning
He's had the sharper punches, but he's getting outworked.  He's the smarter fighter, but his conditioning isn't great.  He's 29, so time isn't on his side.
Yeah, especially the first few rounds.
Yeah, I usually think that's a judge who favors the aggressor and doesn't appreciate counterpunching
Ask someone close to/working with the WBA on Twitter. Nobody here knows bro but I'd imagine they have a Twitter linked to them somewhere
I'll link you to my comment, those are ways to watch the big promotions, the smaller ones, the international ones and the domestic ones in Canada.  &#x200B;  https://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/12c6efm/watching\_fights\_in\_canada/jf0oucn/?context=3
Best bet would be to look at the upcoming fight cards on Dazn, Top rank, showtime, etc. Check the times of the cards and who's fighting, then watch some of their highlights and full fights on YouTube to see who you vibe with before looking at exact subscription to purchase.
DAZN is best streaming service. I buy PPVs for good fights or fighters I want to support, but it is very easy to find a free stream for every boxing fight. It is not illegal to watch the stream only for the person who is streaming it.
Shakur Stevenson fights tomorrow, one of the best boxers fighting today  Jared Anderson and Keyshawn Davis are on his undercard, two great prospects  Pretty sure you can get ESPN+ in Canada which will give you the fight
Fundora prolly has the most entertainment value. Bam put up a stinker last fight and the opponent isn’t really good and Shakur is Shakur lmao
The Stevenson undercard is by far the one to watch.
The Bam card is probably the best and the fight that I'm most excited from the three cards is Ray Ford vs Jessie Magdaleno.
Exactly
Sounds like BS.  Commentators didn't even believe it.  He turned pro at 19.  How could he have that many?
It's on now
Yeah, good fight
Even when Prograis is a world champion, Ramirez will duck him, lol!
Regis is irrelevant. Regis could get these fights with a serious promoter but he would rather cry wolf.
Maybe he named his son after him or something, like Santa Cruz did, lol!
Have you tried, y'know, checking the sidebar?
WBA will be a joke organization if they allow that.
Did he shadowbox again and scaring the hosts?
I do think Crawford wins against Spence, but Ugas is undeniably the best win of either of those. Not just that Spence won, but also in the fashion that he did. Ugas currently is still top 5 WW and if he actually fights Barrios it will be onesided
It goes both ways for Ugas and Porter. Give credit to Ugas for winning and then Porter gets his stock plummeted for losing every step up fight he had at welter and if u give credit to Porter then Ugas is j a solid competitor whose best win is Manny the politician
👍
Got blessed with that draw tonight. I wanna see those scorecards
Based af and I'm not even Canadian.
One of the best boxers fighting today, yet can’t even make weight for a title fight.
Yeah this is basically how I see it.   * Shakur fight will be a methodical ass whooping. I'm sure it will play out exactly how I imagine it. 9-3 territory with a possible very late corner stoppage. * Fundora is probably going to win but it should still be exciting because he's a slugger and Mendoza isn't gonna go down without a fight.  Is the Bam fight for the vacant WBO? They're ranked #1 and #2 in the body at flyweight
Appreciate it!
Regis gate was better than Ramirez gate in their last fight.
Ramirez is the real irrelevant guy, beltless too because he chose to be. And it took him 11 rounds to stop a shot Commey where a smaller Teofimo knocked him out in 2 rounds.
Ramirez is irrelevant as well
Being a duck apologist is LOW man!!!!!!
😂😂😂Game changed😂😂😂👊
Don't be sarcastic w/ me chump
Is the sidebar accessable on the app?
Nah, he’s chill today lol.
Right on brother. When Ugas hit him with that flush 1-2 during the mouth guard incident, and EJ waddled back onto the ropes.... I was shitting my pants. As a Dallas man, that was the most terrifying moment in boxing for me in years.
I can't believe one judge gave Terry the 8th.  I thought it was clear Garcia, but what do I know?  It was a close fight, don't mind a draw...
Those two factors don’t contradict eachother  If anything it shows he might not be that disciplined, but has nothing to do with his in ring talent  And my g you’re favorite fighter is Tyson Fury, better to miss weight than be a drug cheat
Your boy Tyson Fury can't even sign on the dotted line, how about that?
Maybe you should go watch "professional weight cutting" if you think great boxers can't miss weight.
I think the WBO is in contention between Nakatani and Moloney
He is on ESPN. Last time Regis had a fight on a major network?
Yeah, there's "about", "menu" and then there's the three dots at the top that open a menu with a "community info" option. All those will show you potentially helpful stuff.
I had it 4-4 tbh
No “best boxers” miss weight. Discipline is a big part in boxing.
Doesn't matter, he's still irrelevant
Thanks! I checked it out and noticed that Shakur vs Yoshino is slated to be on ESPN. Does this mean it wont be on ESPN+?
I can see that.
Missing weight has nothing to do with their in ring skill and talent  Like I said if anything it shows he needs to be more disciplined.  But I get it, you like arguing.
You are wrong, daddy-o. Jose will still get that bread.
Can't help you there. That's not really my area of expertise. You'd be better off Googling.
Missing weight is disrespectful to the fans paying for his fights
Tyson Fury popping for PED’s is disrespectful to the fans paying for his fights
Tyson Fury avoiding the tough fights is disrespectful to the fans paying for his fights
false positive due to boar meat
It’s not a false positive if the substances were actually in his body from eating boar meat. You should stick to one excuse or at least not choose two who are mutually exclusive
Floyd was tested and Floyd fought good match-ups.  However, his hardest tests didn’t come from the biggest names on his record.
Floyd did fight the best. But not all of them when they were at their best, like Mosely for example. And when he became "Money" Mayweather he fully took advantage of being the A side. Things like ring size, gloves, judges, refs, rehydration clauses... he would have his say on everything.  He is one of the best to ever do it though. But if he was in the era of Leonard and Hearns... he wouldn't have held on to that 0.
The only people that say that have no idea what they're talking about.   He was as dominant a fighter as we've ever seen, fought anyone that made sense and won convincingly each time.
I dont care how good he is. Floyd and his promoters hurt the sport. Mayweather cards were always boring and it was Pacman that delivered the exciting fights that most people wanted from that era.  With that being said, look at the sport of boxing now. Most people are finally realizing that the WBA is just another corrupt organization. The Mayweather phone call to promote Gervonta with an eBay belt just makes it more comedic.  That's what happens when you use revenue as the measure of success. Everybody is trying to imitate Mayweather, everything feels fabricated, and it makes the sport stagnate.  Professional Boxing is turning into Professional Wrestling but pro wrestling is actually entertaining.
Eh what? He's got one of the most impressive resumes ever. Fought almost exclusively the top 5 in his division for about 20 years and moved up 5 weight classes, and kept fighting till quite an old age, and he made it look easy.  &#x200B;  Like sure, you can say a catchweight against Canelo is an advantage to having no catchweight. But the biggest advantage is that Canelo outweighed him 15 lbs. (150 to 165).  &#x200B;  Sure you can say fighting Pac when Pac was 36 was an advantage to fighting Pac at 29, but Floyd was 38 himself.  &#x200B;  Most of the time he was just levelling the playing field. Most of the time he fought experienced guys at a young age, or young guys at an old age, fought guys bigger than him.  &#x200B;  Floyd fought for money, so he typically chased opponents who were looking good at the time. Has he fought anyone coming off of a loss? I can't recall any. He fought Maidana after he punished Broner. Fought Cotto after he destroyed Marghario. Marquez after he KO'd Diaz etc. Like Ortiz we now don't take seriously, but he just beat Berto who was ranked nr 3 at the time, and Ortiz then fought Mayweather ranked nr 2 by the Ring. Only later do some of these fighters look meh. But everytime Floyd fights them they're ranked top 3 or top 5.  &#x200B;  There are certainly criticisms to be had. Would've been nice if he had fought Pac and Mosley sooner, as a fan. But that's about it. All other fights I think were quite fair, Floyd's weighed less than his opponents in like 95% of his fights. Marquez was the one exception where Floyd was a weight bully and which gave him an unfair advantage. But it must be said that Floyd hadn't fought for 2 years when he took that fight, and Marquez is an absolute HOF legend in his own right.  &#x200B;  There's hardly anyone in the world in any era, who could've taken the same set of world championship fights across 20 years, against the same opposition, at the same weights and ages as Floyd, and won them all. Really hardly anyone, if anyone at all.
A user posted this a while back.   “Floyd was great but way overrated. He ducked a lot of great fighters, and his best wins he fought dudes coming off losses or past their best.. Lets see He fought Pacquiao 5 years too late after  Pacman was slowing down and knocked out by Marquez and Floyd was caught using IVs during the fight, which is sus for PEDs considering he claimed to weigh the same weight on fight night. He fought Marquez at a catchweight he never made, making him come up two weightclasses from lightweight to welterweight he looked 20lbs heavier. Once again, I find it hard to believe he couldn't cut three pounds when he claims he walked around at welterweight. I believe he claimed he walked around at 147 as a tactic to avoid the pressures of moving up in weight or because he was potentially using PEDs. He arguably lost to Castillo badly in the first fight. I think this fight made him the cherry picker he became later. He fought a very defensive running style in the second fight. It was more like a high-level slap boxing. Delahoya was old, and the fight was close. Delahoya did not land cleanly but outworked Mayweather, who threw punches few and far between. Shane mosley was past his best and 5 losses in when Mayweather finally fought him. Ricky Hatton was 140lb champ moving up Cotto was coming off 2 knockout losses to Pac and Margarito. Diego Corrales looked weight drained and dead against Mayweather and was avoided until he was, showing struggles. Canelo was young and was weight drained due to the catchweight. Maidana arguably won the first fight and was paid millions to use those pillow gloves in the rematch His best wins have asterisks. The great three welterweights, Duran, Hearns, and Leonard all beat him. Duran carried his punch to middleweight. He would've muscled Mayweather. Castillo was a poormans Chavez. Mayweather marketed himself well. He avoided Stevie Johnson, Margarito, and Sergio Martinez off the top of my head. Mayweather was great at marketing himself as TBE and using casuals to push him as being the best ever based off his undefeated record. Spare me the he fought the most champions in the 4 alphabet champion era. Alot of those socalled champs wouldn't even be ranked top ten fighters in the 1 championship era. The press who challenged him on ducking or questioned his wins was denied access to his fights. He controlled the narratives because he generated so much money. He was one of the first to use woke culture before it was a thing and used the race card a lot to avoid any criticism of his record. He made more money than anyone in history and good for him, but you can't safely manage your career and be put amongst the all-time greats”  - chingon_83
Emanuel Augustus aka Emanuel Burton aka The Drunken Master
Pretty boy Floyd fought top boxers. When he became money he dictated too much being A side. I'm not sure who could've beaten him in their prime. The closest would be Manny in his prime. Wish all these fighters fought in the 80s with no drama. Just best against best where zero didn't matter
Floyd is one of the best defensive wizards of all time, BUT he did more harm than good to the sport. They whole "money" gimmick went overboard. Horrible undercards because the main event sucked up every penny. The mirage of what is his undefeated record. I mean, the Connor fight (0-0 mma guy) as his last fight was a slap in the face. The Berto fight before that NO ONE wanted to watch that. Manny fight was just unfortunate timing  as you can see Pac was hurt, but I can't fault Floyd for that, but not to let him get the cortisone shot just never sat right with me. The 6 or 7 fights after the JLC rematch were underwhelming. His best performance came when he was "pretty boy" against Corrales. Now, look at what the sport is trying to dig itself out of? Overpaid, mismatched fighters being force fed to us with the occasional good card. We need a change!!
The first half of his career was pretty damn amazing. It's that second half that he became a risk assesor. He did fight the correct names, but most of the time it was AFTER they showed a weakness/bad performance. I cant recall of one guy that he fought while they were having the best moment of their life.   Cotto he fought after the Margarito beatdown.  Pac he fought after Marquez sent him to the shadow realm  Judah he fought after losing to Baldomir.   Mosley was having a good moment but he was no longer the same as the guy that fought DLH.    Guys he could have fought that looked threatening were Paul Williams, Winky Wright(Floyd ducked after agreeing), Margarito, Martinez. He also had a solid roster of guys he could have fought before reitiring. Thurman, Spence and Crawford. But Berto was better...
Floyd’s career is smoke and mirrors. His best wins are Chico, Oscar, and Canelo. Even then, he never entered the ring as an underdog. Not once.
Yes and no. Did he fight the best guys available to him, on paper? Mostly, yes. Were most in their prime? No. Did most of their styles favor his? Yes.  &#x200B;  On one hand, he was purely dominant over the best competition readily available to him in his weight classes, but at the same time, he didn't challenge himself to look outside the box and find competition elsewhere that would make him the underdog; he never "dared to be great." Literally, the guy was never once the betting underdog in his entire career.  &#x200B;  There's also several examples of better competition he avoided in place of who he actually decided to fight. Specifically, during his "Money" phase.
He got tested in regards to having to dig in and fight hard with Castillo and Maidana.  But I think you mean fighting elite level opposition in their prime, at their preferred weight class.  It's hard to make that argument really.  The elites he fought (Canelo, Pac, Mosley to name 3), none of them were prime and at their preferred weight.  However, I believe he beats all 3 of them at any time, because he was so much better than them.  Also, they agreed to fight, with his demands, so he's going to milk any advantage he can.
Floyd was tested by USADA *lmao*  He refused testing from any other org. He has them in his pockets just like the UFC does. Who do you think Dana got the idea from?
To question whether Floyd fought high calibre opponents is ridiculous.  Here is a list of the Ring Magazine ranked fighters Mayweather fought and their Ring Magazine ranking. Seems like he fought high-calibre opponents to me...  1. Genaro Hernandez - Ring Magazine #1 Super Featherweight Contender  (September 1998) 2. Gregorio Vargas - Ring Magazine #8 Super Featherweight Contender (October 1999) 3. Diego Corrales - Ring Magazine #1 Super Featherweight Contender (January 2001) 4.

He got tested by cotto, manny, castillo, maidana, oscar, augustus, zab  Just because he always won by a few rounds doesnt mean it wasnt difficult.  The manny fight in particular was a super high level chess match, he won by a few rounds but he had to show a lot of skill and knowledge in that fight.
Yes, don't let your hate and his persona cloud your judgement.
Floyd beat 26 world champions. End of story
did he ever get truly tested or is his status as the goat came merely from his excellent and calculated match making strategies?  Uhh, I would say yes to all of your points, he's definitely not the goat but his resume is impressive, you have to put things into perspective, his resume may not be as good as Hearns/Leonard/Robinson but he's still one of the best welterweights ever.  He definitely got tested by facing some of the greatest fighters of his generation.  Castillo rematch, Corrales, De la Hoya and his fights against Cotto and Hatton showed how great he is.  Him, Pacquiao and Klitschko were monsters and stayed at the top for 10+ years.
um yes...
Great breakdown of why Floyd will always  be considered Greatest Duck King of All Time.    https://www.quora.com/Which-fighters-did-Floyd-Mayweather-avoid-during-his-heyday/
I rate floyd but is he that great that he almost had no difficulty fighting all these great fighters.   &#x200B;  Like the greatest all had trouble somewhere.   He made 147 look like light work most of the time. No serious danger so imo to test greatness you need to move up in weight. Like canelo could stay at 160-168 his whole career and dominate until he old.   Roberto duran could stay at lightweight and just dominate forever but decided to go face iran barkley at super middleweight that crazy bastard.   He aint suppose to be fight Marvin Hagler at middleweight or thomas hearns at super welterweight back to back. If he won then thats the win of the century. That to be is truly testing yourself because when the odds are that heavily stacked against you and you go in there knowing you may come out a different person but chase glory anyways.   Ali- foreman  Duran-srl  Manny-Margarito     Floyd has never been in a fight when the odds were not in his favor. If floyd went up to 160 and somehow beat GGG on points then thats being truly tested. He still a all time great fighter but he does not have all time great accomplishments like some other greats.
Jab Judah kicked his ass the 1st half of the fight. For the life of me it looks like he either got bored or took a dive. He had Maywhether beat.
Zan Judah. Sugar Shane. De la Hoya (old too)
Yeah, by Mike Tyson.
I feel like Emanuel Augustus gave him a good challenge
Floyd was tested, and as much as I hate what boxing has become in part bc of him.   that’s a part of the current game - the weight game, and wait game. He was very good at that, but that doesn’t take away from how great he was
Floyd was very technical with a lot of tangibles. In any H2H would be very hard to beat
No i don't subscribe to this notion, But i could be biased as i've seen his Career Play out and am a Fan,. There are Compilations of him Essentially Calling out Names in his division's and never getting Those fights,.. When his Notoriety and him being a Bankable fighter, Truly became a Thing, he was sought after, AFTER BEING DUCKED while, he was "Pretty boy",..  He was Pretty much older than Most of the Guys he Faced after a certain Point, if they were Past their Prime, that is entirely their Own issue, he gave them a Pay day, if they beat Him... You wouldn't have those Negative assessments of them.
To be fair, he fought the vast majority of his fights with a brittle hand. That's the reason why he focused more on accuracy because his right hand can break.
You’re right. It came from reading books.
Prime delahoya will batter him ngl.
The way Floyd haters/Pac fanboys are working overtime to rewrite history is hilarious to me.
He didn't win convincingly each fight. Almost all of them?Sure. But not each one.
Bullshit. I followed all of Floyds career. He was looking like he could go down as the greatest in his 130-135 days. But 147 and above he definitely had the tendency to go with the opponent that was the least risky fight.    Why do you think people would always give him shit for it back in the day? Everybody was wrong?
+1
I agree! I’ve watched millions of fights and the two guys that stand out to me the most are SRL and Floyd. Two guys that were just amazing technicians and have great ring IQs.
he had a few close fights but hes still the best OVERALL fighter ive ever seen. He had some less than convincing  wins here and there as anybody does.
Calm down. I get people downplay Floyd too much, but he definitely did not fight "anyone that made sense", and didn't win convincingly each time.
Most impressive resumes ever?
Stop, just stop. Fought Marquez after he destroyed Diaz(lightweight)...  Cotto after he destroyed one eyed, couldnt get licensed in NV Margarito.
Pac should’ve agreed to drug testing then
That’s a bunch of bull shit
Great supplement read to solidify how he was the Duck King and got away with cheating by fighting in Nevada and how the governing bodies allowed him to cheat. Who he ducked, why he ducked, when he ducked.  https://www.quora.com/Which-fighters-did-Floyd-Mayweather-avoid-during-his-heyday/
Why wouldn’t Pac agree to drug testing?
Maaan Winky woulda been the most boring fight ever but I think with neutral judges he UDs Mayweather. Bigger, awkward style, great jab, hard guard to break and I don’t think Mayweather has enough pop at that weight to really keep Winky honest.
It's not his fault he was better than everybody
He was the underdog vs Diego Corrales. Odds might have changed come fight night.
hes fought plenty of elite prime fighters, his first two weight classes kill that narrative
Some people can't handle this fact.
Can't believe this is downvoted. Yes, all rankings are subjective and imperfect. But there's no better standard of boxing rankings than the Ring. Again, it's not perfect, but find me a better standard?  &#x200B;  And if that standard shows that across 20 years and 5 divisions a guy fights top 3 in his division, or even p4p top fighters across divisions, and never loses, then at the LEAST you can't say that his resume sucks, or that he hasn't been tested. To downvote that is just outright silly.  &#x200B;  Was Pac a bigger threat at age 29 than when Floyd fought him? Sure, that's not a debate. But Pac was p4p nr 1 after Floyd. There literally wasn't a fighter better ranked than Floyd across all divisions, when Floyd took this fight, and Floyd is 3 years older than Pac! That's simply a solid fight that would test anyone's mettle. To discount that is not objective.
A few? More like three fews plus a round.
> his resume may not be as good as Hearns/Leonard/Robinson but he's still one of the best welterweights ever.  &#x200B;  But that's the thing. It's taboo to criticise these guys' resumes, but you could do it, too.   &#x200B;  Like Leonard's only win over Hearns: Leonard fought in his natural division, in his prime against Hearns, who was 22 at the time, a young guy, and Hearns had only won his first title fight 1 year prior. Okay, what's the problem?  &#x200B;  Then take Floyd: Floyd had moved up 5 divisions already. Floyd was 36 and past his prime. Canelo outweighed him 15 pounds on fight night. And this would've been Canelo's 8th title fight. Floyd won easy.  &#x200B;  Floyd gets shit for that fight because Floyd somehow had an unfair advantage due to weight and fighting a young guy. But Leonard gets this win as one of the reasons he's an ATG (which he undoubtedly is), despite the age/weight being more favourable for Leonard than for Floyd. And in the rematch, despite Leonard getting knocked down twice it was ruled a draw although the majority agreed Leonard lost the competitive fight.   &#x200B;  And you can do this type of critique across someone's resume, even an ATG like Leonard.  lost his first fight against Duran and won the second. The third match Duran was 38 and already had 7 losses behind him, he had come out of retirement twice already, and it was the Lightweight's first super middleweight fight, it wasn't competitive. I'm not even mentioning all the weight/food excuses of Duran for fight II. Does this take anything away from Leonard? No, it's just easy bs criticism.   &#x200B;  Hagler, of course a legendary win for Leonard, was Hagler's retirement fight. He already considered retiring, took one more payday, and then never fought again. Of the two, Hagler was the oldest by 2 years. But when Floyd took a fight against Pac, while Floyd was the oldest by 2 years, and while Pac was ranked nr 1 p4p after Floyd and while Pac won another 5 title fights even half a decade later against solid opposition like Thurman, this fight is critiqued as 'Floyd waited till Pac was easy pickings'. Yet the same isn't said for Leonard/Hagler, when Hagler was the oldest and immediately retired after.  &#x200B;  I'll be the last to critique Leonards' resume, he's an absolute legendary ATG. That's precisely why I mentioned a few examples of how you could critique him worse than Floyd based on objective facts, but it isn't done because it's just silly to do so. If it makes no sense there, it makes no sense here.
Dude really said fuck charity and didn't read one page off of Harry Potter.
The cat in the hat
The only two fights you could really give to someone else, definitely Castillo and maybe maidana, although I don't really know how you could score the first fight for maidana even though it was close, he gave an immediate rematch and showed beyond any doubt that he was the better boxer
I Think you're referring to when he retired Twice and his Family's Moving around as far being his Trainers,..  if you weren't a Title contender or champ, why fight them,.. At some point, he became the A side, I'm kind of confused at WHO these names are,.. because he fought Gatti at super light and then took over welter, then was old after that and still won.. Amir Khan?... Margarito?.. Paul Williams?.. Lol, he faced only Hall of Famers at 47
Stop the cap you hater. Floyd has won of the greatest & most decorated boxing resumes in the history of the sport. He has broken records(non monetary) that will take years or decades to break
Pernell? Toney?   Floyd and Ray were just really fast on top of their technical know how which made schooling people more possible.
I think Floyd gets slept on (not by people in the know) because he's a smaller guy. I think some people think that because he wasn't fighting light heavies he "never fought anyone".
Even when he had arguable draws/ losses, he rematched them within the year and beat them convincingly
Yes
He fought everyone in his era.
It really is... a lot of truth, too, but also a bunch of nonsense, or half-truths.  \> He arguably lost to Castillo badly in the first fight.  Nope, didn't lose badly at all, it was a very close fight with neutrals giving Floyd and Castillo equal share of wins or a draw. He gave Castillo another chance to settle it, and Floyd won that convincingly, even in the words of Castillo himself. This is the worst Floyd ever looked and it was fine.  &#x200B;  \> Delahoya was old, and the fight was close.   Floyd won convincingly, outlanded DLH by like 80%, and outlanded both in jabs and power punches. Was the first time Floyd went up to the 154 division which you forgot to mention. If DLH was old at 34, please do mention that Floyd was old also for his last 9 title fights that he won, while being 34 or older.  &#x200B;  \> Shane mosley was past his best and 5 losses in when Mayweather finally fought him.   &#x200B;  Yes and he was ranked the nr 2 welterweight and nr 3 p4p at the time, but okay... This is what I mean with half-truths. Yes I agree Mosley would've been a bigger challenge earlier in his career. But you make it sound like Mosley is an unranked gatekeeper trying to get a last payday, rather than a nr 3 p4p who was also the WBA welterweight champ at the time. Pac and Canelo fought Mosley after the Floyd loss, but nobody seems to care about that.  &#x200B;  \> Ricky Hatton was 140lb champ   &#x200B;  Sure... if you completely ignore the fact Hatton became WBA 147 champion in 2006 before fighting Floyd in 2007. Hatton already moved up to 147 and won a title more than a year before fighting Floyd, so stop with the bs. Floyd moved from 140 to 147 5 months before Hatton did, which for him was the 4th time he moved up a division, for Hatton the first time.   &#x200B;  \> Cotto was coming off 2 knockout losses to Pac and Margarito.   &#x200B;  What does 'coming off' mean to you? In reality Cotto was coming off 3 KO victories in a row, and hadn't lost a fight in 3 years when he fought Floyd and was ranked nr 1 Jr MW. Should Floyd have avoided that fight?  &#x200B;  \> Diego Corrales looked weight drained and dead against Mayweather and was avoided until he was, showing struggles.   Come on... Neither Mayweather nor Corrales ever fought above 130. They took the fight, Floyd demolished Corrales. Are we now blaming Floyd for the fights his opponents take, or the training regimen they choose? Corrales went on to fight 130 championships and win them on multiple occasions years later. Whatever weight issues that may have affected him, that's Corrales' responsibility.   &#x200B;  \> Canelo was young and was weight drained due to the catchweight.   Blablabla. Canelo outweighed Floyd by 15 pounds on fight night, that's just a fact. And that must've been unfair to not Floyd, but Canelo. I guess it should've been 17 pounds instead, and only then it would've been fair, right? Talk to Canelo about it, he took the fight.  &#x200B;  \> Maidana arguably won the first fight and was paid millions to use those pillow gloves in the rematch   &#x200B;  No he didn't, he lost the first fight (see the official, and virtually all unofficial scorecards) and the second too. Maidana outweighed Floyd by 18 pounds and got the wear the same as Floyd, but I guess that's unfair.  &#x200B;  All this other stuff is even more nonsense speculation, or just not relevant. Like sure, I'm positive he would've avoided a fight with Sergio Martinez like Chingon claims but Martinez has exclusively fought title fights at 154 and 160, when Floyd started at a 130 fighter. When a fighter has to move up 6 weight classes to find a fighter he's not interested in fighting, it's just outright silly to call that ducking. Saying he ducked Pac till he was old, come on, Floyd multiple years older than Pac but somehow age is unfair for everyone except Floyd himself, Pac went on to win 5 more title fights against great opposition like Thurman after the Floyd loss, and he was nr 3 p4p and nr 1 division contender. It's just a joke how you try make these all these wins look like it's meaningless because there's one fact speaking against Floyd, ignoring all the other facts speaking for him.
💉
Oh for sure. Winky was all sorts of wrong for Floyd. Winky showed a solid chin all the way to 170.   I really wanted to see how Floyd would handle Winky's guard. And how Floyd would handle Winky's jab.
Floyd enter the ring favored 6-5.
For one thing, we might have different definitions of the term elite within boxing.  I also only named 3 and accept there's more, I just can't think of anyone he fought at their prime in their weight class who fits the term, but I'm happy to be wrong as I rate Floyd very highly.
>It's taboo to criticise these guys' resumes, but you could do it, too.  I do that too lol.  Every time people talk about Leonard's win over Hagler I like mentioning Guerra's scorecard and the fact that a lot of people had Hagler winning.  I agree with pretty much all your points.  Mayweather gets criticized for stuff like cherry picking, favourable judges, etc...  It's dumb, a sport where boxers/promoters are the ones dictating terms will always have issues, you can't rely on fighters daring to be great and taking risks.  If there's one thing I criticize about Mayweather it's the fact that he didn't fight great fighters multiple times, but again, institutions are responsible for this, not fighters, and second, no one wants to end up with CTE.  Like Bowe/Hearns/Toney or even Katie Taylor, she literally fought everyone, but at what price? most of her fights are wars, is it fun? sure! is she HOF? ofc!  But her brain is on the line.
It's not hating. It's true. He always negotiated some sort of advantage into the contract too. Consistently going into your fights with some sort of arranged advantage is just annoying and should affect how you are ranked.
>Toney?  lol.  Yeah right.  Watch his fight with Dave Tiberi.  Prime Toney got worked by a Sunday school teacher.  He's not in the same class as Mayweather.
i know said he was the best, but to say he won every fight convincingly isnt true. We dont need to over exaggerate to talk about how good floyd is.
I love Floyd. You’re either trippin’ or just don’t know a lot of boxing history
Yeah. Not many people on Floyd's level during his generation. It makes sense to why he was the favorite in every one of his fights.  In time, folk will examine this crop of fighters and their career accomplishments.
Castillo genaro Hernandez corralles. All 3 were p4p or on the fringe of p4p when he fought them
Yep, as far as raw talent yeah he was on Mayweathers level but Mayweather just put in more work, and I love toney  And people say oh yeah but if toney just did this and that then he would be better, but he didn't, Mayweather did
He fought whoever he wanted, whenever he wanted. There are almost no prime elite fighters on his resume.   If he wanted to show true greatness, he wouldn’t have ducked Margarito. He could have challenged Sergio at a catch weight for the MW championship. Or, he could have fought the guys he did years earlier. Floyd chose not to, preferring money to legacy.
Ah, I can't agree.  They looked impressive at that time, but in hindsight not so much.  Castillo later got merked over and over again.  Same thing happened with Corralles.  And Hernandez is seen as a good champion but not elite level status.    I'd even be happy to count Castillo as elite, because thinking back to how he was at that moment, yeah, he was legit.  But it's arguable Floyd won that first fight, which might go a long way in explaining why Floyd wanted everything on his terms later on.
Well said.  Mayweather always showed up prepared and put in the work.
James Toney did not have the innate talent as Mayweather. Toney had a lot Of Talent but Floyd is generational.
I can see you are hyper critical of Mayweather Jr. That's fine. Just be sure to attach your examination criteria to the modern fighters of today. Canelo, GGG, Tank, ESJ, Loma, Thurman, Crawford, etc. Many of them have cookie cut resumes and aren't even on pace to have Mayweather Jr's success in context of career accomplishments.  A lot folk don't care which way you want to go, just keep the same energy.
you are wrong on all 3, but thats fine thats your opinion, all 3 guys were p4p at one point. genaro was the lineal champ only lost to oscar when moved up to 135 when he was the man at 130 then became the man against and then lost to floyd at 130, castillo was the top dog at 135 when floyd challenged him, jose beat stevie johson to get that title, who was really good, jose went on to have classic with corralles and beat casamayor. corralles was ahead of floyd on the p4p list when he fought him and lost
Yeah - Toney was gifted, but not physically gifted.   He was drilled and incredibly comfortable in the ring. Like, I think he’d be a shit athlete outside of boxing. He was also insane and kind of lazy. Relied on his ability over staying in shape. But the dude had crazy iq and technical know how.   Floyd is like the opposite. Eats like shit and is still in shape. Fantastic coordination and reflexes. He’d be a good athlete in general. He was just a great athlete who also had iq and technique.   Which was my point; Ray Leonard and Floyd were both just really fast which is what makes them stand out over others when they’re dominating. It wasn’t just their iq and fundamentals.
The thread is about Floyd. Have a good one.
I acknowledged at the time, but looking back, with perfect hindsight, Corralles isn't seen as elite level, neither is Hernandez.  They were very good, but there's levels.  Pac was elite, Canelo is elite.  They're the best of the best, they weren't on that level, not then and not now looking back.  Floyd is above elite, he's an ATG.  Levels.
This sub is about boxing. I acknowledged your assessment then reminded you to keep the same energy across the board. Take care.
you dont know what you are talking about if you dont think those guys are elite thats fine
I evidently do know what I'm talking about.  They're not elite.  There's atleast an argument in that, and if you don't agree, then you sir don't know what you're talking about, sir.
Guys were on the p4p lists for years but they weren’t elite, ok
Props to this dude for posting this, I know if I ever watch his fights I can root for the other guy now.
Dick move.  Absolutely no need to share sparring footage
Trashy move. This doesn’t do what some dumbass fighters think it will do. Well, I hope not.
I thought you weren’t supposed to do things like this in sparring
Sometimes people get hurt in sparring, but recording this while also walking away without checking on your partner is an absolute asshole move
What a wanker. Knocks a guy out in training, doesn’t even check on him and walks off like he’s just won a title THEN shares the footage.
Not cool to post sparring footage.  He really set him up good here though. Look at the 1-2 before the knockout, and where the dude put his hands on the second one
Absolutely horrible considering I know where and who he’s sparring. That kid is 16 and had not even had his first amateur fight , disgusting
That sparring partner could just be some random dude they pulled off the street. Is this supposed to be impressive?
Such trash to just walk around like billy badass when you knocked down a sparring partner that was just trying to help you improve
People who share this type of footage are losers. Hope dude gets KOd in four straight
WOW! A sparring partner? This motherfucker is REAL!
Lol great job you knocked out the guy trying to help you.
You can tell by the way the other guy moves he's a mid level amateur at best. Congratulations, Otabek. You made a bunch of boxing fans hate you. I hope Lara steamrolls this piece of shit.
Proper POS, hope he never gets a title shot
Sparring partner or punching bag? He might have 20lbs on the guy.
Doesn't even check on the dude. He was just admiring his work
You gotta at least help your partner get up you dick head.
This is such a shitty trend, sharing this stuff
This is against the code.
"Oh man, I'm gonna look so cool when I post this footage of me hurting the guy who's there to help me improve on the internet."  Social media has just made everyone worse.
This dude is a loser. He will get knocked out and humiliated all because he didn't have the decency to check his ego. What goes around comes around. His prophecy will be self-fulfilling.
Looks like a lightweight sparring a bantamweight.
What does it prove that you knocked out your sparing partner?
That's a shithouse move.
Setup was nice but he could’ve pulled on the punch or let his partner know what to expect.
Hope Lara brutally koed him
Some “boxers” really do want to be despised, don’t they? I never heard of the guy and I already hate his guts. Nice going fella.
I hope Lara fucks this dude up.
Not cool to share this footage
Aside from sharing the footage. What did he do wrong? It doesn't look like he tried going to war. He hit him good and calmly walked away to his corner. He's not supposed to do more.  As far as fighting someone less experienced, thats 100% on the trainers. We don't know what our sparring partners level of experience is at our gym. How it goes is they just tell us to get dressed and wait for our turns on the ring.
Holy shit have y’all ever even sparred before? It looks like he barely threw those punches with power he just must be gifted with it. He threw two shots in this clip and people are saying “that’s not what you are supposed to do in sparring.”   Uhhhh yeah it is, he placed two shots accurately and unfortunately the guy dropped. you guys want pros to go into sparring and throw pillow punches…if all you do in sparring is go light then when it comes time to fight you won’t be able to match the intensity. Now sharing the video is a different story.
He beats Lara's ass fo show
He Hit the off switch
Why is filming even allowed in sparring? If anything to rewatch later gym should be only one recording and not allow these fighters to be uploading this shit. Very unclassy and dickhead move to be doing this fuckery.
I don’t even box and I know sharing this video isn’t cool
Might’ve been a bad idea to post this, but it’s not nearly as bad as the Ammo Williams sparring footage 😬
Eric Clapton here looking for some clout.
I’ve never trained in a boxing gym (only MMA or BJJ gyms) but almost all the sparring footage I’ve seen is really toxic. Definitely wouldn’t wanna put my kids into boxing. Although I admit that boxing produces some of the best footwork in all of martial arts.
I honestly don't get it,  if I knocked my sparring partner out I would be concerned right away.  Why do they walk off like they did something cool or like they don't care?
The other guy was probably dehydrated. Wasn’t even a crazy shot. I’ve gotten dropped in sparring when I wasn’t drinking enough water. It’s super easy
Keep doing that and you're gonna run out of sparring partners
I think this is the BOXR gym in downtown miami, a bunch of wannabes out there and they need help promoting the boxing side of the gym since they share it with actual gym , which is a gold mine and the rent is extremely high that the boxing gym can’t keep up with the payments. The social media boxing warriors show up to look the part but boxing isn’t serious to them
Yep.  Very low class move on his part.
I still can’t believe they put this out there. That kid had no amateur fights at the time, 17 years old and sparred maybe 5-10 times before this session. Just horrible on all parts and especially releasing the footage like he’s taking people out, shame on them
Yeah, what is up with people recording and posting sparring footage these days. Unless it's some staged promotional stuff... But it's still weird to see.
it happens sometimes it’s boxing but this guy walked off like he had won a fight and then released the footage. didn’t seem to care at all either didn’t go over to see if the opponent was ok or anything. maybe he and the sparring partner had issues? either way not a good look. Lara will punish him
Your sparring partner is helping you get better! You’d think you’d care about the health of someone who’s trying to help you.
People on Reddit who haven’t been to boxing gyms assume they know everything about it. Most gyms don’t allow recording but a lot of gyms will record for their top guy and try to hide it. Most sparring isn’t light unless you’re doing exercises. Most “light” sparring sessions turn into beating df out of each other.   My coach would always tell me and my sparring partner take it easy. After the first minute and half we would be trying to take each others heads off.
Yup caught this too. Didnt want to eat another stomach shot.
Wow, i've seen plenty of guys not come back to gyms because of situations like this. What's shameful is guys like this will always be a part of gyms unless trainers and gym owners banned boxers for this behavior.
He knocked out a teenage kid who hasn't even had his first armature fight yet. What an asshole.
I might actually watch the fight to watch him lose
He actually is 17 and this was before his first amateur fight, that is terrible on all ends.
I keep posting this because I hope people will see it. The kid is 17yr old probably 16 at the time of the footage. He sparred maybe 5-10 times total  before this session. Shame on the trainer and shame on the KO
No the sparring partner isn’t Lara. The post just stated that Kholmatov is the #1 in the WBA Featherweight rankings, but hasn’t yet been named the mandatory challenger for the WBA champion which is Lara
The fact that he posted it to public media as though injuring a sparring partner is something he should be bragging about is what’s wrong here
People aren't saying you aren't supposed to drop people in sparring, they are saying you're not supposed to celebrate it like you just won a fight, not check on your partner and then post the footage on the fucking internet.
Yeah, the problem here isn’t the punch. That happens in sparring. The problem is that he’s a complete asshole afterwards.  Turning his back like a champ of the world and sharing the sparring footage is super low integrity.
He was sparring a 17 yr kid with absolutely no amateur fights , it’s also the fault of the kids trainer
Yeah something made me think the guy didn’t have much experience I mean it’s what happens everytime someone posts their sparring KO, nobody does this to someone they respect, you do hate when a guy wants everyone to think “He’s GOING THROUGH & BRUTALISING sparring partners 😨” selling that Mike Tyson aura, but Devin Haney first got famous off of sparring I suppose and beat up on that ‘Canelo’ looking guy who couldn’t box at all. This is the new era of social media boxing.
Thats the fucked up part. The sparring partners are usually kids or lambs being fed to a lion. Wheres the glory in posting you knocking out a minor whos trying give you rounds?
It's advertising.  Not saying it's cool at all but casuals won't know the other guys credentials (or lack thereof).  Boxers now see sparring footage like rappers treat mixtapes.   All I'm saying is, unless you're really cool with your sparring partner, of the coaches say no filming, you'd best expect they hope to get clips off u
>That kid had no amateur fights at the time, 17 years old and sparred maybe 5-10 times before this session.  I call BS. That kid didn't move like someone who had only sparred a few times. He had some experience for sure.   Besides, why the hell would they get him to give work to someone like that, with only minimal sparring experience?
Wtf?? His sparring partner was 17???? Poor kid
Wow I didn't know the backstory.. that's just heinous
Social media content-brain.
Yeah fuck him didn’t realize I had a dog in this Lara fight until now
It is a dick move to post it - but the walk off part is fine, I didn't see it as celebration.   When you stun a guy/flash KO him - he isn't going to be "right" for a couple minutes. His trainer waved it off and went in to get him. You don't won't the opponent trying to help immediately for 2 reasons: 1) You can't help much with boxing gloves on lol. 2) You stunned opponent may respond by thinking the fight is still on, so he resists or tries to punch back. Just not a good time for either guy. The trainer is better. Also if you walk away it is clear that you aren't trying to go in for follow up shots or anything, makes you look more innocent.   Like I said - posting it is not cool at all. But other than that, this is just how it is. Sometimes you take one right on the button.
So you trained in a fucked up gym. If you guys can't train light, good luck dealing with Alzheimer's at 40's
Your coach sounds like an idiot and also a bad coach. I trained where there were a couple of guys, one of which is now a top 5 guy worldwide in his weight class (not saying names cos of doxxing etc), and if someone started doing what you are saying not only would the coach discipline them, but more importantly:  I would love to know where you are sparring where you can go all out in the first minute and not have to worry about the fresh guys coming in at the end of every round. You have to pace yourself and learn to fight, which is the point of sparring. If you blow your nut in 90 seconds any decent coach is going to put someone better and fresher than you as the next guy to swap in for your opponent to show you how stupid you are.
It’s not the hard sparing that’s the issue. You’re right that it’s standard practice (and frankly, it’s a necessary evil) but the problem is posting the footage without both party’s consent.
No they don’t. I boxed for 9 years. Went to golden gloves. They’re tough sessions but you’re not trying to take anyone’s head off. You went to a shit gym.
You’re getting downvoted but that’s boxing gym culture, it’s why I love Muay Thai gyms because if you want to go hard they will oblige, you want to have some fun playing tag they’ll do that too and it stays light. The kicks make it more dangerous so sparring etiquette is higher I suppose.  Also I know you don’t want to feel ‘punked’ but it isn’t a bad idea to say “Hey, let’s lighten up man” if you just ain’t feeling it that day and wanna focus on technique, if he takes your kindness for weakness hit ‘em with that Marge Simpson uppercut though.
Yup. I knew it. He's a deer in headlights. I really wish a lot of gyms would change their sparring culture. This type of sparring serves nobody. The entire point of sparring is to go live but be comfortable enough to work on the things you know need improvement. It's an equal exchange. Both guys are helping the other grow. This does nothing but hurt everyone involved. One dude got knocked out and the other had his ego stroked. That's it.
I don’t want to put the kid out there but he is 17, maybe sparred 5 times total before this and had not even had an amateur fight at the time of this footage. Terrible on all ends and shame on the kids trainer for putting him in there
I know the kid well, he’s not bad but still green as hell. I work with fighters at that gym. He had his first amateur fight 3 months after this, he is 1-1 since with one RSC and a decision loss. His trainer in the video is a former Ukrainian pro fighter that now works with 7-8 fighters in that gym.  I’d have no reason to say this, he should have never been in with the other kid.
This is reality at most boxing gyms now. We don’t have the coaching talent or boxing infrastructure we use to and it will probably get worse. Ive been at smokers where dudes are being slept on the ropes.
So much this.  There’s currently a few national champs for their weight class at my gym and a couple training for the Olympic trials and things are run the same.  Good gyms with good coaches that make good boxers don’t allow that kind of behaviour.
Yeah, that’s what I meant by recording for the top guys. The rule might be there but most people don’t respect it
Damn WTF they really putting 17 year old’s with no amateur fights in with a #1 ranked guy. That’s just shitty work from both trainers
Yikes.  Problem is this just means lots of smart people who could be boxers won’t even try because the training is broken and nobody wants to needlessly get brain damage.  Does a real disservice to the sport and slowly kills it.
Unfortunately very true. It has always been like this for many gyms, but I feel like there were more "real" boxing gyms with actual trainers and fighters. I've been lucky enough to train with a few legitimately good trainers and it is a world of difference. The easiest tell if a trainer is good (imo): pad work and drills are the most important thing. Most sparring should be "touch" - but hard sparring is a MUST, you just need to be smart and limit it as much as possible.   But you cannot go into a fight not having done hard sparring, you need to know what it is like to actually be under fire.  >Ive been at smokers where dudes are being slept on the ropes  Yeah I highly recommend doing amateur fights over smokers. But not everyone has that option. Sucks you're being downvoted, because you're telling the truth. This is not a pretty sport behind the scenes - for every star you have a thousand nobodies with brain damage.
100% I was furious the day it happened
How many smart people were really itching to get brain damage professionally for peanuts in the first place lol boxing has always been a sport driven by poverty and desperation, it's not an easy or safe life.  I agree there are safer training methods out there but at the same time reletively frequent hard sparring is a must at the professional level, some of it is ignorance but it's hard to completely discredit all the gyms that train like savages and produce top tier fighters consistently.  Boxing training can definitely be made safer but how much is the question, because it's never going to be safe.
Yeah people want to hop in here and pretend boxing is a healthy and proper sport where everyone follows the rules.   The reality is this sport is ruthless. Most people don’t die playing a sport but you definitely can in this one. You have to have a screw lose or just be built different to survive in this sport.
It’ll never be totally safe but the type of stuff I’m responding to specifically is unnecessary.  Desperation is a driving factor but not the only one and you just reduce the depth of field by making it unnecessarily dangerous where the benefit/cost gets way out of whack.  I don’t discredit the gyms entirely, obviously some hard mfs can come out of them, but I’ve seen those same tough guys, best in their gym get picked apart by someone who trained smarter and isn’t even top tier at their gym.  Boxing is violent no question, but there’s a balance that works from both sides is what I’m saying and dudes just wailing on each other against the ropes or when they can’t defend themselves or control themselves against a less skilled opponent who’s just learning the ropes crosses the line into having no benefit and plenty of potential cost/downside.
That's a fair point, I definitely agree that while hard sparring amongst professionals is needed there is absolutely no excuse to throw your ameaturs against the pros like cannon fodder, that is just shitty coaching.  I do wonder how much of it is inherent to the sport though, cause muay thai is a fighting culture that's famous for its lighter sparring but I've heard from a few people that they do their muay thai sparring light but their boxing rounds hard.   I often think if boxing as a sport just has to spar harder cause of the fast paced nature and the dynamics of punching. Personally having trained both I always felt that light kickboxing sparring is beneficial but light boxing sparring is a minor help at best and developing bad habits at worst, it feels like you just have to go 50-60%+ to train boxing properly.
Hearn has nothing to stand on when it comes to moaning about PEDs anymore
Eddie is such an air head he has zero self awareness.
 this is factually incorrect. the test was taken on the night of the fight. embarrassing
Hearn talking too much and saying something that will probably get him in trouble. He doesn't want to pick a fight with Sky as they have much deeper pockets than him. Also doesn't change the fairly horrendous allegation that during the first 10 months of 2022, 30% of all fight cards promoted by Hearn involved at least one boxer who had failed a drugs test or been punished for an anti-doping offence. This figure does not include fighters who used micro-dosing or other techniques to avoid detection of PEDs. Very crafty with his words is Edward.
Is he being serious right now, come the fuck on Eddie you can't talk shit about anybody about this. If im not wrong the test Khan failed was taken on the day of the fight, but you knew about Benn's failed tests for months and was still trying to get the fight made.  What a slimy piece of shit.
Eddie's lack of self awareness is reaching Don King levels
😂
Watching Hearn be exposed for the true rodent he is has been pleasuring. He’s just a handsome UK Dana White
How would Hearn know if Boxxer knew about a failed test beforehand?
Why? he canceled the fight. While the other promoter let the fight go on, all the promoters have fighters who have tested positive, they’re all the same
On his worse day, Hearn is 3x better than Uncle Dana. Dana is ridiculous
They had to know the results would go to the promoter. That’s not surprising. Did Hearn expect them to just mail them to him though? I don’t see why they’d loop him in. Khan should have
Hearn still tried to let the fight go on when the news wasn't announced yet. And Hearn himself confirmed on camera that he knew about Benn popping 2 weeks before the news broke out.
it was vada who tested Ben positive, the BBBOFC doesn’t go by VADA they go by UKADA where the drug Benn tested positive for is not on the list. Same as how bob arum did with Oscar Valdez. Point is the fight didn’t happen because Hearn decided not to continue the fight.
Doesn't change the fact that Hearn is being hypocritical here. And Khan v Brook was in the UK too, meaning they would have had to adhere to the BBBoC too! So the same principles apply.
Hearn has a history of trying to hide adverse test results. He did it with Whyte vs Rivas.
so he talks all of this, but insinuates he is doing Garcia a favor with the rehydration clause. Okay, Tank! Nice spin.     “It really doesn’t matter,” Davis told BoxingScene.com following a press conference Thursday at the Omni Atlanta Hotel at CNN Center. “If he come in too heavy, it’s gonna be more my advantage than his cuz he’s gonna be much slower. So, he better top it off at, you know, wherever he feel good at.”   “Barrios (26-0, 17 KOs) estimated that he’ll weigh no more than 152 pounds by the time the bell rings to begin their Showtime Pay-Per-View main event (9 p.m. EDT; $74.99).  “That’s not a ton,” Davis said. “That’s decent. That’s probably around fair because when I fight at 130, I come in at 139, 140.”  https://www.boxingscene.com/gervonta-davis-really-matter-theres-no-weight-limit-barrios-on-fight-night--158661
The rehydration clause in there for Garcia smacks of a lack of confidence from Tank's side. If you fully backed yourself, that wouldn't be needed.
Incomplete fighter yet you still wanted rehydration clauses.
He's pulling a Canelo with that rehydration stuff
I read that as "Gervonta Davis media scum".  Stopped caring about this fraud. Ryan did himself a disservice by accepting the terms of the contract and the only reason why Tank probably took this fight is because he knows that they can get away with charging Instagram casuals whatever they want for this PPV.
Skills aside, I completely understand why Garcia annoys some people, but the more I hear/see Tank the more I find him utterly insufferable and am actively rooting for him to lose.   It may not happen for a while because Tank's match-making is so gutless, but I really hope it's sooner than later.
Tbf, Garcia's right hand is really not great. He gets away with it because he is generally so much taller than his opponents, but he throws really sloppy right straights, he is very often off balance after throwing it and he keeps his head on the center line when he throws with his chin kinda high. He also rarely throws it curved (i.e. overhand) in the first place. Compared to the other shots with his right hand, his right uppercut is OK, but I feel like that is a really hard thing to land on someone like Tank.  This really showed in his fight against Campbell. Even though his right hand is still very fast, he really wasn't able to use it at all. He did most of the damage with his left hand in various forms of hooks and straights.
I can’t remember a fight between two such insufferable pricks in my lifetime. Hoping for a double KO or a draw.
It’s funny seeing the mind games affecting the fans 😂
Tank has been more vocal than normal. Is he shook? First the rehydration clauses and now this much smack talking. Almost like he's trying to convince himself.
What sucks is after Tank knocks him out people are just gonna make excuses and take away from his victory.
Reddit hates black fighters
I haven't watched the video yet, but I will if someone can assure me Tank uses the word 'duplicitous'.
rehydration clause
I can’t wait to read the feelings and tears flow out in this sub after Tank banishes Garcia to the shadow realm 😆
Tank just talking smack. Real thing is he respects Garcia enough that Garcia being 5 inches taller than tank makes him fear the old adage a "a good big man will always beat a good little man" to where tank dropped a divison, demanded a rehydration clause and is even claiming in this video he fights at 130.  That Garcia is tanks best opponent in years for all of Garcia's flaws (and betting odds is 3-1 tanks favor) is louder than anything tank says
If tank Davis was really confident he could beat ryan Garcia, he would let ryan enter the ring with an baseball bat and 3 buddies. Clearly tank is not confident
who cares Garcia is getting knocked out confident or not
There are tons of inclompete fighters that have dangerous power….literally tons….Wilder is a perfect example
Honestly that shit should be illegal, if a fighter is able to make the weight cleanly then why should he be punished
If anyone is a fraud it’s Garcia. He says he begged for the fight for 2 years, and now it’s here and all he does is complain about the deal/contract. Fuck him, he’s losing and he knows it.
Yeah both are a bit unlikable in my opinion. You bet your ass I’m still watching.
I don’t mind Tank. Garcia on the other hand is just a fucking fraud.  Generally speaking I think people just want to see these two fight and be done with it. But I hope Garcia gets slept. I fucking hate that kid for some reason 😂.
Just wait until Tank knocks the meat out his taco you ain’t seen shit yet my boy 😆
Ahh yes the classic put 2 weight clauses and a rematch for a non title fight while claiming to be the face of boxing mind games against fans, move. /s
Yea he didn’t talk shit against Rolly at all 🙄🙄🙄
He is favored at more than 3-1. He’s supposed to win.
His victory over an opponent that people expect him to beat handily.
If that happens it's Tank's own fault.
He deserves to have excuses made against him with all the clauses he put. Once you put them clauses in, you have to be accountable to all the excuses being made against you.
Tank was considered a heavy favorite before the fight was even announced. He is the more complete fighter. Now he attaches a rehydration clause.  You don't get praise for beating a guy you have criticized over and over for being the inferior boxer. You especially don't get praise for beating that same inferior fighter with a rehydration clause.  If he wanted praise and credit for beating Ryan, he should not have criticized the guys boxing ability over the years. It's very simple.
Crazy tank dropped a division…y’all say anything on Reddit…Tank and Ryan are both LIGHTWEIGHTS
It’s his destiny to get stopped, it’s inevitable. But it’s funny that Tank was apparently sparring and hurting heavyweight, but he had to put a rehydration clause on Ryan.
Then don't brag about them being incomplete if you don't wanna fight them at their best, simple as.
We all know who the real fraud is. Gervonta only fights women, Instagram thots like Garcia included.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/v5id5n/is_gervonta_tank_davis_a_legit_3_division_world/
Hard to pick between a scum bag woman beater and an uber arrogant juvenile prick, I get it.
Can’t wait - easy money
2 weight clauses? What are you even talking about
I hope you’re a boxer taking it this serious
Well you kind of have to say something since Rolly is a heel. That was mostly Rolly starting with the midget jokes
The rehydration clause won't be the reason he's gonna get knocked out. Ryan's gonna get knocked out because Tank is a far better boxer. The preemptive excuses are pathetic at this point.
For one how is Ryan not gonna be at his best? Cause he has a 10 pound limit in the morning?? He’s a lightweight that has only faced lightweights…  Also I swear y’all hate “weight bullies” unless they’re facing someone yall don’t like
I Never saw tank hit a woman but I have seen ryan on camera talking like a Jack ass
Catchweight is a weight clause. Rehydration clause is a weight clause. Easy maths.
Or maybe he doesn’t like either of them
You sound like a fanboy. Where did I say that the rehydration clause was the reason he would get knocked out? I literally said it was inevitable that he would get stopped, rehydration clause or not. If Tank can put the paws on heavyweights, why does he fear an “ig model” coming in heavy?
You have a boner for Gervonta Davis, we get it. You're just looking desperate at this point. You don't even try to hide it, LOL!
Allow me to remedy your ignorance:  https://youtu.be/0UtdcdtJU-M
The catchweight is because of Ryan not Tank….
Because the “ig model” is a legit boxer not a journeyman heavyweight sparring partner
No you and numerous people on this Reddit just hate on Tank…it’s nothing new
He didn’t touch her he just grabbed her jacket if you look closely and it’s not his hand by her neck, that’s hers
What does that have to do with the question you asked? I answered your question. Now you want to change goal posts. All you are doing is proving my point that you have a boner for Tank.
LOOL! Well, I need time to kill before I munch before I fast again.... Answer me this, do you think Tank *doesn't* deserve hate? If so, then discuss why. The floor is yours.
Dude first off the guy i actually responded to is clearly saying Tank put 2 weigh clauses on Ryan which simply isn’t true…so like I said 2 weight clauses???   Ryan is responsible for one Tank is responsible for the other   I wasn’t even responding or talking to you…obviously you’re obsessed
As a boxer no…y’all are so weird in here…oh people think this fighter is good but he hasn’t fought who I wanted him to so I’m just gonna hate on him…shit is so fuckin weird to me. People think this fighter can beat a fighter I like so I’m gonna act like this fighter isn’t that good 🙄🙄🙄 worst part is most of y’all literally don’t know shit
You're all up in your feelings just because people give fair criticism about your favourite fighter. Name something I ever said about Tank that was out of pocket. Go ahead.  What do I think of him as a boxer? He's athletically gifted, has explosive punching power, sharp eye for counters and good reactions. But he hasn't fought anybody worthy and he is 28 years old, whereas guys like Teofimo and Haney done much more than him at a younger age. Tell me where I'm telling lies!  As a person, he has been in countless altercations, never seems to learn from his mistakes, tweets and deletes and has a childish attitude at 28. Tell me where I'm telling lies! Why would I support a guy like that?  If that's who you want to have a boner for, that's on you. But don't have a go at other people or call them weird for not sharing the same opinion as you, especially when we have VALID points to critique the guy. If anything, you're the weird one for catching feelings when fair criticism is being made. And if I hear more shameless bumlicking of this guy from you, I will block you.
I’m not in any feelings the shit is WEIRD….same shit people in here used to do to Devin and still halfway do to Shakur they do it to Gary Russell …it’s just hate…downplaying people’s abilities is weird!   Trying to act like normal shit isn’t normal is weird!…Tank not wanting Ryan to gain a ridiculous amount of weight is normal and tons of other fighters put shit like that in place including Canelo, Manny, and tons of other fighters that are loved in here….  Then your threatening me with a block like I care…🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
Nobody wants to see Thurman fight. That Little weasel try to deceive fans as always
Thurman and Benn should fight. Battle of the welter villains.
No one cares, we know this isn’t going to happen. It’s just the annual piss take by both of them.
I hope this is the new era where fighters/promoters are frowned on for avoiding these fights.
Also he confirmed that they are negotiating officialy, and fight date will be at summer. But not June 17.
PBC and Showtime are in threat of not being part of a Network deal, with showtime getting merged with Paramount+. If showtime doesn’t make big fights, and get big ratings soon.   They’re done.
I'm about done with boxing. I used to love this sport more than any sport out there. But the diva fighters, fifty different streaming services, fighters not fighting each other unless it's on Twitter, the death of HBO in boxing, the corrupt promoters, the 20 title belts in each weight class. This sport is dead in the mainstream eyes. It's on life support even for hardcore fans.
I feel like Crawford gonna throw some ridiculous stipulations  out there and the fight will fall through again. Terence for whatever reason (I think ego) seems perfectly content with going on with his career without this fight.
Lolololololololol weasel faced prick!
Either one active right now? I can’t remember seeing them fight for so long.
F that weasel
I haven’t cared about this fight or these fighters for a while honestly.
This would be very bad for the sport of boxing as a whole.
They are putting the best fight so far this year, strange way to look done
If the rumors are true that’s pretty damn depressing.   Boxing is really the only sport I follow and love. I was spoiled in the mid-2000s watching HBO Boxing with 24/7 and Saturday night fights.   Showtime Boxing’s production values and announcers aren’t as polished as HBO but it’s much better than ESPN and DAZN. It’ll be a shame if they leave the business.
we are about to have a good next couple of months so idk what you are talking about. Ryan v tank this month, Haney vs loma, Fulton vs inoue, canelo fighting, just had David vs plant. So sounds to me like you not really paying attention.
Not really, I don’t care about belts or fanfare I just like the technical aspects of it. So none of that affects me at all, though I’ll still push for the best to fight the best
Yeah his ridiculous stipulations like asking for a guarantee and transparency
Always blame Crawford without any information lol
It's not Crawfords fault or spence's fault. It's PBC's fault.
People blame Fury for not agreeing to 50/50 w Usyk but then blame Bud for taking less than 50/50
Crawford is an extremely competitive, dominant personality. If he feels slighted he will happily enter a vendetta and screw his own career over just to take the other guy with him. It is what it is.
They're definitely starting the year strong. But it's clear they got the message to put on competitive shows consistently or else.
Don’t let a singular fight (and I’m assuming you’re referring to Tank and Ryan), cloud their track record that got them into this position.  Boxing isn’t the big attraction it use to be. I’ve seen that Paramount is only keeping the top percentage (can’t remember the number) of showtimes content in terms of ratings. If boxing isn’t in that percentage, PBC and Espinoza might be done after the merger. I think that’s the main driver behind them now putting effort into making some fights happen.  I could just be a cynic, but boxing made me that way.
No I'll buy into Ryan vs Tank. But that's in no way a mega fight. Not even close. I think it's a good fight. But years ago that fight would be an undercard or a main headliner on showtime or HBO at best
Canelo doesn’t deserve to be mentioned here but I’m glad you didn’t mention his opponent
How dare somebody ask for a guarantee! Boxers should be getting paid in peanuts and ice cream!
He got a guarantee and transparency.  He did not get an 8 figure guarantee and line item veto power.  This is why he balked.
He asked for approval over expenses, he got transparency
The fight originally fell through because he wanted Spence to take a deal when he was approached by BLK Prime. We saw what happened with BLK Prime.
It is Crawfords fault, it is Spence’s fault. They don’t want to fight each other. It’d damage the legacy for either to take a loss to the other but without each other they don’t have that ‘legacy’, ‘signature’ fight. Don’t get me wrong both are supreme talents in this current landscape but they’re afraid to take that risk. They could’ve had a trilogy done and dusted by now. I’m not holding my breath for this fight
All parties involved were  to blame based on the two accounts, Crawford and Espinoza. Crawford wanted a gaurantee, wanted Spence present for negotiations, wanted to approve all funds even though it was a big bag of worms when it came down to ticket prices. Espinoza also said Crawford was dragging his feet on getting back to them. I think Bud also had an unwarrented dislike and distrust of Al Haymon and PBC, otherwise he would have signed with them instead of being a free agent and calling himself his own boss, even though he has no promotional company. Spence could have also spoke up about the demands if he thought they were too harsh and might break the deal. I think Spence trusted Al to make a good contract, and had little involvement in it.
i meant fights plural, and they are. Other companies are doing worse, if you are cynic about PBC i wonder what you feel about top rank or GBP, their schedules are consistently worse
It's a "mega fight" because it's so genuinely surprising that it's actually happening lol... oh boxing, where did we go wrong
> Crawford wanted a gaurantee,  Which is completely reasonable.
1st. Im not anti PBC guy. But I do have an opinion and see a track record. You’re perfectly entitled to disagree with my opinion and point of view. As for the subject of the Showtime/ Paramount+ merger (which is what the post is about), that strictly affects PBC. So of course I addressed them.  But I can address Top Rank and Golden Boy if you like. Top Rank isn’t great but they do okay. But they are by no means perfect. Golden Boy is terrible, and almost insignificant, especially since Canelo left. The way Oscar has handled Ryan and Munguia career is horrendous. They both should’ve stepped up to real competition a long time ago. But to say any of the 3 (PBC, Top Rank, and Golden Boy) is worst than the others, would just be subjective and arbitrary.   Does it bother if people say something negative about PBC? I’m curious. Not saying you are, but there’s this weird new thing among boxing fans these days. Where guys are fans of promotional companies and networks. If you say something negative about one side, they say something about another company as retaliation. As if that’s supposed to affect you. Ending up in endless “What about-isms”, deflecting from the subject at hand to ask about a topic that has nothing to do with the conversation. Me, I just care about boxing and want the best match ups.  Just because I criticize PBC doesn’t automatically mean all other companies are better. There are systemic issues in ALL of boxing.
Can't argue that point lol. But it just shows the current state of the game really. Boxing has ALWAYS found the ability to shoot itself in the foot for a ton of reasons. But these past few years it's gotten way worse. It's just so fractured now. Every fighter has Mayweather money syndrome. They spent more time arguing on Twitter and YouTube. Then you gotta have like five dang subscriptions to streaming services to even watch. Then on top of that each fighter from each service will never fight the other usually. It's just a disaster now
Indeed, but it doesn't sound like he argued for it, more like he was so appaulled it wasn't there, that was one of the reason for walking away. However he had stated he agreed to all terms. If this was a deal breaker, why not negotiate for the gaurantee instead of just walking away? Kind of a confusing line of thinking.
I’d say there was anti everything pbc brigade that started back when max kellerman called haymon a boogeyman and has persisted since then. Then it was at its zenith when pbc started in 2015, where paid media was constantly shitting on them and their future despite everything indicating it was fine. Top rank quality of top fights has decreased since manny left and they haven’t really developed any stars and I never see people questioning them. So there’s a lot of irony in your comment. GBP is on a ludicrous month to month deal with dazn but more often than not you’ll see people questioning pbc when they are leading in terms of big time events by a large margin. Since manny left top rank hasn’t been able to put on an event that matches a good level size revenue event in benavidez plant, unless you can the co promoted fury fights. And benavidez vs plant isn’t some monumental event
Yeah, I lol'd at that response to you "idk what you're talking about"   I even have to say goodbye to DAZN now cause it's just too much at this point, pretty hard to say it's going in a good direction
Fair enough. I can accept that.  PBC has put on “big” events. Tank had some fights that sold out at the live gate. But I think the issue as far as the merger is viewership and television ratings. What we (boxing fans) may consider good or bad in terms of PPV numbers and viewership, doesn’t compare to the views of the other content showtime offers. The average showtime subscriber, probably doesn’t even know when boxing comes on let alone watch it. Paramount doesn’t care about live gates, their only concern is will the average American (who or what ever that is) watch. Boxing junkies like us always will watch, but I don’t think we make up big enough number to matter. they need to put on the fights that will attract the casual fans. But also do a better job in putting their big fighters on for free (not behind a pay wall like PPV), and more often so the casual fan can know who they are. The track record I’ve been noticing, is that some of the PBC stars (Spence, and both Charlo’s for example), are fighting once a year or more. I get injuries happen, but it’s hard to build and maintain a buzz around a guy who fights every year and a half. I’m suspecting there might be an issue with fight dates effecting how often guys can fight.
I’ve always held Robinson as the greatest offensive fighter to ever live, and at around 20 seconds he shows why. He fired five punches and two to the head the split second there were open, then when he rocked Turpin with a right hand, he immediately went to frame his head for an uppercut and blasted his kidneys
In their first fight, the extremely awkward Randy Turpin shocked the world by ending Sugar Ray Robinson's legendary 89-win streak. Robinson, who at the time had a record of 129-2-2, got an immediate rematch. The rematch was close, but the main problem was Robinson's worsening cut. Before the start of round 10, the ref told Robinson it would be his last. This was the result.
Crazy how back then if you got up on the 8 count they don’t even ask “are you ok?” Or “hands up.” Nah they just let them right back in the fire.
Is it me or the ring is abnormally big ?
Never heard of Turpin before but dude must have been tough as nails. Man was eating a fist buffet out there
With 2K NBA commentary
In the last exchange, Robinson doubles up on his left hook before the right. I think this messed up Turpin’s punch anticipation and that’s why he turned into the right.
He hits like he had dumbbells in his gloves.
It’s hard to compare fighters of different eras, especially as far back as SRR’s era, but he had elite power in both hands and an iron chin. It’s hard to imagine him not being up there with the best in any era
Goddamn I love classic boxing. Thanks for the post
There are fighters nowadays doing that, I think Sugar Ray is the GOAT too but there are guys nowadays doing thag
He’s overrated, and not that good. I can name 5 C-level fighters, in todays era, that would have laid him out and I can name 5 more that would make him quit. In todays era, he would be a journeyman! You lot just praise any fighter in black and white footage even when they are average.
The ref didn't even look at the him as he grabbed his gloves once he got up. Another comment on this thread said the ref told SRR before the round it would be his last as he was cut bad. Crazy how different things were back then
There’s some brutal Jack Dempsey footage where the ref apparently wasn’t even involved in a knockdown, and Dempsey could just stand in front of whoever he knocked down and wait for them to even try to stand and punches down on him as he gets up. It makes the guy on the ground have to stand up real quick and unexpectedly. Ludicrous to watch.
It’s pretty weird, I’m not sure what it’s purpose is because they’re like half committed to announcing it as if it’s live but they don’t react at all to any of the big shots. Turpin hits the ground and they’re just like 😐
Lol, sure pal. Name the five journeymen you think are better than Sugar Ray Robinson. Better yet, name the five contenders/champions that are better than SRR.   YDKSAB.
He's the type of guy to say all boxers from before 2000 would get demolished now but immediately complain when the fight lasts more than 30 seconds
Check out my comment history for another thread I’m in right now with this very topic
I'm still upset about Stanionis v Ortiz 😭
Dang it. I would rather get a refund but they haven’t said anything.. I like zepeda but this is a stay-busy fight.
Dang I thought this was gonna be in the Tank-Ryan undercard. Is this even gonna sell?
Golden boy is nothing but keeping their fighters busy in meaningless fights.
Damn they couldn’t find Stanionis a replacement? What a bummer.
I just realized did they ever announce an undercard for this fight ?. Feel like there was no announcement about any fights beside the Main.
Bruh turned down shakur for a Chris Colbert KO victim😭
My prediction is   Haney beats Loma.  Loma V Stevenson is made for a vacant belt. WBC probably.  Clusterfuck made for the rest of the belts. Kambosos fights for IBO with Maxi Hughes.  Ortiz vs Zepeda is made for WBO.  Frank Martin vs Edwin De Los Santos for the IBF.  Tank fights Isaac Cruz for vacant WBA.  Winners fight in a super series.
I've been looking forward to that as much as Benavidez v. Plant. It's almost ruined April for me.
Idk once you get used to boxing absolutely sucking, it doesn’t sting so bad. Thinking back on all the hype before the new year about how boxing is about to have a huge year and it’s April and the most exciting thing thus far has been Jarrell Miller vs Lucas Browne headlining in the Middle East.
It feels like Golden Boy is doing nothing with his career.
They probably sold a decent amount already because it’s minutes away from Vergil’s hometown.
I think it’s postponed for the summer.
Goldenboy undercards are usually announced 1 week before
He was suppose to be on the undercard but Goldenboy is a mess right now
It wasn’t him, Oscar turned it down.
I thought Beterbiev v Yarde and Navarette v Wilson were great fights
They better give me my refund
Same thing though. Yeah, Oscar didn't want that to happen, but what's stopping the fighter himself?
They were but it’s not the big names fighting one another like we’d often hope. I’m fine with it as long as we’re not hostages to “wow the next several months are gonna be huge!” and then everything falls through.
I bought them of SeatGeek, the will only refund on future credit smh I’m just gonna trade them for some ed Sheeran tickets for my girl smh
Yeah I’d prefer a refund. AXS policy reads like they won’t do refunds unless the event is cancelled. If anyone has luck, post it.  Edit: spoke too soon maybe. GBP posted about refund info on Instagram right now. Full refund or partial plus keep tickets.
What is he supposed to do? He has a contract with Golden Boy.
Lol, I'd consider Beterbiev and Navarette as big names, if not bigger names than Miller or Browne.
Hell yeah, good shit. Gonna look it up now
Do what Ryan Garcia did. Demand the fight. Same case with Munguia not fighting Charlo.
I was obviously joking about Browne/Miller. Wilson wasn’t a name and Yarde was decent, but these aren’t mega fights.
Zepeda isn’t as popular as Ryan is and until the day Mungia doesn’t leave Zanfer he’s not going to get a big fight.
Shakur is an asshole in the ring and outside the ring. Fan of his boxing but he is a dickhead
Shakur has that Ali level of conifdence
Big baby needs to find sombody real
Yeah lol he is a bully but doesn’t pick his target. Dude started talking shit to Jared Anderson lmao. Gives the same energy to everyone . Dude is a character
Last fight was really showing it
why is he a dickhead? just because he goes on a weekly tirade about how he is literally the best of all currently active boxers?
I mean that and the fact there's video of him clearly assaulting people, but sure
assaulting? you mean outboxing
No I think he means starting fights with people in parking garages and punching on them when they’re already down on the ground
it’s the ref’s job to maintain fighter safety, not shakur’s
I was about his dumbass starting street fights not his in the ring behavior. Which is also not the best with how many low blows he throws
why should shakur feel any responsibility for some guy that he punched? just because he punched him? go cry somewhere else
didn’t he have to pay the guy 💰??? so there’s that and all the legal consequences
and now it’s shakur’s fault that the united states legal system is a corrupt mess? pin 9/11 on him while youre at it
I can’t see them on mobile
Haha I remember one of the first things Kazumichi said when I entered the shop was “why would you want to buy these gloves? They’re so expensive.” Then after that he gushed about hanging out with Holyfield.
Great stuff. Thanks for sharing.
Went to see him a few weeks ago at his office in Redondo, lovely guy and has great stories.
Great guy
Where’s his store at
Lmao I remember reading [this article](https://expertboxing.com/winning-boxing-gloves-review) about him.   The article said Kazumichi was a former boxer who became a boxing photographer and was passionate about it.   Apparently he never wanted the job of being Winning’s US distributor but reluctantly took the role to pay the bills. Seems like a character 🤣
No problem!
Redondo Beach in Southern California
such a gentlemen with how he speaks
15 rounds with nose broken in the 1st and eyes cut on 2nd or 3rd!!! that was a hard man right there, toughness can be a double edge sword though.
Tunney and Greb faced eachother 5 times, with most results being controversial for the time. In their first encounter, the one described by Tunney in the video, Greb pummelled Tunney for all 15 rounds in what was considered one of the worst beating in boxing history. According to Tunney; '"He was never in one spot for more than half a second," said Tunney. "All my punches were aimed and timed properly but they always wound up hitting empty air. He'd jump in and out, slamming me with a left and whirling me around with his right or the other way around. My arms were plastered with leather and although I jabbed, hooked and crossed, it was like fighting an octopus." This was Tunney's only defeat.  Their second fight was considered to be one of the most controversial decisions in boxing at the time, with Tunney taking a UD and multiple newspapers feeling bitter, including Greb himself. Tunney, feeling like the decision was unjust himself, decided to give Greb a third fight. This time, he won a comfortable UD. Their fourth fight, however, was a controversial draw that most at the time believed Greb should've won. Tunney dominated his fifth and final match against Greb. He would later win the Heavyweight Title from Jack Dempsey just one year later.  It's hard to truly judge these fights without footage, but luckily for us the newspapers at the time dropped round-by-round descriptions of the fights. For anyone interested, here's the link:  [https://www.harrygreb.com/harrygrebtunneyphotopage.html](https://www.harrygreb.com/harrygrebtunneyphotopage.html)
Note that Tunney outweighed Greb by around 15 points and Greb still beat the crap out of him
Harry Greb and Sam Langford my Boxing Goats and almost no film on them. When you know you know, shit was harder back then compared to now and both true P4P fighters undersized.
I'm expecting the following:  "Too small to be competitive in 2023"  "He'd get beaten by todays heavyweights easily"  "No footage so we don't know how good he was"  "Nothing like PRIME MIKE HULK TYSON PRE-CUS PRE-PRISON"  People have to accept that for the time, these guys were the toughest motherfuckers on the planet. They weren't like todays boxers.
Tunney was my favourite.  He beat Jack Dempsey twice  He beat Harry Greb twice and also drew against him.  Legend.
This dude was a legendary fighter in his time. He was a real technician. He probably deserved to lose in his rematch with Dempsey, but he’s still one of the best to ever do it.   I know you shouldn’t compare eras but I wonder how he would do today as a light heavyweight. I’m sure he’d fair well
Hugely underrated fighter. Great technique, tough as nails. 65-1, two wins against Dempsey. Greb was his only loss!
so in short, greb couldnt put away a guy who was out on his feet since the 1st round
Their series overall was a lot closer than Tunney made out. At best, Tunney deserved to win 2 of the 5 fights.
They just don’t make them like they use to
Lol Harry Greb is like a Mythical fighter now.
I never heard the mid Atlantic accent outside of a movie. I didn't know people actually talked like that.
They literally cut out the part where he called Greb a dosser
Reminds me a lot of my grandpa. I miss this way of speaking sometimes and get frustrated with myself that I don’t sound as dignified as some people from the past do, even though I’m decently educated.
He aint got nuthin on tank
Back in the day when HW champs didn’t go to the corner and ask “why am I feeling like this” And clinch to look to their corner for help like that British dude Femi. Wasn’t even properly KOed by Ruiz who KOs Nobody and people still using that was an excuse rofl. 40 year old Arreola didn’t blink once from Ruiz and put him down twice. “Best Resume in the HW Division”
Thanks for the fascinating background. However,  >with most results being controversial for the time  2 out of 5 definitely isn't "most".
Yes, and this was after Greb's second fight with Kid Norfolk, which was where he lost sight in one of his eyes. Crazy how a past prime, one eyed Greb regularly beat up light heavyweights like Gibbons, Loughran and Tunney
Fr, plus we have plenty of footage of people who Greb beat and they hold up to modern standards (Loughran, Gibbons brothers, Walker, Tunney, McTigue). Obviously the lack of footage affects his H2H rating, but it certainly doesn’t affect his legacy IMO.
I wish I could see the original Joe Walcott so I could know what about him inspired Jersey Joe so much.
You forgot pre-Rooney
I get that people have trouble accepting the old timers, “lack of modern nutrition” and so on, but you ever watch the Dempsey-Tunney fights? Easily the best footage we have of Tunney. He looks magnificent, like he could walk through a Time machine and fight any light heavyweight on the planet, and a damn decent amount of heavy’s as well. I don’t think nearly as much distance separates the old school as people believe.
A great fighter. And it's so cool that we have footage like this.
I think he is easily at Bivols level.
I feel like Tunney did, for the most part, recognize that Greb beat him atleast twice. Their second fight was an infamous robbery, and we can verify this through MULTIPLE newspaper and individual testimonies (all in the great book by Steve Compton).  If two random newspapers say there was a robbery, then there’s obviously a lot to doubt. But if 18 out of 20 say it, then it was probably a robbery.
My grandma talked like this and she only passed two years ago. She’d say ‘Ooooh’ just like Tunney did there lol talking to my grandma was like taking a glimpse into the past
Most definitely has nothing on Wilder either!
Evybody know he beat dat boy Greb
AJ beats Greb to a pulp lmao
Who would you say has the best HW resume then if not AJ? No one else even has an argument
A lot of people thought the third fight was a draw
It's crazy when you can actually see the levels in the game. Those top 10 guys are all something special but there's always that top 1-2 guys that are on their own level, everyone else fighting for gatekeeper status.
I trust the old timers. Sam Langford the real TBE though cause the HWs were scared of the little bruiser
yea I feel Boxing was at its best back then and we cant see those fights or them in their prime. Maybe one day well get lucky somehow. Now we get Devin Haney and Shakur Stevenson jabbing and baby right hands for 12 rounds... :(
It's interesting how many fighters were inspired by those who went before: "Barbados" Joe Walcott, whose name Arnold Raymond Cream took to become Jersey Joe Walcott, "Nonpareil" Jack Dempsey, whose name William Harrison Dempsey took, "Sailor" Tom Sharkey, who inspired Joseph Paul Zukauskas to become Jack Sharkey, and of course Tyson Fury, named after Mike Tyson.
😂 oh shit yeah. Add that to the growing list of reasons why Tyson is the ATG p4p GOAT. It was because he didn't have the right trainer.
The nutrition thing is almost all bullshit. Tunney would have been eating grass fed meat and organic vegetables by today's standards.   People still hit the speed bag and jump rope like Tunney.  The only real difference is drugs and Tunney could just taken them too like everyone else now.
The thing is with most of the major sports today is that they've only been around for like 200 years at the most, so of course they're still constantly developing and advancing which makes the versions of those sports 50-100 years ago completely incomparable to what we have now   What people forget is that boxing is basically the oldest modern sport and that its existed in some form at least as far back as the ancient Greeks, presumably even further. As a result most aspects of the sport have already been pretty much perfected a long time ago so for the most part I think there's actually no real difference between the boxers of old and the boxers today, aside from the fact that todays heavyweights are generally way bigger than ever before. You can see this by the fact that most training techniques today are the same as they were 100 years ago   You can apply similar logic to athletics as well. You'd think with the constant advancements in sports science and nutrition that we'd be constantly seeing world records get broken but a shit load of the records are still standing from 20+ years ago
That’s pretty damn good
Tunney's recollections of their series were self-serving and rarely honest (like Greb fouled him, he had Greb's number after the first one, that he carried Greb in their last fight etc), especially after Greb's death when he was free to say what he liked without being challenged. At best, he said something like several people disputed the second result, and maybe there was something to their complaints.   He wasn't alone in this. Dempsey later lied that he'd never even sparred with Greb and there was never any interest in them fighting. Mickey Walker invented a bar room brawl with Greb (which of course he won), to make up for being battered in their actual fight.
Gene is more cheeked up than Wilder though
Please, the hood knows Greb won
The 240 pound super heavyweight beats the 165 pound Greb to a pulp? Impossible. Greb in 4
Lil Greb would take his soul too. He’s got no balls , literally and figuratively. Langford would knock his 6-6 robotic ass old cold too. AJ wouldn’t have access to TRT back then and be skinny Femi without balls again , so he’d never even get in the ring. Im actually serious both Greb and Langford had iron chins and smaller guys aka hard to hit, stock bulls and AJ cant deal with smaller faster fighters lol. Theyd both beat him in a 15 round fight easy..AJ cant even go 12 with any pressure on him. Franklin is a C level guy, whos tough,and has 0 power and had AJ shaky the whole time.
Nope
None of them but Usyk has all around best resume for prime wins from cruiserweight
fury’s win against a reigning klitschko in germany and his win over an undefeated deontay wilder via KO are the best wins that any current heavyweight posses. up next comes Andy Ruiz’s win over an undefeated, unified champion in Anthony Joshua
What makes it even crazier is that those aren’t even random top 10 guys, they’re ATGs. Tunney has a good argument for top 3 at LHW, and I personally have Gibbons and Loughran in my top 10 in the division. Greb was just that good, which makes the lack of footage suck even more
Bob Fitszimmons was a bad mother too
Don't forget all the partying, hookers and cocaine he did which kept him from being the GOAT! /S
I think its adorable and funny that you people are really inventing stuff that isn't even said at all in this subreddit, let alone any decent boxing forums especially when it comes to Tyson.
I agree. Even with the shitty frame rate, it’s easy to see that his technique is every bit as refined as something you’d see today. One of his training techniques was to run backwards for 4-8 miles while throwing jabs and that was his roadwork. That’s absolutely insane!
‘B-but muh nutrition tho!’ Like bro they’re literally gassed by round 6 😭
Sport "science" is mostly a total fraud and bullshit.  The only advances we have made in nutrition is that we have largely staved off malnutrition in the West. The advances are the larger talent pool of athletes to select from with the lack of malnutrition and just a larger population in general.  When Tunney was born the US population was only 76 million people.  The only thing that Tunney didn't have is performance enhancing drugs.
Couldn’t agree more and I often espouse this same sentiment. Boxing is one of the oldest codified fighting systems on the planet.
Yeah, it’s fucking elite. I think Tunney would absolutely hang with todays light heavy’s, his style was smooth as silk.
I knew that Walker lied about his story, but I never knew that Dempsey lied! That spar must’ve really embarrassed him, I was unaware of Tunney’s insecurities as well. But is it really that unlikely for Greb to have fouled Tunney during their series! After all, Greb apparently developed more of a mauling style after losing sight in one of his eyes.
Gene Wilder got them chocolate brownies though.
Greb beats any HW on his best day
> Greb was just that good, which makes the lack of footage suck even more  Tyson liked to talk about Cus' reel to reel collection... The hard to find things, paid for by cus, usually filmed by amateurs with video cameras.  There's a wealth of boxing videos out there that will *never* see the light of day. It seems the old timers like to collect tape and hoard it away...  Could you imagine a digitized unveiling of Cus' private fight reels? Things nobody but he and tyson, maybe a few others ever saw.. I daydream about that collection tyson offhandedly mentions in interviews. Cus' damn vault.
Yea I just dont put him in the class of them 2. Greb was first and only to beat Tunney, then apparently got robbed in the 2nd fight, then a draw lol, then a fight where he lost by decision but won the last round vs Tunney. I could just tell by his goofy training and shadow boxing that he was a true dog in the ring and I favor the guys who bring the fight cause it takes more balls/risk and somebody has to make a fight happen. Tunney was a counter puncher master too and Greb still beat him multiple times.
I mean...just cos you haven't seen it in this thread, doesn't mean it doesn't happen. I've had to explain multiple times why Mike Tyson isn't in the top 10 HW ATG list from an objective perspective. But you continue thinking there aren't some people here who say Tyson is one of the best HW's of all time.  Just went through your post history. You're one of them 😭
Have you really never seen ONE person on this entire sub mention a prime Tyson? Lmao what sub have you been using, prime Tyson is a meme in the entire boxing community
I do actually agree to a large extent, I mean I wouldn't go as far as to call it bullshit but I think whatever success athletes have is more down to genetics and training than anything. Like as an example there's the footballer Jamie Vardy who did an interview a few years ago where he said his matchday routine and the guy basically just drinks a load of Red Bull and eats Skittles, and he's one of the best examples of a footballer performing well in the Premier League deep into their 30s (albeit not this season)
How do you think Dempsey would do?
Username checks out.
Funny you mention Cus, his good friend Jim Jacobs always claimed to have footage of Greb vs. Tunney 1
I read somewhere that Jim Jacobs and Bill Cayton possessed 98% of all fight films ever made. Cayton ended up selling the collection to ESPN or HBO (can't remember which) for 100 million USD in the late 1990s
So I almost said this in another thread on this same post and decided not to just because I don’t want to fanboy. But since you asked…  To me, Dempsey is the ultimate old school throwback. Whereas Tunney made his bones boxing in the marines against other other service members in exhibitions, sparring, and organized contests before turning professional, Dempsey got his start in the saloons and mining camps of the old west. He left home at 15 and would ride the rails of freight trains from town to town by holding onto the undercarriage for hours at a time, as the tracks raced by just a few feet beneath him and letting go would send him to certain death. When he arrived in town, he’d take whatever odd job he could shoveling stalls, sweeping floors, carpentry, farm labor; anything he could find. At night he would challenge a room full of roughnecks to a fight and, win or lose, would take his licks and do it again the next day. He strengthened his jaw by chewing pine tar and rinsed his face with beef brine to toughen up the skin and prevent cuts. He once famously said, “When I was a young fellow, I was knocked down plenty of times. I wanted to stay down, but I couldn’t. I had to collect two dollars for winning or go hungry. I was one of those hungry fighters. You could hit me with a sledgehammer for five dollars. When you haven’t eaten for two days…you’ll understand!”  It was estimated he had some 300 or more of these contests before he ever turned professional. He learned his craft on the job against hard men in unforgiving circumstances that would punish weakness. By the time he fought Jess Willard at 24 years old, he had more than 70 professional fights. He once knocked out the 6’6” 250 lbs contender Fred Fulton in 14 seconds; an ill omen for Willard. After he retired, he would have another 250 exhibitions, similar to his barnstorming days of his youth as he traveled the country fighting local toughs to recoup all the money he had lost in the stock market crash.   It’s worth noting that by the time he fought Tunney the first time, he had not fought in almost three years, as being champion and drinking and partying had made him soft. After the second fight a year later, when he almost knocked out Tunney and probably should’ve been awarded the victory to prompt a trilogy, he retired at 32. It’s my contention that Jack Dempsey at his peak, the active champion of 1919-1921, would absolutely be capable of fighting and winning a championship in any era. More specifically, if he were fighting today, I think he beats the breaks off Joshua or Wilder, who would have no tools to counter his rough and tumble style and would get chewed up on the inside by savage bodyshots and hooks upstairs. I think Usyk with his footwork and speed would be a real challenge and Fury by virtue of his sheer size and toughness could at least take him to a decision, but it is a modern recent bias to assume that Dempsey would somehow be undersized. At 6’1” and a rock solid 190 pounds, he had more than enough speed, power, and absolute granite will to be competitive with anyone to ever lace them up.
And it's locked away somewhere private lol. what a shame. I wonder how many of those old tapes have been untouched for so long they've turned to dust and nobody noticed.
Great comment. You should make a separate post.
I tend to agree with your assessment. Particularly against the unskilled modern giants like Wilder and Joshua. I don’t think they even know how to handle his onslaught in the first round.   My only concern with Dempsey is his defense, which was not exactly refined. He did a good bit of bobbing and crouching, but I have my misgivings. Particularly since he crouched forward with his head held up—I feel like an accurate jab to the chin could keep him at bay.
I just never understood how someone can be so selfish with such significant pieces of history.
Maybe I will!
And if you watch the Dempsey-Tunney fights, that’s exactly what happened. Dempsey had a less frenetic version of Joe Frazier’s bob and weave. He made up for that by keeping his chin tucked in at all times, his hands up, and good if not great head movement. However, a disciplined outfighter with good legs and a snappy jab could keep him at a distance to win on points - especially past thirty with a lot more partying and boozing under his belt, and his legs getting stiff. Tunney wrote in a couple different conversations on the fight that Dempsey was in fact remarkably skilled, nowhere the crude brawler everyone accused him off, and was enormously difficult to hit cleanly and hurt. Tunney maintained that he was unsure if any fighter, including himself, could have handled the iron chinned swarmer with dynamite in his fists that was prime Dempsey.
While we look at it as an artefact, a guy like cus probably thinks of it as information. You don't get to be a great trainer by sharing the things you know with anyone who asks nicely for it.
I imagine these old fights treated like the archive in the Vatican, which carries every book and manuscript they've ever collected for hundreds of years -- Except with boxing
I wish this subreddit had more appreciation for the old fighters. They see one or two grainy black and white fights and they think everyone was crude and unathletic. Those old timers were different breeds of people than modern fighters. Hell, even some of the guys considered bums back then could probably do damage today. For example, I bet Tony Galento would wreck a lot of modern fighters
Check out my post history, as I’ve made a post on Tony before. He was a real character.  I think people on this sub who haven’t boxed themselves - I myself have been boxing twenty years - fail to appreciate just how much skill matters in this sport. I don’t care how big, strong, and tough you are; you can’t teach experience, and fighters from the past just had way more fights under their belt, both on and off the books. Even guys like Joe Frazier in the 1960s and 70s with his relatively modest 37 fight record was notorious for having gym wars in sparring that would make Mayweathers doghouse look a bunch of yapping chihuahua’s.    More fights means more skills, and more skills means better fighters. I think a lot of the old heads were just mentally tougher than anything most modern fighters can really imagine, coming from states of such extreme poverty and want that you can’t really replicate with the protected champions of today. Don’t get me wrong, there’s always throwbacks that emerge like Golovkin, Alvarez, Pacquiao, etc., but the proportion of true beasts combined with fewer options to make a living in sports meant that the toughest, most athletically gifted men of yesteryear were boxers.
I think difference in dynamics makes them hard to compare.   In Bivol vs Canelo first 4-5 rounds were competitive and it wasn’t clear how the fight was going to go. However, second part of the fight was total wash for Bivol.   In Canelo vs GGG III, first 7-8 rounds were kinda one sided for Canelo. It seemed like it was going to be a total wash or even a KO for Canelo and then Canelo gassed and GGG sorta woke up and won last 4 rounds. So it became competitive out of nowhere .
Canelo GGG 3 was a 10-2 for Canelo, but GGG saved everything for the last couple rounds, Bivol was less competitive
Looking at it from another perspective, hard to compare. I view Bivol as technically superior at that weight to Canelo, compared to an older version of GGG that tried to compete but is a shadow of himself from years prior.
Pretty much in line with everyone else. Bivol, at times, put Canelo to school in their fight. Outside of hitting his arms, I don't recall Canelo being able to do much (especially in the later rounds).  In GGG 3, Canelo was winning handily, and then GGG took over. Canelo still won the fight pretty clearly, but he faded and GGG came out of nowhere looking like he was a couple years younger.   There was no trade off like that against Bivol. I gave Canelo 3 rounds against Bivol, 7/8 against GGG.
Bivol went 10-2 vs canelo. The only 2 rounds canelo won were swing rounds.
Bivol vs Canelo
The Bivol fight. Shouldn’t have been as close as it was on the cards either.
The Bivol fight. People aren’t going to like this but Canelo was still fading and have stamina issues in both fights and I thought GGG won 4/5 rounds while Canelo still had the outcome in hand legitimately, the fight was closer than people realize.   Bivol fight I had DB winning at least 10 rounds. Those shots he was landing was very heavy and affecting Canelo throughout the fight.
At least in the Bivol Canelo fight both guys looked like they wanted to win throughout the fight.    The third GGG fight mostly looke like both guys didn't want to lose, except for a few rounds at the end where GGG put on the gas to try to win.
Canelo vs bivol was slightly more competitive, never thought I’d see the day were GGG would just not throw for 6 rounds bc he didn’t wanna get hit and knew he couldn’t get out the way if he threw combinations. Canelo vs GGG 3 was boring. Canelo vs bivol was a fun watch even tho one guy got cooked somewhat
Canela was in complete control vs. Golovski and coasted giving away rounds at the end. The fight was already won. Golovkin looked so slow.   Bivol-Canela was more competitive.
Bivol at 168 for all the belts
GGG won the third. I understand why casual fans can't see it though.
Canelo has judges on his side so anything’s possible
Idk but GGG v Canelo 3 looked like they agreed to light sparring.
Round 12 was a trash clinch fest but rounds 9, 10, and 11 were reminiscent of the first 2 fights.
These fights are hard to compare.  They're apples and oranges.  Canelo vs. GGG 3 felt like two guys showing up and going through the motions for a paycheck.  Did not have the intensity of the first two matchups.  I did not need to see that fight.     In Bivol vs Canelo, I recall the opening rounds being competitive, but Bivol was clearly winning.  The uncertainty came from the expectation that Canelo would eventually land a power bomb and rally, as he's done in several other fights.  That hope faded in the middle rounds as Bivol's control became utterly dominant.
They are older
Bivol vs Canelo
Canelo nearly knocked GGGs head off at the end of round 3.
That whole Canelo vs GGG III fight was ultra underwhelming at least to me. It seemed like both guys had already accepted that Canelo was going to win and seemed like neither of the guys really wanted to fight that night at all.
I remember hearing G fired Abel (aside from the money) bc G wanted to fight more “amateur style” and Abel was always against it. To me it almost seems like he thought he could really fight that type of fight but realized in the fight he couldn’t at that age.
Gabe Rosado if he was younger. He’s already well known, a warrior, good boxer, and willing to fight anyone. Chisora is not a bad choice but he’s more than shot now. I believe a journey man can at least get a title shot under the terms you mentioned. I’d go with one that’s all ready known and has a look to them that will get attention in some way and gave fits that bill.
Pretty far. Look no further than Glen Johnson. He won the world title with a record of 39 wins, 9 losses, and 2 draws. In the two fights after he won the title, he knocked Roy Jones out giving him his second real loss (I don't count the late hit to Montell Griffin) and beat Antonio Tarver (lineal champ and the guy who gave Roy Jones his first loss).   He didn't need any big promoters backing him or any special trainers.
Buck Smith. The effort that man put into the sport driving around in his Honda Civic, fighting 4 times a month, he deserved more than what he got. If he was given the proper funding, training camps, and promotion, the man could’ve been a champion, and he almost was without all that.
I'd watch the shit out of that tournament.
For any journeyman of all time then Emanuel Augustus, I believe he got the skills to become a world champion because Floyd Mayweather Jr said he gave him his hardest fight(This was after Floyd won his first world title and defended it multiple times) + I think his style is very marketable, some people will love it and some will hate it.
Edgar Berlanga
https://boxing-social.com/features/the-changing-definition-of-a-journeyman/  A really good short read about how the word journeyman has changed meaning in boxing over the years, and it makes the question fairly difficult to answer.
Most of these fighters in the comments are not journeymen.
Derek Chisora. Not in the way you describe but there no doubt that he’s a lucrative journeyman.
McCall with a Don King title fight and special referee knocked out Lewis for the WBC belt.
I mean John Ruiz got himself a heavyweight belt, so its entirely possible to get to the highest level with the right backing
Johnny Nelson was basically a journeyman early in his career, but went on to become a champ. I cannot think of a more extreme example, the closest is probably Orlando Salido.
Wouldn’t do a pure tournament, because you’d also want to pick someone with charisma.  Could def get a decent fighter with Bezos style backing a real title.
Of course you can. There’s a current star that was groomed to become a superstar boxer since he was young
I'd personally invite all the great senior high school athletes that couldn't go div-1 because of  terrible grades to work out then try and develop the hardest natural puncher I found.
Definitely depends on your definition of journey man. For me that's more losses than wins and accepted as a bit of a workout but not going to threaten top prospects.  Guys like Chisora and Rosado are more gate keepers to the elite than journey men. They may not be top 10 or truly elite but they are world class and have had their moments over the years.   There probably have been some journey men who could have made it to the top 50 if they had backing, more time to train etc but it's easier for promoters to just pick off the obvious cherries (Olympians, golden gloves, world ranked amateurs etc) than go searching in the mud. If promoters actually invested time into finding them and money into building them then they could probably go quite far as they would be top talent. You can't turn sh1t into gold but you can gold covered into sh1t into gold.  If on the other hand you just mean a mediocre fighter being steered and built up before being slaughtered then sure but they don't tend to be utterly non credible - more like guys such as rocky fielding and his canelo shot - not a journey man but built up to try and convince people he had a shot at the big time (which of course he didn't but the public won't know either way).
I would go back in time and throw the farm at Everett 'Bigfoot' Martin after he become the first to get to the final bell with Foreman during George's comeback. Martin was way better than the record he ended up with, and I think that, with the right management, he could have been at least a fringe contender rather than the gatekeeper-turned-journeyman he became.
There’s already been tons of champs that are or were considered “journeyman” status.   They did it without needing the best gym or promotional backing either so I don’t know what you’re asking exactly.
You just described canelo
Name me Wilder's best win?  There's your answer.
A fighter with a good shtick could make it far with proper promotion and opponent selection.
Ross Purrity 24-13-1 beat Wladimir Klitschko 24-0.  25-0 Lennox lost to 24-5 McCall.  23 year old 37-0 Tyson lost to Douglas, 28-4-1.  Foreman lost to Jimmy Young 20-5.   More recently Jonnie Rice has just beat 2 undefeated prospects, after his career was off to a bad start.  You could say that these guys, except for Purrity, were more gatekeepers/contenders/fringe contenders that became journeymen by staying in the sport too long.  The best bet for what you are talking about, would be to have the fighter take an easy route to pad their records, then try to fight guys on their way out or coming off of injury. Stay ready and be  a replacement looking for an upset.
Emmanuel Augustus..? Are retired boxers allowed?
Darnell Boone comes to mind. Losing record but knocked out Adonis Stevenson and knocked down Andre Ward
A title fight or worst case an eliminator for a title fight seems achievable. I mean more often than not anyway. Some very sketchy/lower skilled guys get into the rankings & then staying active vs low level guys can move you up over time, eventually becoming mandatory.     As for choosing the guy I think I'd go more selective with it. Do some research on boxrec on who are some of the best journeymen who've been moved poorly, but done well vs high level opponents. Watch some film & see who's got real talent & untapped potential. Ideally a guy not too old cuz it could take a few yrs to move him up the rankings while moving him carefully.
Second for Gabe. Makes good gutsy fights. Knows how to properly go up and down the scale for fights. Also really nice down to Earth working man (met him once.)
Lol! I forgot that guy existed; they’ve been hiding him from Benavidez at all costs
I think a lot of people are picking gate keepers, I agree a journeyman to me is typically someone with a losing record who goes into fights and sometimes seem to be holding back a little.
Jimmy Young honestly might be the most underrated heavyweight of all time. His run from 74-77 would be probably the best of any heavyweight in history if all of thr controversial decisions went his way
Nice try Gabe
Sunny is BAMs biggest threat
The winner of this fight will eventually be undisputed at Flyweight. I favour Bam on points, may look reminiscent of his fight with Gonzalez. Sunny is no slouch, don't let the low KO ratio fool you!
Bam vs Estrada will happen first. Sunny should try to get Martinez or one of the flyweight champs. He was calling out his brother too so ig that’s an option lol
Shame he can't win some British pride back from Mexico beating Martinez first, the big scaredy-cat.   Reckon there'll be a value bet on Sunny for this, don't think it's far off a 50/50 and it won't be priced as one..
Sunny is up next
Well a beating is on its way. Rodriguez going to beat the fuck out of this guy
Let's get him against Prince Patel
Sunny has done nothing but try to get Martinez or another Fly champ. He's just about the most avoided fighter in the game
There doing it on purpose to build a big mexican showdown with Bam and Martinez. They know Sunny would beat Martinez.
Sunny is incredibly skilled, definitely Bams hardest fight in the division and pretty 50/50 imo.
Gets stopped. Another British can
Keyshawn is fighting Yigit?!?!  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I’m extremely excited for all of the good fights these guys will continue to bring to the sport. TopRank made a good decision giving them a well deserved platform to showcase their exceptional boxing skills.  Can’t wait for Saturday!
Can’t wait for yigit to make another Reddit post after he is kod
Let’s see if Keyshawn stops Yigit faster than Rolly,  but I doubt he’ll damage him as much as Rolly did. Also, I love how Top Rank promotes these guys!
Can you Digit?
Watch their exchange at the press conference lol
Yigit is our boy, I’m hoping he puts keyshawns dick in the dirt! 🙏
…Yigit?
mj is a fucking dawg!!!   doesn't get enough credit because of inoue's exploits
A damn shame that MJ and Fulton couldn't fight for undisputed. I just hope the winner of Fulton v Inoue will go straight into an undisputed fight!
Winner of Inoue-Fulton will have their hands full once again
MJ Kaka, Israel Madrimov, Shojahon Ergashev, Bek Bully, Jalolov etc #Uzbek #MJKaka
That ref looking for a dance partner.
MJ is like Inoue, but bigger. I don't know how Inoue's going to deal with a bigger version of himself.
The mf that runs fight hype gotta be the biggest clickbaiter out there lmfao
I hope he’s not taking this fight too lightly, that Japanese dude can bang.
I can't wait! I will be there on Saturday night! 🇵🇷 🇯🇵
I’m not too familiar with Yoshino, is he any good/stand a reasonable chance against Shakur? Or is he just someone to beat whilst waiting for the winner of Haney-Loma?
Yes it's a big coat, it's Gortex
Shakur trying hard to be the heel.
during a faceoff has a boxer ever told the other guy "You have nice eyes" ?
Shakur always trying to be a gangster. Lucky he’s alive after last situation. Be a good boy, you ain’t scaring anyone without a weapon anyway lil guy. Couldn’t even handle that girl on the street.
This is a good fight on paper but Shakur is too skilled for Yoshino. He’ll go the distance though. He’s a tough guy
I love that Shakur stays busy. He’s building up a nice resume.
Lol, all the Shakur haters came crawling out of their hole.
Shakur late stoppage, wide points win at the least.
anything for those views can't blame him though its his job.
So could Valdez. I know that Yoshino is a LW but dude also utilizes the high guard heavily and Shakur was picking that apart all night against Valdez and with how Yoshino struggled against Nakatani’s jab, I can’t see it going any better.   Shakur would have to take this fight very very lightly for me to see him losing.
Nah Yoshino is too one dimensional, this has Shakur late stoppage written all over it
Same!!! Leggoooooo
Same! A lot of talent even if the matchups aren’t very even
Have fun doggie
Hes good but a step below the top tier fighters.
Yoshino can crack but he is noticeably flawed defensively from fights I’ve watched. Shakur is gonna dominate this fight
You know about Gortex?
Shakur is a good kid and I mean that as a compliment I think it’s just hard for black fighters to be the all-American because a lot of people are rooting against you no matter what. Especially because he is a slick defensive fighter and doesn’t sell out for the KO
Lol he only landed a couple jabs on the girl. They beat up the boyfriend badly it was disturbing to watch. Like you have to be a real cold hearted pos to do that to someone.  But I will say it was kinda crazy how Shakur got like 20 free punches on the guy from behind and the guy was still conscious. I would’ve thought a pro boxer would have more power than that.  Source: https://youtu.be/Sfr87a8_NLs
Must hurt knowing Shakur gon win all his upcoming fights and there really ain’t nobody out there good enough that is gonna humble him
Yoshino hasn't fought a Southpaw as a pro so there's also that going against him.
you mean shakur by decision
Disgusting shit
Shakur too weak bruda
To be fair, his own pillow fists already do a good enough job of humbling him.
Damn, going from not facing a southpaw to facing Shakur. Definitely gonna be a rough night.
Doesn’t really humble him when he is 12-0ing his opponent .  He still thinks he is the best boxer in the world and honestly you can’t really say he is wrong . Who gon prove him wrong in the ring?
Don’t bother arguing with these bozos bro they don’t know boxing
mendoza gets stopped in rd 7
Fundora close on points, I don't think he'll stop Mendoza.
Mendoza!
I'm guessing he'll get Wallin or Whyte next. I'd like to see him against Wilder or Joyce this year though.
Eddie better not do a Eddie and turn 12 weeks into 7 months.
Needs more fights with Derrick James, seems like they’re pretty much going over the basics right now.
He said the same things when he lost to Usyk the second time, talking about a November, December return, I hope this time is true, we want to see him in big fights.
Activity will be good to rebuild his confidence.
honestly the best thing aj can do at this point is fight 3/4 times this year. 2/3 soft touches (kabayel, demirezen, whyte, takam) to rebuild and get in sync w/ derrick james and 1 tough fight (fury, wilder, joyce)
Probably the best course of action for AJ. Also wanna take a UK trip in the summer so I'm all for it
If this guy fights Wilder he is going to sleep for a long time. His head and confidence is shot. He is one of the richest boxers of all time. He should hang it up after his next big fight.
That’s the spirit I reckon. He needs it.
Good. He needs the rounds.
Logan Paul has yet to announce his next “big” boxing opponent   “AJ vs. Logan Paul, December 2023”
Should try the jarrell Miller fight again. Have it at Barclays. Get an impressive win on US soil and raise his profile
If AJ gets in the way of spence vs crawford i'm gonna be pissed.
Want to see him vs Wilder
Some of the comments here prove people hate AJ, you’d think he got bullied last fight
Lol no chance that happens
If they match him with someone he stops in 2, watch online narratives completely change about him 😂  Wilder went from the biggest joke to comeback hero, third best HW after fighting his heart out in third fury fight and KOing Helenius
Who do you think he'll fight next? I'm thinking someone like Jerry Forrest, not elite but good enough to try some new things and regain some confidence.
I assume either whyte or fury
Cant wait to see the chicken dance again
🥱🥱
Why is he so sure the people that watched his last fight will have woken up by then?
I have a lot of faith that Hearn can deliver good opponents and am excited to see what AJ has left. Wallin would be a decent opponent and Hearn owes him anyway after fucking his mandatory spot.
This man is one of the most inactive fighters, I'm not buying it sorry
I’ll be ready in 12 weeks
Wilder would be amazing, everything else meh.
Go away bro.
Inb4 fast car offered up 3 potential match ups (1 of them absolute dogshit) guess which one he'll pick
Sounds good.  Right attitude.  If you are going to lower your competition level so you feel more confident in trying new things out, then you should also raise the frequency of fights.  I really hope they are addressing his mental hangups though as I feel those are the real obstacles to overcome if a title capture is the ultimate goal.
Demsey McKean enters the chat.  There's no point in pushing for a Wilder or Joyce (after Zhang) fight, their next fights should be titles. He needs a keep busy fight.  I don't think Franklin was rated in the top 15 of any of the belts, so hopefully rather than a retread with Whyte we see AJ put his balls on the line against the likes of some of the big older European unpronounceables  that tend to get avoided like:  Kabayel  Kossobutskiy Gassiev Makhmudov Hrgovic  For giggles and shit, we could have a line up with former Gold medal Olympians and put him in against Tony Yoka...
Seems like the sensible thing, a couple more non-elite fights to build "Shades of Spence" AJ.
Wallin would be decent, fighting Whyte again now would be kind of pathetic
No way he fights Joyce, too much right for a fight with little upside for him, I.e. not a PPV fight imo and he won't get much credit fir a win even though Joyce is a very good fighter
Doubt he wants a southpaw, so it will probably be Whyte.
The fast car man
DAZN gonna apply pressure for a blockbuster I can feel it now
Exactly, he needs a few confidence builders before he goes in with other top contenders
leaked footage from joshua's training camp  https://youtu.be/CcyYskxlFEY?t=337
I think the former heavyweight champ probably knows the basics somehow
If AJ just started boxing regularly I think most people would put him above fury in terms of respect for the game. Imagine taking 2 losses and coming back swinging.
And he was going to before Fury made the deadlines.
I don't know who is gonna pay for a other Franklin
Confidence won’t do much for him at this stage. If he needs to go through a line up of Uber drivers and roofers after every loss before he even thinks about getting in the ring with someone actually dangerous, he simply isn’t prime material or anything close to it at this stage.
He already faced Takam. How about Bakole?
Whyte and Takam are soft touches? AJ was in a 12 round competitive bout with a US domestic level fighter last week.
I think so too but I think he's gotten in too deep with DAZN and signed a mega deal with them to be their star on the platform.   It's not just AJ, he needs a good relationship with them as he's advises and manages other boxers through his company.   If AJ walks away it might hurt his fighters' chances if ending up on DAZN.
I wouldn't be 100% certain that AJ actually wins that fight now after seeing Miller's last fight. Granted Browne obviously isn't an elite level heavyweight or anything but he clearly has a lot of power and he couldn't put a dent in Miller - that extra weight Miller has seems to make him insanely sturdy in that regard  My instinct would be that AJ outgoings him in similar fashion to Ruiz 2 or the Franklin fight but my feeling is that it either wouldn't be seen as an impressive win (winning rounds without hurting the opponent isn't largely seen as impressive for AJ rightly or wrongly) or Miller actually walks AJ down and hurts him badly
If he fights every 12 weeks i'm fine with it, if it's franklin, forrest, whyte and that's it this year then no.
why fight fury when he can just run across a busy motorway?
Least delusional AJ fan
In the last 5 years; Usyk 6 fights, Wilder 7 fights, AJ 8 fights, Fury 9 fights
He was 2 fights a year, more in some years, until Covid. It's only been recently that he hasn't been as inactive, you make it sound like it's all he has ever done.  It's not like the heavyweight division is massively active in general at the moment. For the previous two years he is about as active as the whole top 10, and only a couple have a few extra fight immediately before this that put them as slightly more active over 3 years instead.
I would like to see Kossobutskiy at this level tbh, even If I dont think he stands a Chance at winning against AJ, hes still a pretty decent HW in my eyes and deserves some recognition and paydays
A Wallin fight would be incredibly boring. It's new but definitely not more interesting than a Whyte fight.
Whyte>Wallin
It depends on what you want. If you want another 12 rounds of boxing with some possibility for knockout sure get Wallin in there. If you want a knockout fight, Whyte.   If it's about building AJs confidence again then it's going to be Whyte.   They also might not wanna fight another southpaw again.
Not a PPV fight? Any bonafide top-5 HW showdown is prime PPV material. But yes, the risk/reward here is too steep for AJ vs JJ.
Joyce vs Joshua is absolutely a PPV in the UK.
Yeah it’ll be a Franklin situation, beating a fighter with a good chin comfortably by decision doesn’t fly over here
That’s not the point OC is making at all. A new trainer requires going over the basics because every trainer has a different opinion on the foundations they want to lay. AJ and his trainer will be going through the basics of what his trainer wants long-term from his style and methods.
The basics of the new coach’s system. Just like if an NFL team gets a new coach / coordinator.
Omg are you kidding
Are you serious? He deserves zero respect for “coming back swinging” against random roofers and Uber drivers😂 AJ fanboys are mad for coddling him and making excuses… the fact is if he needs 2 or more tune up fights against bums before he even thinks about taking on a top 5, he’s not the level of fighter some people still think he is.
So Fury is the reason AJ is inactive?
DAZN subscribers.
Totally agree. Instead of confidence how about adding something new in the bag of tricks?  I just view AJ as being too bulked up with too much muscle mass along with having too much money. He could probably use to shed 10lbs of lean mass but that experience would be so miserable and lengthy to do properly it just isn't worth it.  I just give him credit for fighting at all. In his position, I think I am just going to do something else at this point with my life.
bakole would put this version of joshua on his ass imo
a couple of things:   1. aj vs franklin was not competitive  2. if he can't beat whyte and takam level fighters he should retire before he gets hurt badly 3. who else would you like him to fight? jonathan guidry, mahmoud charr, david allen? he still has to sell tickets and get some sort of challenge
He's already finished both Whyte and Takam, they are easy touches for someone as good as AJ.  Also the Franklin fight wasn't competitive, and for my money there are very very few fighters in the division who would finish him, the guy has a granite chin. Wilder and *possibly* Joyce would be the only guys I'd expect to finish Franklin, and with Joyce it would only be through relentless pressure.
Yeah, that makes sense. Everyone who is into boxing knows this guy is going OUT hard next time he fights someone pretty good. Joe Joyce would put him out. He is a shot fighter imho. He can't get his offense going and obviously gets hit and you can see him change. Kinda like watching Amir Khan going into the Canelo fight. You knew he was talented enough to look good for a bit. But then its gonna be lights out. Khan wasnt mentally shot either. He just couldnt take punches anymore.
Forrest, Jarrell Miller, then the winner of Joyce Zhang would be a nice roadmap
One makes tens of millions of pounds, the other ends in death?
Last 5? Why don't we talk last 3? This mf has 3 fights since December 2020   This AJ dick riding must stop, it's just embarrassing at this point
Franklin>whyte>wallin   regardless wallins probably the right fight for him, if he wants respect he should take on hrgovic who I think is an easy fight
Isn’t it just.   Joyce v Joshua is the only fight I’d PPV that he could make.
I know it would be a PPV event I just don’t think it should be one, I.e. too boring, not enough public demand. I say this as someone who buys PPVs and goes to fights even been to several AJ fights before he fucked off to Saudi. Plenty of fights are PPV despite the demand and/or merit not being there I.e. Parker vs Chisora being one.
Well he did say he wants Fury right? Who else should he be fighting in the meantime?   It more seems like any name outside fury or wilder people will say he’s fighting bums
Boxing is the reason AJ is inactive. Let’s not pretend he’s unique
I mean for that specific period of time yeah.  Probably inadvertently did AJ a favour though, would've been stupid to fight Fury at that point.
The jab-n-grab is something that actually could work. It’s the system that took Wlad and Lennox to the HOF after they started struggling. AJ has the right build for it too.   That’s if AJ can find someone other than Sugar Hill to train him. AJ is apparently on bad terms with Lennox as well.
1. It was competitive in that Franklin didn’t look out of his depth, he had success and landed some good shots on the counter.   2. I’m not saying he can’t beat them, I’m saying they’re not soft touches. I’d like to see him fight Whyte and then if he wins that, the winner of Joyce vs Zhang.
You’re lost. Whyte nearly sent him through the ropes in the 12th round, he’d have finished him with an extra minute.
Fury would finish Franklin just by laying on him
Miller doesn't deserve the payday.  In all likelyhood it'll be in August (crawford/spence in june and 'mell/tyszu in late sept kinda means it has to be august). I think Wallin or Hughie if it's august. If it's earlier yeah, forrest or a martin rematch or arreola in the states would be fine, maybe even kownacki.   If it is Hughie or Wallin in August then follow it up with Ruiz or Whyte in December.
Why would running across a busy motorway pay him tens of millions?
fighting fury also equals death
OK, last 3 years; Wilder 2 fights, Fury 3 fights, Usyk 3 fights, AJ 4 fights.  I went last 5 because everyone was pretty inactive the last 3 years due to covid.  Same result though really
Not riding anyone's dick, but the Usyk rematch was delayed due to the war in Ukraine.
Why would Franklin be better than Whyte when Whyte beat him 8-4 easy? 😂
So you wouldn't bother watching if he fought Wilder or Fury?
Definitely not boring, Joyce and AJ have beef
coughJoycecough  Or how about he actually makes it happen with Wilder or Fury? I’m not going to get into who’s ducked who or who’s fault it was that their previous fights fell through because I don’t believe any of them or their promoters, but if AJ ever wants to be considered top 5 in his career again he NEEDS to win a fight with one of these 3 lads very soon.
So landing a few punches while losing evrry round is being competitive? If that was the case, Usyk lost both his heavyweight fights with Witherspoon and Chisora.  Goal posts keep changing.
franklin won 2 rds 3 if we're being really generous. all his did well was absorb the straight right hands with his face.   neither of those guys (whyte & takam) are top 25 fighters in the he division that inherently makes both of them soft touches to a guy that's supposed to be a top 5 fighter.   agreed on joyce/zhang winner but i see eddie and aj going with the more commercial fights (wilder or fury)
ah the ole reddit switcheroo, the ole ding a dooley, mega prank a rooney  hilarity has ensued  😭😭😭😭 😭😭😭😭 😭😭😭😭
Ahhhhh banter. Low hanging fruit mate.
Remember when he tried this and fury chickened out and gave it to chisora?  Fuck fury and his loyal simps
Is it aye?
That's awesome! Now mention the 1000 other boxers aside from the HWs who I never mentioned once 😂
robbery  also Franklin improved a lot for the aj fight
He said 'that he could make'. Let's not kid ourselves, aj is not gonna fight fury or wilder anytime soon
How?
Fury is doing the dance with Usyk, so likely won’t happen.   Wilder is possible but doesn’t like either is interested. But can you explain why no one is giving wilder the same energy? Helenius is on the same tier if not lower than Franklin. But no one cries and raves that he’s fighting bums and his legacy is in question. Fury also took Chisora which no one batted an eye   Got guys in here saying AJ would lose to Takam ffs. The hate is too much.   Joyce would be good but he’s fighting next week maybe after they can.
Maybe “competitive” was a bit too kind. Nonetheless, Joshua came in at a career heavy, he didn’t come to get a 12 round decision but Franklin didn’t let him steam roll him and was better opposition than many (including me) anticipated.   Regarding Whyte and Takam not being top 25, I’m not sure what you’re smoking there. Granted, Takam is about 50 and a gatekeeper now but Whyte is ranked  6  with the Ring, 8 with the IBF and 6 with the WBC.   A number 25 world ranked heavyweight probably worked the doors at his local pub last night, the division really isn’t as competitive as that.
Whyte isn't a top 25 heavyweight?? Are you being serious?
I can't see the phrase "the ole switcheroo" without getting flashbacks to getting sucked into that massive rabbit hole and trying to make sense of it all.
That's what she said
These are the only other fighters in the same weight class and at the same level as Joshua so seem like the only fair comparisons.  I know it doesn’t give the answer you want though.  Last 3 years; Usyk 3 fights, Inoue 5, Crawford 3, Spence 2, Canelo 6, Bivol 4, Loma 4, Taylor 3, Charlo 3, Estrada 4.  That’s the whole Ring top 10, only 2 have fought more than Joshua.  Half have fought less than him.
2,3,4,7,8,10,11,12.  The majority of franklins shots weren’t actually landing.
Exactly. I’m not even sure AJ thinks he has enough dog in him to go in with Joyce tbh but he isn’t going anywhere near Fury or Wilder.
fury, usyk, joshua, ruiz, joyce, wilder, dubois, parker, sanchez, bakole, makmudov, gassiev, wallin, hrgovic, zhang, anderson, huni, jalalov, dychko, pero, zhan koz....., ajagba, ortiz, wardley, and kabayel  all better than whyte and takam at this point in their careers (an argument can be made for whyte & takam to beat grueling back and forth slugfests w/ the last 7-8 names listed - but i'd put my money on the other guys)
fury, usyk, joshua, ruiz, joyce, wilder, dubois, parker, sanchez, bakole, makmudov, gassiev, wallin, hrgovic, zhang, anderson, huni, jalalov, dychko, pero, zhan koz....., ajagba, ortiz, wardley, and kabayel  all better than whyte and takam at this point in their careers (an argument can be made for whyte & takam to beat grueling back and forth slugfests w/ the last 7-8 names listed - but i'd put my money on the other guys)
I'm sorry. Though I was on the circlejerk sub, won't happen again
That's great! However I never mentioned any group of fighters, simply that Joshua is one of the most inactive. It's vague for a reason :)
i actually thought it was a draw tbh but the improvements from Franklin since that fight put him above whyte rn for me. it’s a draw or 115-113 either way
The majority of the names you listed are ranked lower than and/or haven’t fought anywhere near the level of Whyte or Takam. If you respond again, don’t expect a reply, you’re talking waffles and I’m not wasting anymore time on it.
Lmao. If you actually back your silly opinion I want you to explain why half of those fighters are on Whytes level yet alone above.
Come on man most of the guys om that list haven't beaten or even fought anyone of any significance at all to be saying such a thing while the only people to beat Whyte are three of the top 10 heavyweights of the 21st century. Not that Whyte isn't flawed as a boxer but if you actually take a look at it he has one of the best resumes of any current heavyweight without a doubt  Beyond Fury/AJ/Wilder/Usyk/Joyce/Parker/Ruiz barely anyone on the list has clearly better wins than the versions of Allen and Browne that Whyte beat, let alone his actual best wins against Parker and Povetkin. Also to be clear Whyte did actually beat Franklin pretty comfortably, you could just tell he was taking a more tentative approach for a comeback fight after a brutal ko. The second he upped the intensity in the last round he was bullying Franklin
None of 7-0 Huni who’s best win is probably an ex Rugby League player, British champion Fabio Wardley, Kabayel who after over a decade and 23 fights as a pro is still fighting journeymen, or Wallin who’s career highlight is giving Fury a cut, are better than Whyte lol. Most of the people you list haven’t achieved anything in their careers.
You also have to remember that Whyte was adjusting to a new trainer. We don’t know what he’s like now
He's had one fight and got easily outpointed and never once hurt his opponent.  Only thing he showed at all in the Joshua fight is that he can take a punch.
What improvements? He lost weight but looked utterly pathetic in the AJ fight, his hands looked slower and all he done was hold the whole night.  When Whyte actually put it on Franklin in the 12th he sent him flying across the ring.  Whyte is levels above Franklin mate, Whyte on a bad night still won 8-4
i like whyte but just look at his last 2 performances - he's over it now
substantiate why you think a guy who's only 3 losses are to top HWs two being top 3 in the division. Is lower than fucking ' Justis Huni' (lmao), Jalalov, Dychko, Pero, Ajagba. These guys have proven absolutely nothing at HW and you're just pulling names for the sake of it. And he beat Parker so...
I feel like Liston with modern nutrition and knowledge would be a straight murderer who makes Dubois look like an amateur   This is an undisputed heavyweight champion we are talking about here. He destroyed Patterson and many others, but choked HARD against Clay/Ali   I think Usyk could leave him bewildered just like with Ali but Liston really only needs one good lucky shot. A betting man would probably pick Usyk
Usyk would respect Liston's power early on, and dominate him in the last few rounds. Usyk 8-4 or 7-5.
I’d love to see how this unfolds.
I think it’s near impossible to guage these   The fighters of today are here because the fighters of yesterday. I think it’s the evolution of the athlete   Basketball is one of the clearest examples   While the anomaly’s of the generations before, could likely hang in present generations, the fact they raise both the ceiling and floor for future generations, compiled with advancements in science, makes it tough to compare   It would be tough for me to say the best of today wouldn’t beat the best of yesterday   Baseball: pitchers today would have 15+ k’s a game if they were thrown back into the 1930’s   Basketball: giannis would average 40/20/12 a game in the early ages (before the enforcer era)  Athletes of today have decades and decades of competition to study from - the further you go back, the less there’s been to study and learn from
Hard to say, liston wasnt exactly the best guy against movers. However, he has massive reach and usyk hasnt really shown if he could take punches as powerful as listons without crumbling. Imma say liston for now.
Given that Liston was born first, I have to go with him.
Well, considering Usyk is bigger than Ali with better head movement and a southpaw and that when Liston fought Ali he barely landed a punch, I’m going to go with Liston. Mainly because I have an inability to look objectively at situations because of hindsight bias.
Is allowed access to the same drugs as modern boxers?
I’ve got Liston
Southpaws were just too much of an anomaly back then, Usyk by decision
I favor Usyk to stop Sonny  Not the same guy of course, but theres tooo many qualities that Ali had that Usyk shares, with the cherry on top that he's a southpaw, which Sonny had no exposure to.  He ain't figuring out the GOAT southpaw on fight night IMO
Liston's 84" wingspan I think is longer than Joshua's. He's also a much more aggressive, physical fighter who was willing to use dirty tactics. Liston's decimation of Floyd Patterson is more impressive than Usyk's decision wins over Joshua. He knocked out Nino Valdes as well, the man Marciano was protected from.   It'd be a great fight. Neither have faced a man like the other. The gloves in scenario 1 give Liston an advantage, I think he was brutal enough to stop Usyk. Fight looks like Joe Joyce vs. Jalolov in the Olympics. I don't know about scenario 2, refs are different, gloves are different, who can tell.
Whomever establishes the jab better, so probably Liston.
I don’t like putting Usyk in heavyweight ATG matchups yet. He hasn’t been tested enough yet even if that’s because of his own good work. Too much to imagine at the minute. I want to see how good his chin is.
Actually a pretty interesting matchup stylistically, but I think Liston wins it. Usyk, despite having great movement and speed, was not a young Ali. No heavyweight was like a young Ali.  That being said, this is far from unwinnable for Usyk. If he sticks and moves similarly like he did against AJ in the first fight, he could stand a chance here. Still, I pick Sonny to eventually knock him out.
Usyk barely beat Sizzora and looked shite vs. Chazz
I'm a huge Usyk fan boy but Liston absolutely stomps him imo. Maybe he has a chance if he can dance around him and make it into late rounds. People underrate Liston on here for some reason
Liston. Too strong
I got Liston by KO. He caught up to Patterson's peek-a-boo style, he can catch Usyk. He had beaten the other top contenders Williams, Foley, & Machen. Liston hits harder than any Usyk opponent, coming in with a harder jab and right hand than AJ & Chisora. Liston W by KO 8.
Liston would murder him. Usyk is the most overrated heavyweight I can remember.
Liston. Recency bias is something else
A fantasy match up in /r/Boxing  where the current boxer is favored over an old time?????  What the hell is happening in this sub??!!
Liston was probably in the second tier of power, with guys like Ray Mercer and Anthony Joshua, rather than the Foreman/Wilder tier. Cleveland Williams displayed chin issues against Bob Satterfield, and Liston struggled against small fighters like Bert Whitehurst. Even Mexican Beef Liston would probably need more than a lucky punch against Usyk.      Less speculatively, Liston developed his style when the best boxers were smaller men with less reach. His jab, chin position, and inside work would all need retooling to adapt to lankier boxers like Usyk.
>I feel like Liston with modern nutrition and knowledge would be a straight murderer who makes Dubois look like an amateur  He would be at least 6'6 assuming he had a good diet as a kid. Frazier would've been well over 6'2 also.
modern nutrition = steriods
It’s 15 rounds in the 60’s, and although I respect Usyk I don’t think he’d go all the way with Liston.
Liston's shots looked great against Patterson etc,  a SMW or LHW fighter today. Usyk is similar size to Liston but vastly more skilled.  Liston barely knocked over anyone over 200lbs, Usyk's eaten shots from 240lb AJ and 250lb Delboy. Have those guys swap gloves and opponents with Liston and see how their power looks..
Can't argue with that logic tbh
Idk why you got downvotes. That is literally how people decide this.
I keep hearing “Usyk is bigger than Ali,” even when people aren’t talking about a specific bout.  They’re the same height and Ali may have 1-2 inches of reach on Usyk. Usyk weighed 221 in the Joshua fights, and 215 in his first heavy fight. Ali weighed 210 in the Liston fight, and 227 by the Mathis fight in ‘71. He was in the 220s for the rest of his career.
The physicality of Liston is a myth. He was a careful boxer who worked patiently behind a jab. A small, but strong, heavyweight like Eddie Machen effectively shut Liston down on the inside, while moving Liston around fairly easily.
He has been tested enough. The Cruiser he fought were basically 70s heavyweights
He beat Chisora pretty handily and a lot of the trouble came down to Chisora being 250lbs or so, Liston actually weighed less than Usyk
How did he looke shite Vs Chazz?   He barely got out of second gear but he still won every second of that fight with no trouble at all.
Foreman said Liston was the only man who could consistently back him up
Is diet really the cause of height difference? If anything the food available to regular people these days is way more polluted and damaging to hormonal development. Testosterone has dropped massively, the majority of people(at least in the states)is overweight or obese, and the list goes on. Liston grew up on a farm, had an extremely tough upbringing combined with healthy naturally grown foods without bullcrap soy, plastics or ridiculous amounts of sugars.   The only difference would be the availability to steroids, doctors and such. But that height correlation to "good diet" thing doesn't make sense to me at all.
Maybe on Tinder with shoes on. I doubt Liston was a good diet away from growing an extra 5 or more inches. He was also not a lanky 6'1 so adding 5 inches on him would be A LOT of mass.
His power looks just fine, being bigger doesnt automatically make you stronger or tougher. Liston absolutely overpowered and brutalized 6'5 chuck wepner when he was a dinasour. He could overpower and push back a 20 year old, 6'4 foreman when he was 50. He damaged 16 teeth of a boxer at once and KO'd him with a single jab. Usyk cant just eat those shots.
Yes he did. Liston KO'd 211 pound Nino Valdes in 1959, who was the second ranked heavyweight at the time. Cleveland Williams was also a pretty big heavyweight at 211 in their first fight and 215 pounds in their rematch. Mike DeJohn, a top 10 202 pound heavyweight, and Zora Folley (198 pounds and number 1 ranked contender) were also knocked out by Liston.  &#x200B;  I think it's unfair to say he only knocked out light heavyweights, or that he was vastly less skilled than Usyk. Liston was pretty technically sound himself, moreso than AJ and Chisora.
So if anyone says Liston, it has to be because he’s an older fighter??? 🤔
This was referring to the Liston bout, and that’s what I was referring to, but good point generally.
He also conspicuously never included Liston in his list of "real punchers" he fought or sparred, despite mentioning Cleveland Williams.
I’m sorry but I have to say nothing you’ve mentioned has any bearing on this. Testosterone has dropped because less people have jobs doing manual labor. Soy has absolutely no effect on testosterone or any negative health effects. Plastics are not a factor either, no known effects like you’ve mentioned and the effects that they are associated with (which again, aren’t real) are not height. Sugars=calories so that actually makes you taller (assuming you’re malnourished without said sugars). Height is correlated to caloric intake during childhood. Not sure why you even made the comment comparing eras, people are 2 inches taller today than they were when Liston was growing up for a reason. That being said, the idea that “X boxer would be taller if they had modern nutrition” is very flawed. The “modern nutrition” argument is more of a statistical average, not applicable for individuals subject to their own unique genetics. Also, they are making an unsupported assumption about Liston’s childhood diet. At the very least you can tell he wasn’t malnourished during his puberty years, as you can see by his natural musculature.
Frazier I know for sure was legit malnourished as a kid, as in didn't have enough calories. I'm unsure about Liston tbh, always thought he grew up poor.  Also the low testosterone of modern men doesn't affect growth
>His power looks just fine, being bigger doesnt automatically make you stronger or tougher.  It does, generally. There are weightclasses for good reason. Back in the day their gloves were much slimmer too, making shots more devastating.  >chuck wepner when he was a dinasour.   A rugged journeyman that was only 9lbs heavier than Liston  >20 year old, 6'4 foreman when he was 50.  Foreman was under 215 lbs back then. "Big" George Foreman is lighter than Usyk  I've seen welterweights Ko people with a jab, or knock teeth out. Nothing here convinces me that he generates more force than a modern super heavyweight. Or even a modern cruiser (same size as him) with all of the sports science and PEDs we have now.
Likely because they were sparring and not trying to knock each other out. Liston was supposedly very warm and friendly with people he liked.  Williams, on the other hand, might not have been.
Foreman had a ridiculous chin, that doesnt surprise me. Defo weird tho
Son of a sharecropper, Sonny did the work of a mule / beast of burden that his dad couldn't afford.  Nobody even really knew how old he was.  Some speculate he was in his 40s when he fought Ali the first time.
Surely it does otherwise why would men be quite a bit taller than women on average around about the time they hit puberty and also around the time they start getting a lot of testosterone (which women get minuscule amounts of comparatively) ?
>It does, generally. There are weightclasses for good reason. Back in the day their gloves were much slimmer too, making shots more devastating.  Not at all, ali was bigger than liston and as big as usyk, he hit like a kid compared to liston. Everyone frazier overpowered and beat down was bigger than him.   >A rugged journeyman that was only 9lbs heavier than Liston  Who also took alis shots for 15 rounds without going down.   >Foreman was under 215 lbs back then. "Big" George Foreman is lighter than Usyk  Again, being heavier DOES NOT make you stronger. Fury is heavier than wilder. Most people tyson overpowered and steamrolled were heavier than him. Superior weight mostly gives you advantage in chinching, it doesnt automatically make you physically stronger or a stronger puncher.   >I've seen welterweights Ko people with a jab, or knock teeth out.  Liston did it in one shot and a few seconds into the fight. AND he did it against a guy that hasnt even been knocked down before if I remember correctly.   >Nothing here convinces me that he generates more force than a modern super heavyweight. Or even a modern cruiser (same size as him) with all of the sports science and PEDs we have now.  Some fighters and trainers outright said liston was stronger than foreman. Thats mode than enough for me to believe he is stronger than usyk or a modern cruiserweight.
Personally, I feel like Liston is physically overrated, and technically underrated. Chuck Wepner said that Liston was stronger than Foreman, but Wepner immediately responded to every punch Liston threw. Liston won with accuracy and initiative, but Foreman just battered Wepner around until Wepner's skin broke.    A young, wide open Foreman probably struggled with Liston's accurate, straight punches, without being overly impressed with Liston's strength and power.
What?!? In what fight did Foreman show he had a “ridiculous chin”?!?   I love Big George, and he could punch like a train, but idk where you get that chin stuff. Because he lasted the distance against Holyfield and stayed upright long enough to spring his trap on Michael Moorer? Neither of those guys were natural heavyweights. And nothing at all could ever be gleaned from the first part of his career chin-wise, since he mostly ko’d his opponents quickly. Larry Holmes had a significantly better chin than Foreman, and Ali had the best heavyweight chin ever. Holmes was actually HIT with huge punches by Mike Weaver, Renaldo Snipes, Earnie Shavers. Foreman never recovered to win a fight the way Holmes did on multiple occasions, and he never survived an opponents’ finishing salvo such as Larry was famous for. No, for whatever reason, when Foreman  was beat, he was beat, he didn’t recover or come back. Ali only came out of his rope a dope when he knew George was finished energy-wise. Foreman was dominated by Jimmy Young and Tommy Morrison, both of whom ran like thieves, but neither ever really tested his chin. Opponents were extremely careful to not expose themselves to George’s power, so George never had to really stand up against a fusillade of blows. The only time I recall anything like that happening to George was against Ali, and his chin failed that test. Yeah, he was tired. He was still KO’d (as opposed to just being “stopped”.).   Alltime great offensive fighter (and a pretty good defensive fighter too, eventually); NOT an Alltime chin however.
what i mean is i don't think low T is a problem in pre pubescent or pubescent children
>Not at all, ali was bigger than liston and as big as usyk, he hit like a kid compared to liston.  It's not that the bigger guy always hits harder, but you could plot punchers on a graph and see the trend. The hardest punching flyweight that's ever lived simply can't generate the energy of a journeyman heavyweight.  >Who also took alis shots for 15 rounds without going down.  You pointed out yourself that Ali wasn't the biggest puncher  >Again, being heavier DOES NOT make you stronger. Fury is heavier than wilder. Most people tyson overpowered and steamrolled were heavier than him. Superior weight mostly gives you advantage in chinching, it doesnt automatically make you physically stronger or a stronger puncher.   Generally speaking, it does. Look at any fighter moving up in weight and how they struggle to break down bigger opponents. It's not a guarantee that every HW hits harder than any crusier, but on average, they tend to.   Fury used his weight to manhandle and tire wilder. You're right, he doesn't hit as hard. But Wilder's an outlier, a fantastic puncher (with a much larger frame to generate force than a shavers, Liston etc). I don't think any of these smaller old guys' power would look the same against bigger modern opponents, with modern gloves. Take Wlad, Wilder, Lennox etc back in time and have them tee off on 190lb opponents in 50s gloves lol.   >Some fighters and trainers outright said liston was stronger than foreman. Thats mode than enough for me to believe he is stronger than usyk or a modern cruiserweight.  I believe he's stronger than many, but I don't think he's one of the hardest punchers ever, or that his power would look as spectacular today.
How about the fact he survived death incarnate vs Lyle and came back?  How about absolutely noselling Smokin Joe Frazier? Hardest left hook probably ever?  Holyfield mollywhopped him all over the ring at some points, and that shit put Tyson and many more down, it's such a erroneuos and tbh, biased statement to say George has no chin  He was NEVER knocked down in his second career. As a matter of fact, I can only name 2 fights he's been dropped in and that's Lyle and Ali (and maybe Young in the last round but im not sure). If the only guy to ever knock you out was fuckin MUHAMMAD ALI, then I think your chin isn't too questionable.  Honestly, for you to say George has no chin makes me wonder what you even qualify as a good chin - Do they need to be a Hiroshima survivor?
Jesus Christ. The mental gymnastics some people do. Being bigger just makes you stronger, that is a simple fact
>It's not that the bigger guy always hits harder, but you could plot punchers on a graph and see the trend. The hardest punching flyweight that's ever lived simply can't generate the energy of a journeyman heavyweight.  If you know outliers can exist why are you saying usyk is stronger just because he is bigger? That notion already debunks itself as ali was just as big as usyk but he was weaker than liston.   >You pointed out yourself that Ali wasn't the biggest puncher  Yeah compared to liston. Ali had jerry quarry and ron lyle stagger around the ring like drunkards, he can hit pretty hard when he wants to.   >Generally speaking, it does. Look at any fighter moving up in weight and how they struggle to break down bigger opponents. It's not a guarantee that every HW hits harder than any crusier, but on average, they tend to.   Again, if you know outliers can exist and considering ali was as big as usyk, why use usyks size as an argument to prove he is stronger than liston?   >Fury used his weight to manhandle and tire wilder.  Yeah, his weight, not his strength.   >You're right, he doesn't hit as hard. But Wilder's an outlier, a fantastic puncher (with a much larger frame to generate force than a shavers, Liston etc).  Liston was just as much of an anomaly as wilder.   > I don't think any of these smaller old guys' power would look the same against bigger modern opponents, with modern gloves. Take Wlad, Wilder, Lennox etc back in time and have them tee off on 190lb opponents in 50s gloves lol.   Doubt it. There is a post in this subreddit about a guy who sparred with lewis, wlad and old foreman. He said that old foreman was the strongest among the bunch. Liston could push around a 20 year old foreman at the age of 50.  >I believe he's stronger than many, but I don't think he's one of the hardest punchers ever, or that his power would look as spectacular today.  I dont exactly think he is unmatched either, but he is very clearly among the strongests and I whole-heartedly believe he is stronger than usyk.
I agree, but it doesn't always translate to punching power. You could have a slightly smaller guy who's naturally incredibly strong (moreso than bigger opponent) - like Canelo vs Plant
No it doesnt, and directly adress me if you have an argument instead of bitching about mental gymnastics.
I never said Usyk was stronger, I said he'd win the boxing match.  That being hit by Joshua and Chisora means he can take Liston's shots
Yeah, that's also true. But a 250lbs Chisora is stronger than a 210lbs Liston. It's just physics at some point
A 250lbs Chisora is physically just stronger than a 215lbs Sonny Liston. It's just the way it is. You said Fury being heavier than Wilder like it is somehow a point, when it is very clear from all of their fights that Fury is physically stronger than Wilder, he just doesn't punch as hard.  You somehow try to make the point that being heavier does not make you stronffer when it is absolutely the case. The same guy weighing 200lbs or 250lbs him at 250 will be stronger, if his body composition is about the same. And that's just a biological fact. Also Frazier was shorter, but he wasn't lighter than his opponents. He had huge legs, which obviously was the source of his power. He knocked out Foster who was taller, but much weaker because he was lighter.  Also Liston being stronger than Foreman is moot anyway, as Liston died when Foreman was 21. That's before you get your man pounds and become a bit physically stronger anyway. And you know what made George so strong when he came back? His additional weight. He slimmed down to experiment against Qawi to to 235lbs, but after that he always fought north of 250lbs because the added weight offered just a bunch of advantages
>I never said Usyk was stronger, I said he'd win the boxing match.  Certainly possible, but I give the small edge to liston.   >That being hit by Joshua and Chisora means he can take Liston's shots  The strongest punch joshua ever threw in his life couldnt even knock down a 40 year old exhausted wlad, who notably has a questionable chin. I dont see how chisora and joshua proved themselves stronger than a guy that is compared to foreman, even placed above him occassionally.
Agreed. Boxing is the only sport where people argue the old timers were stronger/bigger hitters. Every sport metric we can measure has improved, but they still argue this nonsense!
Who's the toughest fighter Liston stopped?  I think Foreman's power is overrated. That same forum poster that talked about foreman said he was physically strong, but he couldn't see himself getting kod by him. That Wlad hit the hardest by far.  Who's the toughest/best fighter foreman knocked out in the 90s? His biggest achievement is buzzing 208lb Holyfield before he'd fully filled out at HW. Moorer never had the greatest chin, and got cocky. I believe the 90s fighters talked up Foreman's power as a way to pay respect to the old guard, and make their wins over him seem more impressive
Oh lord this fight is gonna be a good one. Both heavy handed and Zhang showed against Hrgovic that he's not just come for a payday. I expect Joyce to wear him down as Zhangs stamina issues are apparent but this is heavyweight. After all, hrgovic was expected to wall all over him too.
Joyce should win, but the odds are a bit too heavy.  Zhang ko win in the first 5 wouldn't shock me at all.  He hits real hard and Joyce will look like he has an impervious chin right up until he doesnt.
Epic clash of two big men, like Bowe-Golota but hopefully without the nut shots.
ESPN+ with no additional PPV in the US AND Mikaela Mayer is on the undercard? This is a solid month for boxing.
Considering how crappy the division is at the moment, this should be a HW FOTY contender. Should be fun while it lasts.
I want ZZ to win so bad.
Anyone who thinks this is a close fight is in for a surprise. Joyce is gonna steamroll Zhang.  I like Zhang and wish they would have given him a winnable fight like after the Hrgovic robbery.......but he's def about to get stopped here.
Zhang puts on a good performance then gasses in the 8th and probably gets KO'd.
Good analysis, but I just can't see how Rummys pick is Joyce decision. Zhang gasses by the mid rounds and always fights in bursts, even from the early rounds. Joyce is gonna swarm him and it will get very uncomfortable for Zhang beyond rd 6. IMO Zhang has to really hurt Joyce for it to go to decision.
Big Bang Zhilly Zhong will get taken out in the second half by Big Juggy Joe
The unstoppable force meeting the immovable object.
We're definitely going to find out if that chin is as solid as they say. Can't wait
My heart wants Joyce's chin to stay indestructible till the end of his career, but I'm genuinely scared Zhang might be the one to finally break it
Joyce murders Zhang.
Joyce taking on Dubois and now this cat.  He has a better resume than Fury lol.
This is a legally sanctioned sustsained beating given to an old timer
Unfortunately for Zhang, I think his stamina let's him down in this one... Joyce win by late stoppage would be my pick.
Zhang pretty much has to win via knock out in the early rounds or it's over. The problem is Joyce has an iron chin and I don't think this is the fight it's getting cracked.  Or maybe it is. Who's knows. I wouldn't bet on it though.
Both men are natural giants. Both men can crack and have granite chins. Zhang has power and speed advantage - he is more explosive. Joyce has the better chin and vastly superior stamina which will be the deciding factor. Don't think Zhang can finish Joyce even should he land an early round knockdown. Joyce will outsustain him followed by perhaps a late round KO.
People seem to think he’s invincible. I’m picking him to win but sooner or later his chin will get cracked.
The only bet here is Zhang early KO, the worst Russia caught Joyce cold once before. But Joyce def gonna Siri him in late rounds, the early KO potential is still there though
It’s weirdly similar. Bowe (Joyce) is an olympic silver medalist and Zhang (Golota) is also an Olympic medalist, is a good fighter in the early rounds but has awful stamina gasses out then demolishes his opponent’s balls. In fact I’m betting the house on Joyce winning by Testicular Demolition.
And at the perfect time of 5pm EST.   The midnight fight times in the US are honestly killing me.
Zoe Zoyce?
Me too, his last fight was so sick
Styles make fights. Zhang gasses and Joyce keeps going through the gears. Recipe for disaster for Zhang.   His only chance is to land a big shot that hurts Joyce, but given his chin it's has to be something seriously special. I can't see it.
The first 4 rounds are gonna be very dangerous for Joyce though
I would say so, but I think him being a southpaw is a great unknown component. How does Joyce react to the lead hand battle? Is he too slow to win it? If yes he gets battered
The immovable object vs the immovable object
Better than watching all the US main events at 4am.
Bro I love the Great Wall but even if he wins the lead hand battle he's gonna gas in 3 rounds. He does not have the wind to sustain a fight against current Joyce even if he's landing.
But one of those objects becomes more immovable in the later rounds.
good point. He just doesn'thave the gas tank.
Can you do Bradley vs Pacquiao 1 please and 2 if possible.
u/ICTruthcity Stats look different when someone else does them, huh? 😂🤣  [Here are your precious CompuBox stats](https://www.boxingscene.com/amp/tony-harrison-vs-jermell-charlo-compubox-punch-stats--134891)
**Tony Harrison** vs. **Jermell Charlo** — Dec 22nd, 2018  Throwback Thursday #16, fight requested by u/GarfieldDaCat  Somewhat controversial fight with the commentators being criticized for a heavy bias favoring Charlo. Harrison worked up a clear lead on punched landed during the early and middle rounds, though Charlo finished strong in rounds 11 and 12 landing several LQ max shots.

This is interesting. I will say I’m not completely surprised by how big a difference that AI and compubox saw Charlo landing. I remember watching the fight live on Fox and even pointed out to my friend that compubox has Charlo landing several punches that you can clearly see are being blocked by Tony.
These will never not look like a Skyrim menu to me
Love this tech, awesome job!
I've added these to our list for you. :)
Thank you my friend! I have been waiting eagerly for this one. What a disparity for Charlo between your AI and Compubox!!
Confirmed that Compubox is absolute crap.
Hehe, any resemblance is a coincidence. 😊
btw just wanted to say you sure as hell got a very rare username, very cool too
This is their first fight where Tony won a decision. You're not slick.  The punch stats between this new AI initiative and CompuBox are completely different, which only shatters your narrative about how important and reliable CompuBox is.
Yeah, usually the CompuBox numbers are within the right ballpark, though sometimes we do see fights where one fighter is over-counted or under-counted by +50%, in this particular case Charlo was over-counted by ~ 100% on landed shots
Compubox is the complete opposite of reliable can’t believe anyone would think that.
>u/ICTruthcity Stats look different when someone else does them, huh  Guess what...  Most of the guy's stats actually **Agree with compubox**, although there is a small overcount/undercount discrepancy.

Also with the Tony Harrison fight. How many times did I tell you that it's not just about punches landed, it's about #accuracy. Harrison in that fight had several rounds where he had more Accuracy, charlo may have landed 1-2 punches more here and then per, but if you're shooting upwards of 10-15% more accuracy, then your differential makes up for the 1-2 less punches landed..  u/RRR04_
Tony was parrying a lot in this fight.   I knew Compubox was being kind to Charlo but I had no idea they were being THAT kind to him
Exactly! I've told this guy numerous times that CompuBox stats are scored by people who press buttons when they *think* they saw a punch land or get thrown. His answer was along the lines of "tHeY aRe PrOfEsSiOnAlS dOiNg A jOb".
I, for the life of me cannot understand why people still put Compubox on a pedestal.
Not really, it's actually in concurrence with Compubox for most fights. My man called me out for saying accuracy and punches landed count equally.   This stats also says lomachenko landed 78 more punches than Lopez in their fight, whereas as Compubox says lopez landed 42 more punches.  Also these stats say charlo in their draw against castano landed 55 punches whereas Compubox says castano landed 22 more punches.  There are some discrepancies but it's usually because this new stat overcounts, and also the fact that punch accuracy isn't accounted for per round.
u/ICtruthcity , we run all stats published on Throwback Thursday with human supervision so we're extremely confident our numbers are accurate. See [my previous comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/12dnf2y/ai_punch_stats_harrison_vs_charlo_throwback/jfa6ztu) with a bit more details.
You gone off on a tangent about the Harrison fight where I did not even talk about the fight itself. I spoke about how different the punch stats were for the same fight. I never said who won or who deserved to win. The point of the matter is that those stats are not guaranteed to be 100% accurate, but you are still acting like these stats are more important than using your own logical thinking? All you are doing is exposing yourself as a thoughtless human being who is incapable of thinking for himself.
Looool GOMD, you shout me everyday on Reddit...and couldn't be more pathetic  My guy says he has an online maths degree, then says Compubox has a punch of people that punch buttons.  Yet this new stat actually overcounts way more punches that Compubox does.   https://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/12dnf2y/ai_punch_stats_harrison_vs_charlo_throwback/jf7u0mw?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3
Nah he's trying to score points because he lost an argument yesterday. This guy shouts me everyday.  Nevertheless this stat says lomachenko landed almost 80 more punches than Lopez did when he lost, Compubox says lopez landed 40 more.   There is always going to be discrepancies, however most of the fights are actually in agreement this stat and Compubox, yet still this new stat overcounts punches more and also doesn't account for punches landed or accuracy **per round**.
> and also the fact that punch accuracy isn't accounted for per round.  It's literally on the 3rd slide lol

Accounted for per round, not total accuracy. Fighters win each round, there isn't just a final verdict.
You spend too much time on Reddit.  For someone with a online maths degree I thought you would have made something out of your life.  Again GOMD.

>>EDIT: FINALLY HE BLOCKED ME!  Idk wtf is going on man but take a step back and chill out. You’re definitely annoying asf.
guys relax, why not just check how compubox works?  It was etablished in 1985. It works as follows: 'The system calls for two operators. Each operator watches one of the two fighters and has access to four keys, corresponding to jab connect, jab miss, power punch connect, and power punch miss.'  im sure this ai sysem isn't perfect, but i personally put far more trust in it than compubox
All I took from this is what I took from the fight itself when I watched it.    That AJ landed plenty of good shots on Franklin and then didn't bother to follow up.  Thus, a rather boring decision win over a guy he probably should have steamrolled.  You can say this was the game plan.  Don't take risks.  Ensure a win so your career isn't completely toast.  Whatever.  At the end of the day, AJ's problems that have been clear as fucking crystal for a long time were still front and center in this fight.  He has stamina problems.  Usyk just ground him down in those two fights.  AJ was ready to go at the end of the first fight and he did better in the second, but couldn't keep up at the end.  Ok, well, that's Usyk.  The dude with the best motor in boxing, potentially.  Except, people here in the comments are already like, "Look!  AJ didn't gas out!"  Well, yeah, of course he didn't.  He hardly moved around the ring.  He and Franklin hugged each other for long stretches of the fight.  And AJ refused to throw his hands and press his advantage.  AJ needs to be 25 or so pounds lighter.  He comes in jacked to the fucking tits, all of it muscle, and it doesn't do him any favors.  He'd still have KO power at 220-230.  He also has mental problems.  This has been obvious for awhile now, no more so than after that second loss to Usyk.  Yet, he scores an easy win over a handpicked opponent and he's still acting out and being a goofball after the fight.    He has mental problems specifically with fighting/his chin.  We've all seen AJ go from an aggressive pressure fighter who wants to drop you, to a tentative "I'll try out-boxing the best boxer on the planet" guy.  I don't know if it's actual physical chin problems like a lot of fighters get after a super-hard shot/KO like he took against Ruiz or if it's just he's constantly worried about having it happen again.  Either way, he's become a completely different fighter.  And it isn't doing him any favors.  Especially since, again, he's coming in at 250 damn pounds and looks like he has 4% bodyfat.  If you aren't going to press for a KO, what do you need all that muscle for?  If you're just going to stand at range and box you don't need to look like Ronnie Coleman.  Talk up Franklin all you want.  Guy is obviously tough.  But he ain't a Fury or even a Wilder.  And if you're worried about pressing the action and getting KO'ed with a Franklin who hugged you half the fight and is visibly smaller than you, what the fuck are you gonna do against a 6'9 freak who CAN box or a 6'7 rangy guy with a howitzer for a right hand or a 6'6 juggernaut who never tires and has a 93% KO rate?  AJ can continue to beat guys like Franklin, of that I have no doubt.  I just don't see this version of AJ beating the top guys at HW.
The problem was the way that AJ's own team built up the fight. It was all about knockouts and making a statement, and Joshua coming in at a career heaviest fed into that further. Franklin was an awful pick for that because he's a too awkward/tough to be a highlight reel KO sacrificial lamb, but not good enough that outpointing him is seen as impressive.
I don’t understand the comments that Joshua is no longer someone to consider as a potential world champion. Or even more severe opinions, that he is finished and should retire…  The guy has recorded 3 L’s. The first loss was to Ruiz, who clubbed Joshua to death on the inside when Joshua tried to get greedy and KO Ruiz while his tank was a long way from empty.  Joshua avenged that defeat to Ruiz under immense pressure. People play down this victory by saying that Ruiz was out of shape etc, but the guy has never been in shape. Ruiz is just a hard-as-nails heavyweight who will kill you if you come inside, just like a crocodile will when it gets you in death roll. Joshua learnt his lesson from the first fight and boxed him from distance, executing the game plan to out point him (comfortably) using only the jab and the space of the ring. Joshua was never trying to knock Ruiz out, and this is perfectly okay.  Joshua then lost to arguably the best P4P fighter in Usyk. Oleksandr completely outclassed Joshua with his footwork, head movement and quick reaction counter punching.  In the rematch, Joshua once again significantly closed the gap on what was a brutal defeat before. Yes, he did not avenge his L against Usyk. But Joshua was not outclassed this time. He made the necessary adjustments to give Usyk his toughest fight of his career. Anyone that wants to say “Joshua should have walked him down” or “why not finish the job on Usyk in the later rounds when he had him in trouble” has no clue how physically demanding it is to keep up with Usyk’s footwork and feints for 12 rounds and not get sparked out. Anyone would be gassed trying to keep pace with him, so I see no shame in Joshua not being able to give anymore and he can take pride in running Usyk as close as he did, deservedly getting the nod from 1 judge.  My point is this. Joshua has faced adversity twice in two different scenarios and on both occasions he has proved that his initial game plan was not correct and made the necessary adjustments to markedly improve from the first fights.  He then outclassed Franklin, earning a wide points UD. Some people are upset that he didn’t KO Franklin, but from my view Joshua’s focus was on executing a game plan which gives him the best chance to succeed. And this was the case. He was never at risk of losing the fight, but could have been if he went searching for a knockout that would have been difficult to find and realistically unnecessary for him to achieve his objective of winning the fight.  How is Joshua no longer considered a contender?  I would understand comments that on some occasions the game plan/corner instructions he has been given has been awful, but if he was finished, he would have performed to an equal or worse standard than the first L’s to Ruiz and Usyk. This was not the case. He improved significantly.
All I'll say is that even if he looked trash, it's a tune up fight with a new trainer. Tyson Fury took 10 rounds to get Seferi out of there, then literally 3 months later he was boxing rings around Wilder. Then in 2019/20, he got cut open by freaking Otto Wallin, who landed more punches on Fury than any fighter ever has, and again the next time Fury was seen he pieced up Wilder even worse. I'm not going to read to much into  AJ looking naff against Franklin. They obviously picked a dude they knew could go rounds and hoped to stop late. If they just wanted a stoppage, AJ could have called Pulev up again
Alright, so he's fighting a top 10 fighter next?  edit: lol downvoted for asking a simple question, someone's a bit sensitive.
It may just be me but AJ's right hand ain't what it used to be. I know Franklin is tough but just watching AJ throw it, it looks weaker and he isn't punching all the way through like he has before. To echo all the comments he is hesitating a little too much in many aspects of his game.  That said, I don't blame him. It must be crazy being this guy. What a turn of events for a career and it ain't over for him either. I went from not liking AJ wondering if anyone could stop him years ago, and knowing that he will dominate for a long time, to now rooting for the guy to make a comeback. That is boxing.  He is going to hold himself back as long as he is scared to trade. He has to find ways to be confident in his offense again. People used to be scared of his power and the aura is gone because he is showing he won't take the risk to use it full force.
I think he is finished, sadly. What made Joshua a champion in the first place was the fact that he was a lion in the ring willing to trade. Granted, he jabbed off a shorter and overweight Ruiz to win the title for the second time in his career but that strategy can’t work against the top guys currently. I will even bet on Ruiz if they fought thrice as I don’t think he will binge on Snickers this time.
It's not so much the performance, but this is a shell of what true AJ used to be. He looks shaky, nervous, overly cautious, and robotic. This AJ is still good enough to beat average to very good opposition, but we want OLD AJ, going to war AJ! not 1-2 hug AJ Jesus fuck I'm mad just thinking about it
It was flat & very pedestrian. He won’t to the level he once was & for me the Ruiz fight made him feel mortal.  With his tools that he possesses he should bomb most of that division out of there, but his anxiety of getting pinged himself means he stalls.  No shame in that.  Get out the game while you have all your faculties & enjoy your money..
He's absolutely terrified of getting hit, that Ruiz defeat took his soul. Won't ever be the same again.
Aj has too many haters for no reason. He actually didn’t do bad. It was just different than the aggressive aj we’ve seen. He showed a good jab and landed alot of power shots. Franklin just had a chin. People just expected aj to stop Franklin but it didn’t happen.but it was not a bad fight and people have to remember this is a new coach and he’s had 3 different coaches in his last 3 fights. He needs to Adjust to what Derrick wants him to do.  I think it’s just stupid fury and wilder fans talking shit and trolling. It’s weird they have so many fans talking shit when fury ducked the shit out of usyk. Aj fought usyk with no issues. And don’t get me started with wilders pattern of ducking guys for a decade. His best win is a dinosaur on blood pressure meds. Aj gets too much hate. He’s not perfect but him consistently fighting the top guys needs to be respected. He’ll fight a top guy soon. He may need another fight soon to adjust though.
It doesn't matter what Joshua does, he is the most over critiqued, over analysed fighter in the entire boxing industry, absolutely no other boxer gets the scrutiny Anthony Joshua does. It's absolutely wild.
AJ dominated evry aspect of the fight. Leaving not one round to Franklin. His jab was phenomenal, he countered evrry shot landed by Franklin, lead the fight the whole round, landed multiple inside uppercut while useinf his size. Franklin just got a beard on him.  A necessary 12 rounds with perfect footwork, movement, power shots, jab and no sign of gas tank. Aj is well adjusting to the boxer puncher style.
It really shows how much "brilliant AJ!" wasn't just some bozos comment...but indicative of much of his image, his team and his fans. I genuinely don't think the dude has a hope in hell. He doesn't seem to have anyone around him to keep him honest. Probably also why he walks around in such a daze. With half of boxing who seemingly can't stand him and half made of "men" who seem to want to fellate him any chance they get. I hear his entourage is made up of similar clowns who all seem to live vicariously through him.  This wasn't a good performance. It just wasn't. Cherry picking power punches from his broadcaster with which he has an exclusive deal won't make it a good performance either. What I don't get is why his fans keep insisting his last few performances warrant so much praise. You idiots only end up getting disappointed every time.   Again, I think this also applies to reddit. One thing I've noticed here is how many people just...don't like good things. Or at least will take a subpar thing packaged to them well. Life lesson for you. Whatever pick most of reddit tells you to go with, **GO IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.** Joshua was sold as some nice guy, good looking protagonist that the average dork could get behind. As anyone with a brain knows, media darlings rarely ever turn out to make much of a legacy for themselves in this sport. He isn't what you thought he was and likely won't be. Just stop with the fucking pathetic threads trying to convince us and yourselves that he is.
Franklin established himself as a solid gatekeeper. Like Chisora or Takam. He will get fights now.
Agreed. I've watched the fight highlights several times and thought Joshua looked good. I really liked that he was looking fresh and mobile in the final rounds. He didn't gas. Bring on Fury and give us the fight we need this summer!
In the post match thread all the bums said he was finished just cause there was no KO. Apparently wilder who still can’t box that well and has less big wins is better
I disagree with some of this, especially that he has shown he's good at adapting.  He really hasn't, it was clear he had to rough Usyk up in part 2 and instead he just tinkered with his original plan and lost again.  All that said, yes, AJ is getting unwarranted criticism.  He wasn't served well by Hearn in putting him in against someone that, due to his chin and quick hands, was never going to be a showcase win for AJ.  But he won handily.  Lewis struggled even more against an even less proven contender in Zelko Mavrovic (sp); all ATGs have fights like that.  And AJ IS an ATG.  His resume stacks up well with HWs in the top 20 to 30 ATG ballpark.  And I think he would be the overwhelming favorite against all but about 5 other HWs right now.  Having said all that, the top end of this division really is stacked.  People hate to hear it, because they aren't fighting each other and have various other qualities that are disagreeable, but you've got another 3 HWs who have established a legacy comparable or better than AJs, and all look likely to beat him right now, and another in Joyce who hasn't proven himself to that extent yet, but has shown enough to give good reason to pick over AJ.
Fury’s tune ups are Sefer Seferi and Francisco Pianeta.  AJ takes on this Franklin cat, who, while not on the level of a Joyce, is definitely a risk
I dont think it was a bad fight at all, and he did well. But the fight does show that he just isnt a killer anymore, he could absolutely have knocked him out.
AJ wasn’t bad, but he wasn’t good either. He played it way too safe. And it was so boring(imo)
Watching the live thread peoples views on the fight were so damn different and I think I see the divide, people who expect so damn much from AJ and people who maybe expect too little, then there’s people inbetween who’ll just find it boring.   I come from the category of expecting too little because I KNEW he wouldn’t look great against an awkward guy with a great chin, so best thing he could do is just grab the win.
Obviously he looks better when showing just the punches. Everyone's problem is that he's not throwing enough.
Boxed quite a safe and reserved fight. Never felt like he let his hands really go. Still got caught a lot more than I’d like to see. After taking on a top heavyweight twice and losing, he’s still billed and marketed as being top 4 in the world along with Usyk, Fury and Wilder. This performance did not give me that impression. I get the impression he either doesn’t know what he wants to be, or has decided he wants to be a very technically proficient boxer like Usyk, but the shoe doesn’t fit.
Something I feel like I've noticed lately is how Joshua often throws from slightly too far back, so he falls into his punch and has to reset.
Who?
Perfectly summarised.  Another performance like that and no-one is even going to want to see him against a top guy.
I call this iteration "White Glove AJ". He's trying to be too pristine, too perfect, instead of using the incredible gifts he has in size and power.
TBH Joshua had Usyk visibly hurt in the late rounds of their 2nd match. Problem I see with AJ is lack of commitment after connecting and playing it overly safe. Ever since his lost to Ruiz, it seems like AJ is afraid to get hit.   Unpopular opinion: I think both Wilder and Fury can beat Usyk via TKO/KO.
Yep
Long way of saying, 'I would have said "he lost it mentally" even if he lifted Franklin off the ground. I hate aj and evrything he does. Look at my other posts.'
This is a good summary I reckon.   What’s the thought on AJ having an opponent that winds him up.  Can he be wound up?  I’m thinking that AJ may need to forced out of his current ways….he’s thinking way too much. If he goes in with Dillian Whyte would Dillian be able to wind him up and make him snap? Make him lose his cool?  I don’t think AJ is boxing badly but he’s so obviously boxing within himself and just not letting go. I wonder if he were to be pissed off by Dillian Whyte, who in more ways than the other options on the cards right now, Is his contemporary - dat London ting and the history of their previous fights. Dillian and AJ are so we’ll known to each other. More than with any other opponent I can imagine AJ thinking “I’m gonna smash him”. He’s definitely not gonna suddenly unleash if he’s in with fury. Fury being such a talented boxer would have AJ more tense, more unwilling to let go.
I genuinely think he should swap some muscle for straight up fat... fat can translate to punching power (its still mass x acceleration = power) - plus the benefit is its not the same oxygen drain, and may help with punch resistance also. Remember how Fury looked vs Wilder 3... those shots he took were more devastating than anything he took in Wilder 1, but he didn't lose consciousness from them like the way he did in Wilder 1.
I pretty much agree with all you have written, but, maybe this is what AJ needs. Lennox took his time rebuilding after his defeats and he is now regarded as one of the goats.   He's in his 30s now, and we all slow down as we age. I'm hoping he fights a few lower level opponents, gets a good understanding of what his stamina can maintain during those fights and goes on to push those limits. If he can do that, I want to see him face off against Fury, Wilder and Joyce
He can't beat a bowl of custard
While I agree with a lot of this and feel a lot of people are badly underestimating AJ, there is no way he deserved to get the nod on a judges scorecard in the Usyk rematch
My problem with AJ is not that he's no longer "got it", I really think he has and I don't think he's necessarily "lost it", I just feel like his last fights have been more defence first affairs after his loss to Ruiz (though I would personally argue its sorta been that way since Parker). That's fine, but when he's built his career as a finisher who I would argue had better KO wins on his record in comparison to Wilder (hell, he also had a 100% KO record before Parker), he no longer looks like that guy, and I sorta want to see that again.   Hell, I would love to see him in there with Jerell Miller just in the hope that we can see Roadman Femi again, if anyone can bring out that aggression, it will be Miller.... Just so long as we get some "drug testing" going on. By this I mean the only drug testing there is is someone pees in a cup and someone just goes "looks good to me", because there's no way Miller will pass a drugs test, but deep down, I still think AJ comfortably KOs him 😆. If anything the PEDs will give Miller a fighting chance 😆😆
Bruh, what is this?   People downplay the Ruiz 2 win because funnily enough he was far, far out of shape. He got way too complacent and thought it'd be a repeat.  And I'm sorry, but thinking he deserved a nod from one of the judges in Usyk 2 is a joke lmao.
The division, for some reason, has just become insanely deep. I would not feel confident with my money betting against Fury, Wilder, Joyce in an AJ fight. And there is nothing to make me believe guys like Hrgovic, Ruiz, Dubois or Sanchez wouldn't be an off night away from a win either.   Ask someone who actually knows about the sport, or preferably has been in a ring. Not some idiot hearniac feeding shite he hears from IFLTV back to you. I was speaking to my coach yesterday and we were talking about the fight. He seemed tentative, slow and lethargic. As someone mentioned he seems more concerned with not losing than winning. In a division this deep with unified belts, it doesn't make his options that great.  Retirement may sound ridiculous but judging from the outbursts it doesn't seem like he may be able to adjust to not being the most watched British boxer.   >My point is this. Joshua has faced adversity twice in two different scenarios and on both occasions he has proved that his initial game plan was not correct and made the necessary adjustments to markedly improve from the first fights.  I mean this is just...wrong. Joshua is a gameplan fighter. He would likely tell you that himself.
a big part of it is he wont get that same level of reverence and admiration as he once had. thats fine for most boxers but now that ajs had that taste he might not have the motivation when people firmly believe he's not one of the best heavyweights.
ruiz normally fights around 260, he was 268 or 269 for the first fight because of late notice, in the rematch he was over 280 after training. He was outta shape is an understatement. Joshua should fight him again at some point bc their 1-1 against one another
So if you are asking, no I don’t think he is a potential world champion.   He is an elite heavyweight no doubt. But he fights the same way he fought for the London Olympics 10 years ago. No evolution, no adaptation. It just won’t be enough against Fury or Usyk.  Don’t get me wrong that was a solid win. Franklin fought the fight of his life. He was much better than I thought he would be. He had heart and really quick hands.  However in this fight I have not seen Joshua progress in the area that stops him from beating Fury or Usyk : inside fighting.  He fought Franklin just like he fought Usyk. Long and safe on paper, great jabbing and some combos when the the other guy stays static. He fought in his usual very classic, very amateur/olympic style boxing. No much feinting or trapping.  Inside he was still giving away free shots to the smaller fighter when entering and exiting. He has a great uppercut yet he does not throw it well from up close. He was still backing up in a straight line, he was still not using his size to smother and slow Franklin down.  It’s good, but it’s the same old recipe every time. It’s good, but not good enough to be champion again.
I think it comes down the the bait and switch with Joshua that his fanbase can see or wants to ignore.    Up to Ruiz the Joshua that was sold to everyone was a guy with decent overall skills and a great right hand. So what everyone was looking for was him continuing to creatively develop in other areas and create new ways to set up the right.  He was a skies the limit KO Machine, and tried to get Ruiz out of there with some great work up until it wasn't.   Since Ruiz, he's a different fighter. He's just an outboxer.  And his skills, and maybe stamina, as just an outboxer aren't good enough to be considered at the top of the division, and I don't know that they'll ever get there. Before, he was no gervonta davis, but the idea was that he'd take solid skills and use them to set up big punches.  Now he's like a late stage Luke Campbell, good enough to stay in the mix but doesn't sellout for power, and isn't active enough in the ring to beat the better boxers of the division.   He doesn't even have the Puncher's chance that Wilder has anymore.
Everything your saying is correct, it’s just a lot easier for boxing fans to chalk things up to absolutes. People tend to miss or simple ignore nuance. Which is good if you know this and want to bet lol
This is why AJ gets hate.  His personality and some of the other things can be offputting but he was still a massive KO artist.  It's the shills and stans that make people push back against AJ the ATG bs.  &#x200B;  Just full on  don't believe your lying eyes or the scales, Ruiz wasn't fatter than usual and AJ fought Usyk close.....delusional shit that makes it hard for people who even like AJ to support.  He's shown some improvements technically but he's regressed tactically as a finisher and in his ability to apply aggression and power punching, ever since Ruiz broke him.
I'd say AJ is mid level contender but two things:  - Ruiz was horrifically out of shape in the rematch and was probably the worst professional performance I have on memory.  - AJ did not perform any better in the Usyk rematch. I'd argue Usyk performed worse but I think people just waayyy overhyped the few good moments AJ had. People also mistook Usyk rushing back a few times to get to safety as these near-KOs or dominance which they really weren't.  I think AJ would beat Wilder though.
I agree that Joshua was probably the best version of himself in the second Usyk fight, but he seems to have lost the bloodlust, that killer edge it takes to finish someone. Unfortunately it's in his head more than anything else and that's the hardest part to get right.
You’re living in some kind of fantasy world man. Don’t take it from some random guy on Reddit either. Here’s an article from a decent boxing writer, Kevin Iole.   https://sports.yahoo.com/anthony-joshua-faces-perilous-future-after-so-so-performance-in-win-over-jermaine-franklin-233428962.html
Lmao AJ did not deserve a split in the second Usyk fight he had literally one little glimpse of success
>someone's a bit sensitive  Again, why is this dudes fanbase so insanely sensitive???  They're like teenage girls 🤣
You could consider Franklin at like the number 10 spot if you’re in the camp that thought he beat Whyte
Franklin moves like a polished boxer. His footwork is on point when he flurries, moving. He counters everytime he eats something.
What you're missing is AJ used to lean evrything on his power punches and empty his whole tank out trying to knock people out. He paid the price for that style and look how they treated him.  Now he's boxing, throwing power punches and stepping back into defense, managing pace and finishing evrry round dominating. And look they still treat him.  For contrast, if you look at Usyk career, he barely punched to score points. And in all 2 of the AJ fight probay didn't land even two of these kinda 20-30 punches that AJ landed on Franklin. And people scream 'DOMINATION!!! ALMOST KNOCKED HIM OUT'  So what gives?
> it looks weaker and he isn't punching all the way through   Thats true. He's stopped over committing. Slowly, the power will increase again with more ring experience with the new style.
I don't think just trading all the time is the sign of a good fighter. He's just maturing.
You must not have been around boxing for a while. Ali, Leonard/Hearns/Duran, De La Hoya got the same scrutiny.
Really? It was much better than Fury vs Wallin fight. AJ won a wide decision. Pretty easily.   And please give me one active heavyweight that's got a better resume than AJ right now.
Him vs Jared Anderson is the fight to make
AJ is not an ATG just STOP IT
It’s crazy to me how AJ fans keep insisting he needs to fight bum after bum to get his confidence back before he even thinks about stepping in the ring with top-level fighters again. If that’s really the case, what exactly is he bringing to the table? How on earth can he be considered as being anywhere near the top 5 himself?
Oh god don’t mention his power…
Yeah I think you're bang on about AJ, he's scared to be the juggernaut he can be. He's waaaay too afraid to get hit now and it's painfully obvious.   I don't think the Usyk comment is unreasonable. Those 2 guys will actually push for the KO. I think Wilder touches him at least once with his right and it's night night. And the fury fight goes the way of Mikey Garcia vs Spence. The bigger skilled guy beats the smaller skilled guy.
>Unpopular opinion: I think both Wilder and Fury can beat Usyk via TKO/KO.  Personally I think Usyks wins against AJ will end up being more that AJ was on the steep decline. After that Franklin fight I only felt this was reinforced.  Usyk won't beat the top 3 at HW who are Wilder, Fury and Joyce.
I realise its now embarrassing to defend the guy but i kinda think Fury would be happy to fight Usyk if he wasn't fighting for an entire nation.   Fury might not want that kind of motivation in the ring against him and be thinking maybe he waits a year and hopes that's all over with by then.
I actually like AJ.  Kinda soured on him a bit since he started acting like a goon after the fights, but it's gotta sting being THE guy at HW and then crashing down as hard as he has.  Dude wants to be Lennox Lewis, but in reality is Frank Bruno.  Which, hey, Frank Bruno had a good career, was champ, and made some money.  Lots of guys would love to have a career like Frank Bruno.    I'd love to hear a refutation of my points instead of a passive-aggressive diss because you're an AJ stan.  I'm willing to have my mind changed.
Sensible man, he's got everything against him in those fights. Also like you say , wouldn't be at all surprised if he lost to the others you mentioned.  He's got enough heart to continue boxing, but it's almost like he'd be in his element fighting ex MMA fighters or something. He wants to look good,  bloke needs his mojo back.
> I mean this is just...wrong. Joshua is a gameplan fighter. He would likely tell you that himself.  How can you say it's just wrong, when you aren't saying anything different. His gameplan was different in the second fight from the first, what about that is "wrong".  He also showed ability to adjust in the Usyk fight, mid fight. It's just Usyk is even better at that. Showing that ability against the most talented fighter out there is hardly nothing.
You say that but that’s because the odds on AJ are generally short. I’d fancy him to beat Wilder, Joyce, Hrgovic, Dubois, Sanchez and i think Fury is probably a 50/50 and i’m a good and profitable boxing gambler. I certainly wasn’t backing him to smash Frankin because he had shown against Whyte he is durable and tough and likely to go the distance. I think it was a good performance although yes some hesitancy in finishing him that he wouldn’t have shown earlier on in his career but by the same token he’s learnt not to go flying in and be reckless.
Ruiz has been all over the place. 269 is within the normal range for him.  And his problem in the second fight isn’t that he was fat. He’s always fat. His problem is that he fought the same fight he always does. He didn’t do anything different. He didn’t adjust.  And literally everyone knew that AJ needed to come in there and control the distance. That’s precisely what AJ did, and Ruiz had no plan for it.  And Ruiz had been lackluster since. There’s no reason for a third fight at this time. It would end just like the last one did.
I think you’re spot on with the expectation that Joshua gave everyone leading up to the Ruiz fight.  But what I disagree with is that he has somehow changed his style, that he is not this big hitter anymore. People forget that after his tactical victory in the Ruiz rematch, Joshua brutally knocked Pulev out.  For me, it’s about levels and boxing styles. Joshua was able to steamroll opponents at the beginning of his career, naturally because he was levels above them in almost all areas. Now, Joshua is facing world class opponents, so it is fair to expect he should not be KO’ing everyone. And Joshua more than any other boxer I’ve known talks about the “sweet science”. He is not driven by knockout victories, even when this obviously makes him a bit more boring and frustrating to watch these days.  I don’t know why people think Franklin is someone who should have been knocked out. My impression of him is someone who is very dangerous and can take a shot, so Joshua quite rightly took this challenge seriously. I predict no one knocks Franklin out in his career.
Usyk just looked older so he didn't have as much energy to expend
What on earth are you talking about
Lmao you a Kevin Iole fan now? Mfers will go to any length to grab the straws and branches as they take their Ls 😂😂
I would like to see him fight Wilder, Fury or Joyce next, but even people on his inner circle are saying his performance was subpar and if he fights Fury today he loses so I think he's just gonna take another tune up, I'm not sure why they're trying to sell us his last fight as some elite vs elite brilliant performance.
It's a cult
I was shocked at the hype Joshua walked out to. The place was absolutely bouncing, off two losses and that cringe speech on the mic to round it all off. Never seen that before. Fans are sensitive but they’re somehow still fully behind him.
So Franklin is an elite heavyweight now?
Exactly, if you thought he beat whyte, and I didn’t, then he 100% should be considered a top 10 fighter in anyone’s resume
I swear every boxer that Joshua Fights, they consider them elite… prior to even accepting this fight, Joshua goes on record to say he wants to fight 3 times this year, one of the opponents be wilder, and all too guys.. then moments later Franklin is announced…   Then somehow he deserves a title shot? Ridiculous he calls out Fury after that performance. Why not fight Wilder like he mentioned?
Tbh I would have liked him to remain with Robert Garcia.   He looked much better in that second fight with Usyk even though he lost.  Another camp with Garcia could have brought out even more from him imho.
I didn’t say that. All I’m saying in summary is that he’s lost that confidence.
Also, I was 8 when hearns had his last fight. And I wasn't even a sperm when Ali and Leonard finished their careers. My comment is based on current active boxers.
Are they active? No. Irrelevant.
>Really? It was much better than Fury vs Wallin fight. AJ won a wide decision. Pretty easily.   No it wasn't.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.badlefthook.com/platform/amp/2019/9/15/20866648/fury-vs-wallin-scorecards-see-how-judges-scored-fight-espn-boxing-news  Wallin barely won a round in his fight, despite the cut. And Wallin is competitive, I don't think Franklin has wins over someone like of Breazeale.  As I keep saying, this seems like Macgregor all over again. His team and followers are fucking delusional and losing touch with reality. The moment I make a negative AJ comment, its downvoted. There aren't anymore boxing fans, just cuckolds and weirdos. And it's fucking odd seeing people so desperate to make him into something he's not. Every fighter has off nights. Accept it and move on, why this desperate need to convince everyone of some narrative?
Well, Usyk got 3 belts and Fury 1, so, those guys.
Yea, Martin and miller are in the mix outside of the top Americans: wilder and Ruiz.
Stop being irrational.  This always happens with ATGs in their primes, it's absurd to call them ATGs until they've retired and people realize they were.  Can't we be rational and understand he is there?  Quick comp of two consensus top 25 ATGs.  Equal or better best win than Bowe (Wlad is better than Holyfield, but was less prime).  Not as good 2nd best win, but close (Let's say Povetkin is #2, not nearly as good as Holyfield but Bowe gets dinged a bit cause he already beat him).  #3 Let's say Hide for Bowe and Whyte for AJ.  Slight advantage AJ.  #4 Let's say Donald for Bowe and Ruiz for AJ.  Slight ad antage AJ.  #5 maybe Tubbs for Bowe and Parker for AJ.  Solid advantage AJ.  Pulev, Takam, Braezale, Martin and even Franklin are considerably better than anyone you want to slot in those spots for Bowe.  The rest of their win resume is comparable.  All told, if resume was wins alone, AJ would already be higher than Bowe.  His losses to Ruiz and Usyk drop him below Bowe, but Bowe had a loss and 2 shitty "wins" against Golota, which hurt his resume more than help it.  Bowe still gets the edge for me, but its close.  Meanwhile, AJ has better top level wins than Patterson, and his losses aren't as bad.  I'm still not willing to put him over Patterson at this point, but you can make a good argument I should.  I could go on but I'm bored.  If you want to be irrational about it go ahead, but he's clearly in the top 30 of all time HWs and a look at the record of other top heavyweight around 25 level shows it.
I've been arguing this for so long.  He was never as good as his resume suggests. His best win is Klitschko that was over 40 and was coming off a loss. He collected belts like Pokémon cards from paper champions. Brezeale, Martin, Parker.   He's lost against the first real, hungry fighter he faced. Then they got complacent and he got his belts back.  Then he lost against the first actual great he faced in Usyk.  It's amazing how his career mirrors that of Tyson.  Knock out/destroy bums for a couple of years, become champion and have all the hype. Have that solidified by being fed a legend. Get beaten by someone they should have no business losing against. Never have the fights made against the other big names and then when it is, the level is obvious and he loses.  That's where we are.
> he's scared to be the juggernaut he can be  ..because he's seen that its not enough. A stronger willed person would stick with it, get some great wins, and accept that he might lose a few. AJ is shitting himself over getting K.O'd.
Fury playing mind games with Fury. It's glaringly obvious he wants to retire with lineal. Nothing else
Lol. Keep waiting, bro. I thought your analysis was reasoned and spot on (AND I WANT AJ TO RETURN AND FIGHT THE BEST).
Bruno fought Tyson and Lewis, AJ hasn't fought Wilder or Fury. Big difference.
Every Brit/European that's an avid hater, *by advid hater I mean their last 20-30 posts in their comment history being scathing blind crusade of hate and anger and mocking*, when approached or checked by a post contrasting their claims always says the same thing, "I ackchually want AJ to win. I ackchually like AJ. I just don't like his persona. I don't like his shorts."  Why? If you're gonna out of your way and be disingenuous and crusade end of Earth slandering him, ***at least*** be genuine in your hate and say you don't like him.
In that when the gameplan falls apart, he relies on his coaches to help him adapt.
You weren't backing him against Franklin and yet do so against Joyce and Wilder and expect me to take you seriously?
Oddsmakers would have Joyce and Wilder as the favorites, and Fury as a HEAVY favorite
I think if Ruiz was fit and motivated he would have destroyed Joshua again.  That was a terrible fight. Old AJ is happy to get the bare minimum done, even if it's not pretty. He's content with that. No champion has this mentality.
Yeah this isn't true.  He was even fatter in the rematch hence the career high in weight.  He fought the same fight he always does, just ta a lower pace with even less movement because he didn't train and was in even worse shape than usual.  Oh and a very large ring and a Wlad era ref to ensure everything was setup to help AJ execute a jab and grab, backfoot gameplan and hurt Ruiz's chances.  &#x200B;  Put AJ vs Ruiz III in a small ring with a ref who isn't going to break clinches so quickly and will allow some roughhousing, and there's plenty of reason to think new look AJ could lose to a Ruiz that trained.
Joshua faced tougher boxers earlier on barring Usyk.  My gut is that the Joshua from four years ago, knocks out the Joshua from today and that's a weird trajectory for a career to take.
Or AJ was hitting the body more?
Read the article?
Hes not a bad writer. You might feel different but he’s been around for a long time. What am i taking an L on, exactly?
I think its because Joshua is the only fighter who tries to appease the wider audience. Guys like Fury and Wilder are either assholes or just don't give a shit and guys like Joyce aren't marketable. These are manfans not boxing fans.
Whyte is considered top 10 so why couldn’t Franklin be considered top 10 if he beat him? I still have to watch the fight to see if he actually did win but point being is Franklin couldd be considered a top 10. Not like Joshua chose a horrible opponent for a come back fight.
AJ -> Whyte, Klitschko,  Povetkin, Parker, Ruiz, Usyk   Fury -> Whyte, Klitschko, Wilder  Wilder -> Ortiz, Fury  Who do you think deserves title shots here...
Hearn said AJ would fight the winner of Whyte-Franklin. Franklin was the more impressive fighter that night. His performance against AJ affirms that.  Whyte would’ve been slept by a couple of those shots that Franklin ate.
Mayweather was heavily critiqued, but he kept winning so the haters had no choice to shut up in the end. Nobody cares about AJ outside the UK, this sub is just an echo chamber.
Still waiting for a reply to this. In what way did Fury perform any worse than Joshua? Especially considering Wallin is way more live a dog.
 Wilder had that belt a while ago. Did that mean he had the best resume?
1. Wlad was 100 years old. Holyfield was PRIME 2. Povetkin was also 100 years old  3. Hide was better than Whyte 4. Donald was better than Ruiz 5. Tubbs was better than Parker   That version was golota would steamroll AJ  The biggest knock against AJ is he hasn’t fought wilder or fury. At least Bowe fought holyfield. He would be AJ if he fought wilder or fury, but he hasn’t fought either and it doesn’t seem he ever will. Which is sad because he would get respect for trying.
Usyk is arguably better than Tyson
Nah.  I ackchually do like AJ.  Just, ya know, the version of him that was fearless and was a wrecking ball who tore through guys.    If I hated AJ I'd just do like a lot of other people here and shit on him, not offer any reasoned critique of his fighting, and move on.  The British boxer I hate is Fury.  Guy is a fucking liar, a cheat, a clown, a ducker, and has the thinnest fucking resume of all-time.  As an American, I never really understood all the hate gypsies get, but if Fury is their shining example I kind of get it.  Fuck that inbred freak.  Fuck his loser father.  And fuck all his no-account brothers who try riding his coattails.  See?  That's how you post about a guy you hate.  AJ?  No hate.  He made one small mistake against Ruiz and it cost him and then he went up against a sure-fire 1st ballot HoFer and ATG in Usyk.    The problem is, I, the supposed AJ hater, actually have more confidence in AJ than AJ does.  He takes a freak loss and then can't beat the PFP #1 who even Fury is too afraid to fight.  There ain't no shame in that.  So why switch up your entire fighting style?  You got to the top by being an aggressive pressure fighter.  Stay an aggressive pressure fighter.  If, for whatever reason, you can't do that and just HAVE to try and be this slick boxer?  Drop the fucking weight!  Stop coming in at 250 pounds looking like you just need to get oiled up to win Mr. Olympia!
That wasn't what the person you replied to was talking about though. What they said wasn't wrong.  And AJ adapted in the middle of the first Usyk fight - did you hear his corner that fight? They didn't help him do anything.
I said to smash Franklin (win by KO) and i haven’t specified with Joyce or Wilder either. I’d expect Joshua to have a much better chance against both with his recent style than his previous reckless attacking style.
What is a “fit ruiz”? Honestly?  That’s like talking about a flying dog. Theoretically possible but no one’s ever seen one
What champion has Joshua's mentality then haha
Ruiz looked laughable in the first fight for the first 2 and a bit rounds. No version of Ruiz would ever beat AJ, without AJ being stupid and making a mistake.  The first fight came down to one punch, everything after that was just that punch still. He caught AJ and he never recovered. You deserve to win if you do that, but it was AJ that gave him that not Ruiz doing anything.
He wasn’t at a career high in weight, nice try.  And Ruiz is never fast on his feet. He’s a plodder. Watch any fight. Whether he’s 250 or 280, he’s not timing anyone down.  And you can come up with whatever favorable scenario you want to. If my uncle has tits he’d be my aunt. Everyone knew what AJ would try and do. Ruiz did nothing to prepare for it. That’s his fault, not the refs.  You don’t get bonus points for being lazy and one dimensional. AJ beats Ruiz 9/10 because he’s longer, more agile, more well rounded, and can actually adapt.
Maybe but to me it looked like age
AJ just showed he's adjusted to his gameplan fighting style w no gas tank problem even though he's at career high and filled into hsi boxer puncher style, dominating a young HW w great skills. And you have to double down on how TERRRIBLE AJ is by downplaying everytime someone says something vindicating.
Jermaine is ranked #34 last time I checked  https://boxrec.com/en/box-pro/716569
Don’t forget Pulev.  That’s an underrated win.
Lol that's not it. Whyte has more power so he was considered too risky.
Yeah but Hearn talks out of his ass a lot.   Joshua himself said he wanted to fight 3 times a year with Wilder being the one fighter he wanted to fight.. then proceeds to fighting a can. Then once the franklin Vs Whyte fight happened, Hearn started to talk…   I’m just saying, if you want a fight then make it happen. Stop being protected by Eddie Hearn and taking these dumb ass fights, cause then you end up looking like a fool when you’re requesting a crack at the title after fighting a can
When Wilder and AJ were the champions they were #1 and #2, sure.
He's nothing to be afraid of though. Tyson came to take your head off. Usyk is a CRUISERWEIGHT. Great heavyweights, even good heavyweights shouldn't lose to cruiserweights.
lol no. Usyk is not even better than Michael Spinks.
Standing in front of Wilder is a sure fire way fo get punched in the face and I'm not exactly sure whether Joshua's stamina issues have been rectified to make him a sound bet against Joyce. But hey, ain't my money.
An improvement on the ruiz that fought AJ the 1st time. The one that kicked his arse all over the place, Remember?
I'm waiting
I think he and klitschko have a very similar mindset tbh
In reality AJ is 1 out of 2 because he's chinny and can't always dictate ring size and refs.  But hey nice try with the delusion about 9 out of 10.    That Ruiz was out of shape impacts his ability to throw volume and wear down AJ.
“Dominating a young HW w great skills”  Really, man?
He had no problem with his stamina because he barely moved all night and didn’t even attempt to throw combinations. What is this nonsense😂
Boxrec is boxrec. The simple point I was trying to make is Franklin could’ve been considered top 10 if he got the decision against Whyte and he’s not a horrible pick for a come back performance
He was ancient
No it isn’t
Obviously the fight we all want to see in Usyk.   —Joshua fought Povetkin when he was almost 40 years old and past his prime… 6 years AFTER Povetkin fought Klitschko.  —Parker had not really fought any top opposition his whole career.. toughest match up prior to Joshua was Andy Ruiz and won.. but Parker has also lost to Dillian Whyte…  —Dillian Whyte got TKO’D by a 40 year old Povetkin and granite he came back and beat him.. pretty much beats the remains of Anthony Joshua…  —Klitschko was way past his prime  — Andy Ruiz embarrassed Joshua in the states and then requested a rematch in Saudi Arabia. Ruiz unfortunately came in out of shape and Joshua just played it safe and jabbed him the whole fight   —Usyk showed Joshua there are levels to boxing and size doesn’t matter. Mentally broke down Joshua, had Joshua talking out of his ass in the post fight. Hip Hip
It is. Pulev's got an insane chin. But he was declining.
The only risk with Whyte is that he suffers lasting damage from being so washed.
Or, he’s coming off back to back losses, is on his third trainer in as many fights, and took on a tougher opponent than some other top heavyweights face.  Franklin would probably be a top 3 win for Wilder. And it’s pretty rich, to me, that so many people give Fury credit for beating Chisora (who has honestly lost to just about everyone) because he’s a tough fight while criticizing AJ for using Franklin (who has shown himself to be tough) as a bounce back.  This fight was more justified than Fury-Chisora 3, and more worthwhile than Wilder-Helenius.   But it’s easy to shit on AJ, so here we are.
Wilder? Lmao. With wins over legends like Stiverne?
He's a different type of cruiser and I recall Holyfeild beating his fair share of heavyweights
Who knows how good Joyce is? He needs to make a big step up before being in the conversation. A decent but not great record.
I just don’t think we’ve seen anything from Ruiz’s career to suggest that a 265lb Andy can keep up with any agile fighter who is keeping him at range. Even at the weight he’s been best at in his career he couldn’t do it  Sure we can make up hypotheticals about a 240lb ruiz but no one has any idea how that man would fight and we’ll never know because we’ll never see it  And when he did fight at 256 vs Arreola he didn’t look anything special
Klitschko had a thudding jab at least
I guess, he thought some crappy fights also eh. In a weak era. I used to dislike the Klitschkos in a similar manner. Stank up boxing
I just counted **48**, FOURTY EIGHT AJ slander posts in your comment history. Consecutively.  StillLBC is Still on AJ Cock.
So you're putting Franklin above Sanchez, Hrgovic, Zhang, Anderson to name a few?
Let's break down Fury's wins like this. He literally has no wins except one. Klitschko. And he didn't have the mental fortitude to show up for a rematch.         And a Wilder who's never ever been tested against elite opposition.
But he has power unlike Franklin
huh? Who were your #1 and #2 back when AJ and Wilder were champions?
Yes but great heavyweights like Bowe and Lewis took care of Holyfield
Including Tyson.  Edit: sorry for stating the obvious.
Also not sure i’d back him against Wilder but i’d go 55/45 in AJ’s favour and it’d be massively odds dependant. You don’t make money making absolute statements and backing regardless of odds. If Wilder fave i’d go AJ and if Wilder by KO was at good odds i’d have some of that. I’d actually LOVE to see that fight.
There is no step up. If you're not aware how good Joyce is by now then you have no idea what you're watching. Who currently other than Wilder and Fury would be a serious step up for him?   This is what amuses me about the average person who believes Joshua is this great boxer. Its mostly from rubbish sold by Hearn and bullshit rankings.
I'd say Parker, Takam and Dubois have a pretty good idea how good he is, since he stopped all 3.  If we're going off of recent performances, Joyce walks down AJ and bruks him up. But you don't have to worry about that happening because Hearn isnt gonna let Joyce anywhere near AJ
He stopped Parker who gave AJ some trouble
Ok just not worse shape than the fight he won.
he becomes more and more like a watered down klitschko every time I see him. from the safety first approach, he’s clinching a lot more now even his ring entrance to usyk 1 and the way he stood in the ring  during the fighter introductions was like a klitschko knock off.
You’re a weirdo, that’s for sure. Most of those were in the fight thread
Yep. This is how it works. When you fight Joshua you suddenly become a top 10.
Both Zhang & Franklin should have lost to Jerry springer so it ain't unfair to put Zhang & Franklin in the same tier of fighter (personally got them in the 11-20 bracket)
Power AJ has already felt.   And he can’t use that power lying face down on the canvas.
AJ fans put Wilder down to boost AJ. That's why I wish they would fight so Wilder could KO him and shut his teenage fans up forever.
Holyfeild also beat Bowe and was pretty much shot already against Lewis.
I don’t think Joshua is a great boxer. I do think Joyce has never beaten a top heavyweight. A step up would be even be somebody like Whyte or Ruiz but definitely Fury, Usyk, Wilder, AJ. As i say he is going to beat your Parker’s etc but he wouldn’t beat the top guys.
Or Wilder for that matter, and probably not Fury either
Parker, Takam and Dubois. Thanks for the laugh. And what chance would the big robot have against Usyk or Fury?
Or Joshua ko's Joyce cause ya know Joyce is rediculously hittable
He was in a full on knockdown against Arreola. Dude.
Yeah I don’t think a 268lb fighter with slow feet can keep up with an agile fighter who is fighting in a disciplined manner and keeping him at range
This is what some of us pick up on, and goes right over the others heads.
I'm a weirdo? Lmaoo. Sure LBC. You're on AJ dick more than Khan wife.
To his fans maybe
It’s still enough that Hearn was too spooked to put him in
I didn't say Wilder was better, I just said they were #1 and #2 when they reigned the division.
Lost 2 out of 3 to Bowe. That’s the difference between aj and those guys
You rate Ruiz and Whyte that much above Parker? OK I guess.
You already know I agree with that lol  The shills have been insufferable lately Hearn must be cutting some big checks to some social media company.   ["AJ #1! Franklin is top 10!"](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3c/9f/21/3c9f21058d7e36597e6d07abbec201ed.jpg)
You asked   >Who knows how good Joyce is?  And I gave you 3 top ten hws that he's stopped.   I never claimed he could beat Fury or Usyk that's silly, he loses both those fights.
What happens in boxing, you new to this?
You can think what you like tbf I do
Stalker.
Sure
Agree
Mike Tyson was a very dedicated fighter who was never tempted by vices. Extremely tall for his weight class, he was also vegetarian and swore against eating any kind of meat, even human.
Sonny Liston is raised in a caring household with a loving father. He isn't forced to work long hours on a farm. He does not run away from home. He does not meet any shady mafia members. He does not learn how to box. He is a man incapable of causing harm to others. A man adored and respected by his local Philadelphia  community. Most importantly, he finally gets the love he desired.
John Fury is a kind, calm soul who once met an old visually impaired friend at a car auction and generously bought him glasses.
Floyd Mayweather Jr is a 0-50 journeyman that turns up to lose, he goes off the nickname TWE(The Worst Ever)  Deontay Wilder took up basketball route and is now an NBA player that is looking to fight on a Misfits card against WWE wrestler Tyson Fury and Mr Olympia winner Anthony Joshua  Luis Ortiz KO'd Wilder, Joseph Parker KO'd Anthony Joshua and so undisputed is now between Ortiz and Parker  Usyk is actually a middleweight that is being avoided
Adding on to yours, OP:  Luis Ortiz is officially 18 years old, but his youth is highly undocumented (no elementary school records, no high school records, etc) and it's possible he's as young as 12 or 13. There are rumors he's even younger--7 or 8--but took hormones to induce an early puberty.  Tyson Fury is known for his integrity, he is a man of his word. One of his more light-hearted nicknames is "Superman" because he never lies. At times, he's even prematurely spilled out truths about fight negotiations. He's also whistleblown on certain boxing criminals. He comes from a family of well-respected judges and lawyers.
Dillian Whyte is undefeated, and is famous for his devastating uppercut
Charles Martin walks this earth like an average person
Roberto Duran, a man known for denying gender expectations and fighting against toxic masculinity and traditional machismo in boxing, remained dedicated and in shape for the second fight against SRL defeating him in a technical knockout after SRL refused to get up from his chair with the now infamous quote “naw I don’t want to fight them anymore I don’t respect them and I don’t want to fight them anymore”
Amir Khan - the iron-chinned GOAT who never gets into shenanigans outside of the ring, is held back by his slow hands.  Canelo - a tall, lanky, pillow-fisted fighter never seems to get the rub of the green.
Derek Chisora, a highly eloquent and thoughtful man is looking to defend his undefeated record against the undisputed heavyweight champion Charles Martin who reportedly ‘walks the earth like a peasant’.
I wonder what would’ve happened if fury would’ve deservedly lost to McDermott or if wilder would’ve lost to one of the cans that dropped him like sconiers or nichols.   Same with the fury wlad rematch. Wlad was hell bent for that fight and I think he would’ve won.
Joseph Parker is an absolute animal who’s always up for a war.
Following his early KO of Philippine President, Manny “Galaga” Pacquiao, Adrien Broner’s victory was vetoed by the entire hood.
The alternate reality that great power punchers don't fall in love with their power then get too bulky and forget they still have to box and just become stiff and lazy slugs.
Cus D’amato never dies and Mike Tyson continues his win streak for 40 more years before retiring with a record of 15000-0.
I was just thinking about something like this earlier. I was thinking I could see Zhang taking Wilder's place as a big punching champion that has tons of defenses against middling opposition. I hadn't thought about who his conqueror could be though...  Actually, screw it, lets flesh this out further with some lazy analogs. The unified champion could be Kyotaro Fujimoto, and for years a big clash between the two is hyped up but never happens. Taishan Dong dominates Fujimoto and KO's him, which leads to people hyping up an all Chinese heavyweight undisputed fight... which also fails to pass, because Zhang gets outpointed by Clemente Russo.  It's like this reality taken to the extreme with Wilder and AJ's losses switched. Here it's 7'0 vs. 5'11, people talk about Fury and Usyk's differences, imagine the discourse in THAT reality.
Hughie Fury is a heavy handed fitness model
Naoya Inoue realizing that his real dream is to be the very first undisputed HW champion of East Asian decent, turns to the aid of long time family friend James Toney and  faithful Sponsor Burker King in a bid to unsurp the current HW Kingpin Adrien "about dem honyBuns" Broner.
In this alternate universe does Wilder have a good resume?
Muhammad Ali didn't float like a butterfly nor stung like a bee..
/r/boxingcirclejerk
Shit post but I enjoyed reading it. Thumbs up.
The highly viewed former Overwatch League pro turned streamer, Wladimir Klitschko, enters a content creator boxing tournament, but is stopped by Escape from Tarkov streamer Shannon “The Pistol” Briggs. Klitschko never stops trolling Briggs’ stream, calling him out by spamming “whatever you play, I play”  Klitschko has yet to unlock Flea Market.
Even in an alternate reality I expect Luis Ortiz to KO Charles Martin 😅
Terrence Crawford has made great business decisions over the past decade. This, along with his resolute determination fight the very best and most relevant opponents each fight, has resulted in him being extremely popular, a hugely well-known PPV star. He is a genuine household name akin to Tyson or Ali. His star-studded resume unquestioningly puts him at the top of current PPV discussions, he is universally acknowledged to be a top 3 ATG and his humility ensures he continues to fight regularly and keeps seeking the best opposition to ensure his legacy even as he passes his mid-30’s.  Spence was crushed by Crawford years ago and became merely another relatively good win in Bud’s glittering career.
“Luis Ortiz, although 18, is still 134”
Tyson Fury quietly donates almost all of his purses to charity  Martin Bakole is a cardio machine with a terrible jab  Usyk moved down to middleweight  Rolly is, somehow, still the GOAT
After beating AJ to claim the unified WBA (Super), IBF, WBO, and IBO champion belts Andy Ruiz Jr, couldn't keep his weight up and lost his belts. He had to drop down to cruiserweight for the remainder of his career.
andy ruiz jr is a chiseled, technical dominator of the heavyweight division, but the flabby anthony joshua did score a crazy once-in-a-lifetime tko on him
Jarell Miller is the cleanest boxer of all time, enrolls in virtually all anti-doping programs without fail. His statue can be seen at VADA headquarters.  Dillian Whyte is known for his godly chin, never once been knocked down nor wobbled in his entire career. He is known to have exceptionally great defense versus uppercuts, anyone foolish enough to throw one against him ends up on the canvas before long.Also, his B sample never went missing.  Joe Joyce has the slickest Philly shell defense with blazing hand speed, however, he has been let down by his glass chin and non-existent gas tank.   Luiz Ortiz is the mentor of Charles Martin and showed him how to box before the latter created universe. While he was well past his prime, he was still beating up dinosaurs in Triassic period.
Pacquiao was often derided for his boring, plodding style and being a weight bully who cut way below his natural weight class. Nevertheless outside of boxing he would go on to be a very savvy Senator who would legalize gay marriage and ascend to the presidency.
If Ortiz was 18 he’d probably be fighting John L. Sullivan
Though fans hated his lack of showmanship and boring points winning fighting style, Naseem Hamed enjoyed a long and successful championship career due to his work ethic and dedication to keeping himself healthy; earning the nickname "Prince Naseem" from his boxing peers for the noble and respectful manner he treated his fellow competitors in the ring.
ZHANG ZHILEI is the undisputed heavyweight GOAT and has already been inducted into the HOF; he has singlehandedly sealed China as the Mecca of HW boxing and Madison Square Garden fights now take place in the Guandong Olympic Stadium, with ZZ pulling in Africa's entire GDP in terms of PPV
Don't have anything to add but thanks for the entertaining read lol
Nearly all of Haneys fights are won by first round KO. He says he’d like to get more rounds in but his hands of stone prevent him from doing that.
Nikolai Valuev retired as an atg heavyweight champion who was 5 feet tall and 4 get wide. His fragile chin was protected by his incredible reflexes, lightning quick hands and feet and crazy head movement. He also has the best hairline of any boxer ever, and is definitely not buddies with a genocidal, mass murdering autocrat.
In an alternate reality, Vasiliy Lomachenko accepts he has 2 defeats on his resume.     Deontay Wilder and Tyson Fury are best of friends and refuse to face each other in the ring     Terence Crawford is the P4P PPV Face of boxing and is about to face Errol Spence for the 5th time in 3 years in Vegas for a record breaking 100k live attendance.     Tank Davis and Ryan Garcia are fighting each other, Davis known for his work on tiktok and Ryan who gained infamy for his domestic violence allegations have been on a collision course for years.     And Finally Larry Merchant is 50 years younger and will face off with Floyd Mayweather Jr. for the undispusted Welterweight championship of the world. He plans to kick Floyd's ass
Joe Mesi was not known as "Baby Joe" but instead as "Brain Beater" Mesi due to the subdural hematomas he caused his opponents to suffer from, ending their careers as he reigned champion 🏆.
The vegetarian part made me think of the license plate jokes in Mike Tyson Mysteries.  Beef Is Gross Unethical, and Yucky
Mike Tyson actually went Vegan for a bit
Even human got me 😂😂
I'm not crying, you're crying!
I didn't ask to feel this much today
The Ortiz one got me🤣
Who's to say Duran wasn't a heavyweight in an alternate reality.
>never seems to get the rub of the green  I had to look that one up. Is that an Irish or English saying?
Definitely not a Donkey either.
>The financial district know I beat that gentleman
lol even goofy threads Wilder can't catch a break
Well he left Enron for Madoff Securities, then quit for Theranos, followed by WeWork, then FTX, and finally SVB. So yeah, solid resume.
F you
I never specified the weight class.
Could be an English saying. I've always used it..
Why should he? Guy got all the fame, money and recognition of a world class warrior whilst fighting his whole career at national level with his absolute peak narrowly beating a mediocre 50 year old Cuban nobody and losing 3 times in a row to Fury. He got gifted basically everything. There's so many fighters that have worked harder, fought more difficult fights, took more damage and got none of what Wilder got. Think objectively, when in the history of boxing had there been a "world champion" with nearly 50 fights , 13 so called world title fights, who's only beaten 2 top 10 ranked opponents, the best of which is an extremely old mediocre contender? Objectively that hasn't ever happened, and is objectively ridiculous.
I just thought the comment was funny, Wilder gets clowned in threads about him, that's to be expected, I was surprised to find it here.  I know Wilder is not very respected but I think he's gonna go down among the top of this era, he is even top 3 top 4 in most rankings despite his loss.  In The Ring he's #3  in TBRB he's #4  and in BoxRec he's #6.
He's considered top 5 because he's American, without that hype he wouldn't have gotten that gifted belt, fame or rating. Instead magine a random Nigerian, his best win being a rated 5th at best 40 year old Luis Ortiz he barely beat with an incredibly padded record, Would anyone, boxrec, TBRB or The Ring ever rate that guy top 5? Especially after basically 3 back to back losses? No. Let's be real. They wouldn't give a fukc about that Nigerian Farmboy or whatever. The fact he's American and the only somewhat decent American in 20 years is what gets him that.  This era(assuming last 10 years)the top 5 is Klitschko, Joshua, Povetkin, Fury and Usyk. Even Andy Ruiz who arguably should have beat Parker, beat Joshua as well as Ortiz(Wilders utmost greatest accomplishment as a fighter)should rank higher objectively speaking.
Man, if only he spoke Spanish, repped the flag, and bought a place in the Island. He'd have a huge fanbase.
No one sees Shakur as Puerto Rican.
That boy don’t identify as Rican lmfao
Since when is Shakur Puerto Rican? Is he actually from Puerto Rico or was a mistake made?
If Shakur is Puerto Rican then Duran is Mexican.  On behalf of all Mexicans, I accept this exchange.
It’s funny how Valdez used to be a top opponent now people think he bum cuz Shakur made him look easy
The speed & balance of Shakur’s footwork when he throws the backhand & then recovers is incredible.
I pray to the boxing gods that Haney beats loma and shakur moves up to fight Haney while they’re both still young no Floyd - manny or Spence - Crawford bs
This pisses me off. Shakur ain't really Puerto Rican let's be real, his dad abandoned him and left him to be raised by his non Puerto Rican mother, he's got nothing culture wise of them and only ponders because it's a money market. He's American af and there's nothing anyone can say otherwise.
I wanna see Shakur fight Diaz just have a direct comparison with Haney. Or even better a fight with Haney but I doubt that will happen
Dude started claiming puerto rico as a marketing strategy lmao. Never repped PR until now.
Shakur has Puerto Rican ancestry somewhere on his dad’s side. But he is not Puerto Rican and nobody thinks he is.
Latino like Taco Bell
I was at this fight. Flavor Flav was sitting right behind me as part of the cheering section for an undercard fighter who starched his overmatched opponent (Nico Ali Walsh). Was really fun to sit in the family section of a pro fight.
This is not a classic Mexico v Puerto Rico fight. Stevenson was born in the US, not PR. There is a distinction between a Nationality, and an ethnicity. PR is a nation with a large diversity of ethnicities.
Hold up! Stevenson is Puerto Rican?! When did this happen?
Lol you Puerto Rico boxing fans reaching right now...
Shakur only started mentioning Puerto Rico when he discovered it could benefit him
Shakur is about as puerto rican as john leguizamo
i doubt that Puerto Rico represents Stevenson at all. its easy to see who they stand behind
Isn't it illegal to keep posting and measuring and pushing with your lead hand?
He’s American, not potorro
Cuz his dad who he didnt even know was from puerto rico? So does roberto duran count as mexico vs puerto rico rivalry since his dad was mexican?
His Puerto Rican father ditched him and is a scumbag…nothing to be proud of.
I want to see Stevenson beat the shit outta Tank
Shakur is AMERICAN.   stop with the cuck shit
Lol Shakur never has and never will rep Puerto Rico.
ITT: Redditors discover mixed black/rican kids grow up in new jersey.
How many fights till he gets a shot at the titles do you guys think ?. All the bigger names are ducking him in lightweight. Any chance top rank puts him up against Keyshawn Davis, I think Keyshawn and Frank Martin are good fights.
Manny never unified the featherweight titles?
This was like a big brother fucking with his little brother.
Ain’t shakur black
That was a fucking beat down.
I'm always confused when Americans say someone is from wherever their ascentors are. I get the "nation of immigrants" concept but come on...
PR??? Is the OP drunk or am I ignorant about something?
Toyed with him
Shakurs balance and distance management is beautiful to watch. I just wish he would punch in combination more.
Shakur is afro latino. His father is puerto rican but he was raised by his step father(also black). His mom is black too. So he has it in his blood but he’s not fully Puerto Rican nor did he grow up around any puerto rican parent so its kinda weird to say this is a mexican vs puerto rican thing honestly
Just here to remind ya'll what a piece of shit Shakur is. Fucks up innocent people and their women in the street. Trash.
Ya can accept someone changes their gender...ya can accept all of the letters of LGBTQ plus I. But ya can't accept Shakur is PR even tho his biological pops is PR.ya Ya crazy 😂🤣🤣😭
Shakur stevenson was on fire the only one that can beat shakur is himself imo.
He’s a MF problem
As a Puerto Rican I just want to throw in my two cents. I hate all the talk of "he wasn't BORN in PR" or "he doesn't speak Spanish or carry a flag with him everywhere he goes, so he's not Puerto Rican". I was born and raised in New York, but if anyone ask me, I'm not going to say I'm American, because I'm fucking Puerto Rican!   If he's half Puerto Rican, then he's Puerto Rican. All these conditions and stipulations and qualifications you guys are coming up with are silly. I don't care if he's never listened to a Daddy Yankee song in his life. He's Puerto Rican! All you bozos over here gatekeeping. Smh.
I see shakure as a hood nigga not as a crazy communist 🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🦅🦅🦅🤍💯💯💯💯💯💯🔥
You guys, my friend Omar who was born in Puerto Rico says it's enough for him to acknowledge and claim his heritige despite the fact that he doesn't speak spanish. So case closed.
Lmao Puerto Ricans thirsty for a champ they settle for a half breed.
Mexico 0 Blackarican 1
Bunch of weirdos in here.  His dad is Puerto Rican, making Stevenson Puerto Rican. Lmao blood is blood, dummies.
He blew up to 200 lbs.. monstrous.
In a moment of genius boxing IQ, Shakur takes advantage of Valdez's habit of clapping his gloves together by shooting a jab as Valdez brings his gloves apart to clap 0:04
wait, isn't puerto rico just a small city in Mexico?
Duran was half Mexican (mother) he never made it in the clan. Cray
Well that’s my morning shit sorted
I know this is a hot take, but Reynoso making Valdez try to box is the wrong strategy in this fight. Should have been unleashed the old Oscar who enters a dog fight,
I saw this fight, he straight punished Valdez for 12 rounds. Valdez is a champ but Shakur was treating him like a puppet in there, making him go and do what he wanted him to do.
I didn’t even know he was Puerto Rican.  Either way great fighter and Jersey made!
Honestly, from someone who hasn't watched much of either fighter, he made it look like Oscar Valdez didn't belong in there with him. It looked like a colossal mismatch.
he repped it in his last fight
He’s not PR…you’re trippin, his scumbag dad left him early…hardly anything to be proud of
They want to claim him so badly.
Reminds me of this UFC fighter name Dricus Di Plessi or something, and he is white south  African, he was like I will be the first legit African champion and since he's white and not black, nobody really took it seriously, but he is African.
Try telling that to the Puerto Ricans in the tri state area. Don't be surprised when Shakur makes his debut on the Island soon 👀🇵🇷
newrap does and that's good enough for me.
I've seen him bring the 🇵🇷 flag out post fight in the ring on at least a few occasions. He's definitely trying to reach those fans
😂 hell nah he don’t !
He does.
he literally has the flag on his shorts
He does.
His biological dad is Puerto Rican I think but he was born in Newark. I wouldn’t really call him Puerto Rican
his dad is puerto rican but wasn’t around. it’s sad really, shakur was cut off from an entire half of his cultural identity because his dad was a deadbeat
>Since when is Shakur Puerto Rican? Is he actually from Puerto Rico or was a mistake made?  He is Puerto Rican the same way Roberto Duran is Mexican, apparently.
In the USA anyone with Puerto Rican lineage is considered Puerto Rican. You don't have to dig deep..his pops is PR. Papi look at his face..shakur is PR. Coño
Top rank sees how boring Stevenson is and are trying to use any angle to get a fan base going , tbh it looks desperate when they should of done it from the start lol
Most people that Valdez was overrated and that berchelt was gonna kill him, then berchelt got KO’d. It then became wait Valdez is good? Then the Robson fight happened
I always thought Shakur was going to demolish Valdez and Valdez was ducking him at 126 and got downvoted for it.  Valdez ain't a bum though, just not on *that* level.
It's  crazy cuz Valdez Is a really good fighter. There's just levels in boxing and Shakur dominated him. Shoes how good Shakur really is. The 135 and 140 lb divisions are loaded.
Facts.
Haney is moving up to 140 after Loma win or lose and Shakur won’t rush to 140 for him, so no fight for them for years regardless. But if Loma wins, that’ll 100% be the next fight
That ones going to get made at 140-147. Shakurs gotta catch up a bit in size.
He’s half puerto rican, that makes him Puerto Rican.    You dont have to be indulged in the culture to be PR.   I hope he embraces his ancestry and claims the PR flag more often as hes doing, because haters like you get mad and real puerto ricans will always support our own kind 💪🏽🔥
Lol this pisses you off? People on the internet are weird man. Its so funny seeing all these people write rants and cry on reddit about how shakur is not puerto rican. Like this is seriously what people are getting upset over?
Basic Biology seems to disagree with you
I don’t think you’ll get Shakur v Díaz. But, I have a feeling Shakur is in a path to face the winner of Haney v Loma. So, you’ll kinda get what you want.
When Top Rank realize he needs a fan base to sell to.
His dad is from pr but he wasn’t in his life…he was raised by his black side
Puerto Rican boxing fans never claimed him.  It was Shakur himself that tried to claim he's Rican out of nowhere.
I mean he's half Puerto Rican so it's not a full reach lol
What are you implying exactly?
100%. But most if not all refs ignore that rule these days.
Tank will walk him down. Tank walks down opponent that don’t have pop
Keyshawn Davis will not be put up for that fight for a long time
Frank Martin can give him a run for his money
That’s how it is in most parts of America where they heavy immigrant groups. For instance in South Florida, a common question is where are you from..meaning what’s your background/where are your parents from. There’s tons of Boricuas,Colombians, and etc who have never visited they ancestral homeland but are considered as such. Based upon ancestry.
his dad is from puerto rico
Shut up loser #StevensonYoshino April 8th live on ESPN 🇵🇷
😥
It’s not that, the title is just weird for me. Its like if I was a pro boxer and because I’m half Filipino and I fought a Mexican boxer and headline said “another classic Filipino vs Mexico matchup” but I was born and raised in North America.
Facts the gate keeping is mad weird and funny style.
I think Shakur is looking for Puerto Rican support. Puerto Rico has a few prospects, no need to say they’re thirsty for a Champ, they’ve bred a handful.
Nah, he was getting clowned by Puerto Ricans when he said “Yo soy Boricua, pa que tu lo sepas” ahead of this fight as they know he was just pandering to try to get some recognition and support which he didn’t get for the most part.
Remember when they tried to bring Danny Garcia to PR? Lmao.
Lol his pops is Puerto Rican ain't nothin about claiming it is what he is...plus he the one trying to get more fans and bringing out the PR flag and having it on his shorts
No they don't, he's the one who wants to expand his fanbase
I’m a Puerto Rican from NJ so I found my loophole
He claims it, he throws flag on boxing shorts. So what u sayin
Its like in WWE where Drew McIntyre was British when he held the World title. When he lost the title he back to being Scottish
Bro he started claiming that himself fym. Get off your high horse.
Not really Boricuas are proud people, I remember when Danny garcia fought Mauricio Lara in Puerto Rico and folks still were saying Danny is a Philly fighter he's not PR.
It isn't Puerto Ricans doing it lol
What Dricus was trying to say is that he'd be the first "legit" African champ because he still trains out of Africa (SA) instead of moving to one of the big gyms elsewhere like the others did; Ngannou (Paris, Vegas), Usman (Florida, Denver), Adesanya (Auckland).  Still a dumb and tone deaf statement but what he said makes sense.
Puerto Rican here living in NYC working in Newark. Going to his fight Saturday. The kids half Puerto Rican, but 100% a top talent in the sport. Who gives a fuck? Let him rep what he wants to rep. Can promise you he’s not the only boricua in the states who can’t speak Spanish…
Hey, more power to him if he does but he seems to avoid claiming it. If I had .00001% Puerto Rican or Mexican blood I’d be trying to get those fans all day long lol
Its like Koreans claiming Bivol
That’s why I was confused because they kept saying he’s proudly from Newark constantly on ESPN
Purto Ricanish
Are you Puerto Rican?
Wasn't his pops out of the picture as well?
I guess Mexicans should stop claiming Oscar DLH and Ryan Garcia according to this logic.
I like this. We Mexicans can claim one of the greatest fighters of all time. Yay
Thats Haney. He is the boring one. But credit to Haney for having the balls to fight the best and go into enemy territory
And this is why one of the reasons boxing sucks now. Fans just flip-flop all the time
People who saw the Adam lopez fight already knew his level, the Robson fight j solidified it
The goal post just moved and Berchelt was considered overrated
Loma vs Shakur is match made in heaven. I think Shakur wins over this version of Loma. Loma in his prime vs current Shakur would be a fight of the ages
Lol this is boxing man…absolutely nothing is “100%” gonna happen.
Especially when this isn't even about Shakur himself claiming to be Puerto Rican, he just has the flag on his shorts and says he's from Newark. Insane to me that people care so much
Culturally he's American ya know what I mean, he may be part Puerto Rican but he's never known that life, never known the language, never been to the island, he'd rather uplift a Culture he doesn't know for many than uplifting the culture of his Afro-American roots, just bothers me a bit when people do that ya know.
Puerto Ricans born on the island view Puerto Ricans born in the states as not real Ricans. Which in this case if he doesn't even speak Spanish and has no close ties to family on the island he's just pandering. Italians from Italy do the same with American east coast Italians...
I would be shocked. I have a bad feeling Haney might win then they’ll marinate the fight forever. If Loma wins I could definitely see Bob trying to sacrifice Loma to make Shakur a bigger name
Facts.
He can't speak Spanish and has never been to PR, that man is American.
watch any Tito, Cotto or Juanma Lopez fight when they were champions. thats how they stand behind their fighters.  what did you think i was implying?
Why is it illegal? I don’t really see how it puts the opponent in a massive disadvantage.
Tank is not the walking down type of fighter, he's a counter puncher. He looks for opportunities to time clean shots, but he doesn't use any front foot pressure. Shakur would not give him that opportunity because he sticks and moves.
That's what has people peeved here.
I kinda get that because it sounds like country vs country BUT in the USA people like delahoya and Barrios..many more are mexican-American. But still called Mexico in a fight like Trinidad (PR) vs delahoya(mex).   Just how it goes....  So this would be pr vs Mex.
Danny is actually Puerto Rican though, there are more Puerto Ricans in America than in Puerto Rico. Cotto was born in Rhode Island and Benitez was also born here.
This was hilarious. He got whooped on and got a gift decision
Lol tried to cherry pick against the Mexican and almost lost the fight. Then when the Mexicans asked for the rematch... Hell No!
I completely agree - why is everyone down downvoting you? He is literally half Puerto Rican.  I don't think anyone is in a position to say who Shakur Stevenson is, apart from Shakur Stevenson - and if he's half Peurto Rican and the Puerto Rican people are proud of that, then fuck off if you're not happy with that.
Haha yeah Usman with that crazy logic lol, basically he said “you’re white”
he repped it in his last fight though
Or GGG
Makes more sense than calling him Russian like we do.  Bivol's mum is Ethnic Korean born in Kazakhstan, while his dad was born in Moldova. Both when they were part of the Soviet Union.  Bivol was born in Kyrgyzstan less than a year before it left the Soviet Union. He moved to Russia when he was 11, 5 years after he'd started boxing at 6.
Right like I'm proudly from NYC BUT my ethnicity still what it is.
No… not at all similar
never heard of any mexicans claim Duran as theirs. i always figured that everyone knew he was from Panama
That’s not really the takeaway. No one is saying Valdez is a bum. The takeaway is people felt like he was a B level fighter, then he put up a great win against berchelt. Valdez has been featured with the boxing public for awhile. Out of all his fights he’s looked to be B level outside of one fight. I def thought berchelt was gonna run him over so Valdez gets the most kudos for that. The conversation is about where Valdez is as a fighter, this isn’t about trying to take away from him. Valdez has a great list of opponents
i thought berchelt was drained but then he looked horrible his next fight, dont know what to make of any of it, but i agree, people seem to them say berchelt was overrated
These people got a stick up their ass and cry about anything. Idc if he is puerto rican or not but the kid is half puerto rican I don't see the problem.
I understand, but that doesn't mean he should be excommunicated from half of his heritage if he wants to connect with it, especially since his dad is ethnically puerto rican. You should be more worried bout that entire region being gentrified by rich people living there to avoid paying taxes.
Is miguel cotto a fake Ricann then?
It’s a good point…but I think Shakur’s going to fight Loma either way, win or lose. Win…Loma gets sacrificed to set up Shakur as undisputed and king at 135. Lose, Loma is a “proving ground” for a shot at Haney…while they let those tensions heat up.   Plus, Haney’s going to move up to 140 soon I bet…so they need a face to hold down 135.
Like many of Puerto Rican descendants in USA doesmt speak Spanish or been to PR. So what?? On the other hand...i CAN speak Spanish and I have been to Puerto rico. Yet, I'm NOT Puerto Rican...and Shakur is still much more Puerto Rican than me. 🤔😂😂 ya mofos crazy tho...
He would be American even if he was born in Puerto Rico. If his father is Puerto Rican so is he it's just how it is. Plus in these times? You can identify as being a fuckin alien and get away with it so why not
Berlanga has a big Puerto Rican following too
It falls under several rules like not blocking your opponent's vision and punching properly (you cannot leave your arm extended after throwing a punch AKA stiff-arming). An example of the rules being enforced is Fury Chisora 1
Agaisnt hector he wasn’t hesitant to walk them down.  He kept applying pressure . No matter how much hector moved or hit him, he will be right frojt .  Tank is versatile. He can walk you down or counter punch. Shakur will have to be perfect for 12 rounds if his punches not bothering tank
Puerto Rico is part of America.
I'm tired of hearing this shit! They just have the heritage and that's about it. Two, three generations back and they still claim to be Puerto Rican. When in reality they know very little about what's going on over here. y menos aun los que ni habla espanol 🙄
Danny is no more Puerto Rican than Shakur.
Its so funny redditors telling a guy with a puerto rican father how puerto rican he is. You can't make this shit up.
People don't like the truth lol
Yeah, just dumb lol. He wouldn't be the first ethnic African champ, but he'd be the only one to do is training full time out of the continent.
Or Kostya Tszyu/ Tim Tszyu
Ethnically Puerto Rican? It’s a nationality not an ethnicity. That’s why you can get different ethnicities from Puerto Rico in the same way you can get different ethnicities from Brazilians or Germans.
"Puerto Rican" isn't an ethnicity, it's a nationality.
Yeah I gotcha but I just have never heard it Shakur himself.
Duran’s father was Mexican. Just like Shakur’s father being Rican. I can now proudly claim Duran as another Mexican great.
He hasn't been the same since he got covid. Long covid is a thing and athletes aren't some how magically immune to it.
I would if he did it from a place of sincerity but I'm getting mad clout chasing vibes from it, he and TR know that's a hot boxing market so that's why they're doing it. If it's sincere then it's aight but I simply don't believe that to be the case. Also you're right about the rich
Cotto was raised in the island as an actual Puerto Rican.  He speaks Spanish, plays dominos, eats pasteles with ketchup, sniffs coke at the local pub, and drinks medalla light.  Cotto is Puerto Rican.  Shakur knows nothing about that.
I'll ask my Puerto Rican friend from the island how he feels about these important questions.
I have Loma beating Shakur. Loma is the smartest fighter I have ever witnessed. Besides Bud Crawford
Puerto Ricans can't vote and have no political representation in America, so calling them American is a bit of a stretch.
I never saw Hector being forced on the backfoot via pressure. His back was never against the ropes either, and this is a guy who walks back in straight lines. Tank beat him via counters, not pressure.
Probably means in the states
Its an owned territory, I'm talking about the states.
You're wrong. His dad speaks of growing up there and being so poor he couldn't afford shoes. You don't get to decide someone's culture for them.
Mate - they're not even telling him, they're telling random Internet strangers how Peurto Rican he is, and on a boxing forum nonetheless. Fucking mindless.
I mean tbf he’s clearly doing it to try and get some Puerto Rican fans more than anything. He’s was born in Newark, went to the olympics repping American rather than Puerto Rico and he doesn’t speak Spanish or live on the island.
Yeah, that too! You get different ethnicities in literally every country. You name, uganda, mexico, China..etc etc. All have different ethnicities...
I'm half Black, half Puerto Rican. My father was born in Ponce Puerto Rico, I was born in Brooklyn NY. Are you telling me that I'm not Puerto Rican?
It can be either but usually not considered nationality since its not a nation. The nationality of Puerto Ricans is American since it is the United States ...using the American dollar, etc.   So in that way it's ethnicity within the USA such as Mexican Amercian (chicano). Also ethnicity not nationality.
Technically it depends on what you mean by “puerto rican”
He tweeted it a while back. Comments were full of ppl telling him to lean into it more. Looks like he’s taking the advice. Either way I think I speak for most of us when I say this was NOT part of the Mexico vs PR rivalry.
He's raised by his momma, that's why.But he's on video saying it...search on YouTube.  And he wears it on his boxing trunks. besides if I was a boxer I wouldn't be chanting or throwing up flags like that. It's just not me...and just not my generation.   But people get on you about it..force you to throw it up...or else you're not proud or reppin it. Then when you do...you get others to say you're not that because you never been there..dont speak the language. So I say f em...lol people never happy...
California used to be Mexico. Bivol is from Indio, CA. You can claim Bivol as a current Mexican great!
shit i missed the context earlier..got it now lol
Do whatever u want. Change your gender if you want...now will people accept your claim is a different thing. 😂
Duran is Panamanian through and through. Even if his father was a Mexican-American US soldier, he never played a role in his life so he’s not Mexican, as cool as it would be to claim him, it doesn’t count
I feel you
I have to disagree.   I think the fact that Shakur is a southpaw would give Loma a lot of problems. Loma won’t be able to take his normal step around angle that he loves to use to get to his opponents’ backs.  Shakur is incredibly fast, and the kid has an unbelievable IQ himself. On top of that, he has great footwork and is a defensively minded fighter.  If the fight happens, I have Shakur by UD.
Be that as it may...when they are born they are American citizens with no need for passports to come stateside.
Uhhh Puerto Ricans do vote my guy…and dc doesn’t have representation either
Cuz he was holding his ground and trading which got him stopped like he was bound to be . Tank starts his offense from counter and without counters. You must have missed all the angles Davis used against hector and was often the first man to start the offense. Tank showed that fight he wasn’t scared to take one to give one
>I mean tbf he’s clearly doing it to try and get some Puerto Rican fans more than anything.  He probably is dosen't change the fact his dad is puerto rican not his fault he didn't grow up around the culture. The kid is puerto rican.
How do you know his intent?       You act like he woke up and decided to be Puerto Rican  Why must you be a persistent jackass?
That's not what an ethnic group is homie. You mean nationality
If you were born in Puerto Rico, then yes you are. If you weren't, then no you're not.
Both Mexicans and Puerto Ricans are multi-ethnic, and neither are culturally or racially monolithic.  And not all Mexican Americans consider themselves "Chicano," which is in and of itself a relatively recent term.   That said, he's really not culturally Puerto Rican.  Mark Aguirre's biological father was Mexican (hence his surname), but I wouldn't consider the dude Mexican culturally, since he really wasn't raised amongst Mexicans, didn't speak the language, etc.
Yeah that was just Shakur being special
Lol yeah I know all about that. My family is from Nicaragua but I don’t know much about it so I don’t claim it as me.
🤣 seems like a good idea, since anything goes nowadays.
Brb claiming Beterbiev, Lennox Lewis and Arturo Gatti as a Canadian lmao
They accept this ridiculous claim about Shakur being Rican. Lol
Shakur’s father didn’t either. I’m just going off the fact that ricans want to claim him now.
Citizens without equal access to benefits or voting rights, but yes they do have American passports
Google is your friend, no reason to sound dumb
Using angles doesn't always equate to pressuring though. I mean, someone like Loma used angles effectively for pressuring, but someone like Haney uses angles to get step out of the inside.   Either way, Hector doesn't fight like Shakur, it'll be a much different fight where Shakur rarely gets hit clean.
You read that WRONG. Read it again, I'm saying within all those nations you have different ethnicities. 🤦🏽‍♂️ I didn't name any of the ethnicities....
That's the stupidest shit I ever heard. So my father just doesn't exist then?
I agree. Not culturally Mexican but still considered Mexican. And forget about PR and Mex being multi-ethic. The whole world is...lol. Even Chinese are multiethic...even Russians.....lol
Man he really beat Valdez, Herring and Conseiçao back to back on easy mode. Still wild to think about.
It's actually fair to claim both Gatti and Lennox as Canadian since they both grew up there.
He said it himself. What you need documentation? Lol
Puerto Ricans vote in primaries my guy…they also have delegates….they are 100% US citizens
Using angles can equate to pressure and can not . If you use angles to go forward than yeah it can equate to pressure but I don’t think you caught how tank was using it . He rarely attacks from  a straight line.  Yeah they are not same. Shakur more slick and smart but hector is tougher and more of a dog . Don’t think Shakur will be able to take the same punishment but he won’t get hit as much . And even the slickest fighter is not Neo from Matrix. Floyd got clipped alot in his career against his higher skilled opponent  and the more explosive fast guys. But thing is he had a helluva chin. Let’s see if Shakur got that
Dude... Ethnicity and nationality are different, this isn't hard to understand. A white dude and a black dude born in America are both American, but they do not have the same ethnicity.
So you're just stuck on stupid...
>hector is tougher and more of a dog  We don't know this yet, lol! That's not based on anything.  >Don’t think Shakur will be able to take the same punishment  Gervonta needs to get close to him, he also needs to let his hands go more than his last 5 fights. I don't like how low volume he's been getting.
My guy literally just needs to look at 2 fighters for it to make sense. Look at Cotto and look at Tito and tell me if you think those guys are the same race. But they’re definitely both Puerto Rican because they’re both from Puerto Rico. (Yes I know Cotto was born in Rhode Island but he grew up in PR so he’s Puerto Rican.)
Puerto Ricans are us citizens. I'm not talking about Ethnicity.  "All persons born in Puerto Rico on or after January 13, 1941, and subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, are citizens of the United States at birth."  https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title8-section1402&num=0&edition=prelim#:~:text=All%20persons%20born%20in%20Puerto%20Rico%20on%20or%20after%20January,the%20United%20States%20at%20birth.
Try telling that to Italians, or the Irish as well. Gtfoh
Yeah that’s why I said we will see if Shakur is really tough like mayweather was  Gervonta has good offensive defense , and he makes up for that by being accurate . After round 3-4 and he is done figuring out his opponent , his landed percentage is always around 40-50% which is high .  It’s not physically possible to dodge every punch and move around for 12 rounds. No one has ever done that.  Let’s see the dog in Shakur
Calendar age is different from physical age. People can deteriorate at very different rates. Too many factors besides just being XY years old
I mean, we can say they're both old...  But one's fighting a weight class where he's much smaller than the average fighter, while the other isn't. Not to mention, I would call Devin Haney more of a weight bully than someone like Spence.
Crawfords old, too, Devin.  He just hasn't declined a lot because he is always in shape and takes care
For whatever reason age is a HUGE factor in the lower weight classes.
Nothing ever is compared oranges to oranges .   Loma isn’t shot that’s forsure , but we all can agree that the smaller the fighter the faster they peak  Boxing is a young man’s sport.   Mileage.   Everything is pointing in haneys favor. Let’s see if he’s got that dog in him.
They're both pretty old for boxers in their weight classes
This is funny because Haneys the one who called Loma old
Bud is old now. But he's just too good to look old. That’s it..
Loma is old. Hes been through a ringer a career with about 400 amateur fights included. His shoulder is held together by scar tissue and glue. Crawford is just a bit older, but like Floyd aged well due to a style that lets him take minimal damage so hes in way better shape.  Haney knows this thats why the fight is happening, but trying to shine him up so its a better win than it is.
Crawford is old, but he has amazing skills and IQ to go with absolutely freakish reach and physical strength. Horn and Porter were big, strong welterweights and he was tossing them all around the ring. I genuinely think he'd be competitive with most fighters at 154 right now (not dominant, but competitive).   Loma struggles with big lightweights and is only a year and a half or so removed from injury & surgery. He's obviously way more comfortable at 126-130.   If Haney wants his resume to be undeniable go out and dominate Loma then go after Shakur and the winner of Tank-Garcia.
The issue is he's old AND he's too small for the weight. He should be at 130lb, while Haney is a boiled down welterweight.
Crawford is old and hasn't fought anyone as good as loma..ever....
They are both old Devin.
I mean, he's not wrong but I do think people are referring to the decline of his abilities rather than his actual age when people talk about Loma being old. Terence hasn't shown any such decline but people will no doubt start saying that he's getting old when he starts slowing down. When a fighter starts "getting old" is probably a combination of genetics, livelihood, how much damage they've taken and what style they have.  Beterbiev for example doesn't look like he's aged an awful lot to me even though he's soon to be 40. But his style is more reliant on power and IQ than speed and quick feet. Loma's style on the other hand is heavily reliant on speed, reflexes and quick feet. Loma's not gonna be able to hang out in the pocket like he likes to do when his reflexes suddenly is too slow for him to see and evade the punches in time. And these are normally the first attributes that a fighter loses.  So while Haney is correct that 35 isn't ancient it's not enough to show that there exists another fighter of the same age that are not yet being called old by fans and media to conclude that Loma has not shown signs of decline.
Devin Haney himself has called Loma old in the past lol
All these damn languages out here and Haney decided to speak facts
Loma has more mileage on his body
Doesn’t Loma have close to 500 fights? Bad comparison considering Bud fights once every leap year.
Devin Haney: “Loma is to small to old”  twitter.com/realdevinhaney/status/1317682569442336769
Crawford is not fighting men bigger than himself.
I feel like people are gonna discredit Devin Haney if he wins. The weight bully shit is the biggest joke if he makes the weight at the weigh in he belongs in that weight class, i miss the days when there were only like 8 weight classes. As for Loma’s age that’s not Devin’s fault he has called out Loma for years.
Loma is definitely pretty old and he’s undersized, also he has a shit ton of miles on his body compared to Crawford and has fought better competition.
seems like the athletic take i gather on here is that the dude's just saying Crawford is more athletic than Loma is because he's black, seems like what he's saying when there's absolutely no basis to say that other than that
Crawford is the most skilled fighter of his era and he only fights once a year so there's not a lot of wear and tear on him you wouldn't think he's 35.
Put some respect on haneys name
Age is really just a number in boxing.  Some guys look done in their early 30s and some guys go to 40 no problem, so "age" is more of a case by case basis
Lol devin needs to chill. Loma has lost a step and lomas style is dependent on his feet and reflexes. But if devin wins it’s still a win. Bud has a different style than loma so it’s not an even comparison. I hope devin is ready because he’s never fought anyone like this. Looking forward to this fight.
Ah, they're attempting to pre discredit the inevitable win over Loma I see. Pathetic.
loma been through more. fighting bigger fighters and tougher fights.  more wear tear than TC.
He is old but he's still a top fighter. I don't like haney but if he wins people have to give him credit because before the Ortiz fight lomachenko had 2 great wins. No one was saying he was old then. It's like people saying golovkin was old when he fought canelo 1 when he was still king of the middleweights
None of this BS will matter on May 20th. Whichever fighter wins, should get their due credit.  With that said, Loma wins this (IMO). Haney has NEVER fought anyone with Loma's skill level. I think he's going to realize how much he is NOT like Mayweather.   I'm backing up my opinion with $$$ though. $300 on Loma to win straight up and $100 to win by stoppage. I'd bet more but I think I may fly to Vegas for this one.
This sub in shambles with facts. Can’t wait for Devin to give overrated Lomo his third loss :).
Cue the Loma is old and shot excuses for when Haney wins   Was he old when he lost to Teo also?
Why is no one saying Devin is inexperienced and too young.  Devin wanted to fight Loma 4 years when he was a scrawny 20 year old.  I think it’s unfair to already create this narrative when we haven’t even seen the fight yet. People are trying to change the narrative and create excuses if Loma loses.
Just gotta laugh at the built in excuses
lomas an athletic based fighter, it is what it is. Crawford is much less dependent on movement than Loma.  &#x200B;  edit: when i say athletic based fighter im saying he relys on his athletism alot. The first thing to go are a fighter legs. Nothing about comparing how athletic they are
Can't wait for the excuses made for Loma when he loses to Devin.
At the end of the day, Loma refused to give Haney a shot when he was younger, so it's a moot point anyway.
Haney had the easy road to undisputed compared to others. But somehow people will always diminish his accomplishments man
But he is lol. Not to take away from this fight. Still a legit fight
how many fights total has loma had?  And dont fighter age differently anyway?
To overcome size and dimension disadvantages you have to be exceptional  You have to be so much better than your opponent to overcome those disadvantages.  Its obvious in any other sport than boxing
Lower weight classes age out faster because they rely a lot more on speed and reflexes. Once those go, it's a lot harder to keep up. On the opposite spectrum, heavyweights tend to do better as they get into their early or mid thirties. Speed isn't as big a factor and they fully mature into that "man strength."
Boxers (and people in general) don't age the same way, so this is just a dumb point. There have been boxers who were shot by their mid-20s.
This is the thing. Loma has shown definite signs of not being who he was a few years ago. His rotator cuff issues have also seemed to become a chronic problem in his last several fights.   Crawford is one of those rare exceptions that has aged, but his performance in the ring doesn’t reflect it.
Exactly.
I was discussing this with another user who claimed GGG retiring because he was ducking Lara.  They claimed they're about the same age so GGG is ducking if he retires. Well GGG had a long amateur career and has essentially fought like 100 (can't recall the right number, I had calculated it before) more amateur fights than Lara.  In the ring age, GGG is much older than Lara if you count wear and tear.
One also has over 300 fights under his belt including two Olympic medals. So yeah… one of them has a lot of mileage.
He’s also not undersized for his division, he was like high 150s when he fought at 140 so he must be in the 160s now and his arms are longer than Floyd’s
And isn't active whatsoever,plus he consistently chooses to fight bums
It's not really a big mystery, if you think about it.  Lower weight classes are the ones where a decline in speed/explosive power/reaction time affects performances the most.
They decline faster, it’s like dog years
Power is usually the last thing to go, so for these super quick and agile smaller fighters, aging takes them out of the game much faster.
Devin Haney isn’t concerned with this theory,   because he’s a middleweight.
Because speed is more relevant there and usually you get slower when you are old
Examples?
I remember he called him small and old on the build up to Gamboa, who was both smaller and older
Eh, he's also not fought much. Loma is approaching 450 fights at this point. Haney is a turd
Easy to not look old when you fight nobody the whole time. The hard fights is what ages you
Completely agree. Lomachenko is battle worn and they know it. Crawford hadn’t declined at all.
>His shoulder is held together by scar tissue and glue  As a medical professional reading this statement.. it sounds so stupid
He hasnt fought below 135 in 5 years and he is in his 30s already. I highly doubt he makes 130 without losing something. He isnt skinny with wirey muscles like Donaire. Thats why Donaire was able to move down successfully after his weight climb. Loma is pretty stout for his size. Unless he has been weighing in at 130 for his 135 fights, he aint going down there and staying the same man.
People started saying he should be at 130 once he lost to Teo. But when he was beating bigger guys at 135, it was all good.
That’s just called not smart
Amateur fights with headgear most are 3 rounds
3 years ago*,
Benavidez Jr. was vastly bigger than Crawford. He just doesn't on the regular.  Edit: anyone downvoting just look at him. He is much bigger
Funny how none of these Lomasexuals never complained about Nakatani who is way bigger than Haney. These guys only complain about size when they feel like that fighter actually has a genuine chance of winning.
Crawfords more athletic, but I don't think it has anything to do with him being black lmfao
Its your opinion naoya inoue for me over everyone. Crawford is good but not the most skilled, actually i really like him but he aint like inoue or usyk
He has no feet and lost rounds and got hurt by david who’s a nobody last fight
Bud relies on reflexes cuz he counters more then loma
Who is they? This is a thread bout what Haney is saying. You're a special kind of sensitive bitch ain't ya?
I agree. Especially the canelo ggg 1 point. They just called ggg old outta nowhere.
I think thats the whole point Haney is trying to make. He does not want to hear any excuses for when he beats loma and honestly Haney is undisputed who actually took who i think is the #2 guy in the division who is not a mando but instead voluntary and its very possible for Haney to get beat. This is like a 50/50 or like a 55/45 towards haney but for a guy who pretty much just won his belts to then go into a challenge like this should really be applauded.   Hate his style. hate his pillow fist or that he held against linaries. He went to australia twice for a shitty deal. Was Loma's mando in 2019 then became undisputed and instead of swerved and took the challenge.   &#x200B;  Good luck on your bet btw
Cue the professional victim simping for Haney the hugger
Honestly he should thank Loma for not ending his career at 20, and the universe for allowing them to come together when he has a chance to win his first good win of his career.
10000%
Exactly.
So true.
Crawford relies a lot on his movement too. Both are athletic based fighter.
Crawford been getting tagged recently and losing rds tho. His style does also rely on quick reflexes due to sharp counters. Been losing his feet too recently
Can someone Caine up with receipts for these amateur fights people keep throwing around.. ??
Floyd had great reach too for his size but Crawford's is just absurd, he has longer reach than Ward, Kovalev and Bivol.
yeah, true. He filled out quite a bit, if you compare him against Horn now to Porter or Avenysyan
Crawford admitted that he walks around in the 150’s so he and Loma are pretty much in the same boat.
Meh, most of em are top 10s, they're not quite bums
Plus more people fall into the lower weight classes than heavier ones so the talent pool isn’t as deep, less young hungry lions waiting to punish you
As a person clearly making analogy reading a statement nitpicking an analogy and missing the point... it sounds so stupid.
Other people have. I've been saying it since his face was rainbow colored after fighting f'ing Pedraza, and getting knocked down by Linares. I was never impressed by him at 135lb, and got downvoted to oblivion when I would point it out back when he was considered #1 here.   At 130lb and lower, he was a different animal.
No, it's called having a long amateur career. Fighting once or twice a year as a pro isn't the only way to box.
It’s called almost 400 amateur fights
Look at the difference in frame size between Teofimo/Haney and Lomachenko.  Both weigh 150+ in the ring. Lomachenko has never weighed over 140
Facts.
I think Crawford was a multi sport athlete growing up so that helps a lot with athleticism as an adult
They called him old as soon as Jacob's gave him a close fight
Inbred buzz words never mattered   Loma about to get victimized by the hands of god ✊🏽💪🏽
We will never know.
no where near as much as loma. Loma is an athletic based fighter on activity, it why he was 396-1 as an amatuer. He likes to be constantly moving forward and changing angles. in fact Manny is more of an athletic based fighter than crawford. Actually how the fuck is crawford an athletic based fighter, what in his last 3 performances make you think that? I dont think i could find one person at my gym that would agree with that.
itll be a good win for devin but when people make up narratives like that itll make it seem less impressive. Crawford didnt use his legs at all against brook, porter and david. Loma relies on footwork, angles and moving forward, constant movement and activity. They fight nothing like one another. Crawford is so much better on his backfoot than loma
He's got 94 on Boxrec. Boxrec only has shows like 25% of most fighter's amateur records
Yeah I think Floyd would’ve edged him but I’d have Crawford giving him absolute hell because he’s as fast, has as high a ring IQ I think and has even longer arms than Floyd
Bruh, Crawford literally has a Instagram post where he weighs 177.8lbs. Crawford walks around muhh bigger than Loma. Much, much bigger
Get back in the gym Crawford, we know it’s you lol
You're saying that as if that matters, we all onow the placement on the top ten is based on who you onow rather than skill. Avocado was in the top ten despite not being a top ten talent.
>Haney knows this thats why the fight is happening, but trying to shine him up so its a better win than it is.  You're way off here too. Haney didn't just Cherry pick loma because he's looking vulnerable like a vulture chasing wounded prey.   [Haney been calling out loma long before his L to teofimo when he was called "the matrix and p4p #1" ](https://www.boxingnews24.com/2019/09/haney-to-try-and-force-lomachenko-fight-before-end-of-2019/)  Haney been chasing loma since 2019 when loma looked untouchable, so this agenda you're spinning is silly.   Even Paulie malinagie recently was trying to spin it like haney doesn't really want the fight, and loma will be too much for haney.
Getting KD by Linares, you know he's slowly biting more than he could chew.   And it's gonna be annoying if Haney beats him they'd be quick to label him overrated. Forgetting he's a bit old, got injuries and small for this weight class.     His trex arms won't help him a bit, since it's mostly his footwork that gives him the advantage, and that's one of the bits you lose as you get older
Rip
Amateur fights are not the same, they wear headgear and most are 3 rounds. Also I remember the narrative Loma had less mileage due to him starting late, he saw every style possible
Good thing it’s amatuer
I agree, that Loma is caller than Crawford relatively for their weightclass. But Crawford is fighting guys bigger than him, too.
💯
God wouldn't have pillow fists lmao
Crawford is more athletic than Loma lol sometimes I have to check if I am in the boxing subreddit. From boxing to wrestling
He is very athletic . Super fast twitch. All his punches and movements are very explosive , and explosiveness is one of the major think that leaves as you age.  Athleticism isn’t only footwork and moving around alot
Boxrec only shows elite bouts, national championships and international tournaments
The last few rounds of that bout would be super exciting
I don't actually think Crawford has longer arms than Floyd. Reach is basically the same as wingspan, meaning your shoulder-to-shoulder part of your body is also counted. Floyd's individual arm length was listed as 26 inches on HBO once, same arm length as Wladimir Klitschko!
At WW I'd bet money on Crawford.
Yeah, Bud has all the tools and ways to use them on paper to make Floyd’s night long and hellish. Has crazy speed for his size and length, can switch stances when need be (has fought entire fights as a southpaw at this point, to varying degrees of success though), and hits hard with a penchant to go downstairs on the regular.
And he is a dog...
Funnily enough, I'm thinking about taking my mom's maiden name Crawford and compete under it when I turn professional
He was ranked like 7 on the ring. The belt rankings are shit. Ring magazine is not
He wasn't chasing shit dude. People can say whatever the fuck they want on social media or interviews, but do contracts get sent? Do agents get contacted? no on both counts. Its really not uncommon. Fighters will be gassing the shit out of themselves on twitter but when it comes to actual offers nothing but crickets. He was doing the same shit with Tank, same shit with Teo. Did the fights ever get made? No. We had the four divas era for a reason.   Its not much different than Fury saying hes the best while making a million and one conditions until Usyk eventually fucked off.   Loma was open several times. If he was really after that fight he would have gotten it before Loma went through a fight injured and another fight sonewhat lacking.
Round up the amateur rounds and it equals up to around 100 12 round fights
So who wins the fight?
he dosent rely on his athletism boxing like loma sometimes i know you guys have never been inside an actual sanctioned boxing gym.
loma relies on his athletism more than crawford, i cant believe that shit got downvoted XD when i say athletic based fighter i mean he RELIES on his athletism. When boxers do that they age bad. Look at gamboa, roy ETC Crawford dosent RELY on his athletism nearly as much. Hell stand and trade, move back and trade. That style ages far better, in fact one of the main reason people pick spence is crawford isnt using his legs as much as he used to.
every single fighter youll see on a major main card has super fast twitch. these are top tier athletes. thats a given, also that will stay with you much longer than footwork and movement. watch ray leonard hit the bag at 60, hes fast af.
I'd expect it to become a fight and not a boxing match in the end. Hard punches and shit. Both were also in tremendous physical condition so they could go the 12 rounds no problem
Yea HBO's arm length measurement of the armpit to the end of the fight is the only really useful measure of reach.  HBO had him listed as 24.5 in the Prescott fight in 2013.
Good luck with your career man
That guy knows nothing.
Lol.. either you're clueless or you have the memory of a fish, I'm going with the former.   Haney was lomas mandatory when he was pursuing it. Loma requested the wbc franchise belt which excluded him from facing mandatories UNLESS he chooses to. Loma did not want the haney mandatory fight for whatever reason, possibly he wanted more lucrative fights or was ducking I have no idea but.....   It's a fact that haney together with eddie hearn wanted the loma fight since atleast 2019. [haney wanted a title shot from loma even before becoming his WBC mandatory ](https://www.boxingnews24.com/2019/10/hearn-furious-at-lomachenko-being-given-franchise-tag-without-fighting-haney/) and well before looking vulnerable to linares and lopez   Just stop it dude  😄
I think it's a tough one to judge going in. Depends on how the clinch game is going, like if the excessive holding is ignored or if Loma can break out of it well enough.
Legs isn’t the only thing that’s athletic . Everything Crawford does is fat twitch fiber and explosive. Specially his punches . Roy and gamboa reflexes went away with age .
I understand what your saying actually. Your talking about the legs of a fighter and how that is athletic. How fast a fighter can do his 1-2 from outside the pocket into getting into the pocket then getting out is a very athletic move. you need to have some great legs to do that.      Do you measure explosiveness as a big metric in athleticism?. Like the ability to generate alot of power (power comes from the legs also). speed mixed with strength.   We are talking Mike Tyson in how fast he can launch a missile   Roy Jones jr is pretty much the undisputed king of what we consider the most athletic based fighter all time and crawford probably looks closer to roy does then loma   The conversation is actually pretty good because i think the likes of manny and loma are pretty athletic guys   The America fighters (african american) are known to base their whole style around their athleticism.
Crawford relies on a lot of footwork and movement too. Never flat footed
Both excellent body-punchers too.
Nah it would become like a game of chess with both boxers trying to score points to win.
Still quite long for Crawford's height.
After you stop dickriding Haney. You basically read nothing and just repeated yourself.   He can claim whatever the fuck he wants, ain't shit happen.
like in the kell brook fight? he dosent use footwork like loma does and he has no problem being on the backfoot, where loma needs to moving forward and at angles. He used to his footwork a lot more but not anymore.
You're the dick rider here.. I'm a fan of the both of them.   A fact that can't be disputed is haney/hearn were chasing loma since atleast 2019, loma wasnt interested in haney then and I provided proof.   Ciao 😄
Could have mentioned the porter fight instead . Used a lot of footwork .  Going back uses up even more energy
What can't be disputed is that ain't shit get made you clown. Keep using emojis like a tool.
You seem upset 😄
Wow, I thought Acosta was gonna win that one, but Cordova upset him.
Cordova 's punches just don't seem to bother Acosta
Didn't expect that win for Cordova. I actually thought Acosta probably pulled that out, but I'm a fan of Cordova now.  Love to see a fighter with no quit
I got tickets for the Acosta v Cordova fight tonight you guys think it’s gonna be any good
ProBox is growing on me, throw free fights and I’ll def watch
The Golden Boy card starting well but not sure about that point deduction
Rocha low-key confirming Spence-Crawford?
Upset kind of night
I'm curious how an AJ vs Jared Anderson fight would turn out.
 i recently bought a pair of winning gloves from winning usa website and realised i got the wrong colour and tried to email them to sort the issue out but they just keep responding with blank emails does anyone know what to do?
This card passing fast lol
It's a good week.  Boxing Wed night, Thur night, Fri night, early Sat, Sat. Night
I am warring glasses, is it okay to learn boxing? Or just need to cautious during sparring?
Lil Joey Dawejko broke Joshua in sparring. Ruiz getting credit when lil Joe KOed him that camp before Ruiz. He was running from Joe Parker in worse fight ever before Andy too. Ruiz is a myth at this point from casual fans using that as an excuse for Femi. Always been a scary man. Even Dubois and Price KOed him in sparring in his prime.
Does anyone know what shoes tank is wearing in these photos ??? [tank David wearing unknown Nike shoe](https://www.instagram.com/p/CqrS5z7pX-K/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=)
Does anyone know how to watch Stevenson vs Yoshino legally in Australia? For the life of me I can't find a source.  I don't like resorting to the high seas for good cards  but I honestly have no idea how to watch this one
no thread for Acosta v Whoever getting KO'd huh
Everytime I hit the bag, my arms hurt. Like when I do it repeatedly, do I just keep on doing it until I get used to it?
Why did Floyd make Snr his head trainer later in his career over Roger? I also saw in the Berto fight that Roger was in the crowd and it makes me wonder why Floyd didn’t have both Snr & Roger in his corner for his last bout. Is it like a “Let him have some spotlight” thing?
Yeah, with the point deduction, I just didn't see Cordova getting the win.  Really surprised
Yeah i dont really know how you score that for cordova. He was rocked multiple times, fighting dirty, spit his mouthpiece out alot, cut badly.  I will say acosta looked drunk tho most of the fight so idk.
It should be a fun little set of fights.  I think the other fights other than the main event are 4 or 6 rounds so should fly by.  Main event is a solid fight IMO, should be a good time.
Agree, although I did buy a subscription.  $18/year so I don't have to watch ads is worth it.  Plus, I want to support their efforts.
Too many unanswered questions. We actually know nothing about Anderson other than that he has a lot of potential. Chin? Gas tank? Heart? Coping with pressure? Too many unknowns imo
Give Anderson 3/4 years man cmon he's still green as hell. He's on the same trajectory as Dubious was in terms of opposition, and we all know what happened when Dubious stepped up to quickly to face Joyce. Let the man have 5/6 fights more and see where he's at. He does look very well rounded so far though I can't lie.  Perhaps Dubois Vs Anderson could be the next gen heavyweight clash in a few years time, but so many things could go wrong for both  Edit: people wanna clown on AJ too soon, he comfortably outpointed Franklin who is ranked higher than Anderson. Besides AJ gains nothing from that fight so not gonna happen, but AJ beats him rn imo
Anderson wins the ring walk.
Jared isn’t a finished product just yet but if he were to reach his potential he would wash AJ  But rn I’d take AJ by decision or possible stoppage
Too soon if we are talking about right now. Jared has potential, but he is waaaaay far behind at this point.
Anderson is levels above Franklin. That’s why they’d never fight him, they’ll fight chinless Whyte. Anderson isn’t that great but he schools AJ
Pulev AJ claps Anderson. Last fights AJ gets probably beat
Jared is still growing & learning but as much as I’d love to answer after his fight this Saturday, I’d honestly take Jared
Jared might get himself caught by AJ but the way AJ is ATM I think he is ripe pickings.
the latest version of aj would get smoked by big baby

It was just white on white and nobody could see it. Try to copy and paste the "blank" emails and see if they show up in a text or your notes or something.
Pretty entertaining ngl. All fights have been KO so far
Can’t wait for that Teraji fight and also Tenshin’s debut
The first ones look like HyperKo but I think its the Machomai 2s, the second ones are the air jordan 1 retro 85's chicago bulls colors
Welp, Acosta didn't win...
You'll get better answers in the amateur boxing subreddit
Good for Cordova though, not everyday you win an upset.
He showed good chin and heart in the Jerry Forrest fight  Got caught with some reckless shots that didn’t phase him and responded to them by upping the pressure and basically dominating until the ref pulled him off in round 2. Threw 114 power punches in the first round which could be indicator of a exceptional gas tank. Was a pretty sloppy performance but showed he could be a tank when he’s not boxing like usual.  Forrest went to a draw with Zhang, Michael Hunter, and lost narrowly to Jermaine Franklin
Franklin was a guy who never beat anybody and went to a draw before Whyte. He’s not even half the prospect of Anderson. Lmao AJ gets whipped easy
Jared hasn't fought anyone of worth yet so it's hard to speculate about his potential. I know we're hating on AJ right now but you have to predict Jared's evolvment very favorably to say he's ever going to wash, even this version of, AJ.
People said the same about Dubois until he stepped up and his level got shown. Let’s wait for Jared to fight a top 20 opponent at least before we say he has any capability of ‘washing AJ’ (a unified champion with the best current heavyweight resume).
Lol I like Anderson but if you genuinely believe he’d school aj even now then you’re doing some crazy ass drugs. Aj will smoke him and Andersons development would be derailed. Jared just had his very first 10 round fight and all his other fights were 8 rounds or less. We don’t even know if he can beat anyone else in the top ten including Franklin.
The only difference between “Pulev AJ” and “Franklin AJ” is the opponent. Pulev couldn’t take the power, Franklin could. If Franklin had showed any weakness then AJ would have tried to get him out of there but he didn’t so he stayed boxing tentatively behind the jab. Franklin was also answering back every time he got caught which Pulev didn’t do so AJ wouldn’t commit to his shots and combinations.
Yeah, me too.  Going to be a long Friday night.  Fights on Showtime before the Japan card
Its on private I can’t post
Yeah, he made a fan of me.
Any professional boxer can throw 100+ power punches on a heavy bag for a round and a half. Cmon let’s not do this Jerry Forrest is terrible. Zhang was literally suffering from kidney failure wasn’t he? Michael Hunter is semi retired. I would love to see Anderson fight Franklin next though. That will potentially answer some questions about how he would cope with a longer fight because the guy seems to have good whiskers and will spoil to survive. And if he blows him away even better he’s ready for the big dogs without those questions answered. Or even a Joseph Parker would be a nice fight now.
true. he's not even a 1/10th of the prospect Anderson is. he's been working full time and hasn't been able to fully commit to the career. but its based on who you've faced, and Anderson hasn't been under the pressure of a huge fight against a top 10. aj getting whipped easy is a stretch
I don’t like Anderson. AJ is a scared man. He will get smoke fast by Jared. AJs jab even looked pathetic. Too young delusional and Hungry Jared would be for AJ. Joshua was never that good in the first place though
Absolutely not. AJs feet were much worse, AJ was 15lbs heavier, he didn't feint, he was waiting for a big right hand all night etc. AJ was much worse and if you can't see that, you need a pair of glasses
And then a busy Saturday night with the Matchroom, PBC and Top Rank card.
I said it could be a SIGN. Didn’t say it was a certainty  And I’m not talking Forrest up like he’s some great opponent either, but look at the guys he’s fought  He went to a draw with Zhang and Michael Hunter, and lost a narrow decision to Jermaine Franklin. Jared finished him in two. If Jerry Forrest is terrible what do you think of those guys. He isn’t good but you’re being hyperbolic
AJ is terrified in there. Anderson would just put it on him and he’d fold. Franklin main weakness is he has 0 power, dudes chest lmao. Couldn’t bench 225, but Anderson is flawed..still hits harder than Usyk who also can’t punch. AJ is fighting guys who can’t punch and being scared lol.
Lol you’re just hating man. Jared hasn’t done jack shit for you to compare him to someone who’s a top 3 heavyweight. We don’t even know how he’d do vs a fringe top ten fighter like hrgovic zhang Dubois makhumudov bakole etc. I don’t think you’ve been keeping up with the division for long because objectively he’s been fighting the best competition around for years. Wilder can’t say that with his trash ass resume and fury took a hiatus to deal with ped and other issues. Aj would destroy him right now.
>AJ’s feet were much worse, AJ was 15 lbs heavier, he didn’t feint, he was waiting for a big right hand all night   Do me a favour. He was waiting for a big right hand all night because Franklin was countering him when he did throw which made him hesitant. Pulev came in with a high guard and marched around the ring like a heavy bag on legs and was CLEARLY more affected by AJ’s punches than Franklin was.   >if you can’t see that then you need a pair of glasses   You reached for the cusses straight away because I disagreed with your point? Maybe you were too busy stuffing your face with an XL bag of crisps to notice that JERMAINE FRANKLIN and KUBRAT PULEV do not fight the same at all and require different approaches? I bet you’re the type of fool who said shit like “IF AJ JUST FOUGHT USYK LIKE HE FOUGHT WHYTE THEN HE WOULD HAVE WON” before the second fight. 🤡
It's a beautiful thing!
You should know by now I’m incredibly hyperbolic with everything
Yeah just checked, the last good puncher AJ fought was Povetkin damn near 5 years ago. Pulev, Usyk and Franklin all can't punch. Even Ruiz don't really got power, only reason people think he's got power is cause he KO'd AJ lol
Joshua is not and never was a top 3 HW. He’s a myth. Beating Charles Martin for a belt and other belt was running from fat Andy Ruiz who didn’t team to be 2 time!!!  And other belt was from Joe Parker where he ran away and nothing happens for 12 rounds vs a corrupt Italian ref paid off by Hearn. Top 3 lmao
> You reached for the cusses straight away because I disagreed with your point? Maybe you were too busy stuffing your face with an XL bag of crisps to notice that JERMAINE FRANKLIN and KUBRAT PULEV do not fight the same at all and require different approaches? I bet you’re the type of fool who said shit like “IF AJ JUST FOUGHT USYK LIKE HE FOUGHT WHYTE THEN HE WOULD HAVE WON” before the second fight.  Damn, one day you get called a fatshamer on this sub and now I'm the fatass😂 but you know what, I started the insults so fair enough. but for context I'm an amateur fighter recently moved up 6'1" 81kg. And no, I did bet on Usyk winning, I also bet on Usyk winning the first fight and made a bit of money. There is levels to the game and Usy and AJ do not share the same one  Of course Pulev and Franklin don't fight the same and I never said so. The AJ in the Pulev fight was still much better.
This is what I mean. You don’t watch the division. He beat Martin parker and wlad for his 3 belts. and then lost them to ruiz and won them back. If you think having 3/4 belts doesn’t make you top 3 in the division you really don’t know what you’re talking about. You’re a hater.
Belts mean nothing like rankings mean nothing. Only Prime Wins matter and he goes 50-50 or loses to every one his age. Whyte is only one he KOed and Whyte even hurt him and is legit terrible at Boxing. Sky Sports hypejobs like UFC does and Eddie Hearn a good talker.
Lol they do matter. Always have and always will. That’s why legends like muhamed Ali, sugar ray leonard, duran, Holyfield etc are so great. They were champions that beat out everyone at the top. Titles and title defenses is as objective as you can get to proving you’re the best. Nobody gives a shit about your eye test.
yea they used to mean something. like stats used to mean shit in the NBA now any bum can drop 50 cause how easy the game is and cant get physical or play proper defense and how the game is designed. Modern Boxing the belts mean fucking nothing with how you get them. All vacant BS belts too like Joshua won himself
No arguments from me in regard to Kell's points, except for the part where he says he wants to fight again. That one's probs not a good idea.
Amir testing positive for trace amount of chin shouldn't be a surprise to anyone.
wow they are really close.
Boxing has enough trouble punishing fighters that have been caught with bans and such.  You start trying to retrospectively mess with their pay cheques it's going to get messy.  This is over and above the fact that I don't believe the administrations are as virtuous as they're supposed to be.  If you bring in the cash are they going to be lenient?  Maybe they'll go the opposite way and see the dollar signs and fine you more.  Like everything else in boxing it will be inconsistent and arbitrary which will just create more divisions in an already fragmented 'sport'.
Some kind of punishment beyond the “bans” they receive would be good. Although I suppose a properly held up ban would indeed cause financial pain.  Perhaps once a boxer fails a test ,for whatever reason , they have to have their testing regime made public knowledge and have a program they themselves pay for every one of their subsequent fights.   So if khan were to have a fight in the future using a model like this he would need to pay up front for 10 tests to be conducted by an accredited and reputable testing body. 5 tests would be for him to be tested in the lead up to his next fight. He would also have to pay for five tests that would be used elsewhere in the boxing landscape.   And each subsequent fight he pays for ten tests. Five for himself and five for boxing in general.   Under this model failed boxers are paying accredited companies to police their own careers and other professional fights.  Although there needs to be some cleaning up done by the people up top.   It’s just not transparent.  STRICT LIABILITY SIMPLY HAS TO STAY THOUGH.
I thought Amir Khan's names been cleared
It’s an interesting take for him to make the narrative about his own safety. I haven’t heard that before but he is right. Unlike other sports and PEDs, in this one you could cause real harm.
Cocaine is expensive.
I like it but oof

Now kiss
It's not too difficult to write that into contracts, that a failed drugs test results in a fixed fee fine or a gate percentage to either loser or winner. It's supposed to be noble sport...
The reason that isn’t a thing is because they both do it.
1. A bin man 2. A tescos factory worker 3. My mates gran 4. Baz from the pub 5. A short notice Mexican no one's seen 6. A fringe cruiserweight on short notice 7. Bogdan Dinu 8. Usyk (on a 80:20 split with Moses on the lions share)   In that order, take it or leave it.
Good to see should he pull through with eight fights.   Prospects should be doing that.
Think that’s how it should be if you’ve got a good prospect who’s too green to be put in there with anyone that good, don’t see the point in them only fighting three times a year if they’re just blowing people out in a round or two and not being tested
If he's after the record, can he do them all in one night?  Just Moses against 7 guys on the Joyce v Zhang undercard.
If he's knocking those guys out in one or two rounds, it should be doable. I don't see the point though
What he going to box a full three minutes?
wins all in a round. he's special. (i think)
Jay McFarlane would be a great opponent at this stage.
If he’s anything like he’s brother, he’ll be done, washed and on the tools by the end of the year.
Does frank warren have 8 shows to put on this year?. This is a serious question to
Putting a British fighter in with an unknown late replacement Mexican is the ultimate career suicide
Re number 8: Usyk's percentage drops by 1% each day he doesn't sign
Challenging for HW title at 18 if #8 is before year-end!
Where does Kevin Johnson fit into all of this?
> A short notice Mexican no one's seen  Getting the first loss out of the way early, I like how you think!
Shit that's how the greats did it back in the day. No need to destroy your body through hard training camps if your fighting so frequently.
Moses "Edgar Britlanga" Itauma
Amazing article. Thank you for this! :)
Amazing piece of history. Also Sonny Liston’s Q&A is too funny.
When is this from? It is written ''published in 2016'' but Patterson died in 2006.
Two good articles in one day
Did Patterson write this himself? This is wonderful
Pretty rough that he wrote an entire article “in defense” of a man and explicitly chooses to refer to him by the wrong name.
Thanks man. Great article.
“How’d you get my number anyway?” Lmao
Aug, 1966
The fighter and the poet are often one and the same.
I mean in the article he did say that Ali gave him permission to call him Cassius
Just because he defended him in one part doesn't mean he has to acknowledge him in everything
word. calling someone by their dead name is mad disrespectful.
Which is kinda ironic considering the first fight there was an entire shitshow of Ali wanting to punish Patterson of insisting of calling him Clay instead of Ali.  Guess they put down the axe after the fight.
He asked Ali’s permission to call him Clay, and Ali gave it. Patterson respected Ali.
> licitly chooses to refer to him by the wrong name.  Easy to judge someone by modern standards. The world was a lot different in 1966.   Ali even gave him permission to call him Cassius, it says so in the article
lol
It's not a dead name lol. Clueless
Great to know, thank you
You have no idea what you're talking about.
dead name verb: deadname  call (a transgender person) by their birth name when they have changed their name as part of their gender transition.     "he was addressed with the wrong pronouns and deadnamed"
It's literally not just for transgender people, buddy. Fool.
It is though, it means something specific. Just take the L and move on mate.
You're literally wrong.
Citation needed
Crazy that you never came back with any evidence lol.
A real article. Thank you
Great share - thanks! He's somehow both over and underated in terms of legacy. I listened to a podcast where the journalist Neil Kulkarni talks about the barriers Naz broke in terms of stereotypes of Asian/Arab kids in England including the fact that they could be tough.
Remember when he ruined the that guy's life by driving into him then running off?  Helluva fighter though. He was huge over here in the 90's. I wish he would have took training with Brendan Ingle more seriously and stuck with him for the Bareara fight.
Newlines usually has really great articles. Mostly focused on conflicts in the Middle East but they do a bit of everything
Man he was fun to watch. What happened to fighters like he and Roy Jones Jr? Seems like that style of fighter died with the 90's.
A very interesting read, thanks.
GOAT
Poor guy punched too hard for his own hands. I love how people shit on him for losing 8-4 to MAB like that makes you some sort of bum.
Brendan ingle was a diamond god rest his soul
I would guess it’s almost impossible to teach unorthodox styles (and be successful).   Sergio Martinez, Ali, Toney, Mayweather, Augustus, prime Gamboa, and Walcott all had very unique fighting styles. It isn’t for everyone. Look how many fighters would struggle even just trying to effectively fight out of Mayweather’s shoulder roll.
I was a big fan of Nas back in the day, and some people do make fun of him but mostly it’s not because of the loss, it’s because of the documentary he made prior to that fight. He came across so badly in it that people wanted him to lose. I think between that, the Barrera loss, 9/11, and the brittle hands he was basically done at a crazily young age, which was a shame.
Poor guy did a hit and run. He is a fat bum.
In terms of taking fighters from childhood to world titles there's very few that can compare to him
Tyan Booth speaks highly of him (for what that's worth!). Towards the end of his career, Naz disappeared up his own arse, which is a real shame. He was still fairly young and could have had a lot of great fights.
Boxing as a sport needs to be way more transparent with it's anti-doping policy if it is to be adhered to.  Around the same time Conor Benn popped, Simona Halep (Tennis star) also popped and was immediately suspended, pending investigation.  How do other sports have it figured out, when the consequences are much less severe? Boxing needs to decide whether they care about doping or not. The approach so far is just half-hearted.
Yeah, it shouldn't take a fucking year for an "independent panel" to review a result. 😂   (Unless I'm misunderstanding)
Now ask them about Anthony Joshua’s TUE for testosterone that he didn’t even deny the 1 time was asked and never been asked about it again. Joshua been on TRT since early 20s and nobody brings it up. UK boxing shady as it gets
He got bopped by Crawford and knew it was the juice or hanging it up, now it’s both.
I am not condoning any kind of cheating. But false TUE’s are a little different to illegal drug taking.  If you’re getting false t.u.e then yes it’s cheating and likely is for performance enhancing but it’s more like an abuse of power and bureaucracy than full on taking  of illegal substances.   I would have thought that t.u.e have to be submitted to some body and can therefore be reviewed? In which case it’s less cat and mouse than taking PED’s. (Although admittedly I don’t know how t.u.e work)   Either way boxing is a mess and its hard to be interested right now.  I was so hyped on boxing until recently. When the you tubers we’re getting in on the action boxing media was awash with belly aching about how it’s not real etc etc. perhaps it’s the sport of boxing that’s not real anymore and YouTube fights fit right into this sports entertainment landscape.
Is there any evidence for this?
You shouldn’t be allowed to box if you’re on legal steroids. That’s what they did in UFC for few years cause Dana needle White recommended it for exciting fights for Forrest Griffin since sold PPVs lol. It was so unfair had to ban cause dudes jacked up levels to inhuman limits during camp then brought down to “legal” limits for fight and those legal limits are test of a 17 year old boy lmao. Whyte said he knew for a fact AJ had a TUE in training camp years ago and someone asked and he didn’t deny. Having a TUE is even better for cheating cause can mask a lot and you can cheat easier all camp and still be on juice during the fight “legally”. I think Tyson Fury has one now too apparently from Dr Usman dude
Joshua may well have used TUE. But I don’t think the guy is juicing. His physique has remained the same or similar throughout his career and while I don’t know how many tests he takes I can only hope he’s getting tested a bit.  Now take someone like Connor McGregor.  His physique has changed dramatically. That doesn’t mean to say he’s been using PED’s, it’s just suspicious. Also we know he’s not enrolled in anti doping for times in his career.  Perhaps someone else can clarify but In the ufc - tue was being handed out legitimately in relation to testosterone I think. At the time doctors were happily providing ufc athletes with tue’s who complained of low libido and other testosterone related things. This meant tue were easy to get .
Crazy robbery at the end there, wow. Glad the commentators straight up called it corrupt and a shame.  Hope that gets some traction
The best thing about boxing is it's almost always happening. I need a 24/7 boxing channel on TV.
This slipped by, it's not listed on boxrec, is it sanctioned?  In any case, here's the YouTube description:  Wednesday Night Boxing is back on April 5th, live from Mexico City, Mexico, returns with a night of action-packed fights.   In the main event, welterweight Carlos “Tiburon” Sanchez (23-1, 19 KOs) of Baja California, Mexico, will face undefeated Alexander Duran (21-0, 7 KOs), of Panama City, Panama, in a ten-round bout,   Carlos Sanchez has been incredibly busy fighting six times since 2020 with his only loss in his career coming to Pedro Campa in an exciting fight. Sanchez is out to prove that he belongs at the top of the division and is eager to show his loss was an anomaly.    Duran, on the other hand, has never learned how to lose. Fighting exclusively in Panama for his entire career,    The co-feature will be a six-round battle of bantamweights as Brandon “King” Reyes (6-0, 2 KOs), of Mexico City, Mexico, will face crosstown rival Abraham Arreola (5-2, 4 KOs), of Mexico City, Mexico. Not just is this a competitive fight, but this bout also has bragging rights on the line as to who is the best-emerging bantamweight coming out of Mexico City.    The TV opener will feature Rogaciano Guerrero (6-2-1, 5 KOs), of Mexico City, taking on Eduardo “Lalo” Martinez (10-1, 7KOs), of Mexico in a ten-round TV opener.
There's a live card on DAZN tomorrow night.
All the Probox cards are sanctioned.  They have cards every 2 weeks now.
Probox TV is a partnership between Garry Jonas, Roy Jones Jr., Juan Manuel Marquez, Antonio Tarver and Paulie Malignaggi. These days you see way more of Paulie Malignaggi on the fight nights. I'm honestly surprised it hasn't been more popular given the ridiculously low price and the names behind it (I paid something like $20 for a year). Lots of former prospects, a lot of decent matchups and solid commentary.
Horn managed to establish the headbutt early in this fight.
Jeff Horn would go on to win the fight in a controversial decision and win the WBO belt.   Jeff Horn would defend his welterweight championship once before losing it in a matchup with Terrence Crawford. Crawford still holds this belt today.
Bob us a snake for robbing Pacqiaou so many times.
One judge hat this fight 111-117. this was on of the biggest robberies in boxing history. Pacquiao landed twice as many punches in almost every round.
Horn got the robbery, Bradley got the robbery against Pac-Man.  He's still one of the greatest of all time, and also one of the most disrespected by these judges.
Teddy Atlas on the verge of a stroke all the way through
Damn this was already 6 years ago..
What's really funny is the staged drama after the fight. Horn had already prepared a glove and a cane then calls out Floyd. "Floyd Would you choose a glove or a cane".. LMAO.  Everything was already planned that night and they are 100% sure of it.  And even if he get KO'ed he'd still win; they'll just have to wake him up to tell the prepared speech for Floyd.
Pacman got robbed too many times
Ppl don’t even recognize horns win over pacquaio lol. They remember him more for getting beat by Michael zerafa.
We need the guy with the AI/computer vision scoring thing for this one to stir the pot a bit on this one 😁
lol my dad and brother stopped watching after the 12th round, not even watching the decision. I told them that horn won, lol they were like wtf.
I remember the ref wanted to stop the fight after this round or maybe it was after the next. When the fight was over I thought surely Pac was the winner. Walked outside smoked a cigarette and came back to see Horn with his hands in the air celebrating victory. As somewhat of a casual fan, this was the first highway robbery I think I remember seeing.
This is just Bob trying to Bradley Pacquiao all over again. Stretch a nonsense match up 3 times and keep things in house. Glad Pacquiao bailed out after.
Bigger robbery than the Bradley one in my opinion
I hate to be sort of conspiracy theorist-y, but I feel like there was definitely some incentive to put Horn against Bud and somehow, they had to figure out a way to make that happen.
Rewatched the full fight a couple months back I scored it 8-4  or 7-5 pacquiao. Was a much more interesting fight I thought Horn gave Manny a lot of issues. Teddy was clearly biased and just acting like an angry kid that entire commentary.
Teddys post fight interview was historic. Fix was in.
But Jeff horn won!!! /s
One of the most blatant robberies ever.
They should be able to go back and change the results of bullshit fights. Fix Manny's record.
A truly historical moment in modern boxing, but not in a good way lol.
Will always love teddy atlas
Does anyone have a good training video for Mannys style? I like to do boxing workouts and seems like his style would be great cardio to copy.
Fucking robbery.
Teddy Atlas screaming at the end with Timothy Bradley looking awkward as hell next to him was a thing of beauty
Highway robbery
2008 Pacquiao would...
bro got battered by Manny from Diary of a Wimpy Kid
I remember how full of himself Jeff was after he won, from then on I'm pretty sure everybody saw him as a complete clown
Robbery.
I watched the fight live and thought Horn won a close one.  It seems to be a popular thing to claim that Pacquiao won.  Perhaps, but I didn't see it that way.
I saw this live and I was pretty concerned heading into this round but I was concerned from the perspective of expecting a Pacman exhibition and instead I was surrounded by thousands of increasingly hepped up Queenslanders.  It was too hard from a distance to really tell what was going on but it didn't seem like Pac was dominating.  This round was a clear domination but then it went back to being...'unclear'?  I've never watched footage.  I'm surprised at how 'not washed out' it looks because in person it was BRIGHT that day.
I still don’t agree with that decision. Not a robbery but most definitely a hometown favor.
I watched the fight and thought Horn did barely enough to edge it. Pac seemed to be off that night, and the referee was allowing Horn to do anything.  I couldn't believe it was happening. But that is what I saw.  I know it isn't a popular take.   Hell, the narratives about this fight got so crazy, that Australia got a reputation for home cooking from that single event. Even though none of the 9 officials (the ref, the 3 judges, the 5 judges who did the 'review') were Australian. People went insane and stayed that way.  Boxing fans can be mental.  Edit: please downvote if you are a nutcase.
The great Australian robbery
To make matters worse this also wasnt a ppv fight if I recall.
Bob arum always does this. When he has an aging star, he puts him in with his young guy he wants to build. He did it with manny twice and with loma off the top of my head. He was gonna do it with bud and josh Taylor next
Teddy Atlas is the fucking goat commentator
Watched this a few times, 3 different broadcasts. Was a close fight and Teddy Atlas was the only guy screaming robbery in any of them. Was also 50/50 here on who should have got the W but seems to have changed over time, as people trot or statements like "biggest robbery in boxing history".
People who watched the US version, with Teddy Atlas's disgraceful commentary, thought Pacquiao won easily. If you watch without the biased commentary you'll see a close fight that could have gone either way.  I love Pacquiao. One of my favourite fighters, but this wasn't a robbery. Watch it without Teddy's nonsense & score it round by round.   Atlas was removed from doing ringside commentary after this, and rightly so.
Idk how this wasn’t a 10-8 round.
people forget horn was a teacher who boxed as a hobby. he held his own against guys who were boxing since they were kids & had a career at 16. pretty impressive you can’t doubt that
L
I thought Horn lost the fight, but he put in a great showing in this fight and actually made it pretty close and competitive. Judging by the rest of his career and comparing this to how Thurman did against an even older Pacman, Horn really overperfomed here and greatly exceeded expectations.
The last time we saw Teddy on ESPN fights. Their loss though.
Atlas is such a great commentator, damn. We need him for more fights
Thought it was a close fight.   To those who are of the same view and being down-voted to oblivion - no, you're not crazy or wrong.  It's just that the subject and title of this post would attract the tunnel-visioned, biased, and emotion driven fans, like flies to shit.
It was slow on the timing, but he likes to work into it.
Never seen so many cuts on the top of a fighters head.
It was a set up by Arum to give the belt to Crawford because he didn't think Crawford could beat Manny. So he takes Manny to Australia where Horn gets gifted a hometown victory and then feeds him to Crawford. Then Manny and Top Rank part ways
The state of boxing. Smh
is it bob or just trash judges???
PoS Arum tried so hard to build horn and Bradley off Pacquiao.. problem was they fn suck… all the smart boxers avoid arum now.
this is why im weary of boxers fighting in other countries. too many robberys
Bradley won the fight fair and square. You can't stay dormant for the first 2 minutes of every round and expect to win by decision.
you must really love alex jones  everyone prepares to win, every single person who loses an award has a speech ready for when they win  some of yall are broken in the brain
his miracle win over zerafa [in the rematch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4dbdBFX0R8&t=7s) was far more memorable
No conspiracy there, Bob has been trying to get those belts off of Pacquiao for a while
Stop mimicking the mods who put up Horn's image in the banner yet love to distribute a disgraceful flair KO flair without a good alternative lol
Word. Take two of those "wins" he had against Marquez to rightful losses.
It was a wash out. I think every commentator had a clear Pacquiao win. I've never spoken to anyone who said Horn won that fight. Remember that to take a belt from a champion you have to defeat him. Horn didn't come close to that. He got a few punches in but that's it, no domination in any round. It's the thing I hate about boxing, is the incentive to keep it unfair and corrupt. It won't change for as long as these fossils have power
I was there too and can confirm I couldn't see shit lol I was extremely far from the ring:  [Suncorp](https://i.imgur.com/jYCfgcX.jpg)
It is not a popular take because you and the Judges are wrong my Guy.   Pacquiao out landed Horn two to one.   Fact is this win was 100% home cooking.
I'm probably gonna be down-voted to oblivion like you, but I agree with your take on this. Was a close fight and my opinion is that horn did barely enough to edge this. To the people who believe the fight was won by Pacquiao one-sidedly, and the match was not close at all, I have no idea what fight they were watching
A close fight that could have gone either way? You must have not only watched without sound but without picture too.   Pacquiao outlanded Horn two to one in the fight.   This fight is the definition of a robbery
Personally I did score it for Pacquiao but it could've gone to Horn. Certainly not a robbery.
Nobody is ready to have that conversation especially pac fans who run a hall of fame defense for this fight.
No. The guy was dirty and headlocked Pacquiao a million times. That, along with the headbutt and home town crowd cheers, skewed the judges decision. Had the ref done his job, this would not be a close fight at all. As it is, the compubox numbers were hilariously one-sided.
I remember the punch stats in this fight where Pacquiao outlanded Horn two to one.  I don't know if this was Ole Bob's doing or just some good old Aussie home cooking.  It  was a disgrace no matter how it went down.
> he didn't think Crawford could beat Manny  lol, or the judges just suck.
It wasn't about Crawford not being able to beat Manny - it was about forcing Manny to re-sign with TR to get the rematch.  Same with Bradley 1. Bob knew the Mayweather fight was on the horizon and wanted his slice - but then Pac got KO'd in a layup and iced the plans.
you really think manny would beat crawford? Thats a horrible stylistic matchup for manny whos gonna have no reach advantage and fighter that charge in like manny does have had little success vs crawford.
Sure it was. Crawford would've beaten Pacquiao fairly easily.
The same as with Teofimo Lopez, George Kambosos, Devon Haney situation
That's quite an elaborate conspiracy you've thought out there. One thing I want to ask, do you really think Bob Arum knew beforehand that this dude Jeff Horn was even capable of going the distance with Manny, nevermind having enough success to get "gifted" a hometown victory?   I think it's much more likely that Arum had nothing to do with it, and Horn simply won "the story of the fight" so to speak, and swayed the judges opinions each round by making Manny, one of the greatest fighters of all time, look very uncomfortable (by mostly using dirty tactics) and also showing heart by coming back from that beating he took in round 9. It was the fight of his life, and probably one of the worst performances from Manny, apart from that one round where he beat the snot out of him.
lmfao
"He takes manny to australia"     Bob Arum is a promoter. He is not a manager. He does not decide where or who Manny fights. Manny took that fight and the promoter made money off it because Jeff Horn is popular in Australia. The questionability of the decision falls on the local athletic commission.
Hmmm not true. Mannys team turned down Crawford back then. Roach himself said he did not want Manny fighting Crawford. That was a horrible style matchup for him.
Crawford would have obliterated this version of Pacquiao, and I say that as a diehard Pacquiao fan.
Then manny should have knocked him out
[removed]
It happens at home as well.
No he didn't.  There was absolutely nothing fair and Square about the Bradley win.  Same with Horn.
Dormant? Lmfao
Lmao not even remotely true
He’s talking about the outcome of the fight being fixed you invalid
Pac fought everyone in their own backyards on their own terms, became a legend a d still got robbed several times, it made me quit watching boxing for years because of it  Last straw was when GGG got robbed by that 118-110 card in his canelo fight....
Blame pacquiao for refusing to comply to the testing schedule. Dude is on record saying that he doesn’t want to take a blood test the day before the fight just because he did the same Vs Morales and lost, saying it “made him weak”. It’s funny how only mayweather gets the blame for that fight not happening but I can’t say I’m surprised because most boxing fans just parrot narratives. Also whilst we’re talking about the Horn fight it’s funny how there was no testing involved in that aswell and horn’s camp had concerns about it.
Mayweather did not duck pac. Ydksab
You're downvoted but you're right. Some of us have noticed that ugly stuff throughout the years. Hell look at the old version of the sub. Mouse over every boxer in the header and it's their colored picture version. Mouse over Inoue and it's somebody else.
wont change as the fossil before them did the same shit
How is it home cooking when it got reviewed afterwards by a panel of 5 judges who came to the same outcome?  There are some takes on this fight which I can respect. You can think Pac won. You can think the ref was awful. You can think that there was a home advantage. I can probably agree with points you would make, and think your take on it was fair.  You can even think that Arum had a hand in it, and that he fixed the fight. I mean, I don't want to be some conspiracy theorist, but Arum is a corrupt turd and I wouldn't be surprised by anything he did.  But calling it home cooking, when it got reviewed by a panel of 5 judges afterwards, who weren't there being influenced by the crowd and all? Nah, that isn't a position I can respect.  Stating that the 8 judges combined came to the wrong conclusion (I think 1 of them gave it to Pac?) but that the untrained monkeys mashing buttons for compubox are 100% reliable and their results are some gospel? Nah, I can't respect that.  Acting like it was some domination by Pac instead of a close, ugly fight? Nah, I can't respect that.  I've been on all the major boxing forums, some since 2002, and I have seen every kind of stupid boxing fan. I've seen how many of them there are, and just how proudly ignorant they get. I learned to stop arguing with them - so this is my last post on this topic.  Currently I have been downvoted by some folk who DKSAB. They'll downvote this too, and there will be more to come. There are plenty more mouth breathers out there. Keep it coming lads, I've not cared about the opinions of idiots since I was a child. As for these dregs of boxing fans? No-one gives a damn what they think.
Outlanded Horn two to one.  The definition of a robbery..
Not to mention Horn's face after the match. Compared to Manny's face, Horn looked like an aged plum.  Horn also went to the hospital that night. While Manny had dinner with his wife
Bingo
The fight was officially reviewed after the fact and it came to the same results - that Horn won.
>I remember the punch stats in this fight where Pacquiao outlanded Horn two to one.  Same shit happened in Pacman's first fight with Bradley where he got screwed over as well (similar stats, Pacquiao had landed twice as many shots as Bradley yet Bradley got the decision).  Fucking disgrace.
A little of both. Bob really didn't want Manny to leave Top Rank
Definitely Bob. I always found it strange that he was the one reading the paper that said who won after the Re-score. What a load of crap.
A layup? C'mon now I agree with the rest but at no point was Marquez ever considered an easy fight.
Marquez was a fucking master in the ring. Calling the Marquez fight a layup is extreme ignorance.
Bro only watched the last 3 seconds of the fight
Not sure why you got downvoted, I too do see Crawford beating Manny
both  and the only way is to remove them from the industry root and branch. but thatll never happen and bobs old ass will just have to age out entirely
[removed]
Sir this is a boxing match
Go watch it again, and count how many flush punches land each round. Then make a judgment call on if Pacs handful of punches in the last 60 seconds did enough damage to wash away dozens of scoring punches over the entire round from Bradley.  And turn of your sound while you're at it. The commentators were so on Pacs nuts, they could tell us the make and model of his Cup.  Before anyone says "this isn't amateurs, it's not just scoring points", yes, I'm quite aware. Pac was the scarier fighter for sure. Way more potential for a KO. But he didn't do shit that fight. There were 2-3 exchanges the entire fight where Pac landed some decent shots. You can give him those rounds. But the rest of the fight, he was out worked by at least 3x to 4x the punches and didn't land anything significant enough to take the round.  And watch the clock. He consistently slept through the first 2 minutes of most rounds, and would just turn it on for the last 60 seconds to try to steal the round.  But sure, just downvote. It was your boys fight to lose, and he lost it.
I know lol he's saying that horns having that prepared for when he won means thats evidence it was fixed  that's fucking idiotic lol
Nah, those are fanboys. The real fans that actually followed the sport back in those days know.   It was always Manny. He made random blood testing an issue. And lets be honest, if a dude declines a drug test it's usually for a reason....
I think in the Bradley fight, Manny took his foot off the gas in the last few rounds, and that made the fight closer than it should have been. It has been years since I watched it, though.
Most punches doesn't mean you win. That's not how boxing is scored
Yeah, that was a silly comment. Marquez always, always gave Pacquiao problems.  Hence why they had 4 fights.  Marquez arguably should've won 1, maybe even 2 of the previous 3 fights as well.
Yes, of course. But it doesn't change the narrative around that fight. Please look up articles written before the 4th fight.
Didn't call Marquez anything.   Pacquiao was supposed to batter the 39 year old and everybody was questioning why the fight should happen. Just because Marquez is good doesn't change the fact that that fight was  set up in the expectation Pacquiao would win.
[removed]
you typed all those things and still wrong.
If he is saying that then yea he’s thick as pig shit, I think he’s just saying that Horn knew he’d be saying the speech win or lose
Watched the Bradley fight live, and went back to watch this fight after all the commotion, Pacquiao should have won both fights without question regardless of punch stats.
No one was questioning why Pac Marquez 4 was happening? Have you only just started watching boxing? Everyone wanted that fight at the time as Marquez had just been robbed in the 3rd fight.
Anybody who watched boxing back then and followed the careers of both fighters knew that the 4th fight wasn't going to be a walk in park for Pac. He had trouble with Marquez to varying degrees in the first three fights and it was well expected that the 4th fight could be more of the same. Only those who had no idea what they were talking about or Pac super fans were expecting Pac to all of a sudden blast Marquez out of the ring when he failed to do so in the first 3 competitive fights between the pair.
That was the thought going into the 3rd fight, as Pac was surging at his peak and Marquez was looking older and fighting in a lower divsion.

jan 6 edit huh?  again w the reading comprehension  *how about you read the post*  where i specifically called out jan sixers for being manipulated and said we should feel sorry for them and go after the actual criminal in trump  can you see how ironic it is that in your rush you proved *again* you cant read?  seriously. go back to school. people in your life are laughing at you thinking you're smart and you dont know
Would have preferred to see him step in for Stanionis, but that's definitely short notice.   Gonna stay peeled for the Davis v Garcia broadcast to... Nah, I won't say it.
He has to fight his mandatory to keep his belt. If hes fighting another champion then he can bypass the mandatory. This is a good sign to me
🤫 nothing to see here
Wait a minute surely this can't be right? This sub told me Crawford vs rocha was next /sarcasm
I don't give a shit anymore
Yeah cause David avenesyan was def his mandatory 😂
Lovely, after Spence Crawford a number of fighters deserve title shots, hopefully they get it over the line and fight by the summer. Rocha isn’t one of the young guys I was thinking about but ennis stanionis ortiz(once he figures out rabdo) it’s time for them even Crowley deserves atleast an interim shot or something
So it's a mandatory that is not mandatory?
Errol Sprints hype train dickriders gonna cry lol
theyll move up to 154 more than likely, at least errol will.  If bud wins hell drop some of the belts eventually because of sanctions fees.
Mandatories have never been mandatories
Unification bouts trump mandatories
He also just took a mandatory. Avanesyan  was also a mandatory
Sprints vs Crawfish
Yea tears of joy when bud gets knocked down in the first 6 rounds 😂😂
I’ll explain it to you later
I read about this so long ago, apparently Ingemar’s camp was furious Ali was sparring like he was the champion, he straight up styled on Johansson in his own camp
This took place in Ingo's training camp for the third Patterson fight.
Ali > fury
Wonder what was Johansson's reaction when he heard Bob Foster bent Ali over in sparring in the same time period.
He convulsed and urinated uncontrollably
Sugar Ray Robinson had a dream the day before fight night that he killed his opponent Jimmy Doyle with a left hook. The next day he was so scared that he refused to fight him. His promoters brought a priest to convince him to fight. It worked and that same night Robinson hit Jimmy with a left hook that had him carried out in a stretcher. Jimmy was dead the next day.
Favourite is Evander Holyfield or his team saying that George Foreman telegraphs his punches. Foreman quipped: "Yeah, I telegraph 'em, but the message gets through."
A few:  George Foreman was so haunted by his loss to Ali in the Rumble in the Jungle, he wore the same shorts he wore in Zaire in the 70s when he fought Moorer in the 90s... and won the title back.  Someone who knew Rocky Marciano told me he used to chew his food, suck out the juices & spit the rest out.  (Why, I do not know.)  Riddick Bowe is the only linear heavyweight champion to never he knocked down or knocked out in a world title fight.  Max Schmelling was a pallbearer for Joe Louis.  When Mike Tyson was released from prison, he weighed a little less than 190 pounds.  Gerrey Cooney was (allegedly) gonna receive a congratulations call from President Ronald Reagan if he beat Holmes for the title.  When Holmes won, he didn't receive a call from the White House.  Roberto Duran (allegedly) knocked out a horse.
One of my favorites was how in 1980, Sugar Ray Leonard had already fought at the top Olympic level and beat Wilfred Benitez for the Welterweight title, but when Duran punched him, it felt like an entire different strength completely.
I've seen a few anecdotes from late 90s heavyweights that sparred the likes of Holyfield, Tyson, Lewis, Wlad Klitschko etc. They said Tyson and Lewis hurt when they landed but they didn't realise Klitschko had landed till they were waking up from the canvas.
Back in the mid 2010’s, I remember Freddy Roach talking about Pitbull Gomez being his most promising fighter at the moment, but that he would disappear for months without notice. That same weekend, I ran into him at a bar south of the border.   😂 he was really nice and even invited me to hang out with him and his boys for the night. Not a big star, but I just can’t get over the fact that someone would abruptly quit right before making millions. He was almost certainly going to get a championship fight.   Crazy
Dave Allen was knocked out on his feet by Usyk in sparring and started snoring. Finished the spar and said he didn't remember anything that happened after for a while. He was basically sparring on autopilot whilst seriously concussed.
George Foreman is one of the most mind blowing characters in boxing:  Has five son's and he named them all George.  Has made more money by endorsing a kitchen product (Foreman grill, approx 250mil$ ) than entire boxing career (apparently Hulk Hogan was offered the grill gig first but opted for another product to endorse.)  Started Training at 16, won Olympic gold at 18.  Retired at age of 28 to become a Christian minister for 10 years, upon coming back to boxing set the record for oldest heavyweight champion which still stands.  There is a film coming out this month about him as well [https://youtu.be/urKDu40iaXk](https://youtu.be/urKDu40iaXk)
Vinny Pazienza said Roberto Duran hit harder than Roy Jones. Duran was 43 when they fought, Roy was 26.
Archie Moore used a bent license plate as his protective cup for years. He also ran a chicken shack when he took a break from fighting, I think he had serious ulcers.
When SRL did the 7up commercial with Duran he was expecting the atmosphere to be difficult but Duran turned out to be very kind and personable to SRL’s son and professional through the filming of it.
My boxing coach had a training session with Juan Manuel Márquez and said that Márquez was a DOG.
After fighting Ali, George Chuvalo said, "Ali went to the hospital. I went out dancing with my wife."
Two would-be muggers jumped 76-year-old Jack Dempsey in New York and he knocked them both out.
When Stanley Ketchel was shot in the back and killed by a jealous boyfriend, his manager reportedly said, "Tell them to start counting ten over him. He'll get up."
Shane Mosley has two older sisters named Venus and Serena
It's the quotes that always stick with me.   Jack Dempsey has a few great ones - after losing to Gene Tunney was sat in a dark room drinking when his wife got home and saw his face. She asked him what happened and he said:  "Baby I just forgot to duck."   After KOing Jack Sharkey while he was complaining to the referee about fouling:  "What was I supposed to do, write him a letter?"  About fighting Harry Greb, "the Pittsburgh Windmill" he said something along the lines of:  "It's like being in a boxing glove factory when all the shelves start falling over"  Joe Louis also has a pretty memorable one about how he felt serving in a US army which was still segregated:  "Lots of things wrong with America, Hitler ain't gonna fix any of them though."
Yvon Durelle the Canadian Light Heavy was a fisherman from rural New Brunswick.   He tells a story about going to New York for his first big fight. He was doing his runs in a nearby park in preparation for the bout and he ran into two beautiful black women. Durelle hit it off and they had a wonderful time and was up the entire night. This was of course the night before the big fight.   He later found out the manager of the opponent had hired a couple women. Durelle was disappointed to find out but still told everyone this story. And I mean everyone.   He told 80% of Baie-Sainte-Anne that story.  Even put it in his book.   Durelle obviously considered this one of the high points of his career.   I think it might had been the first fight with Archie Moore or maybe the fight with Floyd Patterson.   Archie and Durelle would do the paid dinner circuit and Thai story was a staple.
My favorite anecdotes to keep track is the wife/gf beatings that great fighters are guilty of just to show you can't idolize anyone in boxing, especially Muhammad Ali.  https://www.reddit.com/r/boxingcirclejerk/comments/10prqac/who_is_the_greatest_women_beater_of_all_time/j6n9erz?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3
Joe Frazier at the end of the Thrilla in Manila said he hit Ali with body shots that would have brought down a city. I’ve always remember that. For one, I believe Joe when he says that. Two, Ali was a tough mf’er.
When Evander Holyfield stood up to Tyson at the Olympic trials:    'We were in Texas training for the Olympics. I'd made the team, Tyson was the alternate. We were shooting pool. He lost to a fellow named Bennie Heard, and I had the next game. Well, he had an attitude, he wanted to take the pool cue from me.  I'd seen him take the pool cue from others. Tyson says to me, 'I'm playing.' I told him, 'You ain't taking this stick from me.' He became mad and started pacing. I'd noticed that when he's pacing, it means he's mad. I told him, 'Look here, Tyson. You ain't taking this stick. You might as well stop being mad.'  He looked at me. All of a sudden, he starts laughing. Fact of the matter is, he didn't want to be that way, but he was using to having it that way. When he was mad, there were not too many people who would talk back to him.'  - Evander Holyfield
Lennox Lewis is big into crocheting.
Before Chuck Wepner fought Ali, Wepner told his wife "tomorrow night you'll be sleeping with the heavyweight champion of the world." When he came back to the hotel room after the fight, she asked him "will Mr. Ali be coming to my room or am I to go to his?"
During one of the trilogy fights with Mickey Ward, the ring doctor tested Arturo Gatti to make sure he could see out of his swollen eyes. He couldn’t see out of one of them, so his coach tapped his leg the number of fingers the ring doc held up so that he could keep fighting.   That’s like such a reckless thing to do but also doesn’t surprise me at all.
Houston police once arrested Cleveland Williams in 1959 for attacking his first wife, Gwendolyn Scott, with a meat cleaver. When his wife refused to press charges, Cleveland went to the police station, asked for, and received the very same meat cleaver he attacked his wife with.    Speaking of domestic violence, Bob Satterfield was once successful in getting a restraining order against his ex-wife, Iona Satterfield, telling the judge that she was "some battler."
I saw Terence Crawford at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, “Quack quack?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “Quack? Quack? Quack?” and closing his mouth shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him waddle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen bags of duck sauce in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be quacking and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bags and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and quacked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bag and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by quacking really loudly.
My favourite but apocryphal: Joe Frazier bumps into Kenny Norton and his wife at a party; Ken announces that they're gonna have a baby. Joe utters excitedly, "*Congratulations! Who's the father?*"  \^ (Dang, I'm not even sure I got the boxers right [sad face emoji, dementia brain] Anyone wanna correct me? I am 99% sure though that this is a popular story among prizefighters)  Honourable mention: '.' [Tony Thompson's poor wife!](https://youtu.be/J75cOATq_w0?t=47).

Pacquaio before the Marquez 4, he dreamt of riding a horse and he has been successfully leaping from mountains to mountains but there's one that he tried to cross but fell short. He fell off the cliff and got KOed.  Then the Marquez KTFO happened.
That Aj is a chess grandmaster
“everyone has a plan till they get punch in the mouth”   - Michael Gerard Tyson
George Foreman said he dreamed of his dogs ice-skating to George Plimpton before the rumble in the jungle (he's not really my favourite anything due to his history of being an abuser and a horrible violent brute though.) My favourite fighters are probably David Haye, the Klitschko brothers, Usyk etc.
I remember that story. That was heartbreaking.
I believe he used the money from his next few fights to buy Doyle’s mom a house. Tragic story.
Even though it sounds made up, it is true. There is audio of Sugar Ray himself talking about it.
The details are so creepy. He dreamed Doyle's corpse lay in the opposite corner and then the ring tilted and it slid towards him
After being accused of fixing the Moorer fight, George said "Sure, the fight was fixed. I fixed it with a right hand".
Duran denied having knocked out a horse. He said he knocked down a horse on a bet when he was 15. Duran, presumably, not the horse.
Archie Moore used to chew the food and spit out the food and swallow only the juices in order to make weight.
When you said Tyson weighed 190 after prison, are you referring to after his rape conviction? The guy was definitely juicing to get back to 220 lb that quickly then.
I remember reading about Rocky Marciano training regime and I was surprised to read he would eat only one large meal at the end of the day.  No three meals. Just one.
>Someone who knew Rocky Marciano told me he used to chew his food, suck out the juices and spit the rest out   Damn I gotta hang out with Marciano some more 😳
Riddick Bowe was knocked down by Holyfield.  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=SqKMuPsIvJw
That's some mad anecdote about The Rock!
One time I heard someone say that as Ali watched the ref count Foreman out in Zaire, he thought of Frazier. He said something along the lines of,  “The only way a ref would be able to count 10 over Joe is if there was no blood left in his body.”  I have no idea if this is true but I’ve tried to find the source so many times. If anyone knows, please lmk.
Yeah, I remember Manny Steward saying that his power was astonishing and unlike anything he'd ever felt on the pads.
Let's go champ?
I mean he got his money.. The same for me if I hit the lottery.
this happened to me in soccer once. I got knocked out by a knee to the head, I was in goal and just kept moving around sort of facing the action.  Our defense was great that year so noone notices until a final minute push, the other team broke away, it was 2 vs me and to watch the video I just stared into the middle distance and tripped over my own legs coming out of the box.  I didn't remember the end of the game, the bus ride to school, my drive home.  Nothing until I ate dinner.  Scary
Dave Allen's story of training with the Klitschko's is hilarious too, basically spent the whole camp eating the best food he'd ever had, on holiday and running away from Klitschko in the ring when it was time to actually spar.
Muscle memory in action. That's crazy!
This is me after about 8 drinks!
Hogan lied. He said that he missed the phone call so they just called the next celebrity on the list.  He also said he almost became the bassist in Metallica when Lars has never met him. So take what he says and disregard every word
To be fair, the Foreman grill wouldn't work on everybody, Foreman knew how to sell it he sold it with his charachter as fat champion while knocking people out.
Keen on that movie. Casuals need to know what a true gentleman and legend George is.
Hackie Reitman, who fought Duran in an exhibition fight, said Duran hit him so hard he saw his ancestors.
I mean how reliable is this?? Also what does this even mean. RRJ knocked out plenty of people so apparently he hits hard enough to put people to sleep.
Anytime I hear something new about Archie, it's always something wild.
What do you mean? That Marquez trains like crazy, or he had girls coming in and out of the gym.
Chuvalo became a popular and skilled public speaker and anti drug activist after his retirement.   He had terrible family tragedy of suicide and overdose and instead of giving up he did a lot of good.   We could all stand to be more like Chuvalo.
Thats because he spent most of the fight rabbit punching Ali in the the kidneys and the back of the head.   He also lost so nobody but him gave a fuck where he went after the fight.
Old man strength is real
One could almost say...they got *Dempsey Roll*ed.  ^((I'll see myself out, Ippo fans)^)
Is he some Egyptian voodoo Pharoah or something now?
You're gonna get downvoted to hell. But it's a sad fact that boxing has quite a few woman beaters and it's awful and also I suppose not the most surprising thing at the same time.
Damn so Tank is just trying to follow in the footsteps of the greats
Unfortunately, the role of CTE can't be discounted in that. A lot of these fighters have started before they were even teenagers. Seeing the number of damaged fighters in the gyms was a real reality check for me in boxing.
Too tough for his own good. I still can't believe he got up that quickly (or *at all*) from that left hook Joe launched at him in The Fight of the Century.
Joe fought blind in one eye most of his career, and in his fight with Ali his other eye closed and he wanted to finish the fight in that state. Joe is harder than coffin nails.
I knew he was into chess but not crotchet
And Chess.
What's crocheting, sorry?
Knowing Ali , he’d probably been up and in it and out before Chuck turned on the light.
Are you sure it was Crawford? I had a very similar experience with Tyson Fury.
This is amusingly absurd, but on the real I’ve run into him at several fights and he’s always cool and in down time earth.
I think you misspelled Errol Spence
Lol, good one
Who gave him that title? WBO, WBC, WBA ???
Adam Smith is somewhere laughing
George Foreman was is an abuser?
Talking about it before the fight?
It’s a amazing the amount of charisma he built over 10 years.. He went from a quite force of destruction to a loveable one.
I remember Frazier had a similar response after defeating Ali. Some said Ali was drugged, and Frazier said: "Sure, I drugged him. I drugged him with a left hook."
He made George Foreman do something similar when he was training him
Yes.
Yes.  Burt Sugar had a boxing magazine then & they wrote that after leaving prison for the rape conviction, Tyson weighed 188.  The mag didn't straight up & say it, but the inference was that Tyson was juicing.
Or getting out of prison gave him access to way more food and training tools than he had in the pen. He was a monster as a teenager in the drug tested Olympics too. Muscle memory is a real thing and his genetics were super human.
Oh please 😒😒😒😒 If he was "juicing," then please explain how Arturo Gatti would almost always show up for a fight (after the weigh-in), almost ten to fifteen pounds heavier than his opponent??
I saw an interview with a Jui-Jitsu champion Mikey Musumeci. He's Italian, so he'd just eat one big ass Italian meal at the end of the day. That kept his weight in check and allowed him to eat what he loved.
Yes, in their third fight -- when no world titles were on the line
To be fair, manny said that about a few guys
Reading this and I can remember clearly when Shannon Briggs made Wlad fall out of the waterboard
Nope, never quite did get his money. That’s my point. I’m not sure what the most he made, but he was still fighting under the six figure mark at the point in which he disappeared - I am sure about this. This is not enough to call it quits.   He was climbing the ranks fast, though. He for sure would have gotten his title shot.
> I didn't remember the end of the game, the bus ride to school, my drive home.  Nothing until I ate dinner.  Scary  I wonder if there are some people who just end up living forever like that and don’t even realize it. Like just end up on autopilot for the rest of their life.
I hope that you're doing well and you had no serious repercussions from that concussion, bro.
[The video is a bit unsettling.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FjA4MPbLBRo)
My God it's like Tyson Fury is his apprentice
This is a fun playlist https://m.youtube.com/results?sp=mAEA&search_query=hulk+hogan%27s+lies
There's all kinds of power and ways to apply it, Roy had plenty of power but it was more the speed and drawing people onto shots that got people. With Duran from everything I've read he has the George Foreman/Deontay Wilder type of power where even experienced fighters with great chins get hit and say it's something they've never felt before.
Dude apparently lived a legendary life.. He was the old fashion chuck Norris.
Márquez trained like crazy.
He is an extremely diciplined fighter. Alot like Michael Jordan. If things arent done in training exactly like he wants them he blows up. Some say he's an asshole but shit so was Jordan and look at how much he achieved. That strong mindset helps get you to the top.
My dad told chuvalo he couldn’t box oranges lol  He’s a local hero here and it’s a shame I never got to personally meet him
Despite their fierce reputations in the ring, Duran and Chuvalo both did a lot of good outside of the ring.
I mean these men make a living by getting hit in the head and hitting people in the head.. Why act Holier than tho.. Also the military, and police have the same issue.
I was just kidding. Just a funny mental image of giant badass knitting a sweater
Just watched an interview with Froch and Groves where they talk about chess.   Froch says they should play a game of chess and Groves responds:  "I'd have him in check, close to checkmate and then Howard Foster would run in and just swipe the board off the table."  Cracked me up.
Knitting with yarn. Often done by Grandmas here in the US to make scarves, hats, blankets, etc. Just a silly joke I don't think he actually is, though who knows.
Amir Khan
He said he beat women as hard as he beat men. He's also good friends with another serial woman abuser in Jim Brown. And he admitted that he was a homicidal bully in his younger years.
After
Did you know Chuck Wepner fought a small bear in an exhibition once? Riddick Bowe also joined the army and dropped out after one day.
Makes sense, as wide as he is, the dude is 5 foot 10, and if you spend a long time in jail without training, you will go back to your "natural", non hypertrophied size.
If you think Mike Tyson wasn't on steroids, idk what to tell you bro. Great genetics will only take you so far.
Probably because elite boxers take steroids. Gatti was almost certainly on them too. Tyson had the physique of a borderline bodybuilder at times, while being a boxer.
He was weight cutting to be a weight bully.
And it was pizza of all things haha. I think he said he would just buy the shitty Trader Joe's pre-made dough and sauce haha.
What does having a title have to do with "favorite anecdotes"?? RIF  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=11dl6MNDXOs
Manny  specifically said he hit as hard as any heavyweight  he ever saw, in his estimation.  He also said he clearly hit harder than Lennox Lewis to the point where you could tell the difference just by their pad work.
Lot of ex fighters who stayed in the ring too long, sadly.
We are finding out about it now with multiple concussions causing CTE
Yeah, this sounds like what bad CTE is like for some people.  They'll have moments or a lifetime where everything is just foggy.  They look normal, but feel dead inside.
Just functioning without a memory or you could argue, consciousness. Kind of existential.
Also shows what a decent guy Usyk is
Haha that’s where i got some of these stories  What a huge asshole  I know someone who’s dad took a photo of him in public and he wanted $60 for it lol
Yeah I don’t disagree with you. Also had to reword what I wrote it sounded more attacking than what I intended..I was writing it during a work meeting 🫠
Can imagine, especially the Manny fights must have made him an animal
There's still time to meet him.
Am I acting holier than thou by saying that  that kind of behaviour is awful, and that we shouldn't idolize people who engage in that kind of behaviour? (I know that it's extremely common, but that doesn't make it any less bad, like how 1 out of 6 women are sexually assaulted in their lifetime)
He’s a badass with a brain
I heard about this... they were chatting a bit when Amir went to pick up his wife from her date with AJ. Amir said, "mate, you're a great chess player." Something like that.
Damn imma need a source in that, that’s crazy. Quick google didn’t give me much beyond the recent sex abuse allegations
Not once but twice. In the second fight the bear threw him out of the ring. The ref started counting, "1-2-3-4..." Wepner yelled from the floor "5-6-7-8-9-10. He wins".
Never knew that about Wepner. I did know Bowe joined the Marines to dedicate himself back into boxing training but he quit that.
I thought he lifted a lot In prison?
So you think he was on gear when he met Cus at 14 years old while upstate in juvi? Looked like a monster then too. Not sure how a 14 year old kid would get gear in the middle of nowhere in the 80s
Because that's the anecdote: Bowe is the only linear heavyweight champ in history who was never knocked down or knocked out in a title fight.
the last undisputed HW and noone touched that in decades till now
He says it in a Sports Illustrated article he did.
I thought so too
Jojo Diaz did a pretty good job against Haney.  Landed some pretty good body shots that rattled Haney a few times.  I remember giving Diaz 4 or 5 rounds.    I think Diaz's success was also due to Haney wanting to prove that he could hurt or knockdown his opponent.  Thus not using his size and athletic advantage at times.  He stuck to his bread and butter against Kambosos.
it made me more curios to see what a top contender level pressure fighter with the dimension of a 135/140 guy could do to haney. loma reach is like a super FW too, but hes great so the upcoming matchup is great
Gamboa exposed his power and Linares exposed his chin.
Assuming Haney wins against Loma ( alot of people, including myself, are just assuming Haney is gonna win), I really wanna see a fight between Haney vs the winner of Ryan vs  Tank.
This is why I find it absurd seeing everyone talk about how "Haney's going to dominate loma easy." If blow jo Diaz gave Haney this many problems, just imagine what loma can do
I think he raises and lowers his performance level depending on who he fights. Against Loma, I think we'll see Haney at his absolute best. However, Loma will also be on his A-game. I think the difference will be Haney's youth and size, as well as Loma's inactivity.
 Exposed ? Haney won wide for me
Speaking of exposing, didnt Jojo get caught sending dick picks to a minor?
I guess you gotta win 12-0 or else you got exposed.... 🤣
117-111, Haney had a pretty dominant UD win imo. It was his 1st step up w/ a southpaw and Jojo gave him good looks but nothing near exposing.
it's hard to "expose" someone when you lose 9-3 on the cards
I like haney personally but the idea he needs to be "exposed" is dumb. His liabilities are well known, there are many examples and he will obviously need to successfully impose his size to have any chance beating loma.
No.
Ehh it was a combination of that and the fact that Kambosos does not do his best work on the front foot.   Diaz is a far better pressure fighter and was an elite level amateur.
>Linares exposed his chin  Linares was never a weak puncher, bro. He had pop and lightning fast hands. Him hurting someone doesn't necessarily mean they have a weak chin.
Me too and I love your username lol!
would be nice to see but doubt it pretty sure he’s moving up to 140 after this fight he’s huge for 135 and looked drained asf at the weigh in last fight but idk
That's the next logical fight
Although Haney is the favorite with boxing analysts/commentators, this sub is absolutely cheering for Loma. This sub praises loma strength/skills and magnify Devin Haney's weaknesses in most threads about this fight
Lomachenko lost to an asthmatic kid who couldn’t even beat George Kambosos Jr and a cab driver who boxed part time 😂 #HaneyUD
Loma’s also really good at breaking out of clinches
As much as I think people are underestimating loma, I feel like Devins more mature and learnt a lot from the kambosos fights
Same here. People just love to hate on Haney. Jojo won 3 maybe four rounds.   The whole thing about Haney being hurt is also greatly exagerated. He caught Haney with a good shot. Haney regrouped and went to work. He got him back.
yes, nasty af
WHA-?
Haney his recovery was pretty bad though don't you think?
He had pop in the lower weight divisions
Chinny chin chin Haney held for the rest of the rounds because he wasn’t fully recovered from that shot. If Linares caught him earlier, he would have probably gotten stopped. Haney has a glass chin!
That’s literally every fight when a black boxer is up against a non black opponent. Root for the non black and disparage the black one
People love to hate on black fighters period. Acting like Loma didn’t lose twice
Boxing twitter got that tea
I don't deny that. 2 rounds and still not having your legs isn't the best sign, but sometimes it's not as bad as it looks. Can Loma hurt Haney like that? It remains to be seen.
He dropped Loma, dropped Campbell, dropped Crolla.. the last two names may not sound great, but Campbell was only ever stopped by a bodyshot from Ryan, and Crolla needed to take accumulation of punches to ever get stopped. Linares also knocked out Carlos Morales, a guy who Ryan wasn't able to knock out. So Linares definitely has some pop at 135. His handspeed is another factor though, speed kills and it catches you off guard.
facts. i hate this shit were if a guy gets rocked by a good puncher then all of a sudden they have a glass chin.
Loma is too small for 135.  Dropping him says more about jorges accuracy than power.
Too bad he had to hold to survive. You know why he held for the rest of the fight? Because he didn’t fully recover. Haney is Chinny!
Yea, but he was there with other top 135ers and they didn't drop him. Teo and Campbell im refering too
Two different things.  Recovery and your ability to take a shot.
Like I said, it’s a great credit to his timing and accuracy on his shot, but not his power.  Loma was way more embarrassed than hurt.
Crazy thing is that Haney is good at neither of those. 🤷
Yet he's never been floored while Ryan, Loma, Teo and Kambosos all have. Strange isn't it?
That tends to happen when you jab and grab and don’t take any risks. Don’t worry, he’ll eventually get stopped.
But don't you agree that going down, standing up and have strong legs still is better than getting hit, stay standing but are weak in the legs?  I swear, if I was a pro boxer and some guy was hurting me with shots I would just thrown myself down to get that rest in. I can't believe fighters stay standing just taking shot after shot even after they are hurt.  Just like how I do not understand fighters trying to stand up right away when clearly hurt when they could easily try and take 7-8 count before they stand up.
Here is a crazy fact about Gary Mason before he became a pro boxer most people don’t know!  As a kid he was often very ill due to an autoimmune disease which kept him out of school and sports.  His parents didn’t know what to do so they brought him to a Bolivian shaman living in southern Idaho for spiritual treatment.  The shaman gave him a potion which included several traditional herbs and dried animal secretions.  The potion didn’t cure the autoimmune disease but Gary claims it made him hallucinogenic and he was visited by spirits from another realm. The realm of great warriors. And he realized that it was his destiny to be a fighter.  He fought through his illness to become a pro boxer.  And the rest…is history!
I feel like an ass for almost always rooting for the southpaw (only when I’m not familiar with both fighters that much). Ig I just like lefties
Slightly off topic, but what happened to that "weird endings to fights" series you mentioned a while back? Just not enough material to pull from?
[removed]
Aldi frank bruno
Yeah then he got hit by a truck and killed
I just stopped researching I got personal shit going on but I'll start looking again. It completely slipped my mind but I have stuff bookmarked I think.
[removed]
He did.  Tragic.
Ah, no rush. I was just interested in what you could find. Take care of yourself as a first priority.
[removed]
I got some unexpected free time currently so I'm actually glad you reminded me.

This should have happened 25 years ago.
Ngl, Tyson is starting to look like the type of guy who might just make that happen for Tua so he does get that payday he needs. Tua is also the type of bloke who would do that for anyone else if he could. A True Samoan Warrior.
Tua: I am broke, I need Payday.  Don't get me wrong, I am broke and need payday too. It's normal and I am not trying to put Tua down or anything demeaning.
Noooo, please stop with the grandpa boxing!🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
Tua's last comeback was 10 years ago and he lost to Monte Barrett ffs. Is there even money in a fight like this too...
I mean it’d be pretty sad to see. But can’t say I wouldn’t watch.
That would be cool
What, you think Tyson won't duck you twice?
Controversial take, but I think Tua is very competitive, even a head to head favourite imo, if that fight had happened back in the day.
But worth the wait right?
You think? I mean Mike seems chill af most of the time these days, I thought he only did the Jones Jnr thing cause he was strapped for cash, not sure how he's going these days
True. Last I heard he was borderline homeless, living at the gym, poor bugger should have more to show for his career eh?
Just like how Mike Tyson lost to Kevin Mcbride and Danny Williams before retirement?  They both ended off on a shitty note. Just that Tyson has the star power to make other deals for income while Tua doesn't.
True, lost to Barrett in 2011 and Ustinov in 2013. I'm guessing this would be nothing more than a sparring session rtoe exhibition if it came together, not that I really think it will. I'd probably still watch it though, one of the matchups that should have happened way back when
Would be a fun exhibition
Two Gunz
1980’s Tyson would be the clear favorite for me but if they faced in the 90’s I think Tua wins. After he dumped Rooney, Mike was too stationary of a target for a heavy hitter like Tua.
He has a weed company that is doing well right?
Let's just say his management team pulled a Joe Louis and lost nearly all assets and money to his team in the mid 2000's.
Exactly, star power...  Tyson could fight my Nan and make millions.
I can see where you're coming from. Eh we'll never know eh? Sucks cause it's one of those immovable object irresistible force situations for me. A bit like Joyce - Wilder today in a way.
He had a Cartoon, a few doc's and his Broadway show as well as a successful podcast, it seems as if those "Broke" days are Long over,.. The Film Roles, helped pull him out and the Repayment Plan, Pretty sure the weed Helps But He probably was Wealthy even in Bankruptcy.
Man, that is the first I've heard of that but a quick Google and yeah, apparently he does and it's going great. Far out.
Yup, Barry and Pugh fleeced him big time.
Dam that’s sad. One of these influencers give the 50 year old 1 last payday. He’s only 50, got 1 good fight left in him
I'd call the business of boxing a snake pit, but I'd be being disrespectful and unfair to the snakes.
Honestly mate I'd on your nan
Yeah, I agree. When you have made money you can remake it way easier
Tua - Jake Paul incoming? I'd actually buy that tbh hahaha
Cum, you forgot the word cum.
Out of all these bums getting millions to “Box”, real entertaining true tough guys like Tua should be first on list to get a dam payday. I hate seeing true fighters like him be left out to dry and broke cause dirty management scum.
😐
I mean, I wish him the best. I don't think out pointing Bivol is a great strategy with his reach, stamina, defense and accuracy all going for him. I don't know if Canelo is big enough to swarm / pressure him either. If I was him, I wouldn't take that fight at all, but good on him for being determined and not avoiding a tough fight.
All Canelo has to do is remember how to jab, and he will beat Bivol.  And by beat, I mean get a dubious decision on the scorecards.
his gas tank looked horrible with GGG, he was trying to manage it, GGG didnt throw punches for the first 6 rounds and he gassed anyways. dont see what a hurt hand has to do with his gas tank
Starts right from beginning.   Paraphrase: *"In the 2nd fight, Eddie told me I needed to throw 100 more punches per round. And we did. And we won. With Bivol, we are going to make adjustments and I believe no one can beat me after training 100% for the specific fight. I was coming off of fighting 4 times in 11 months and couldn't train for a particular guy and have a focused camp. I believe I'm unbeatable at my best."*
Canelo might get hurt increasing his output at 175 and possibly fading a lot sooner and making openings for Bivol a lot easier.
You have to respect the guy for wanting to take an almost unwinnable fight. No one is beating Bivol.   Meanwhile, Crawford and Spence still have very vocal fans that apparently enjoy ducking more than boxing.
Except Bivol is a more naturally gifted combination puncher. I remember when cotto fought pac and Merchant said Cotto is a strong puncher, but pac was the more dynamic puncher. Kinda like Canelo vs Bivol. Bivol also jabs more and trains for combos so has a better gas tank. I can’t see how Canelo wins the rematch without the judges on the books.
I gave Canelo 2 rounds in the first Bivol fight and the judges somehow found 5 for him... Obviously he's great but I'm really concerned that oblivious judges  will give him 10 rounds if he only wins 3. Bivol should steer clear of that situation and get the Beterbiev fight locked in.
100% Training= 🐄 🥩 🇲🇽💉
Canelo is never going to beat Bivol. He’s to much of a counterpuncher. Canelo dosent have the gas tank nor the footwork to pressure/cut the ring off consistently for 12 rds. Bivol is far to disciplined to fall for any of Canelo’s counters.
All Canelo has to do is win 4 rounds for a SD win nothing too crazy
Bivol Chase beterbiev plz
All I can hope is that the Canelo AND the judging has improved, but even then, I still have a hard time seeing Canelo figure out that puzzle
Clenelo and the judges are everything wrong with fucking boxing right now.
Zzzzz we don't want a bivol rematch, I'm sorry but it won't go any differently.. Go back to your true weight class and dominate, fight benavidez. Bivol has beterbiev to fight for the 175 supremacy
No version of Canelo or new gameplan will get him the W over Bivol.
I don't see anyway he can beat Bivol.
And Clenelo STILL LOST the 2nd GGG fight according to vast majority of boxing experts and fans
I’m gonna bet the house on Canelo win by robbery
He gassed out around round 5 against Bivol, and I gave Canelo 3 of the first 4 rounds too lmao. I don’t like his chances at all
> No one can beat me after 100% training.  I like Canelo, but he should keep that same energy if Bivol beats him again. I don’t want to hear about some kind of injury or any excuses.
Needs to eat more horse meat
Wtf does punches PR mean
Wish we could skip the Rhyder tune up and get right to the inevitable Bivol mollywhopping...
Bivol different
Definitely in the majority here thinking that this is awesome, but a good underdog rematch. Good on Canelo. I like both fighters, just going to be cool to see a rematch either way. Definitely don't favor Canelo, but I don't think it's impossible. Imagine if he knocked Bivol out? Or vice versa. Good stuff.
He is getting stopped this time
You won the second fight because GGG was past his best.  Bivol isn't and you're going to get your arse handed to you again.  So get over it and fight someone your own size, namely Benavidez.
He’s too small to beat Bivol.
Canelo has a chance because of the judges and that’s about it, if it wasn’t for the judges he’s have lost at minimum 1 GGG fight, was a joke that the first bivol fight was even has close as it was on some cards when bivol dominated the entire fight
I really don't like this Bivol rematch. You can tell its just some personal shit from Canelo. He lost very solidly and will lose in the same fashion. The best he can hope for is getting more robbery inclined judges.
Unless Canelo tries to outbox the fuck out of Bivol by using his jab to the head and combos to the body and by moving his feet more then I could see a victory, anyways Bivol 8-4. It’s like Usyk and Aj, tehy can fight 100 times and Usyk will win 100 times.
Wasnt Canelo trying to get the rematch at 168? I'd imagine Bivol being a lot faster. Or are they targeting a rematch for 75 again?
So he didn't train 100%? Cmon man haha. Isn't that what he ragged on Garcia for?
The problem is that he’s getting older, he didn’t look primed against GGG the last time. He’s gonna be a year older, Bivol is going to have improved yet again, and Canelo’s gas tank is going to be even worse. Granted, I don’t think he can stop Bivol either. His only shot is a dodgy decision imo. Bivol simply isn’t there enough to be warn down. Higher output will only lead to him getting beat up even worse.
Lol. Whatever dude. You’re gonna get beat all over again.
Then what the fuck were you doing before then filming Creed III?
Bivol i just the better man, he can make adjustments for canelo's adjusments. Run them through a neverending simulation and Bivol outadjusts canelo every time.
Some kind of sub of Canelo haters :-) Canelo's fights are the most interesting to see. Beautiful, smart, challenging. It supports the great interest to the sport. Appreciate it
Canelo cowarded away like he did vs old brittle hand Mayweather when Canelo was a fresh 23 year old bull with 40 fights. This is who Canelo is
I think you'd be surprised
I quit watching boxing after the first fight but did it actually look like he won the 2nd for realsies?
Goddammit I wish he'd let this go, man. Nobody is gonna hold it against him that 175 is just a bridge too far. Rule 168 and take on all comers. Fight Benavidez, then Charlo if he wants the smoke. Hell fight both Charlos if the other wants to move up a little more.
So he admits he lost the first golovkin fight
If Canelo throws more he will get hit more.  Could be a knockout for Bivol.  I’m really not sure why Canelo would fight that guy again , that was embarrassing.
how about moving your feet and head not just taking it on the guard which resets your attack?
I honestly don't want to see him fight Bivol again. He was totally outclassed by a fat better boxer. Canelo should fight Benavides at 168, or 175, and the winner can then fight Bivol.
Aw that's nice.    Bivol TKO
Y’all underestimate canelo, he just needs to pay judges a little more to get a UD win.
If by this he means he plans on a robbery on the score cards then I'm never watching this "sport" again
Bivol is just better. All round.
He hadn’t trained 100% when fighting Floyd Mayweather jr? Bivol took Saul to school and dominated the entire fight. A rematch would be intriguing if the first fight was close and competitive. However, Bivol made Saul look like an amateur.
I mean, the scorecards were 7-5 despite the fight being dominated by Bivol. With how the judges favor Canelo it’s certainly not impossible that Canelo wins by points just by throwing 100 more fancy punches.
He can apply the Andre Ward “punch him in the nuts till he quits” strategy. Might work for him.
Canelo did have bivol in ropes couple time . But he threw one big punch instead of throwing combos . If he fights like how he did in Lara, he could potentially take the rounds from judge and win a robbery . Also another reason why I think Artur beats bivol
I think we all prefer him taking the fight than making a fury one.  Beside you never know, canelo isn’t the average Joe. With determination and some Mexican beef it could work.
Yeah no chance he wins but good on him from not shying away
I don't think that would work now he already lose having a dubious decision will be to much
I take Canelo isn't really big fan of jabbing. I rewatched his fight against Plant: he would totally ignore jabs and would just try to walk him down to the ropes and throw powershots.
For real, something is very wrong when you're more gassed out than a 40 year old man. What's more is there really wasn't a lot of action. If him and Bivol rematch at 175, and Canelo blows his load early, he's going have absolutely nothing past round 6.
Did anyone even catch that he said, throw 100 more punches PER ROUND? Tf, he can't even do that for 2 rounds
Not if he eats clen, trens hard, anvar gives up
Crawford vs spence is such a dissapoinment.
>No one is beating Bivol.  I am not sure even Bivol himself believes that. Canelo is world class fighter, I'd give him a benefit of a doubt. Stylistically this is not the best match up for him, but he is more than capable of making adjustments and showing more than he did last time.
Damn you guys really have Bivol on a pedestal. No-one is unbeatable. Canelo has shown he can adjust from the GGG fights, don't count him out so quick.
How does no one beat Bivol when he’s destined to get dropped and stopped by the Chechen?
Okay giving Canelo only two rounds in the first GGG fight is just as whack than giving him all but two rounds
As if they both weren’t already on something for their first fight lol.  >>I was coming off of fighting 4 times in 11 months and couldn't train for a particular guy and have a focused camp.   “I got cocky after beating BJS and Plant and instead of training hard, I partied and golfed too much.”
Made me think of the 100% training he allowed Kovalev.... 70 days between fights.
Per round
Per Round
Canelo has some serious power don't get me wrong but if Smith Jr couldn't put bivol away canelos got no shot
Why wasn’t he too small to beat Kovalev?
he is not good enough
Majority* not entire
I’ve been saying this. Bivol by decision. MAYBE Canelo by controversial decision. I think we’d rather see Bivol vs Bieterbev and Canelo vs Benavides
Canelo has been adamant on 175. Bivol is the one that mentions 168 being a potential target.
Canelo won’t give Bivol a chance for his belts. Alvarez will want it at 175.
75, canelo wants it there
Nothing wrong with respecting canelos ability in the ring, while also recognizing that he got totally outclassed, because, you know, there’s are other fighters in the sport who are even more talented than he is… like the dude who embarrassed him: Bivol😉
Yikes man you need a reality check
If you watch it with commentators getting off to the fact that Canelo is on the front foot, not a robbery at all, in fact you’d be generous to give GGG three rounds.  Watch it without sound and GGG outboxed Canelo. Rematch was pretty egregious too but with no horrid Adelaide Byrd scorecard it got forgotten.
113-115 is a disgrace and the judges should not be near a ring anymore. Also the "give the first 3 or 4 rounds to the guy you want to win" happened so evidently it's criminal.
Bivol is lucky they introduced him as from “California”. If they said Bivol the Russian, he would have lost unanimously. Lol.
and then in five years people will say Canelo deserved the win. we already see it happening with ggg.
I may get downvoted to hell, but 7-5 wasn't egregious in my opinion (though it's the absolute closest you could've scored the fight.) I scored it 8-4 for Bivol with the fight being about even until round 8. Bivol dominated the second half of the fight.
Plant strategy as well
"Punch his dick! Find his dick and punch it! The oooool' dick punch!"
Frankly I see beterbiev bivol as the most 50-50 fight out there but at this point I just want it to happen more than I want to talk about it
Artur could never beat bivol, bivol moves too well and has great distance control
And the fact he starts with the first four rounds by default
Yes but vs washed up 40 year old GGG, Clenelo started throwing LOTS of jabs
Canelo is a walking boulder of fast twitch muscles, he ain’t built to throw a million lol
I don't want to speculate but I will.  I have the impression that Canelo after BJS (but probably even a bit earlier) sort of let himself go a bit. We saw him partying and drinking more than usual.   I don't blame him, he reached the top and made a shitton of money, but seemingly he wants to coast and not putting it 100% focus only 80.  I hope we get back the laser focused Canelo because he was a treat to watch.
It’s been know for years that Canelo always gases out after 6 rounds. Just go rewatch when he fought Mayweather.
I'm gonna guess over training had something to do with it. Once you're in your 30s you can't train like you were in the 20s. It takes way more time to recover.
GGG isn’t a normal 40 year old man he is a killing machine manufactured for destruction
Canelo was gassed out in the 3rd fight, and more than GGG? Or are you just coping loudly?
🤣🤣🤣🤣 canelo delusional in a really funny way at times
Dragonball Z mode
Bivol isn't unbeatable but nobody in the super middleweight or Light heavyweight division besides beterbiev will beat him anytime soon and beterbiev is a 50-50 fight so it's not really putting him on a pedestal when he's been so unchallenged this far in his career
This is such bullcrap, in the second ggg fight he just had to come forward a bit more to get gifted the decision. There is no way he genuinely beats Bivol, but after 7-5 in the first fight he might not need to.
Canelo still lost both GGG fights. Adjustments be damned.
Was talking about Bivol (post updated)
Scoring only off of compubox, 10-2 GGG is actually an accurate scorecard lol.   But I agree, I scored the first fight 8-4 GGG with maybe one swing round that could make it 7-5.
If Kovalev didn’t punch a woman and need thousands of dollars in legal fees he could’ve declined the offer.  Kov def wasn’t at his best for that fight, and if he was, I favor him slightly vs Canelo. But he’s a piece of shit and losing humiliatingly to a former welterweight is some major karma.
Kovalev didn’t have to accept the fight. You act like he was taken in the ring at gun point
The claim that Canelo "only allowed" Kovalev X amount of time is a phony narrative. He had tried to step in for Yarde earlier in the year but Kovalev reportedly passed on chose to pursue the Yarde fight first so it was made after. And it was DAZN not Canelo that selected the November date because they wanted a month buffer between that fight and Joshua-Ruiz II so that they'd fall on different billing cycles. Meanwhile if Kovalev didn't feel like he was up for it, he could have passed like he had before and held out for later in the year knowing it's a fight Canelo wanted, but he eagerly took it.  Kovalev didn't look like a washed fighter either-- other than fellow light heavy Bivol, he probably gave him more close rounds than any other opponent since GGGII. If anything that fight gets underrated, I remember some were suggesting Kovalev was washed after stopping Yarde because he was tested by him when Yarde also tested next level hyped Beterbiev.
Thanks!
Rehydration clause
Nah he was pretty much clearly in control that entire fight, canelo did almost nothing offensively.
I mean if bivol can make it I would love to see it and imagine it would be the same outcome but I doubt it will happen I just don't think canelo would risk it
They all “do what’s good for boxing.” They just want more money off Canelo
thankfully canelo cant wait for bivol to age while juicing himself to a whole new body and weight category so he'll have to win this on merit  and he cant, so itll be even more obvious the fix is in than w golovkin
He was born in Uzbekistan.
I’ve already seen Canelo fans going out of their way to act as if saying judges favor Canelo is making excuses for a Bivol rematch should Canelo win(likely by robbery).   I respect Canelo for taking the challenges he has and what’s he achieved but his fanboys need to chill. Judges clearly favor Canelo just as they do any cash cow.
GGG's own trainer said Canelo deserved the win in the post fight and that it's "ridiculous" to not give him credit. The people overreacting where those crying robbery:  “It’s two great fighters. For me to say that Golovkin wasn’t at his best would take away from Canelo. We’ve gotta give Canelo the credit, too, that he was able to do the things that he needed to do tonight. It doesn’t happen every night, but for me to tell you that Golovkin wasn’t at his best would be taking away from a great victory for Canelo.”  “If I start to make excuses about Golovkin, then I’m taking away from the victory of Canelo, and that’s ridiculous.”
It absolutely is. Bivol did much better work almost every round and Canelo really did not land shit.
You misspelled shakur
Yeap and when you throw that many powershots, you do expend a lot of energy. Canelo's style is very powershot happy.
It doesn't matter if he's built for it or not you have to work on your weaknesses that's how boxing is and always will be if he doesn't work on it then he cant expect to do better but with the same style on the other hand though it does work just not against top knotch boxers like bivol
Not only that but even taking a break from a training camp to shoot scenes for a movie. Just seems like he isn't as focused recently.
He definitely looked bloated against Bivol. Because he didn't have to cut weight maybe he altered his training. Also his workload likely played a factor coming off that busy schedule of undisputed in under a year.
He definitely was. Canelo dropped off steeply after round 7. The judges had GGG taking most every round from 8 to 12. Canelo was tired. He faded hard in that fight and he faded hard against Bivol. It's obvious that his tank is getting worse.
I thought 8-4 GGG to 6-6 was acceptable
Crazy how good he was in his prime tho Kovalev stopped yarde with a jab that's fuckin scary to say the least even if he is a shit person
Am I misremembering or did  Canelo severely brutalize one of his sparring partners over a woman when he was younger? (Someone correct if I'm wrong pls)
who would turn it down? Who has ever turned it down?
Kovalev had legal problems. Of course he had to take a Canelo payday. Even with the rehydration clause. Canelo knew what he was doing
Kovalev was still bigger than Bivol with the rehydration clause lol, Bivol was 182 for the Canelo fight
> thankfully canelo cant wait for bivol to age  It may be an interesting strategy, given that they are of the same age.
I know. I’m a huge fan. For most of his career, his name came with a (Russia) tag though.
Wasn't it Kyrgyzstan?
Which fight of the three?
How did you score the fight?
Also GGG isn't throwing haymakers. His power shots are precision, technique and consistent. His energy conservation for his style is wildly different than Canelos. If G fought like Canelo, he'd gas too, but he doesn't. He stalks and attacks.
I'm not sure how he fixes it though. His style has evolved into something where he loads up on single shots. He'll have to change his style, imo.
Yea he should work on it, I’m just acknowledging why his gas tank is more of an issue for him esp. he has some body type hurdles to overcome as well
That is one of the hardest cope mechanism I have ever heard anyone build for themselves. But whatever helps you sleep at night.
That fight wasn’t a draw. Sorry. Rematch could have been. How is 6-6 an acceptable scorecard when GGG outlanded Canelo in 10 out of 12 rounds? That means you have to give four rounds to Canelo where he got outlanded. Give him two, sure, three, maybe, four? No.
Benavidez turned him down, so did charlo
Sour grapes. No one forced him to sign anything. He thought it was an easy fight against a shorter, smaller fighter.
right, there isnt an age gap for him to take advantage of and he doesnt have the time to juice to new weights either  thats the point
Galactic brain move
I think it was or it might be khazakistan either way he moved to st pertersburg when he was a kid so he's introduced as such
The [Abel quote](https://www.badlefthook.com/2018/9/16/17865752/abel-sanchez-i-wanted-ggg-to-fight-canelo-he-decided-to-box) el-californio is referencing was about the second fight.
1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11 and 12 to Bivol.   2, 3 and 9 to Canelo. So 117:111  3 being a swing round, I gave to Canelo  Canelos best punch was in round 4, the uppercut. Bivol was out landing him a lot that round tho with great stuff, too. I think the 1st could be a swing round, but I don't think so. So you're not that far from my judging, I apologize.
GGG also doesn't have Canelo's upperbody movement/same ability to slip and counter. His counters effectively hamstrung GGG by having him abandon his body punching and making him reluctant to throw power shots as he stayed busy mostly with his jab, whereas Canelo was the more dedicated power puncher and aggressor.   Canelo rears into his shots with full extension, but doesn't throw many haymakers either, he's got a high connect rate on his power. His main weakness has always been his stamina-- he can't afford to throw a ton of shots and instead tries to make every one count. One of his trademarks is making opponents reluctant to sit down on their shots and brings the fight more to his preferred pace.
In fairness, this version of Canelo stalks too, only he doesn't rely on jabs at all to set up his offense. He walks you down to the ropes with high guard, then starts unloading once he gets you against the ropes.  I agree though that GGG's style is less energy consuming.
He needs to go back to how he was boxing at 160 he's seems to have Fallin in love with his power which is a recipe for disaster issue is im not sure if he can keep up that level of conditioning with his current size
It's cope to point out that the judges gave an old  GGG rounds 8-12? That's not cope, that's fact. The reason they gave him the rounds is because Canelo was inactive. Why was he inactive? Because he was tired. You're taking an honest observation on Canelo's abilities and taking it as a personal attack. Very strange. His tank isn't as good as it used to be, dude. Everyone gets old. Canelo has been a pro for a very long time, and the wear is starting to show.
OP it seems like you're having a very hard time coping w the fact Clenelo looked like crap on the late rounds vs a inactive washed up 40 year old GGG
Remember when AJ lost bro
First three rounds and the last three rounds were solid showings on Canelo’s behalf, he was getting outlanded but only by GGG’s jab, GGG couldn’t find the right hand all night and Canelo was landing the crisper counters with more power. That’s why we don’t count rounds solely off of punch count
He cared about the money in the first place homie. very clearly
Ah apparently we both were wrong: he was born in Moldova(I think his father is from there) and they moved to Kyrgyzstan when he was a kid.  But yeah he did represent Russia in most competitions he participated.
Yep the difference for me was round 4. I gave that to Canelo but i’m completely okay with Bivol winning that round.
Ya that's true. Just Canelo relies on his quick reflexes to bob and weave. All that muscle he carries taxes him. Honestly when you think about it, their styles match up nicely against each other and makes for a damn good fight, as we all saw, regardless of who anyone thought won.
I think you're right.
Agreed.
[Here's 1105 fan entries who live scored the fight.](https://imgur.com/kAokJyD.jpg) Absolutely no one gave GGG more than two rounds.  It's so funny with you GGG/Usyk people. When it's a razor thin close fight and Canelo wins by one or two rounds, you spend years crying about the judges. When Canelo whoops GGG like GGG never fought in his life, I mean people would be hard pressed to give GGG a SINGLE Clear round, then you hang to the judges' scorecards.  Absolutely waste of time using logic or civility with you lots.
We don’t, which is why I’d score it 8-4 or, stretching a little bit, 7-5 for GGG instead of 10-2. 6-6 is a reach imo.
Interesting I didn't know that he's been around then that's pretty cool
Yeap very good point: their styles did mash perfectly and that's why we've got fantastic 2 fights. Pity that 3rd happened too late and injured Canelo was fighting GGG's corpse and neither of them wanted to hurt the other too much.
I am curious about the adjustments he's aiming to make tho I wonder if he will try to focus more on his skill or physicality
>Here's 1105 fan entries who live scored the fight.   >   >Absolutely no one gave GGG more than two rounds.  GGG clearly won more than 2 rounds. All the people live scoring were influenced big time by the audience
[**https://boxrec.com/en/scoring/2850125**](https://boxrec.com/en/scoring/2850125) Boxrec scorers averaged the same as Dave Moretti. If you look at the averages, fans has GGG winning rounds 9 on. Get Canelo's dick out of your mouth. He's a fantastic fighter and p4p, but he's got clear problems now. You're a blinded fanboy. He's too small for 175 and doesn't have the tank for it.
6-6 is a bit of a reach, but possible nonetheless. GGG wasn’t having success with power punches whereas Canelo was. It’s a battle of light consistency versus powerful spurts
Sidenote, did we just have a normal conversation regarding GGG and Canelo without arguing without who won? LOL. Cheers broski.
>injured Canelo was fighting GGG's corpse  This sums that fight up so well.
I would imagine skill. Physically, I think he's as big as he can be.
[Moretti and Weisfeld also both scored 113-115 in favor of Canelo in the 2nd fight.](https://imgur.com/suDX5dE.jpg) But I bet you haven't stopped groaning and moaning about that, have you?  Get the Soviet dick out your fucking mouth and use all sides of your brian if you're gonna argue with me. Matter of fact, get all three of your alt accounts. You can't do this alone.
You do know Canelo landed only four more power punches overall, right? Yes, Canelo was more accurate but it’s not like GGG was just spamming a jab while Canelo was landing the harder shots all night
Indeed haha cheers
I meant physicality as in conditioning strength etc not really size
Again, can’t base it squarely off of numbers, Canelo’s blows were cleaner and more explosive.
People are overreacting to this.  He was asked if he'd move up to 140, and he said no, 135 is his max, as he's stated before.  He was then asked if he'd fight Inoue at 126, and he said maybe.  People are acting like he's calling out Inoue and complaining about fighting at 135 or something.  He's just giving standard answers to questions he gets constantly.
I’d like to see Tyson Fury move down to 135 and see who’s the true pound for pound champ.
Inoue barely just jumped to 122.
We don’t need another Loma-Rigo/GGG-Brook/Spence-Mikey situation again lmao
I’m the weight bully now
I just want to see Loma fight 3 times a year against good opposition... he's only getting older.
Is this gonna be happening regularly now until May 20:th? Loma gets asked a silly question, answers it in good faith, some reporter puts a clickbait article on it and voilá, we got ourselves an inflammatory thread
Loma shutting the door on 140 is like Tyson Fury saying he can't make Middleweight.  Who would even ask such a stupid question?    As far as Inoue is concerned, dude hasn't even campaigned at 122 yet.    What's next?  Will Roberto Duran fight Mike Tyson?
I like Loma both as a human being and fighter.  That said, look for Devin Haney to stop Loma and possibly retire him.
Undefeated and 126lbs in his mind. All in one week. Impressive.
Look at the size of Loma, of course he doesn’t want 140
Then why did VL refuse to move down for tiny, ancient Rigo?
I'll have to give the slight edge to Inoue in that fight but still a 50/50
shouldn't he get through Haney before planing the next?
“One hundred thirty-five, everybody knows, it’s not my weight class.”  This dude is getting on my nerves with this shit, if it ain’t your weight class stop fighting there and go back to 130, nobody wants to hear these too small excuses that you’ve already built in for yourself in the likely scenario you get your ass belted by Haney  You’ve had 8 fights there, nobody wants to here it now that the competition is actually stiff.
Loma ducked a fossilised Pac even when Pac the shorter guy said he would move down for him. Now he wants to pick on a smaller Asian lol.
Already making excuses for why he is going to lose. Pathetic and is now calling out bantamweights despite fighting at lightweight for the past 5 years. How embarrassing! And watch all the Lomachenko Fan Bots 🤖 praise him for this 😂😂
Lol, he loved that Rigo advantage.
I never thought of that🔥🔥🔥
All I see is more excuses for when he loses to Haney. Better than saying he’s still undefeated in his mind lol but Loma will likely duck Shakur.  Loma is pathetic & a dumbass in just 3 days.
So, anyone going to condone this?
He doesn't want Fulton because Fulton is 'very strong' but he believes Inoue is a better match since Inoue has 'good skills'.
Loma aint making 126 again. Guy is just agreeing to a big name for clout.
Loma would be too big. If they were the same size, Inoue would stop him.
I'm sorry but he hasn't fought at 126 since 2015, and it's alot harder to drop back down to it now especially being much older and having allready moved all the way up to 135... This is a bad move for a great fighter who is aging
I'm more interested in the loma vs aj grudge match personally.
you think boxing fans actually read the articles? We like to immediately and ruthlessly judge and criticize the entire character of a fighter based solely on the clickbait-ey article titles💯🙏
Just the same way people overreacted to AJ's comments with Loma.  Yet the sub acted like AJ committed a felony.
Would be a masterclass troll job for Fury to promise to fight the worlds top Ukrainian fighter then face Loma ngl
mfer would move to 135 just to make excuses
Fury ducking Tank.
Fury could probably move down to 175 if he pushed it. Fundora is 6’6 and fights at 154, Fury is only 2 inches taller at 6’8 so why not
it would just be his head and one arm attached to it
Did you see Inoue last fight? Lmao  Dude is rehydrating back to like 135 and he’s the essentially the same height as Loma (who is not actually 5’7)
Mikey was too small for Spence that's not his weight class
This is more like Dawson/Ward territory where Andre made Dawson go down to 175.  Or Pac/Delahoya catch weight.
People saw Pacquiao did the impossible then everyone else thought, all boxers should be able to do it.  Pacquaio is bad for this business, setting up unrealistic standards.
Nothing wrong with brook spence.   Brook Golovkin was the problem
Loma vs Chocolatito 💀
Shit I wanna see any big name fight 3 times a year
Just like the inflammatory thread just blowing out of proportions AJ comments to Loma.
Boxing journalism is dead. Last credible outlet is the London Boxing News magazine.
What a terrible take. Inoue stops him easily. He hasn't fought at Featherweight in about 5 years lol and he looked far less sharp in his latest fight going the distance.
He's already went through 130. Haney has to basically kill himself to make 135 and a naturally undersized Loma will still be the best fighter he's ever fought. Thats the state of boxing these days.
nobody of note was willing to fight him at 126-130  he HAD to go to 135 and STILL has to jump through jagged flamed hoops to get a decent fight  Tank had all the chance in the world to fight him at 130 but his master kept him back for fear of losing that zero
But he is way too small for 135, it's just that he cleared 130 out so moved up for a new challenge
What would you have him say when asked if he would fight at 140? Have you seen the difference in stature between him and the men he’s fought at 135? When did punching up instead of down become weak? And how could a guy have 500 fights if he’s the sort to make excuses?
dead ass, you never heard pacquiao back in the day whining around saying “we all know 147 is not my weight class”
Looks like people are also tired of HEARING your nonsense opinion too. Not sure what you’re the “goat” of but it’s definitely not grammar.
yeah but let's not forget, in his mind he's also never lost a fight
He didn't even use it lol. People like to act like Loma beat Rigo because he was too big, but he didn't use his size against him at all. The only real physical advantage that Rigo had to deal with was Loma's height, but he's the same height as Donaire who Rigo beat.
He literally said he didn’t really care for the win because of that advantage
are you gonna be on suicide watch when Haney loses?  asking for real cuz the way some of you people comment is just out of this world  an undersized Lomachenko will still be the best opponent Haney will have faced
Of course! These are Lomachenko Fan Bots were talking about 😂😂😂
That’s actually reddit in general, it’s not just boxing fans.
Facts. I'm a boxing fan and that's what I do -PROOF
> you think boxing fans actually read the articles? We like to immediately and ruthlessly judge and criticize the entire character of a fighter based solely on the clickbait-ey article titles  Well that just sounds like the news
FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!
Just cuts himself in half.
 Tank is so short he can probably punch the ground while standing up straight. Fury literally could not duck him. The lowest Fury can probably bend over (or "duck" in layman's terms) is higher than Tank can reach. Thanks for attending my Ted talk next week I'll be covering the alleged [Gervonta Davis - Shawn Porter dunk contest.](http://blog.step2.com/wp-content/uploads/735700_B3.jpg)
He’s a chonch
Fury trying to get as thin as Fundora would literally kill him
Yeah that's exactly what they're saying.
It was such a stupid idea for Mikey to take that fight. Dude started off at 126, his best weight class was 135. And he wasn’t big at that weight. That’s like if Spence went up and fought Benavidez. Insanity.
Yep, and Rigo came up 2 weight classes to fight Loma.
Something helped him do the impossible that has never been done before or since. Come up from 110’s up to 154 and keep your power. That just goes against everything in boxing history.
Pacquiao is a freak of nature and outlier, there is no other current boxer who can move up 8 weight classes.
I’ve always said this too, Loma shouldn’t have rushed moving up in weight. He was too ambitious when he fought Orlando Salido in his second pro fight, and frankly his frame is already pretty filled out at ~130. Pacquiao’s genetics allowed him to disperse the weight evenly throughout his body, hence those bowling ball Filipino farmer calves of his, while Loma’s frame is very top-heavy.
Pacquiao and now it’s Canelo doing it
Remember when his fans really thought he could beat Floyd lol
Was incredibly poor advice to allow Brook to take the GGG fight. It basically ruined his career.
Brook isn’t even that much smaller that GGG though. I don’t think it’s as much as a mismatch as people make it out to be. Skill wise and GGGs power was just too much
Dream fight if it was somehow possible lol.
Closest we can get this fight is Bam Rodriguez (Similar angles and footwork in some degree) vs Chocolatito. Flyweights is such an exciting division.
I wanna see YOU fight 3 times a year
We did in canelo
True but we'll always have big names but we won't always have a Lomachenko lol. He's been a pro for nearly 10 years and has fought twice a year since the start, would like to see as much of him as possible.
> Inoue stops him easily  I'll take that bet if the fight happens in the next year.
It seems every other week these days there's a guy who has had to cut too much for a weight he can barely make and he's likely to look weight drained. But I'm not sure of the last time I actually saw someone struggle from being drained.  Just a week ago everyone was concerned about Benavidez. Dude looked fine on fight night though.
The IBF rule might play against Haney. He's only allowed to add 10lbs from the first weigh-in to the 2nd weigh-in on the morning of the fight so that could work against him unless he plans to ignore the rule and drop the IBF belt for the fight (which he might do anyway if he's moving up).
You're saying that as if Devin isn't the best fighter he's faced lol
I like Loma, but didn’t Haney beat Kambosos who beat Lopez who beat Loma?
It’s a whole new fresh crop of players at 130, who are all primed and ready to go. If he feels he’s too small then he’s free to move down and make some elite fights happen against some great talent.  And he has not been jumping through flamed hoops to get fights lol  Teo was a great fight and he lost, naturally that moves you down the ladder and you have to settle for what it is (Nakatani and Commey). George Kambosos was going to fight him after he beat Teo but the war happened and Loma had to defend his country, respect. Now he’s fighting Haney, who has been after him for years. He has not been jumping through flamed hoops for shit ever since he got to 135.
I don’t understand why “guy testing himself in weight class he’s uncomfortable with against the best fighters” is a bad thing but apparently it is
“Become weak?”  When did I say it became weak? The excuses are weak  And him having 500 fights doesn’t have anything to do with him making excuses, do you hear yourself?  Loma fans I tell you, I’m not going back and forth any longer, I’ll just let y’all bathe in the salt.
He actually did say he wouldn't fight at 154 again after beating Margarito at that weight.  Though he was open to some catch weights at 150lb. Not to take anything away from him since he fought everyone, and even 147 was above where he should've been, but he knew his limits too.
Exactly. Manny was beating up p4p guys way above his optimal weight  Loma becomes compromised as soon as he faces an average ass boxer with muscles.  Dudes not too small, it’s hella guys today and from the past who have been putting in work on way bigger guys, maybe Loma is just more flawed as a fighter than they care to admit
There's maybe 8 boxers tops, in all of history, who don't come up short when compared to Pacquiao, so even if we agree, you're not really saying much.
Wow😂  I made one grammatical mistake and you jump on that because your crying ass ain’t got shit else of substance to say  Go take a walk to blow some steam off and come back when your lame ass can conjure up an actual comeback. We can see all you do is comment about Loma HERE, you do know that right?  Now find something to correct in that.  I can see why your “Dreams” are “Skeptical”
Has any boxer ever lost a fight in their mind?
"didnt use his size against him at all"   Buddy you never boxed in your life if you think the bigger guy "needs" to use anything, its a natural advantage.
They fought at 130 Rigo was a small 122. If you saw a fight, there was real size difference between the two.
He has been a lightweight for 5 years and has had 8 fights stop making excuses it’s pathetic
Good for Haney, whether Loma is the best opponent or not he’s still a dumbass. Can’t even remember his own fight date lol  Loma is moving very weird calling out someone who hasn’t even fought at 126 yet, he’s a goofy 35y/o who has 2 loses in 19 fights.
It's so funny how every negative comment about Loma gets downvoted to oblivion all the time. Not just -5 downvoted, it's like you guys personally insulted them lol.
😂
I broke the dam
Can't reach the ground with those T-Rex arms.
So you're saying there's a chance?
same like him doing coke for 2+ years every day! Take my money I want to see that!
He had the courage to try to achieve something great and now gets called stupid by keyboard warriors on Reddit.   I wish more boxers took risks rather than safe fights.
But he saw something though.
You have to look at it from Mikey's perspective. If he managed to beat spence, he's a 5 division world champion beating one of the  top welterweights at that time. In terms of divisions that puts you in the conversations of all time greats with just one fight.
Got to give him credit for not being a pussy like most boxers nowadays
$$$
Power pellets 👀
Increased his power and speed. Couldn’t do drug tests though as they could weaken him…
He moved up 12 weight classes. He got 8 belts on those 12.
Although, the belts - Mayweather has 15, the record  quality of fighters defeated - 23 different champions beaten, the record.   Money/fiscal earnings procured - whatever this is it’s clearly going to be the record   and aggressive/counter puncher fighting style on display - this describes his style as pretty boy Mayweather before he broke his hands for the fourth time and had to switch it up.   Congratulations, you just described Floyd.
Canelo is not like Pacquiao
Was kinda sad that Chocolatito lost to Estrada (honestly thought chocolatito had that fight won though tbh) because a fight with Bam Rodriguez would probably be next on the card, and Chocolatito has never shy'd away from a fight
I can't fight one round without getting winded tho!
Bro ask my shampoo bottles I’m fighting every damn day these guys don’t even know
I'm surprised people here rate him so highly. I watched his latest fight and all I can think is Loma looked like he missed a step and should have been able to get that dude out of there. Ortiz went the full 12 against a washed Herring whose 11 years older than him lol.   Ortiz is not at the level where a fighter in title contention should be going the distance with him.  I'm calling it now Haney is going to Jab his way to a boring ass UD and Loma will be grabbed often and unable to stop it. Then people here will act like they knew it was gonna go down like that all along.
Im not 100% convinced he is. If you go by a "the guy who has the belts is auto best" sure whatever. But Haney beat a guy no one had even heard of, a guy who had probably the best night of his life when he won the belts. All im going to say is I hope its an awesome as fuck fight and im glad that they were down to fight. Way too much ducking is taking place lately in boxing. Def gotta give Haney props for his want to fight the best available competition.
mma math don’t work
That logic doesn't work. Let me remake your sentence using Pokemon.   Didn't pikachu beat squirtel who beat charmander who beat bulbasaur?
Joe Frazier beat the shit out of Muhammad Ali. Then Joe Frazier got the shit beaten out of him by George Foreman. Then George foreman got the shit beat out of him by Muhammad Ali.  What-about-isms don't mean shit when it comes to boxing.
Powerscaler tier logic
rewind back 3-4 years, he cleared out 126 and 130 and nobody of note wanted anything to do with him, his move to 135 was forced by the industry   yes he wants Haney to get his belts back  if he loses i am fine, but it wont be a cake walk for Haney  the man is just explaining the situation but yall jump on him and invent narratives that dont exist  just be glad they're finally fighting
It shows that he is so skilled he can negate the size difference
Just look at peoples opinion of canelo after the Bivol fight. Boxing fans can never be satisfied
you dont have to be an ATG to refrain from bitching about your own decision to move up to a new weight
Lol. Bro, you're the one with the nerves of ~~steel~~ plastic; criticizing one of the best boxers in the game right now, because of some comments he made in an INTERVIEW? You act like he's running around all day spewing "excuses".   The fact is that he IS too small for that weight class. Period. Instead of acknowledging that truth and giving him props for stepping UP, you want to chastise a comment? Haney is currently draining himself to fight at 135, which is why he's moving up after this fight. Look at how big he looks when he stands next to Loma.   The grammar stuff was a joke. We both know that grammar doesn't matter here just like neither of our opinions. But me being "Skeptical" is a lot more honest than you being a "GOAT".
Yes, one’s who aren’t delusional and can accept defeat
You seem to forget that Loma started as a pro at 125 ( that’s 3 lb above where Rigo did) and that the latter is the one that taunted and begged to get the fight for a while.
How can you read my comment and miss the point this hard?
he was asked a question and he answered  he isnt calling anyone out  how are you on reddit if you cant read?   interviewer asked him if he would fight Inoue at 126 and he said if he can get down to 126 then sure they can fight  that's it  all this bullshit your saying is your own invention
It would help if they weren’t alarmingly stupid.
Exactly 😂 I don’t even dislike Loma I just like pissing off his sensitive ass fans 😂😂
A chance he dies?
Looking another way his chances were way low for that fight.
Saw two of everything for about a fortnight after too
Yeah but the higher you go the bigger the difference between weight classes. Most top talents in lower divisions go up and get belts 2-3 weight classes above. This rarely happens at heavier weights.  That was a bad decision and literally everyone called it even before the fight.
Spence wasn’t even a huge draw at that point. It was a terrible decision to cap off a horribly mismanaged career.  He could’ve gotten similar kind of money fighting way easier fights like Postol, Commey, Linares, Jojo Diaz, Campbell etc. then eventually made huge money against one of the young guys at 135 like Tank, Ryan, or Haney and he would have probably beat most of them if not all. He straight up ruined his career, he was really talented.
Never said he was, just that he’s the only other guy that’s actively winning championships in multiple weight classes. From welterweight to light heavyweight.
To be fair their fights were close(and brilliantly amazing). I had Choc 2 - 1. Choc had the first and 2nd fight while Estrada had the third fight.
bet it would a hell of a round
Gotta start somewhere I guess
I don't think that Loma has been the same since he hurt his shoulder. I'm hoping the time off has helped that recover a little more completely.
I want you to go look in a mirror and say out loud "Devin Haney isn't better than Lopez, Nakatani, Ortiz, Commey, Campbell etc etc." with a straight face. I understand rooting for your guy, I get that, but let's be serious lol  He's never been an underdog to my recollection. He's likely to enter this fight as a big underdog. Again, let's be serious
But this isn’t Pokémon, and I’m not saying Haney will beat Loma.  I’m talking about Haney’s competition,
I’m not talking about who wins. I’m talking about the level of competition.
“Invent narratives that don’t exist”  That don’t exist? He said out of his own damn mouth that he’s too small for 135 and I commented on it, that’s not creating a narrative, that’s responding to something LOMA SAID.  “Just be glad they’re fighting”  I don’t know why you feel the need to tell me this. I am glad they’re fighting, you just don’t like me arguing against a statement your precious Loma made
Yes because of the comments in the interview, know one said he runs around spewing excuses all day, I just didn’t like hearing that excuse.  And no one’s bashing him for fighting up, he gets props, I just don’t want to hear he’s too small when he’s fighting there by CHOICE. Nobody that beats him should have to deal with excuse for why he lost. Plenty of men are fighting up today, not just Loma. He’s not special and most of the other guys don’t make excuses for when they do lose. Once you move up any excuse for why you lost is down the drain and doesn’t matter.  “A lot more honest than you being a “Goat” “  Still going huh? Loma will never be a GOAT, unlike me.
you talking to loma nut lickers bro you gonna get downvoted for being logical
He shouldn’t be entertaining fights with bantamweights. It’s incredibly sad that your defending this pathetic behaviour.
[STSASU!!!!](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkx_z-esIzOO3_X5j_f9gFEUk2KM5jkMzZy) This dumbass thinks he’s still undefeated, is entertaining fights w/ 118lbers, & MAKES EXCUSES… you’re nothing more than embarrassing enabler of all his bullshit. Boxing is better off w/o people like you.
Please stop. Logic is no good here.
Same here. I actually like Loma but his fanboys are something else.
I’ll take that chance
All the number I saw said 360k-400k PPV buys and that both guys earned 8-10 million.  Guaranteed 3 mil each but the PPV would have been 25-27 million revenue generated, and the split up.   Mikey had never headlined a PPV before
Spence actually was since that fight on free Fox tv right after the Alabama college football game. They held the majority of the audience. Then they partnered him on free Fox tv with Jerry Jones and the Dallas Cowboys. Also, if you remember the fight, Spence didn’t bully him around the ring. Spence outboxed him and won every round easily.
He was was caught with something once. Who knows how many times he wasn’t caught 😂
super welterweight
Yeah their fights are always a pleasure to watch and hella close. I had estrada winning the first and the chocolatito winning the last two
I'll do my best. Put me in coach!
Alright I'm back! The competition Haney has fought doesn't impress me. But that's just my opinion. None of this matters, we'll find out fight night!
Haney is the biggest challenge loma has faced because of size and age. Rigo is a better boxer than haney. I said it out loud in front of my mirror.
Explaining the analogy. Styles make fights. The comparison with the pokemon is that some elemental types are weaker and more susceptible to losing to certain element types.   All three of them fight differently. Kambosos tries to counterpunch, Lopez is a  boxer puncher and Loma uses his footwork to create angles. Just because Kambosos beat Lopez doesn't mean he can beat Loma.
What's the difference?
Save your energy. This sub has trouble holding their preferred fighters accountable. Its an echo chamber.
Fucking preach lmao. I respect fighters for competing beyond their natural weight but the size difference shouldn’t be used as an excuse to detract Haney’s credit if Loma ends up losing
Why shouldn't he entertain a fight in any class that he can make weight?
you're using words which you're not fully understanding the meaning of
I think he would’ve made more than that eventually had he played the long game, especially with how 135 became one of, if not the hottest division in boxing as soon as he left.
> Spence outboxed him and won every round easily.  Which is a big part of using you size advantage correctly and bullying the smaller fighter.  What do you guys think it looks like when a guy uses his size advantage to bully another fighter? You think they should get in close and wrestle them?
Which is interesting because no matter what they both win. In your scenario, Estrada beats a Prime Chocolatito. That is an amazing win. Then later, a past it Chocolatito beats a Prime Estrada twice. Even if you reverse this, both still had a strong argument for how great their wins are.  Its such a shame the lower weight classes aren't that popular.
Again, I am not saying Haney will beat Loma.  I am talking about the level of competition. OP said that Haney hasn't fought anyone at Loma's level of competition, which I don't believe is true since Haney, Garcia, Loma, Kambosos, Lopez, etc are all elite level fighters, even if Loma is the most skilled of them all.
In my mind, Lomachenko, Davis, Kambosos, Lopez, Garcia, and Haney are all elite level competition. Maybe Loma is the most skilled of them all, but OP said that Haney hasn't fought anyone at the same level of competition as Loma.
“Why shouldn’t the former unified lightweight champion entertain a fight against a bantamweight at a weight class they have never fought at before whilst simultaneously complaining about being undersized”?   😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Man is really freeing up the ass! 🤣🤣
That joke was rubbish 😂
Possibly, but these guys were just up and comers then, he was chasing them he Pac fight.    Did he maximize his career from a boxing purist standpoint, no.  But he made most of his money in his last three fights and part of that was because of the exposure from the Spence fight.   He reportedly made 7 mil a o fight Vargas.  It worked out well for hi financially.
Mikey wanted to retire
>I think he would’ve made more than that eventually had he played the long game,    Mikey was 32yo and had been a pro 13 years at this point. He had grown up spending his entire life hanging around boxing gyms and was tired of it. Hes said several times even before the Spence fight that he didn't really like boxing anymore ...... so "the long game"  is just you talking out of your ass and thinking you know better than him.
For sure - these guys at the lower weights don't get the respect that they deserve
The only one of them he fought was Kambosos lol
Let me rephrase:  Why shouldn't ANY fighter entertain a fight in ANY weight class that they can make weight?
Which still negates the OP’s point which was my point lol
If he only fought Kambosos (the weakest competition of all the guys you mentioned) why are you lumping the rest in? It seems like the only way to make your argument believable is by trying to equate Kambosos to higher level competition.
Jack Johnson would later claim that he was paid to take a dive. Most didn't believe it because who goes 26 freakin rounds before taking a dive.
Still blows my mind that we have fight footage from freaking 1915. I still have a long shot hope that we can one day find Ray Robinson’s welterweight fight footage from the 40’s 👀👀
Ortiz in second row if you look carefully
The fight was scheduled for 45 rounds, and it took place in the blistering Cuban heat. Johnson, the defending champion, had been champ for nearly 7 years at this point, and had been driven out of the US by 1915. He was 37, and the once seemingly invincible Johnson's age was finally beginning to show. Willard, who was the new 'Great White Hope' picked to beat Jack, was a staggering 6'6 and 238 pounds.   Despite some minuscule failed negotiations between Jack Dempsey and 'coloured' heavyweight champion Harry Wills, this would be the last time a black man fought for the heavyweight title until Joe Louis won the title against James J. Braddock in 1937. Credit to Smooth Legends for the video.
Funny how color commentator was channeling JJ’s inner monologue
Jesus 45 rounds. Why though? I’d be bored eventually watching that many rounds
Most accounts described how the Cuban fans were very much a pro Willard audience. It goes to show that racist white supremacy wasn't just a southern U.S. phenomenon.
I could see grampa Simpson having a long winded rant about this fight being too short.
26 rounds and we guys gassing out at 6....
45 rounds shit, I know the output isn't like modern boxing but shit that and 103 degree heat.
I'm loving these
Does footage of the whole fight exist?
Someone really dedicated to the grift.
Yeah, if you watch the final few seconds, you'll see Jack Johnson shield his eyes from the sun with his gloves -- which he offered as proof of his dive.  But to me, that looked like a very legit KO shot...
Just to give a different perspective, the pro wrestlers of the day would go 1-2 hours long in a world title fight before the finish. And it was still predetermined back then but going an hour and a half gives someone in the crowd less of a reason to believe it's a work.
That's even worse than just losing.
He's probably lying, but to play devil's advocate, that's probably to make it look believable.
There is quite a bit of footage of prime Robinson from the 40s, although nowhere near the same amount as the 50s
Yea I just watched some yesterday  https://youtu.be/i5FwNkY9rqE
Look up Ray Robinson vs Freddy Flores.  That is the ray Robinson I would travel back in time to see.  Every punch was thrown with the absolute worst intentions and the form was incredible.  Bolo punches that can knock you dead
Most original joke on this sub
Nope, that's his grandson, Jr, Jr.
Pfft 45 rounds? Back in my day we did 45 rounds as a warm up backstage
> Despite some minuscule failed negotiations between Jack Dempsey and 'coloured' heavyweight champion Harry Wills  I don't know if "minuscule" really makes sense here since Jack was so annoyed at promoter Tex Rickard's inability to make the match that he jettisoned him in favor of promoter Floyd Fitzsimmons.  Rickard was the author of Dempsey's $1 million gate against Carpentier, while Fitzsimmons was a comparatively smalltime promoter who handled Jack's first title defense against Billy Miske ($137,000 gate).  Fitzsimmons famously bounced his check to Dempsey, ending any chance of the fight occurring.
Seen some great posts from you over the past couple weeks mate. I love watching these old fights, the old boys were a different breed, couldn’t imagine being scheduled for 45. Thanks a lot! From me and my dad who loves them too.
That’s the crazy part Willard is AJ sized all the way back then a super heavyweight, lost to a middleweight too so history repeats itself…
Presumably this was reconstructed audio since we didn't get radio recordings or broadcast until 1920/21.  That voice over supposed to be Jack Johnson is err something else...
Aren’t a lot of the Cubans black? Most Cuban boxers Ik are black, the only non black ones Ik are Gamboa and Robeisy
So you have to always go for the black boxer? Or else you're a racist? 🤔 That's BS...
I don't think anyone who knows Latin American history (or American history in general) thinks white supremacy or racism is just southern phenomena.
Probably not.
Just because he was knocked out doesn’t mean he was completely unconscious. He may have still been able to shield his eyes, while not having the strength, stamina, balance, or desire to get back on his feet before the 10 count.
Cheers! HCD 🎂
That joke's almost as old as Ortiz
True, Fitzsimmons did try to screw over Dempsey when the fight was close to happening in 1926.
Thanks so much! I just felt like the old school fighters were being heavily unappreciated on the sub, so I wanted to post some of the best old school fights I can find.
In the Cuban heat 45 rounds,
Doesn’t mean the audience was, as it would often be in the US for many decades
Do you think these cuban fans were against Jack Johnson in 1915 (during the Jim Crow era) because of his fighting style?
You read about Fitzsimmons and every kinda agrees he was a good egg and friendly but not a great businessman.  IMO (no real evidence) he was sincere in his efforts and wanted to pay everybody, he just didn't have the cash on-hand to make the promised deal happen.  From reading various contemporary accounts I get the impression he thought the money would materialize as public demand for the fight spiked but that never happened and he tried to baloney his way along until it did.  Both Dempsey and Harry Wills had decent things to say about the man, they seemed to think he was operating in good faith.
Sure they were. And Johnson was fighting in Cuba instead of the US because he loved the weather. Racism didn't exist until right before MLK gave his "I have a dream" speech, and ended immediately after.
Ortiz was a very good fight for Loma. Bigger guy with a high offensive rate. Basically what Loma hates the most.
Would love to see Ortiz vs Zepeda!  Would be a banger of a fight
Of course Ortiz is good. People jump to fighters getting old a bit too quickly. Before Ortiz fight, Loma dismantled Commey and Nakatani who are both pretty decent fighters.   Also, even though Ortiz performed well, Loma still won that fight very clearly. He had very clear 7 rounds and pretty reasonable 8 rounds that he won. Its just that his habit of giving away first 1-2 rounds for free is a dangerous strategy against top guys.
I agree too . I don’t think loma was old. Ortiz is just good. GGG beat canelo at 34-35 area.  Crawford beat porter at 35 and looked fantastic . Nowadays 35 isn’t old for athlete .
I can see Ortiz going on to do great things.
Has Ortiz got another fight booked yet?
I agree.  People act like Loma looked terrible but I just Think Ortiz looked like a very capable young fighter, switch hitter had sparred Loma a lot and knew how to plan for him.   I think Ortiz along with Zepeda are two upcoming guys at lightweight to keep an eye on.
He is
I thought Ortiz won
or really any fighter if the guys big enough lol
For sure.
Yeah. And they were sparring partners. If it wasn’t the case it’s be a more lopsided fight.
I thought the fight could have been scored a draw.  Ortiz threw 36 more punches and Vasyl landed 3 more punches.
Dude when Ortiz switched southpaw he was giving Loma some work. I need to check his other fights out.
Ignoring ggg had already declined sure
>GGG beat canelo at 34-35 area  Draw
Sadly I feel like he is not going to get a fight. High risk low reward.
Me too.
Nope, he wants to fight but he isn’t getting one.
fuck no XD, he gave away all the championship rounds and there were way too many swing rounds to give him the victory.
It was a competitive fight but when scoring round by round, RDs: 3,5,6,9,10,11,12 were oretty clearly Loma rounds . RD7 was very close.   Some totally Loma biased person could have also score either Rd2 or Rd4 for Loma too, he did have some moments in them. That is probably what the judge did who scored the bout 117-111
I thought so as well until I saw both guys' faces. A lot of loma's connections are still so fast it's easy to miss how clean they land
Honestly confused why he didn’t stay as southpaw, Loma was struggling with finding angles when he was southpaw
His fight against Herring was good.
That’s a shame I’m keen too see him action again.
Disagree: but he would never get a decision win unless he totally dominates
I wouldn't count on loma to stay struggling. Going southpaw takes away the orthodox right, which historically is the actual best way to control loma's approach.
i think if haney wins hell move up and all belts become vacant. if loma wins he fights shakur... and then idk hopefully they dont hold belts hostage. i really wish haney moved up and loma would fight shakur for a belt. i like that matchup more
shakur is a true student of the game
Boxing savant/sponge. He’d make a great trainer one day.
Damn, dude bodied Rayo and Colbert  Him vs Frank Martin is a great fight
Isaac Cruz team supposedly turned him down. Pbc was trying to make that fight
Even though it was sparring, the judges still gave Colbert the decision.
This guy is the real deal. He needs more hype.
Edwin definitely a threat to any top 135
This sub usually hates when they talk about Sparring, but they condone this one? Lol..
He is a problem for anyone at 135 due to his obvious power. Great fight however Idk if Martin and company would be interested in it. High risk, low reward.
Isaac’s team has been ducking everybody as of late  Shakur and Ryan as well, after his showing against Gervonta they are just going to feed him easy knockouts and he’ll scrape up a title if Haney beats Loma and leaves 135
They’re waiting for Haney to move up so they can fight for the vacant WBC
Had so much respect for the guy, until this kinda stuff happens. Honestly, Tank would’ve KOd or at least  knocked him down if it was for the fact he broke his left hand.
Damn Isaac
The fight where Canelo tried the shoulder roll
I'd have to go back and watch it again, but if it was this all night, that is not an early stoppage.
I remember Gomez from the Contender. Miss that show
Good clip to show the distinction between a very good boxer and elite. Gomez's head movement at the start of the clip was good, was reasonably defensively responsible and was trying to set up shots intelligently but Canelo shows that elite timing, shot picking and power. Excellent stuff
That’s what he gets for rapping/ freestyling at the press conference.
Canelo, the baddest thing since sliced bread
Ref made the right call, Cinnabon was about to go ham on that oaf. Would make for a great highlight real, but Gomez can skip the trip to the ER and be with his fam
Don't understand why people hate on quick reffing decisions...no way Gomez was gonna get out of that victorious, wasn't defending himself, wasn't throwing anything back.  Save him the brain damage imo
A late stoppage is always worse than an early one. That said, this was a very very early stoppage.
I was at this fight in LA, definitely a bit too early of a stoppage.  They showed Victor Ortiz vs Mayweather on the screen after this (it was in Vegas) and the whole crowd was throwing their drinks after Mayweather controversially KO’d Ortiz.  I didn’t understand the throwing of drinks since the fight was happening about 200 miles away.
This was at Caneloweight when he was fighting little men.
Early stoppage.  EDIT: This stoppage was identical to Wardley v Coffie this past weekend, but y'all were mad about that one.
💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
is that the guy from the contender 2005? what a blast from the past.
jim lampley and co wanted to see some blood, they wanted to see destruction
Brutal finishing shots
That technique is amazing
That combo at the ropes😱
Cinnamon roll
Hmm, Canelo really did go into a Philly shell right before he landed that big punch. Never thought I'd ever see that
It wasn’t - Gomez was having some success. Mostly because Canelo was basically sparring and trying out the shoulder roll. Did feel early from memory.
The contender had him, ishe smith and Sergio Mora, good show!
DAZN should make that an Orignal Content sort of thing. Too many wasted opportunities. UFC has The Ultimate Fighter
I miss both of those boxing shows. 🤔 The great contender and what was the other one?
i followed that man since the contender, this whole fight was hard to watch.
Did he really?
I completely forgot about it , it was hard to watch.
Bivol😬
Coz boxers have come out to victories from much worse situations than this.
He wasn't getting his that much actually
Imagine calling someone who's 5'7.5 about 170 lbs walking at the time huge 😂🤣. Pinches ridículos
If he let it keep going, Canelo would've just knocked him cold. Ref saved him from a concussion.
You're getting downvoted because you've made that assumption off a 30 second clip. I haven't seen it since it was live but I believe Alvarez was thrasing him for several rounds, dropped him once.
A bit, but it was the right call to make. In that short clip there was already a dozen unanswered punches. As soon as Gomez opened up again he would have gone to sleep.
Yes it was premature. I was watching when it happened.  It was early, no matter what anyone says.
It was a very early stoppage.
Probably the best comment I’ve read on this sub thus far.
Forgot about Ishe Smith! Sergio Mora won it all. I think something like it would work today.
https://youtu.be/vSP0B5nxsuA
So why did Canelo need to fight at catchweights then and fight smaller fighters above their natural weight?
I'm not saying Canelo wouldn't have knocked him out, but the guy only *just* got hurt, and took a few more, then the ref jumped in. Even the commentators in this video said it was too quick.  In fact, this was very reminiscent of Wardley v Coffie this past weekend. Virtually the exact same situation. So this Canelo clip is where everyone seems to defend that stoppage, but the same people trash on the Wardley stoppage?
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFrnEK\_sXQA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFrnEK_sXQA)  ehhhh he may have a point
I'd rather have a ref who stops it too early rather than too late.
So you're okay with the Wardley v Coffie stoppage too?
If it meant protecting his brain, then yeah.
I thought Wardley Coffie was a reasonable stoppage tbh.
Fair enough, that's consistent at least.
I felt if it went longer, Coffie still would have got stopped. But it just seemed a bit too quick for my liking.
Herring wasn’t a top tier champ but Shakur WHOOPED HIM.   Shakur is out here practically shutting out other world champs. Or in the case of Valdez and Conceicao, beating them 11-1.  Incredible boxer and man I’m excited to see him at 135
The best in the game. Can’t stand the kid, but he is the best at the moment
Id much rather get KOd quick then get pieced up like this round after round. I'm a huge Shakur fan but I ended up mostly feeling bad for Jamel as the fight went on
Ok I might be wrong but why do I see so many pro boxers that are south paws shouldn't they be rare or something.
Shakur is acquiring a pretty nice resume of opponents.
One of the best performances of 2021, masterful
Shakur’s boxing is picture perfect
Jamel isn't a chump either. He had proven himself as a guy you can't count out... And Shakur made him look like he didn't belong in the same ring as him.
Looked so good in this fight
Stoppage seemed kind of premature. Let the man get the rest of his ass whooped before you pull him out.
Shakur is so special he can put the whole sport on his shoulders I’m geeked for his future.
Herring was literally washed AF when this fight took place
Good fight but Herring looked terrible. Zero defense
If only Shakur had power he’d be dangerous. For now it’s just getting outboxed by pillows.
the best
This guy is top of the class and wipes everyone from 140 and down OUT.  Great control of spacing, angles, great ring IQ and he’s got the physical gifts too.
Unbelievable
What round did Valdez win, not tryna hate, just wanted to know, I scored that fight 12-0 in favor of Shakur, while the Conceição fight I scored 10-2 in favor of Shakur
Southpaws aren’t rare per se, but they are less common then orthodox which is the style majority of boxers fight in and go up against  There are a lot of southpaws, there are just more orthodox.
Some southpaws, like Shakur for example, are actually right handed but were trained to be southpaws
Not rare,  just not as common as orthodox.  Statistically  between 10 to 12 percent of boxers should be southpaw.
At least in the amateur world, before you’re looking at the cream of the crop, southpaws have a real advantage. From the perspective of the orthodox fighter, everything is backward. Your jab suddenly is matched up with their jab, for example.   I think even in Rocky, Apollo says something like “oh shit he’s a southpaw.”  Source: Am amateur boxer who gets fucking worked by southpaws.
Its like pitchers in baseball. Average population is probably around 15% but because of advantage they from right handers not being used to facing them and people like Shakur who got trained to be southpaws just for the advantage, it ends up with more of them in boxing and baseball.
Round 3 and 9 is what I remember giving him
I forget, there was 1 round where Shakur was a a bit more passive and Valdez just had more activity.  Not every effective, but still
Ive always been confused by this concept, I’m not tryna hate, I just wanna understand as to why. I tho7ht left or right handed people are stronger with their dominant hand? I’m left handed and tried orthodox, my right hand just doesn’t have that pop when it’s the rear but works rather well when it’s the lead.
You can transfer more weight when your dominant hand is in back, so you stand with your weak hand forward to open a path for the rear handed shot to get the knockout since you’ll be able to aim better. Standing with your dominant hand forward is a viable strategy but not the norm because the 1-2 is still the best combo in boxing and needs to be set up   It feels better for nearly everyone to stand dominant hand forward at first but you learn to be comfortable
Well I'm not a pro  but when I first started  I absolutely knew nothing about boxing  , didn't even know what orthodox and Southpaw meant . I started fighting in a Southpaw stance even though I'm right handed , I worked on my left a bit and never shadow boxed or hit the bag in the orthodox stance . Now after some time I have much better balance in the Southpaw stance I don't overreach with my left crosses , even if the backhand feels more natural to throw in orthodox , throwing the left is much more ingrained in my routine
You're jabbing with your dominant hand and you regularly face right handers but they don't regularly face southpaws. Especially early on, it can be confidence boosting for left handers to piece up confused kids on boxing or baseball and get them to work harder at the sport.  For an outboxer like Shakur who looks to control distance, it can be a theoretical advantage for winning early rounds and doing more damage with their jabs.  You can transfer more weight with your punch if it starts in the rear position but it requires more coordination so its easier to do so with your dominant hand. So without training, you get a slightly stiffer jab but lose a lot of power from the other hand. With training, you mostly just lose a little power from it not being your dominant hand.
Surprisingly I feel like your dominant leg also matters alot, I'm right handed and right leg dominate so I feel like my left hand has more power then it should, like my left hook is by far my most powerful punch because you load off the opposite leg.
Very few leave the mcguigans happy. Okolie only one I can remember.
what is this? twitter is talking about irish mob shit, how deep does this go?
It would seem Cameron didn't pull Scotney to the side with Hearn and explain the situation, offer assurances of securing her title shot later on in the year etc - although we'll probably never know what really happened.   Quite a few fighters have left the McGuigans on really bitter terms so I guess there is some truth to it.
Very few leave the mcguigans happy. Okolie only one I can remember and he had a different management deal.
[removed]
tldr
 Can someone give a breakdown on the history of this beef, it’s not making sense at all
Yeah Josh Taylor and Frampton very good examples of the McGuigans being pricks
She was MTK so there’s definitely Kinahan connections.
Before the legal issues and the NDA she was a lot clearer about what happened. t sounded like Shane promised to focus on her exclusively in the lead up to her foghts but he was busy with other fighters and when she asked him about it, he'd yell at her and demean her til she felt like shit and just accepted the little time he gave her.  I'm not saying she wasn't sexually harrassed, just that isn't what she's said in the past
You think? Shane seems likeable enough or am I missing something. I thought it was his dad who is the dodgy one
To me it sounds like she is trying to imply that without saying it. The entire text comes across as weird and narcissistic
Yeah I never understood why Shane was catching feelings for those 2 leaving his father's promotional company. It's business, not personal. Shane could have still trained those two as he trains many people who aren't signed with Cyclone.
That's enough to make her uncomfortable around him
Maybe it's his dad. But she must seem extremely uncomfortable to be around someone to not want him in the same arena.
I mean if she's been harassed to that extent, it's pretty devastating
I agree, he sounds terrible, and that interacting with him would really disturb her focus.
So one of them tried it on with her possibly? Got to feel for her if that’s true. Always thought the McGuigans were sound but they seem to be amassing enemies for some reason
Yeah and if she hasn't then it is irresponsible dog whistling. A lot of whining about mental health and no actual specifics, claiming some excuse of an NDA. Crimes aren't covered under NDA just contracts.
Barry is a cheating businessman. Shane seems to be nice, but with women you never know how men can begin to act.
If she hasn't she wouldn't mind his presence.
Very true. Chantelle Cameron seems like a nice lass and very settled and looked after by Jamie Moore’s camp. Moore’s a class act, would be great if she beats KT. Don’t think she will though
Right, that could be the only conclusion. You're remarkably credulous.
I don't follow british women boxers that closely to know honestly
Taylor's only getting older and Cameron has a busy style, great opportunity.
>credulous  And you are incredulous.
I’m not a massive fans of it either but it’s been getting better recently. Taylor vs Serrano was a great fight.
Hope she gives it all she’s got. She doesn’t seem to have much power in her punches but good skill set
I'm familiar with the American ones more
I think the more plausible scenario is that he's just a dickhead.
I hate when people try to bring up "waiting someone out" because they forget **BOTH** fighters are getting older.  It's not like Fury is freezing himself in a cryo chamber while Usyk his aging. Usyk might be 2 years older than him, but he is dozens of pounds lighter. Carrying around that much weight is going to hurt Fury wayyyy faster than Usyk.
There is no way 1.5 years age difference makes the slightest of difference between them. Usyk is an example of a fit well trained athlete and Fury is, well he's just Fury.
Fury is a shithouse he deserves the slander he’s getting. I don’t think he’s scared of anyone but the dude doesn’t even know what he wants. The usyk probably doesn’t mean shit to him. Or “undisputed”. He gets up for certain type of opponents. The narratives of wlad/wilder/AJ excites him. But clearly usyk and undisputed doesn’t compute in his brain. He’s won every belt and was lineal. Trying to figure him out is always a mess bc fury doesn’t probably know himself either Lmao. Also shoutout usyk, second best resume in boxing for prime fighters right now
No he's just a dick, although Fury handled Wilder those fights took some toll on him. So him waiting for Usyk to age out is ridiculous.
I think Fury and AJ have a secret agreement for the summer. I read that Fury didn’t want the rematch clause because the third Wilder fight stopped him from fighting AJ for undisputed and a double massive payday. If Fury beats AJ and then has two fights against Usyk then he’s laughing. Frank Warren is also laughing because if Usyk fights Dubious and then Fury he’s also getting double money.
When you day you're getting Mayweather Pacquiao vibes are you saying that Pacquiao delayed that fight to get an older Floyd?   Mayweather is older than Pacquiao   Regardless. Fury just doesn't want this fight really. That simple.
Gonna repeat this until people on this sub understand.   Go meet some gypsies. Really try and get to know them. Now imagine the ones who've been repeatedly punched in the head from a young age    Fury is a smart guy, he will take advantage of the phenomena that is bullshit baffles brains. You'll be amazed.
Bigger purse.   Should be obvious.  Chisora mentioned it as well (he's surprisingly accurate when it comes to boxing politics).   I think the UK purse for the Usyk/Fury fight was going to be modest and Fury wants £100 million. People keep talking about ducking but I just don't think Fury operates on that wavelength. I reckon what really has him stewing is seeing Joshua get paid £65 million to fight Ruiz in Saudi and definitely wants to best that. I can imagine him feeling massively insecure if his seminal undisputed fight resulted in him earning even less than AJ for a fight against a fat pudding in Ruiz. Remember there is all the chance of him steamrolling Usyk (hell, Usyk possibly even steamrolling him) killing the chance for a rematch to make any real money.   This talk of aging out is bullshit. Golovkin was 34 and 35 in the second (not sure where you're getting 37 from, that bout took place in 2018). He was hardly a spring chicken. Manny was even younger than Mayweather when they eventually fought. A decent heavyweight can have a competitive career up until their late 30's now. Its not like they're fighting all that often these days anyway.   Also "aging out" is another term casuals use which none of you mugs understand. Years in boxing don't age you, fights do. Hence why someone like Whyte seems punch drunk at like 35 whereas Joyce is the same age and seems like a spring chicken. Whyte is also known for regular wars in sparring. There is no guarantee that Usyk will suddenly show signs of slowdown in the next 2-3 years.
Fury is trying to big belly. Not much to look into.
I think he’s just buying time for adjustments and training. Usyk is ridiculously fast for his size and there was an interview fury did back then, where he highlighted his fear of smaller/faster guys.
At this point it hardly matters , he once again collapses a big fight for bullshit reasons and lied to everyone.
I’ll see your “age him a year”, and raise you a “intentionally played with my life long goal of undisputed and wasted a year of my prime”. You need an ATM?
It's a bad plan to try to age Usyk out when you're only 2 years younger, have put your body through a lot and have a raging coke habit.   Fury looks to have noticeably slowed in the last few years (albeit adjusted to a new style to mitigate incredibly well) and I don't think it's a good strategy to try to wait out someone who's an absolutely elite athlete.
Downloading more data.  Usuk at hw. Is still unknown
I think Fury, Wilder and Joshua are all kind of shellshocked ATM if we're being honest.  Fury only wants to fight beneath himself  Joshua isn't the same monster he was.  And unless Wilder really is lurking for a title shot then I have to question what's going on with him, and I'm a huge Wilder fan
I don't like how Fury has behaved lately and I am rooting for Usyk but I unequivocally do not think that Tyson Fury is scared of any boxer.
You can plan a pretty picnic but you can’t predict the weather.  There are a lot of mega fights that lined up, matchmaking wise, to happen this year. But is this the best year to actually have them? The economy is in a huge recession, inflation is sky high. House holds and businesses alike are making budget cuts.   Fury and all these other boxing stars are assets and their promoters do not want to cash out this year or all years, after what, a decade of investment?  That’s why I’m expecting half these big name fights to keep falling through.
He clearly has mental issues, then add his douche bag  character, and you get this Fury we are seeing now.
One option of Fury's game plan might be to wait until Usyk goes to war in a mandatory and then very soon after offering Usyk a fight. Knowing that the Ukrainian probably has to take the fight he can force him to a very short recovery and camp time.
why does everyone always say that about the pacquiao fight when floyd was older than him
How are people so confused on how Fury operates? He loves money and doesn’t like high risk, there’s a reason he went for Wilder instead of AJ. His whole pretending to retire was to see if AJ would beat Usyk in the rematch. Now he shat the bed by rejecting the Saudi offer for a smaller percentage for a higher percentage at Wembley. Problem is, the Saudi offer was more lucrative despite the smaller purse percentage. He’s going to wait as long as he can to maximize his chances of winning and gather whatever profit is left besides the Saudi deal.
The only thing I'm interested in is Tyson Fury being stripped of the WBC strap so someone who's willing to fight Usyk can take it.
They're both holding out for more money.  You dodge certain fighters to get significant mega life-changing events like this. like this. Apparently the Saudis are only interested in opening their pockets for a winter date, Usyk will probably fight Dubois next maybe Fury will take a tune-up against Ruiz, then I expect it will happen in either November or December.
Uysk probably only fights until the end of next year.   So it's a dumb gamble because Usyk won't slip that much in a year.   Fury, on the other hand, has been looking slower each fight since Wilder II. Treating his body like an outhouse is catching up with him.  Fury will fine the passing of time crueller than Usyk over the next 18 months.
Fury is the new Floyd Jr. in terms of attitude outside the ring.
I'll make 1 statement that is going to be popular and one that won't be.   1. Fury conducted himself in a way that set himself up as the bad guy when this fight fell through.  2. I think the real reason for the fight falling through is because they couldn't get the Saudi venue before Usyk goes into his fast and Fury's camp didn't actually want to a smaller deal at Wembley
Both simple and fitting. That's usually the winner
Usyk also did way less coke and booze I would assume which should help with longlivety as well.
Fury will end up shattering an ankle and breaking his noggin off a banister, he's too tall and heavy.
Who has the best resume if not Usyk?
On the contrary, I think Fury is seriously worried if not scared of Usyk. That Cunningham knock down probably still haunts his dreams. Fury knows that Usyk is the real deal and there is a good probability that he loses. He's trying to age Usyk out.
>I don’t think he’s scared of anyone but the dude doesn’t even know what he wants.  Money.
He’s scared of Steve Cunningham part 2
Not to mention the fights with Cunningham, Nevin Pikic and even John McDermott, the drug abuse and constantly ballooning and cutting weight. I think Fury is a lot more vulnerable right now than people realise and a fighter could give him real trouble if he is taken out of his comfort zone.
No, I'm saying that I believe Mayweather delayed it for more money, an easier win and easier legacy add. Dude was told by the whole world he was a pussy for ducking Pac all those years but ended up making $180m instead of whatever it would have been originally.  Not gonna derail the topic but everyone wanted the fight to happen 5 years prior for a reason
>Fury is a smart guy, he will take advantage of the phenomena that is bullshit baffles brains. You'll be amazed.  Bizarrely enough my parents have lived for nearly ten years next to a family of "domiciled" gypsies. Bizarrely enough they're good neighbours. Never given us an issue ever. But they're very resourceful. Not stupid by any stretch of the imagination. I think Fury knows exactly what he's doing.
Yep he’s always been jealous of AJ even now when he doesn’t have a belt to speak of the guy still lives in his head rent free lol. The £40 or 45m he got offered is still a ridiculous sum.
This is the correct take. They wanted Saudi, couldn't make it come together in time, the UK was going to be much smaller for what would essentially be the biggest fights of Usyk and Fury's career (besides Fury vs Wlad).   The biggest British fight you could make is Fury vs AJ and the Saudi money lured that away before the Wilder arbitration.   Aging out is also dumb as you said because the reality is Usyk's next mandatory is Dubois and Fury's probably got one freebie before WBC demands Ruiz or Wilder.
I mean he fought in october and since then a lot of interesting opportunities like Usyk, Ngannou, and even Ruiz have been up in the air. I think he's biding his time for one of those options to crystalize.
I have kind of thought he might try hiding behind Wilder.  Either hope Wilder knocks people out so you get Wilder again, or he at least adds some miles to the brain.
Because age isn't all that matters here, Floyd at 38 had taken a lot less punishment and was much "fresher" in general than a 36 year old Pac.  By the time the rumours started, Pac was starting to show signs of slowing down, while Floyd was still looking as good as ever.  I'm not saying Floyd intentionally waited for Pac to get older, but that's the reasoning behind it, even though Floyd was older.
Because this is what this guys do for a living, searching for excuses and not giving credit to the TBE and plenty of boxers . It seems like all this people forgot that the fight was on but Pacman didn't want to take the anti-doping tests , they just love to manipulate the narrative
Occam's Razor.
I've never understood how fury had the gas tank he did considering all the drug abuse
Canelo
As a heavyweight? He has Chisora and AJ, no knockouts. AJs best win is an older, beltless Wlad. Usyks best win is AJ. Fury has a better Wlad, 3x Wilder, Whyte and 3x Chisora. Each of his Chisora wins looked more convincing than Usyks win vs Chisora. I know you're probably including his Curiserweight record, but unlike lower weightclasses, where you can reasonably use results from other weightclasses in the neighborhood, that doesn't really factor into the heavyweight resume discussion imo. But oh well. If he finally starts fighting more than once a year, he'll soon have the best heavyweight record I'll give you that. But right now? It's very thin
It's not the knockdown. It's the fact that Usyk presents a unique puzzle he might not be able to solve. He could end up just getting outboxed completely.  It's been so obvious that he doesn't want this fight  He spent years calling Usyk a nobody foreigner and the fight is worthless   Now that it's the next obvious fight he ensured that it would be impossible to come to a deal
i dont think so, getting knocked down isnt something fury hasnt experienecd numerous times, and he got up and KO'd cunningham. that fight shows he can adjust if anything
Cunningham's knockdown still scares him? Nah, dude. Fury got up from 4 knockdowns from Wilder! What is Usyk going to do that's worse than that 12th rnd bomb in Fury-Wilder 1?   Perhaps outpoint him and take away his "0."  That's the only thing he's afraid of IMO and even then, I'm picking Fury.
A lot of people watched that fight and took hope that they could beat Fury "If little Cunningham overhand right dropped Fury then he has no chance against me" Must have thought Team Klitschko and Team Wilder, but the reality is you can't watch such an old fight and make your gameplan based on that, Fury still had hair ffs.
Brother, he fought Wilder 3x. Scared of Usyk? 😂
Lol , whenever I see this topic I lol , just because it happened time ago doesn't mean that people forgot what happened, the fight was on , Pacman was the one not agreeing to make the anti-doping tests, stop manipulating the narrative pls is ridiculous
Yeah.   My point is you don't know what he's doing. All sorts gets said, taken back until you've agreed to something you don't even realise or that you didn't want then you need to get out of it.   Like how there were disputes about the rematch clause, the initial fight didn't have what the second fight would've had which led to fury coming out very quickly saying no rematch.   People want to act like you need a team of lawyers to go through a boxing contract that's 400 pages long. . . Also like it's jumbled in a different language and encoded.   Bullshit baffles brains.
But the way things are shaping up the soonest he's going to fight is likely July/August  That's a pretty long layoff following a first round KO after another long layoff
You make fair points but I honestly never gave Manny much of chance to ever beat Floyd at any point in their careers but especially not when they were younger.
Possibly more, different drugs.
That’s why I suspected.   Can’t say I agree with you, though.
Protected fighter.
If you say so.  And no. OP said “second best resume in boxing”.
hes been outboxed before and he adjusted and turned it into a dogfight. so i dont think theres some unique puzzle here. he has as much high level experience as usyk. A level fighters dont get surprised my much, and thats for both of them
Usyk is miles ahead of Wilder in everything but power.  Fury is not scared of Usyk but he is scared of losing. The thought of Usyk beating him after he has talked all that shit has definitely crossed his mind.
Floyd so scared of losing to Pac he requested FIRST about random blood testing. And Floyd was only a boxer, not the commission. I always believe the one who makes up excuses or demands FIRST is the one whose scared or derailing the fight.  And a bit of context; 2009 Pac was the top dog in boxing. Floyd just came out of retirement. Pac should have been the one making demands, not Floyd. But of course Floyd wants to, because he was the last great black hope of the Americans in boxing at that time. lol
Pretty Boy Floyd, who was more of a fighter than the defensive wizard Money May, will get annihilated by Pacquiao.  A lot of people doesnt seem to realize this little fact; Floyd having brittle hands as he gets older was the best thing to ever happen to him, boxing-wise. He changed his approach, and became 90% on the defense. If he continued his Pretty Boy style, who opens up more, he'd be hit sooner or later.  Style makes fight. Pac loves fighters who aint scared to trade. That was Pretty Boy, before he changed to Money May.
At times yes
Lol Usyk is a great fighter. But this unbelievable 4d chess master in the ring he is not. Even Joshua (who I don't think is all that skilled) was finding decent success in the second fighter before the 9th or so round. He's not unhittable.
Counter point - Breidis backed up Usyk and he struggled but overcome that issue.  Usyk looked weak being backed up by a stronger guy…thoughts?
But light years behind in power which makes up for it
Keep fooling youself, you are good at it
Mayweather was just a better fighter imo.
Usyk would be by far, and I meen far, the best fighter Fury has ever faced in his life.  Fury has height, weight and reach on Usyk but nothing else.  Usyk is a far better boxer than Fury and there is no argument to the contrary
I agree. He is a great boxer, but far from untouchable. People forget the Briedis fight where it was tooth and nail. Even in the Belles fight, he was getting hit quite a bit.
I think breidis gave usyk his toughest fight and he stylistically matched up really well with usyk. If they fought 10 times all 10 of those fights would be difficult. Are you saying usyk struggled to adjust?
he was the better boxer, Pac was the better fighter imo.
Fury is a better counter puncher and inside fighter than Usyk.
I am not disagreeing, just curious…what would you say are Usyk’s greatest strengths over Fury and key paths to victory?
I think you are underestimating Fury’s ring generalship
I’m saying he struggled when being backed up and pressured.  Survived and won clearly but struggled.  Fury doesn’t always choose to do it but is very good at swarming space, leaning on opponents and forcing their back to the fence.  If I was him that’s what I would do here and I think it would cause Usyk problems
I watched Mayweather Jr.'s entire career live as it happened and I never picked anyone to beat him in a professional prize fight including Pacquiao and when they fought Mayweather won conclusively imo.
    What fights exactly and against who has he proved that against?
We saw him struggle against a Cruiser and get cut by a southpaw, we never seen him facing a guy as fast and with better footwork and boxing IQ than he has ,people bring the size topic but no one point out that it's harder to hit a smaller opponent and they can catch you off balance if you miss ,Usyk being a southpaw, his angles,footwork, faints, speed, and overall boxing IQ would be very new for Fury who ussually pick opponents that are slow and static and only rely on power ,his style does great against those type of fighters , Usyk is the opposite
Footwork, speed, stamina and ring iq. The smaller, faster southpaw will close the distance and land on Fury.  Fury looks dominant against big slow plodders like Whyte and Chisora. Not so much smaller, good boxers.  Take Otto Wallin for example.  He got in and landed on Fury with good effectiveness. Fury turned it up after the cut and tried to stop an exhausted Wallin and couldn't. Usyk's stamina is much better than Wallins.  Otto is a good boxer but he is no Usyk.
I think people are really overrating it.  Just take Wilder III.  Fact is Wilder and Fury both looked like shit in that fight.  It was a sloppy mess.  People don't mention that because the fight was a banger. People forget Otto Wallin gave Fury a get fight.     I believe wholeheartedly that Usyk would stand a great chance at beating Fury.
I agree too. That's why it baffles me why he made those so many demands during the first negotiations vs Pac. He was already Money May at that time, and his style was the perfect style against a brawler like Pac. He could have easily handle Pac like what happen in 2015.  My guess is fear caught up to him. Not fearing to face Pac, but fear of losing. Lets be real, Money Mayweather always fought fights that are in favor of him/his demands. Gloves, ring size, venue, referees, etc.  I think in 2009, Floyd thought he couldnt beat Pac.  My opinion, of course.
Plenty. You can go as far back as the Cunningham fight to see Fury's inside game. Also just his latest fights like Wilder, Whyte, Chisora. Throwing short shots to head and body, generating power, using bodyweight, defense.  Usyk on the other hand has no inside game. This was showcased in the Chisora fight where Usyk couldn't do anything up close. Also watch the Briedis fight.   Fury can also switch hit unlike Usyk.
Appreciate the response…sensible viewpoints
Appreciated!!
I was one of the only people not really interested in a Mayweather vs Pacquiao fight at any point in their careers as I didn't view him as a threat to Floyd but fighters like De La Hoya and Alvarez I was very excited to watch those fights.   Pacquiao has impressed me more as he got older and bigger and did things I never thought were possible for him.  He has my utmost respect as a prize fighter.
Pac was his most dangerous opponent at the time. That's just the reality of it. Even if he was "better" Pac was the biggest threat to his record.   I also don't think it's surprising that the fight happened after Manny started having all of his fights go the distance consistently and he took two losses, one being a pretty brutal KO.   By the time they actually fought, everyone knew Pac had taken a step back from when they were initially negotiating
Fury knows the strenghts of his style, he does very well against the type of opponents that he faced till now, he enjoys fighting slow static boxers that rely on power. Usyk is the opposite.  Also I hate how people only see the benefits of being the big guy but they dont point out the disadvantages,it's way harder to punch a smaller target that never stops moving ,he can catch you off balance when you miss . Usyk is the opposite of what Fury is used to face in terms of opps , so definitely it would be a long night for Fury
That's probably because Pac was a small guy. And him fighting a boxer much bigger, and a defensive master as well, hed pose no threat. Pac didnt even break Clottey's defense.  Floyd and Pac are like ying and yang. They will forever be associated with each other.
Personally, I'd like to see AJ and Wilder go at it. Someone in that fight is getting KO'd and it's guaranteed entertainment for us fans.
Fight Whyte, KO him, then lose in a mega fight to fury
AJ has 2 fights in him from what I saw.   He has 2 options.  1. Fight Wilder in USA. Then make another big fight or retire.  2. Fight a low risk. This time KO them, then make a big fight and retire.  &#x200B;  After his last performance AJ has to really question does he want to fight anymore. He clearly can't beat Usyk, seems to be really gun-shy and has lost that killer instinct. If I were him, I'd try make the biggest fight I can, then call it a day. Go all out for the KO and if that means I'd lose then so be it.
Seems like AJ just wants the big fights now (Fury, Wilder, Joyce). Get those out the way and then retire. Whereas Eddie Hearn seems to want to milk him a bit longer (understandably) by giving him more warm up fights. Can just tell from the interviews, Eddie is really pushing for a Whyte fight ("that's the fight to make" bla bla bla) whereas AJ seems more interested in fighting Fury.   If it goes the way AJ seems to want it then I think he should fight Fury next, and if he loses that then I think it sets him up nicely to fight Wilder (considering they both would've been beaten by him), and then finish on Joyce (I think he'd probably beat Joyce on points, finishes his career on a decent win). Or maybe Joyce, then Fury, then Wilder. Something like that.   If he ends up doing another warm up fight I reckon Ruiz trilogy isnt a bad shout, but it would also probably end up the same way as Ruiz 2 and the Franklin fight (easy points decision, kind of underwhelming). But if he could manage to KO Ruiz it would probably shake that stigma he gets from Ruiz 1. Don't see him doing that though. So probably someone like Otto Wallin. If he KOs him (probably would) him and his team could then say that he did what Fury couldn't, market the Fury fight that way. I just think beating Whyte does nothing for him honestly.   Idk, the next steps for AJ are kind of tough. I think he should just say fuck it, fight the other top 3 guys he hasn't fought yet. Win or lose at least he fought the best of his era in the end. And I feel like that's his mindset at this point anyway. But Hearn obviously wants to make way more money off the guy lol
Fury in Saudi Arabia for between 50-100 million and the belts on the line because why not and what else is there?   Might as well dare to be great and make an ungodly amount of money in the process. Wilder is NOT an option IMO, Too high risk low reward. Same goes for Ruiz and the others OP listed. And no way do I fight Joyce.   And as funny as it sounds I think AJ has a shot to beat this aggressive version of Fury.  No reason he couldn’t catch him walking into a huge uppercut
Only against someone where Hearn can dominate negotiations.
Nathan Gormon 🤷‍♂️
If I was his manager; Hrgovic, followed by Wallin, with a cash-out fight against Fury.   If he has rocky moments or loses in the Wallin & Hrgovic fights I'd tell him I think he should finish.   If he can't get Fury I'd maybe suggest Joyce if he has a belt and/or the money is right.
Francis Ngannou
I can’t see Ruiz as he struggles with that shorter man style.  Only ones I see are Wallin or Whyte. Whyte with those big looping punches is actually dangerous for AJ as he needs to sit down on his punches with conviction down the pipe and throw out combinations.  All of those things we saw little of vs. Franklin so  he needs to switch up a bit for Whyte.
Fury.   I am pretty sure Fury will be more willing to arrange a fight vs a boxer he perceives as less of a threat. Fury doesn't want to fight Usyk full stop the money is just an excuse. AJ looked quite pedestrian for one reason or another vs Franklin so Fury should fancy his chances and be more open to the idea.   For AJ this is one golden redemption ticket. A loss wouldn't even damage his rep but a win would absolutely redeem the Usyk losses and put him above both Fury and Wilder in one single fight.   Potentially people would write off Usyk losses as bad style matchup and you could actually see AJ go back to the top heavyweight spot if Usyk has a loss.
He should fight Wilder. He either gets decapitated  or finds his killer instinct and takes it to Wilder to win. Wilder kills him.  Fury basically toys with him to the point where it is cruel/demeaning. AJ will spit it out his gumshield in the mid rounds, possibly quit on his stool.   Joyce - Walks AJ down and bludgeons him like he did to parker.
Fury. But Fury is a massive fraud and won’t go near AJ. Conveniently he has gone awol as the world now sees through his bullshit. Funny enough, Frank Warren says he can easily make the Joyce AJ fight but doesn’t say a word about Fury AJ. Fury remembers the pasting a young Joshua put in him In the gym and doesn’t fancy it. So I’d like to see Joshua Wilder. But again, Wilder ducks like Fury does. We will likely get AJ Joyce, and Wilder Ruiz. Fury will retire or fight that MMA guy.  Usyk Dubois, and DDD starches him.
If we're talking about the best path to follow, it would likely be Wilder or Fury and then unify against Usyk if he wins.  If we're talking about the most likely path, it's probably Whyte or Wallin. After that it depends on what Usyk does, AJ will surely try to have another run at the belts, whether against Usyk or whoever holds them by that time.
Joe Joyce.
I’d like Joyce or Wilder but I think Whyte is the smartest choice for AJ and I’d bet this does happens next.   It’s clear AJ needs more time with Derrick James and you don’t want to be going up against Joyce or Wilder when you’re still stuck in between styles.
Whyte’s still a pretty big fight that he *should* win
Wallin. There is no point in fighting Hughie, but if AJ were to KO Wallin and stop him badly. Then AJ would be considered one of the top dogs still.    Wilder and Fury are the only fights that matter and we all want to see. Id throw Joyce or Dubois in there since they are overrated.
Whoa now the WBC African Heritage title is a prestigious belt bro.   Previously held by Gerrie Coetzee, Corrie Sanders and Francois Botha.
He should go for a quick run of top 5-15 level fighters. Wallin, Hrgovic, Whyte. Get some knockouts and confidence. Then Wilder or Fury, which ever pays more.
I think he needs to fight some lesser opposition and get his confidence back before he goes anywhere near the top 10
Ngannou, then Wilder, then retire
A few tune ups. He’s in the shitter for confidence right now.
I’d like to see him reset and challenge Fury. He has the tools to win but his mental soundness concerns a bit.
Hrgovic. Easy fight to make and assuming Wilder has already passed his shot in the mandatory rotation they could make it for the IBF interim belt. On that note, if Wilder can he should also take Hrgovic if he really wants to become the next mandatory like he is rumored to be attempting with the WBA.
I personally believe AJ should fight Joyce then Wilder or Fury. He has already boxed the head of Ruiz so nobody wants to see that rematch again. Whyte probably can’t touch the new AJ the style is just not right for Whyte aka look at what Fury did to him. Dubios is fighting Usyk so can’t go there either.  No one wants to see him fight Hughie Fury.  Zhang beat Hrgovic imo and AJ needs to up his level not down his level for his next fight. Only fight that makes sense to me is the Joyce fight. Secure his number 3 ranking imo 1) Usyk 2)Fury 3)AJ/Joyce 5) Wilder.
Throw him to the wolves against Wilder. Quickest way to break him out of his mindset by forcing him to focus on getting back his aggression.
Honestly I think if he can get Joe Joyce that would be a great fight for him. Joe's got great momentum with him at the minute, lots of guys don't want to fight him, and he's game enough to take an AJ fight if it's offered.   Joyce is a good opponent for AJ in that, while he has a fantastic output and jab, he's not a missively technical boxer - he relies on his chin a lot and tends to get hit hard. I would expect AJ to stop him, he's a very different style of fighter than Franklin and I would expect the fight to go very differently.  A win against Joyce while he's still undefeated would be massive for AJ's current reputation.
I'm not interested in any soft touches. Joyce, Fury, Wilder, those are the only names he should be speaking if he wants a place at the table. If you're still about it, then be about it, and get back in the mix. Otherwise just call it a day and enjoy not having to fight to live.
Wilder.
If I'm his manager and my priority is protecting his value, then it's as follows:   1. Whyte. Winnable fight that AJ should cruise through, but still enough of a name to build him up a bit.  2. Hrgovic. Up and comer that AJ "should" still be able to outclass.   &#x200B;  Then I start looking at maybe Joyce or Ruiz as challengers that will give AJ a fight but he should be a comfortable favorite. After that, I start looking at Wilder or Fury in a big payday fight where if he loses you at least got 4 fights for him to make decent money before he tumbles out of the contenders sphere.   He should stay away from Usyk, he can't beat him and I don't think a third fight has value.
I want to see AJ vs Wilder, I have been wanting to see that for awhile. AJ can win it but I do think Wilder is going to land on AJ quite a bit and could easily hurt him.
Whyte then hrgovic. Big fight after that.
Eddie Hearn should make a fight between AJ and Alan Babic. Babic was complaining that DAZN was mismananaging him. What bigger fight could they give him than AJ?  It would be great for AJ because Babic is tiny for the division by today's standards, so Anthony could go in and get a big KO and, in turn, get his confidence back.
Eddie won’t put AJ in front of anyone risky for at least 2 more fights.   Wallin & Whyte rematch next
A few years ago I would have said that AJ would have took him apart, but if he tries to box him at all he's setting himself up to be knocked out massively.  You need to step to Wilder and put the hurt on him early. Massive digs to the body. The other thing Wilder does that would really set AJ up is step away from breaks. I saw it loads in the Franklin fight, he needed to move further away after the ref separated them, AJ wanted to get back in too quickly and he'd just walk into something. If AJ would have taken a step or two back he wouldn't have smothered his work anywhere near as much and would have set up his bigger punches better.
After the Franklin  performance, Wilder by KO inside 6
~~fury~~ Wilder
You make it sound like he can easily KO Whyte. I think he beats him, but it’s a closer fight than people think
I agree that since Ruiz 1 he's been a bit safety first. What I think we saw at weekend was that Franklin hurt him in the 1st (after the 1st is when we started seeing blood coming from the nose) and then he went into his shell a bit.  I've mentioned it before but other Derrick James fighters (Spence and the Charlos at least) have great fundamentals. I think that's the Derrick James way, to make sure the basics are there. AJ already had good fundamentals so the Franklin fight was about seeing where they were at and if the communication in fight was good as much as getting back on the horse.  In terms of communication, it wasn't good. AJ looked glassy eyed in the corner and then just did whatever he wanted in the ring. Derrick called the right shot early on (hook to the body) and it took AJ a few rounds to deploy it, when he did it seemed to hurt Franklin (and fell into AJ), then AJ after hurting him to the body went back to head hunting. It was weird, sort of like AJ has lost his finishing instinct but also doesn't trust his corner.  Maybe part of the plan was to get rounds in and **not** to look too good to try and get Tyson Fury to take a punt on the AJ fight. I don't think so though, AJ didn't look or sound  in his best mind after the fight.
Or fight Whyte, then Zhang, then Hrgovic, then a proper big name money spinner.  Gives him plenty of time to work on things and also keeps the gravy train rolling.  If he goes immediately for Wilder and gets KOd then long term that's just a horrible business decision even if it is what boxing fans want.
After the Franklin fight, Wilder isn’t an option.  It would do him no favors to get in with Wilder next.
Dude's rebuilding with a new coach. Yes he had a shit fight, but he's only 33 and still one of the best heavyweight boxers in the world. Let's maybe calm down on the whole 1 fight then retire thing.
I agree. I also think Wilder only has 1-2 fights left. He's taken so much punishment  over the years and has had 4 arm surgeries.    Pay day fight for both of them. Possibly for the WBA regular title which might sell it to casuals too (DDD has to give it up regardless of Usyk result).
He knocked Joyce out in the amateurs in the first round AND also got a TKO in round 2 against Joyce. Joyce had a chin yes but not vs AJs power.
Problem is that Fury has yanked him around in bad-faith negotiations repeatedly. There’s no reason to believe the fight would actually materialize
Thing is though, taking the AJ fight for a small % is probably more money for most fighters than getting 50% against someone you're ranked similar to. Furthermore the potential reward is huge in that you either get a rematch on better terms or you can pretty much nail on a world title shot within a year.
If he fights Hrgovic though that makes him IBF mandatory, so that's the avenue he takes if he wants to go again with Usyk.
He gets KOed in a round. Joshua doesn’t have balls or self belief to fight a real specimen like Franny. Tittie Franklin scared him enough
I think Whyte's 100% most likely. The question is whether Whyte wants his Chisora money before or after his AJ money?  From Whyte's POV fighting Chisora first makes sense, more winnable fight and improves the reception of him fighting AJ again. There's risk there though, and seeing as how he avoided fighting Wallin to make sure the Fury fight happens, we know he's not adverse to risk avoidance.
AJ cant beat Fury. 0% chance. Literally 0.
Based on what? Wilder has only koed brezeale and helenius inside 6 in the past 6 years.   Not saying it couldn’t happen, can’t write wilder off but let’s not act like every punch he lands knocks people out because a few shit fighters couldn’t make it out of round 1 with him
Yeah, good shout!
He already KO’d him. Why does this sub always think that they never fought before? Smh.
Nah. He knocks him out easily. Not as easily if he comes in in last form, but still. Whyte drew a much worse version of Franklin
Yeah, I don't see why he doesn't go that way. He seems to have these fights in him for sure and wins them all comfortably. And it should still draw enough attention, add a good undercard and all are sound events.  If there is no improvement he can still fight Fury or Wilder for a payday. If he finds his strengths and works out his problems he can still be a world Champ.
If Joshua fights like he did against Franklin,  Wilder KOs him inside 6 rounds.  He really needs to take the massive payday with Fury and retire
33 is not a great age to rebuild and adjust your style in the heavyweight division.   Ali did it, but he was also a couple years younger than AJ, which bought him more time once he finally got back to form. Joshua is likely going to be around 35 before he can get a real title fight again imo.   They do need to start looking at the idea that he lost 3 of his last 6 and hasn't really shown any ability to dominate at the level he should since he first lost to Ruiz.   Maybe it's a tad early to totally write the guy off, but they do need to start thinking about what brings him the most value and money because he really can't sustain another loss imo.
Did he listen to his new coach? No.  Did he look like the same AJ? Yes.  Should he have KO'd Franklin? Yes.   Did AJ look gun shy? Yes.   Would he beat Usyk or Fury? No.  Would he beat wilder? Questionable.   So if he isn't going to beat any of the big dogs of the division any time soon then what's the point of fighting? He's got enough money. He's not going to win any of the belts at this point. So just getting punched in the head for no reason seems pointless to me. He can do that and at 50% if he just continued to train.
The problem is Hearn dominates the rematch negotiations too. I'm shocked that Usyk even got 50%. Which is still unfair. Ruiz got about 15%.
Ah right, I didn't consider the sanctioning bodies because they suck so much and I figure AJ generates enough money he could possibly just fight whomever he wants.
Is there any public appetite for Whyte vs. Chisora 3?  Whyte’s beaten him twice and after both of their last performances I’m not seeing a lot of people calling for this one.  I’d say Whyte wants AJ and the money with that one over risking anything going wrong against Chisora.
I don’t know if Wilder KOs Joshua in six. But I do think that Franklin landing his right as often as he did against Joshua, and Joshua fighting a bit more… let’s say reserved after getting touched early in the fight, doesn’t inspire a great deal of confidence for him going into a fight with Wilder. Of course, he can KO Wilder. He *clearly* has the skills and the physical attributes. But he looked vulnerable in a way that wasn’t really about either of those things in that fight. I’m just unsure, at this point.
Well, Joshua was shying away from Franklin's shots on Saturday, who's not exactly famed for his power, 14 kos in 21 wins.  He was also uncomfortable with Usyks power in his last two fights, Usyks last ko was Bellew at cruiser weight  What do you think he's gonna make of Wilders power?
Imagine he beat wilder though and set up a fury fight!
That was a long time ago, different AJ now
You say this like Wilder could of taken any of the beaten that Franklin took.
He didn't look the same AJ at all - he looked a lot worse. I'll give the benefit of the doubt that that was due to a rebuilding process - we'll see over the next few fights whether that's true or not.  How do you know he didn't listen to his new coach? They've been training together for several months, and I assume advice was given during that training that was taken forward into the fight.  Every top fighter in the division is very different - I don't know why a poor performance vs Franklin means he probably wouldn't beat the others. The only thing we can say for sure is that he doesn't beat Usyk.  Should he have KO'd Franklin? Absolutely. Again, we'll see over the next few fights whether that's due to rebuilding or due to a massive slip in form, but to cry for retirement after that seems a big stretch. Plenty of time to challenge for belts and he could absolutely still beat current top fighters with a return to form.
I think Ruiz got like $5million in the first fight and a lot more for the rematch. If Miller hadn't gone mad in a pharmacy do we think Andy would have ever reached the point where he had $15million or so in his bank account? Negotiations are relative.
not to doubt but do you know where you read it was 50/50 rematch?
Maybe, maybe not. A dangerous looking AJ probably gets avoided by Fury and Usyk. They don't need the paycheque as much as someone like Charles Martin did.
I think it has value in the UK especially if it's on Sky not DAZN (more of a casual audience). Chisora IMO put up a better fight against Fury than Whyte did and the Pulev win was better than Whyte's Franklin win.   I'd watch it is basically my answer.
 Yeah usyk was never gonna ko Joshua with 1 punch like Wilder might, but maybe he was weary because of how Ruiz stopped him with fast hands.   Joshua doesn’t like getting hit and he certainly isn’t gonna like being hit by Wilder. Wilder is tough and has a lot of heart, he won’t be afraid to bring it to Joshua. If Joshua tries to win on points he’s getting knocked out after winning every round he stays standing in.   I have no doubt in my mind Joshua can stop Wilder if he goes on a fury 2 style rampage though
14 kos out of 21 is respectable though
Whyte has been on the decline ever since, don’t see the outcome being any more different than the first time around.
Did Franklin take a beating? Must of missed that.  And Wilder can take shots to be fair to him, look at his fights with Ortiz and the 3rd Fury fight.
But still, the guy who wins should have semi favorable terms. But that's Hearn's strategy. That's why Whyte refused to sign an AJ fight for years because Eddie was screwing him on rematch financial terms.
I read something recently, when fury/usyk rematch clause was being discussed
AJ-Usyk 2 was a 50-50 split with both fighters guaranteed 75 million pounds
I'm not a Wilder fan and believed for the last few years that Joshua would beat Wilder if they fought.  This new (shy?) Joshua though, he looks so timid I think Wilder will smash him about.  Joshua was always relatively easy to hit, however he used to fire back with combos, and most opponents would back off. Now Joshua's not willing to engage as much, opponents are becoming less worried about getting hit themselves
Wilder is not tough lol, he’s been dropped a few times and hurt badly against pillow fist Fury and 50 year old whatever his name is haha.
Wilder has 42 kos in 43 wins
Yeah, I love Whyte and wish him nothing but the best but I can't see it going any different for Whyte if they fight again.
I mean yes he did Franklin just about won 1 round. Wasn’t even close, he was close to having his first knock out loss in his career had to clinch to save his life for 5 rounds. If that ain’t a beating I don’t know what is.   Wilder must be tough to take punches from a 50 year /a
Wilder got hurt bad in the first but Ortiz was too gassed to get around Wilders spaghetti arms. Then in the 2nd nothing really happened up to the KO.
I don't see a problem with it, if you want to negotiate the rematch before you show your hand that's your problem. It was Whyte's prerogative to reject the fight because of the rematch and it was Andy's to accept it in spite of it.
I don't think Fury is pillow fisted at all, I think he has quite a lot of power but he just didn't used to fight for the knockout. Even now when he got guys hurt he still takes it quite slow and starts leaning on them. This last Chisora fight he could have easily finished it but he didn't. He knocked out Whyte with that uppercut, he hurt Wilder badly many times. Even Fury's jabs land hard.  Fury also doesn't throw a lot of big shots to the head like an overhand for example or hooks. He throws way more jabs and straight punches.  So I get it if Fury throws a big punch, lands it and guys seem to just walk through it to call him pillow fisted but I don't agree with his style that he's supposed to just knock guys out with 1 punch it's not how he fights.  But whenever Fury does land a big shot it clearly hurts these guys.
So according to you, Fury is pillow fisted, Chisora is tough, but Fury stopped Chisora twice?
So who is tough according to you?
42 Ko 43 wins and the best name on his record is a draw again Fury. You put AJ/Fury against the bums Wider has knocked out and they would be at 42 KOs also
Look, Joshua couldnt T off on a very limited Franklin, who really didn't throw a lot at Joshua.   What's gonna happen when he gets in with Wilder? Wilder is a very limited boxer, but one thing he can do is bang, which is evident in most of his wins.
Hearn demands it, nobody wants to negotiate a rematch as the B side.
Think it’s more to do with the fact he’s 19ft tell weighing 827lbs and it downs seem like that when he throws punches because they are quick and light. Ofc his punches hurt
Chisora is very tough, but it’s heavyweight boxing anything can happen.
Fury, AJ, Chisora, Joyce, Parker, Franklin and Ruiz have great chins.
The bums on Wilders record are better than the bums on Franklin's record though
Franklin is a counter puncher, ofc you have to be careful what you throw at a counter punches. Wilder is a one trick pony, no defence and no combos. Yes AJ had to be careful but he doesn’t have to worry about not seeing the punch coming wilder is extremely telegraphed, he even touches his glove with his other hand before throwing lol.
Fury has great recovery but his chin isn’t as good as the other guys you’ve mentioned. He reminds me a little of Calzaghe - gets dropped a lot but hops up a few seconds later having recovered. Weirdly Hughie Fury seems to have a bit of a granite chin though!
Who is better than Franklin on Wilders resume apart from the 50 year old? Franklin was undefeated before moving into European competitors.
So you're saying Joshua needs to worry more about being KO'd by Franklin than Wilder???  OK, I'm done here mate
>he doesn’t have to worry about not seeing the punch coming wilder is extremely telegraphed  I mean Fury got hit with that punch that's apparently easy to see coming at least 4+ times. And he's probably harder to land on than AJ is. With a much better recovery on him as well.  Helenius didn't even last 3 minutes without getting hit by it as well while Deontay was on the backfoot
No not at all, I mean AJ wasn’t able to unleash a flurry against Franklin like he could against Wilder.
So I've finally seen Creed III and I have to say is you got 154lb Jose Benavidez portraying a Heavyweight champion..
Why is there a Top Rank, Matchroom and PBC card at all the same time and all of them seem pretty good.
Spence and Bud are equally respected but idk why it seems Spence is much more popular
Ready to watch Joyce get another KO.  I’m sold on the big fella and think he’d be a tough matchup for Usyk, and would beat Wilder, Ruiz, and AJ.  AJ has lost it, don’t know if it’s the yipps, hearts not in it anymore, or mental confidence after the losses but he’s not the same.  Wilder is a one trick pony with devastating power but overall poor technique and footwork that Fury exposes.  I think Usyk is a nightmare matchup for anyone, he’s a southpaw with an impressive gas tank and is slick. Joyce is a terminator with good technique, an equal gas tank, and a rocker of a jab. He looks slow like his punches shouldn’t hurt but he’s got the clobbering foreman power.  Not enough hype for him yet, but I hope he gets the proper chance before age and Father Time take hold.   In other news, still hoping for Bud-Spence, can’t wait for Tank-Garcia, and am excited to see Lomachenko get back in the ring. A bout with Haney should be very entertaining.
Probox has a card tonight starting at 8pm CST.  It's free on YouTube. https://www.youtube.com/live/CInSKPeMAHk?feature=share
Reminder Devin Haney is an Andrew Tate supporter. Hopefully Loma knocks him out.
Great fight and what an upset. Just a 24 hour notice, mad.
Joshua’s biggest opponent is himself. every morning he gets up and throws a baby jab at the mirror and a slow reaching cuddle clinch to fight off his demons. The way he rests his head trying to clinch is funniest shit I ever seen; thank god he didn’t do MMA, would be absolutely useless
Kinda shocked to see a Dr stoppage in Mexico that quick.  Probably best, though
I’m an American living abroad. I just discovered TalkSport and their guy Simon Jordan. This guy is so fucking real. His recent video on AJ was brutally honest and I love it! He compared Hearn to Col Tom Parker! Such a savage comparison lol.
Claressa shields needs to hurry up and book a fight
Day 3 of asking: Does anyone know what happened to the WBA’s plan to move HQ to Houston? Did it get scrapped? I haven’t heard anything since last year.
Hey, I can’t seem to punch without hurting my wrist. I think it’s because I bend my wrist in order to hit with my knuckles. If I don’t bend my wrist then I would hit with the joints of my hands. Can someone help me
ALEXIS ROCHA is scheduled to fight ANTHONY YOUNG May 27th  LFG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Lol, the ref wants a better fight.
Has Canelo ever been down on the canvas?
TBF Adonis and Dame would be small HW’s irl as well, they are muscular 175 pounders but the movies just understand Heavyweight is the glamour division
Yeahh they really should've kept it in the 175-pound class like they did in the first movie. Heavyweight champion just sounds better for the movies.
They been counterprogramming each other forever
1. A better resume, more active (especially considering car accident)  2. He has more marketable ability. He’s got a chill swagger and just overall better with the media.  3. Bud, while being an incredible boxer, has the personality, at least in front of cameras, of a cardboard box.
Crawford has no rizz.
Spence looks like he wants to take all comers and he puts himself out there.
Because Spence is more handsome. And I ain't shitting you
More belts, better resume at 147, and just marketed better.
Texas is a huge state. We have about 30 million people. Nebraska has about 2 million people.  There are **15x** more people who can say Errol represents their home state. Texas also plays a huge role in mostly black industries (Houston is massive in HipHop, Sports, etc.)  Errol hangs out with a lot of rappers and superstars. He has flashy chains and cars. More people look at him and want what he has than Bud.  Bud is a laid back family guy from Nebraska. Not a lot of people see a shooting star and wish to be him.
LDBC crowd
They both aint really that popular for what they’ve achieved tbh. 🥾 will be more popular in 2 yrs
Just wondering if you ever saw usyk/joyce 1? It was very lopsided.
>Give Award   >   >Share  Thanks for the reminder!
Why are so many boxers such fucking morons lol, same with Roy Jones Jr. becoming a Russian citizen... *sigh*  I appreciate them as athletes, but I'll never put any of them on a pedestal. Perhaps Usyk because dude's literally fighting a war.
who cares man
Loma is a Putin supporter.
Yeah, love Probox bringing Wed night fights.
Oh wow.  That was a bad cut.  Good call.
He used to own Crystal Palace football club.
That applies to everyone ngl
Is there any woman left for her to beat?
Mayweather vs Corrales - I'd put money on it being this
Ya, some people's knuckles are just more obtuse than 90 degrees. Much over 100 degrees and you are just not gonna be a boxer without sustaining injury.
Sort of slipped against GGG in their 2nd fight. Otherwise no.  He’s only really looked momentarily a few times: once early in his career when he was like 17, once late against GGG in the 2nd, and then he sort of looked sort of stunned against Bivol a bit too.
I hope someday someone goes the Ippo route and focuses on the other weights.
Yeaah I always thought Adonis was a little small for HW, especially against drago. Dame looks a little heavier, like a Holyfield/Tyson.. Jose just looked so tiny compared to them all
Agreed, Happy Cake Day
I know, just hate it.
Dresses better, gets more bitches, better looking, knows how to party, possibly immortal.
Yeah. I’m sitting at the hospital with time to kill at the moment so I’ll try to give a good response on my phone. I don’t put too much stock into it. Joe Joyce didn’t take up boxing until he was close to 23 years old. I don’t mean winning amateur titles I mean just putting on the gloves and giving it a go. But within 2 1/2 years of experience Joyce won the Super Heavyweight ABA Championship, and 2012 GB Amateur Boxing Championship. So he learned very quickly and his size and athleticism carried him some, but he was still very much a raw prospect at that point.  He’s 37 now. That fight was a decade ago. He would’ve had roughly 3 1/2-4 years experience when he faced Usyk. Usyk despite aging seems to have the same relentless gas tank, but you can even tell from watching that fight he’s lost a little bit of speed.   Now, notice in my comment I said it’s my opinion he could beat Ruiz, Wilder, and AJ. But I don’t make the same claims for Fury or Usyk. As I said, Usyk is a nightmare matchup for anyone. Southpaw, gas tank, movement, slippery and hard hitting.   However, Joe Joyce has since abandoned the B movie version style of Ali that he had in the amateurs, and has embraced his strengths as well as gaining a decade of experience in the pros. Now, he reminds me of old Foreman. He’s a terminator and the nickname Juggernaut fits him perfectly.   I told everyone that I thought he was going to beat Dubois and my friends thought I was crazy at the time. I think he finally put the world on notice with the Joseph Parker fight. He has fully embraced his size at 6’6 and doesn’t try to be what he’s not. People only notice hand speed sometimes and don’t see everything else that’s going on. His chin is granite, and his jab is brutal. His gas tank is substantial and he walks everyone down much like GGG, instead of his faster amateur days. He’s gone full Old Foreman.  I think Joe Joyce is now at a Heavyweight Champion level, and it just so happens that the best 2 in the division in this era are fast moving, slippery, fast boxers in Usyk and Fury. People thought Joseph Parker was going to win too for similar reasons.   That’s why I put him above AJ, Ruiz, Wilder, Parker, and Dubois. Can he beat Usyk? I’m not sure. Anything’s possible in boxing where one shot can change everything in an instant, but Usyk is a monumentally tough challenge. He’s a true freak of nature, just in a different way than Joyce. He reminds me if Manny Pacquiao were a Heavyweight.   In conclusion, I don’t know who would win now, I’m leaning Usyk despite high praise for Joyce. In any case, if this fight were to get made, win or lose, the real winners would be the fans. I hope we get some variation of Usyk-Fury-Joyce in the future. They’re all starting to get up there in age and I hope Father Time and boxing politics don’t prevent us from witnessing a good matchup.  Edit: spelling and I just realized, while this is blasphemous in boxing language, the more I pondered on this, the more it reminded me of Ali-Foreman. Usyk and Ali are both equal in frame, both being 6’3 with a 78’’ reach, both very slick and mobile. Foreman was slower but bigger and hard hitting, with both Foreman and Joyce weighing in at 260, and having approximately 80” reach. Obviously I’m not saying that either of them are as good as Ali and Foreman, but just the styles, size, and matchup is very reminiscent of Ali and Foreman.
Joyce had only been boxing for a couple of years when that fight happened. It was 10 years ago. Pretty much a novice vs an Olympic champ
There's also fights Thur night on DAZN
Why are some of you so emotional and set on these lies?
Who cares Usyk was pro Russia too before all tie shit. The conflict been going on since 2014 btw and they were supporting it
The cards are always fun to watch. I hope the BLK Prime Tuesday night boxing events are going to be as fun as this.
He rich bruh
John Fury
He didn't say it had to be a woman
Definitely Mayweather vs Corrales
>possibly immortal  lmfao. His first tweet after the car accident still cracks me up
No lies. Loma was openly pro-Putin before Feb 24 2022. He switched after the enormous backlash.
I didn't even know about Blk prime doing anything.  Thx 4 that info.  I paid for a year of Probox, I mean for $18/yr, it's a bargain.  I don't have much faith in Blk Prime since they really don't have many boxers supporting them, but I'll give them a chance if it's not expensive
BTW, DAZN has a card tomorrow night
Yea, the Golden Boy one. Appreciate it and hopefully my internet is back by tomorrow lol!
Two ATGs fighting.
This why leonard was so good in that era. He was a 15 round fighter.
So, if this took place in the 12 round era. Would it have been a draw?
Round 15 and they have more activity than 50% of current round 1s.  Amazing athletes.
High level fight
Benitez is underrated H2H. An absolute monster and went the distance in a great fight at 154 against prime Hearns.
When men were men
OMG, recording commentary over decades old fights. Horrible.  TR put up the whole thing in their Youtube channel with original commentary and in better quality:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejyQTgB9fYI&ab\_channel=TopRankBoxing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejyQTgB9fYI&ab_channel=TopRankBoxing)
Maybe maybe not.  If they knew they will be fighting less than 15 rds, they would have fought in much higher pace
I couldn't find the scorecards. But the Boxrec page for this bout has an Sports Illustrated article that says this:  >Actually, through 14 rounds Leonard was in front by at least two points on all three cards. Harry Gibbs, the English judge, had them the closest, 136-134 on the 10-points-must system.
good question. Leonard vs Hearns 2 had a vastly different outcome because of it. If it went 15 no question Leonard would've knocked Hearns out, it was astonishingly similar.
Ok boomer
Damn. My scorecard was a fair bit wider.
:-)
He looks like the IT guy who fixes our computers at work
This dudes why you don't pick street fights lol I'd be so sure I could whoop this dude if I saw him and didn't know who he was
As much as I wouldn't say it to his face he has huge skinny nerd energy.
Unlike most boxers, I actually believe Fundora when he says he’s going to deliver a good fight!
As credible as trust me bro
Who happens to night light as Slenderman
Lubin looked unrecognizable. It was actually pretty insane how much of beating he gave him in a fight that was pretty even until he took over.
That kids like 6’6”
Hpw tall are you to be trying to fight 6'7 dudes
I'd say it to his face. He's pretty self aware.
Nah I believe him. He’s an entertaining fighter
Yeah he's a bad mf, I love how he'll try to use his range for a minute before being like fuck it and just going back to brawling
Lol that's true but I'm 6'4 so I still feel like I could take a lot of skinny ass 6'7 dudes not named Sebastian fundora
Excellent username.
Oddly, the dude could probably land punches from the opposite corner of the ring if he wanted to. Just decides he wants to fight up close.
ya, Im not a figher or anything but at 6'5 230, at first glance I wouldn't be all that intimated by a 160lb 6'5.5 guy (looks like he is not quite 6'7)?  Regardless I'd be intimated by almost anyone I know who is a boxer / martial artist lol
Yeah I'm about 210 with a few years boxing experience, I think I could take a taller guy w no boxing experience pretty easy   I've also been humbled by little dudes who were way better boxers
For sure! I literally only have a couple basic classes so I'd be pretty much useless regardless beyond being a large moderately fit person.   Regardless, looking forward to the fight!
Sonny Liston is a problem for any fighter in history.
The power ❤️
Anyone who hasn't read "The Devil and Sonny Liston" by Nick Tosches should do themselves a favor. It paints a tragically sympathetic figure of a man who you would not expect to be described as such.
Patterson was facing a complete stylistic and size mismatch in these two fights. Similar to Frazier when he fought Foreman both times (although Frazier was more durable).
Heavyweights looked better before all the advances in technology.
You could see how cautious Patterson's body language was as he tried to clinch, defend, counterpunch, and look for the perfect shot. It almost looked like he didn't want to throw. The moment he throws he gets knocked out. Liston looked like a real boogeyman in there.
This is the rematch I believe.
Man, that moment when Patterson held on to only *one* of Liston’s arms was hard to watch.
His framing work is quiet skillful.
The fear of what might come back to you (if you attack first) is so crippling. Then your mindset changes to; just survive the round. Meanwhile the other guys mind set is to destroy you (not just surviving the round).     That's why "they" say that boxing is way more mental than physical (all striking for that matter, not just boxing).
God, that jab is a problem.
Sonny was a Monster Floyd stood zero chance
Was Cus still training Floyd? He stopped handling his business affairs after an issue with Jimmy jacobs. Cus didn’t want Floyd to fight Liston because of mob ties and Cus had been fighting for years to get the mob out of the business.
Sonny Liston vs Anthony Joshua who wins?
Floyd Patterson before mike Tyson was the youngest heavyweight champion of the world.
Hall-of-fame writer Gay Talese wrote a phenomenal portrait on Floyd Patterson, holed up after this loss, [here](http://www.thestacksreader.com/the-loser/).
“Sparring with Liston is the most dangerous thing that I ever did in my entire life. No matter what I tried against him, it was me who had to revert back to boxing. Nobody made me box like Sonny Liston did and that happened every time we worked together. He taught me many things, including the importance of the jab.”   - George Foreman
TBF, Floyd had no business fighting any elite heavyweight that was over 200 lb
Amazing book.
Yes.  In the original fight, Patterson went down once and stayed down for the count.
By this point Cus was Floyd's manager in name only, with the Jim Jacobs' television deal being the last straw, according to Stratton's biography. D'Amato apparently wasn't involved in Floyd's camp as a trainer for the second Liston fight. After the fight, Cus couldn't even get Floyd to answer the door and talk to him, despite showing up at his house every day and knocking. He then initiated legal action claiming Floyd owed him $250k and was never directly involved with Floyd's training or management again.
Liston has longer reach.
Liston wrecks him. I rate AJ but he lacks a ton of things to go against Sonny.
Sonny Liston, a real gangster and master intimidater. AJ would poo his pants.
Or……  who wins between Floyd Patterson and Jersey Joe Walcott.
I thought you were kidding at first. That fight doesn’t make it past the second round.
Id favor AJ.   I'm not sold Sonny has the chin to hold up against the bigger heavyweight punchers of today. The guys the same size as Chris Byrd and got stopped 3 times (2 if you really want to ignore the Ali rematch) against Cruiserweight sized fighters. He did outgun Cleveland Williams, which is a nice win, but not indicative of how he'd hold up against a generation of bigger dudes who can do nothing if not punch.  And theres nothing wrong with that. It doesn't hurt his greatness for him to be a legend in his own time. Gone is the era of Heavyweight where 6'1, 210 pounders are giants who have a size advantage most of the time out
They both trained by Cus. Crazy
What would I give to see those sparring sessions
That was a 17 year old foreman, referenced by the old foreman who said everyone would beat him. The foreman who walked through Norton and Frazier would have beat the fucking brakes off of liston.  Enjoy your rose tinted glasses. Foreman, ali, holmes, Frazier, tyson, lewis, holyfield,wlad and vitali, fury and usyk all beat liston with little difficulty.   Your great grandfather's favorite fighter doesn't hold up to the reality of sports progression.
That just makes guys like him that much more impressive
Floyd did beat some solid 205+ lb HW in Chuvalo and Bonavena.   Just that Liston was just brute power to anyone that fought him as well as having the IQ to put it to use and had a shitty ass bad back against Ali. Did much better against Ali on the rematch thou the cut ended those matters.
Thanks for bringing clarity to the history. I recall vaguely reading mike’s account in Iron Ambition, that Floyd was a very religious man and went with his church/preacher over Cus, and that was the thing that creates the biggest riff between them, even moreso than deciding to fight liston
Not true.  Beyond his reach being listed at different amounts on different tales if the tapes, its also mentioned on the Cleveland Williams commentary that Cleveland has the longer reach
He doesn't. 84 Inch is not the real size
Here we go again with the mythical reach.
Even though his hands aren't as fast as Andy Ruiz's and his chin is probably a bit worse, he hits harder, is meaner, is better at cutting of the ring etc. I think despite the size disadvantage, Liston would batter him.
Jersey Joe Walcott.
Who doesn't make it out of the second round?
Chris Byrd is an inch smaller and just not as solidly built, Bone structure wise. Liston was just more sturdy. Agree on the rest, but they're not built similarly, especially because Byrd had a cray chin, but was featherfisted which Liston is not
Very fair take for sure, however Andy Ruiz is the same height as Liston and if he got down to 10-15% bodyfat he'd probably weigh the same too. Liston's chin probably isn't as good as Ruiz's but he had a much better jab and equal or more power in the right hand, longer reach and was comfortable in the clinch (although that might not work against somebody AJ's size).
Again with the size.  Butterbean must be the greatest heavyweight of all time.
The fact that you included Tyson and Frazier (whom Liston was a stylistic nightmare for) is a big DKSAB indicator.   Although a few would be favored, I honestly don't think that any of those fighters beat '58-'62 Liston easily.  Edit: you should read some of those "best I fought' ring pieces where liston is discussed along with the 70s fighters.
Cap, Liston woudlve destroyed Foreman. Ali fought an old Liston (pretty sure the guy was in his late 30s to early 40s, the guy also fought a younger and faster Ali). Im pretty sure the Ali Liston fought, woudlve boxed circles around Foreman. The Ali that Foreman fought, I feel like Ali woudlve been torn apart or might have still found the right strat to outlast the big bear.
Very true. I mean that I wouldn't bet on him against guys like Ali, Frazier, Foreman, Norton, Lennox, Klitschko, Holmes etc.
Yeah, there was at least an indirect connection there.  Floyd converted to Catholicism to marry his first wife. From all accounts he was a genuine believer, even after his first marriage ended, and remained devout to the end of his life. Meanwhile, Cus had dropped the Catholicism of his youth and was bitter about it.  According to Tyson and Stratton's books, there were two lawyers that nudged D'Amato out of the way and took control of Floyd's career: Roy Cohn and Julius November. Cohn was close to Archbishop Cardinal Spellman and arranged a dinner party with the cardinal and Patterson, which Tyson claims was key to winning Patterson over to Cohn and November's side.  It doesn't seem like there was a religious figure in Patterson's life who directly told him to break from D'Amato, but religious connections or affiliations seem to have played a role.  For what it's worth, long after the events, Floyd maintained that it was really the Jacobs' TV deal that caused the split, and he said that it was a huge mistake on his part to have shunned D'Amato. (Tyson claims Floyd's perception of that deal was poisoned by Cohn and November.) He reconciled with Cus when D'Amato was on his deathbed.
Source? I guess no one can really identify a reputable source then? As the dude’s dead now…so…
Cleveland Williams, from the sources that I’ve checked, has a reach of 80 inches. That means his reach is just 2 inches shorter than Joshua’s.
So if 84 inches is not the real reach; (meaning it’s 80 in.) then his reach is still just 2 inches shorter than Joshua’s.
I can definitely see it going the other way, also.
AJ
Also Liston was naturally 212-218 lb, Byrd walks around at 155 lb nowadays, he's a much thinner and more slender man.
Chris Byrd was incredibly brave, a MW fighting super heavyweights like the Klitschko brothers and Ike Ibeabuchi
I wouldn't rule out a Liston win by any stretch. Bigger upsets happen all the time. Heck, both Sonny and AJ themselves got beat by bigger 'dogs than I'd make Sonny.  I've seen enough crazy outcomes in real life that any of these fantasy pick "upsets" are mild in comparison lol
I personally do not rate liston very highly and I don't think his resume implys  he would find success against Frazier or tyson because stylistically it could be useful.  Tyson wasn't exactly weak to big punchers, he beat rudduck. Frazier wasn't a slouch either, being steam rolled by foreman doesn't mean that any big hitter could walk through him. Tyson had solid chin, and so did Frazier. They aren't Patterson. Frazier also had about 500 times the heart liston did, and was powerful enough to break Chuvalos face. I don't see liston holding up to that left hook or the work rate Frazier would bring.  Liston didn't exactly have heart either, the other guys on that sure as shit do. Listons most impressive wins were against a guy known for getting knocked down.  He was a big puncher and a skilled fighter, but I don't see him touching any of the atgs.  I'd take a prime mercer to throw against that list over liston.
Omw to bet the house on Patterson to beat a 137 year old Norton.
Amazing. Thank you. Both narratives sound reasonable enough to coexist. Do you know who trained Floyd for the second liston fight? Peek a boo fighters seem to have poor track records once they leave the catskills.  https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5b94bf99c1c576a2144a17780446a743.webp  I’ve never been able to find a solid story surrounding the events around Cus’s death. Mike says he had to go to the bank(?) with Jimmy, but he’s been pretty nebulous about that situation, understandably.  Is this the book? Thanks!!  Floyd Patterson: The Fighting Life of Boxing’s Invisible Champion https://a.co/d/dngYuXn
It was said during one of the two Cleveland Williams vs Liston fights in the commentary.  Liston's reach is more likely to be 80 inches, which is still good for only a 6 ft fighter.
https://youtu.be/aiTQsdgt9-w  1:40 ish there is the tale of the tape for the Leotis Martin fight  The Cleveland Williams fight where it's brought up is on YouTube as well, but I can't play anything with noise on my phone right now to find you the right one
He had long ass arms and really broad shoulders. His reach is smaller than AJ's tho
my man
Also that was back in the day when heavy weights were supposed to keep their weight low. By today standards he would be 10-15 lbs above that.
Beat tua too.
Nobody questioned Listons heart in his day because he had several instances of overcoming adversity and was only TKOed in two matches that were investigated for being fixed. You should watch more tape.   I can't think of a single fighter who fought them both who rated Foreman over liston, and that includes Ali. Frazier was also notoriously ducking Liston as well later in his reign, just as Tyson ducked Foreman. If you don't think that liston would have beat them those fighters and their teams certainly did.
You sonofa- 😂
Yes, that's the biography I mentioned.  *Iron Ambition* was co-written with a researcher who did most of the digging and work to put facts together on Cus. D'Amato's past was infamously obscured by Cus himself, who was an eccentric, off-the-books kind of guy, and also paranoid (with good reason).  Working with Tyson gave the researcher exclusive access to a bunch of D'Amato's old papers and records, though, and those informed Tyson's book. One thing he uncovered was that D'Amato was involved in having Floyd marry an early girlfriend who got pregnant — before his marriage to Sandra — in order to appease the girl's father and keep the scandal low-key. It was a marriage on paper only, and D'Amato negotiated child support payments and then facilitated a divorce to wrap it all up.  Regarding your question: I'm pretty sure Dan Florio was Patterson's primary trainer from early on and remained so after Cus was edged out. Cus was more the manager, Florio more the technical trainer. His involvement went back to the Gramercy Gym days.  Regarding D'Amato's death, I don't think there's much mystery — Tyson lays out a timeline in his book. The story about the bank was something that happened just after Cus died. Tyson recounts it because he felt Jacobs was cold and emotionless when he informed an employee at the bank why Tyson was so distraught-looking.
>Liston's reach is more likely to be 80 inches, which is still good for only a 6 ft fighter.  80 inches is 6"8. You would absolutely not expect that kind of reach on a 6"0 fighter.   Liston's reach is listed at 84 inches, the same as Jon Jones and Lennox Lewis, two guys famous for having ridiculously long reaches for their heights and they're both half a foot taller than Liston.   Obviously we can't measure it now, but the best fight that highlights his strange reach is the Chuck Wepner fight. There's a point where Liston throws a jab and hooks directly off of it and Wepner doesn't react because he clearly thinks he's out of range, both the jab and hook just clatter him and he goes down bemused.
Yeah, I know.
I mean Liston is a top 10 HW all time, and AJ is … I like to watch his fights but there isn’t a boxer in the division who can’t get past round 2 with him. See his last fight as evidence.
I'm imagining a 230 lb Liston, he'd look like a giant  brick with arms haha.
"and was only TKOed in two matches that were investigated for being fixed."  I'm not familiar with the background for the Martin fight, but the actual tko occurred when he was pouring blood out of his mouth and got caught by a nasty overhand right from Martin that stunned him badly. Liston was very clearly hurt badly by the punch.   As for shared opponents of foreman and liston, foreman was a kid when ali beat liston. A lot of the comparison is with a very very young and green foreman to an established champion in liston. It's dishonest to compare them in their prime and use evidence of one as a kid.  As for the ducking, liston was thrown into the corner of disregard after losing to ali. I don't think anyone saw the fight as valuable from Fraziers side. I favor Frazier to win, but liston was a big puncher so of course it was risky.  I don't think Frazier was scared of any man though.  Comparing ko ratios, foremans is insane. That's after being lowered during the late stages of his comeback where he got to old to effectively stop good opponents. Listons KO ratio doesn't match up, and doesn't hold the same quality of opponents that foremans has. I won't compare the wepner fights because liston was at the end of his career, but foreman stopped him in 1/3 the time. Of other relative opponents a much greener foreman stopped them in roughly the same time period.  I have foreman up on power, I have him up on chin, I have him up on his ability to cut off the ring, he's better at posting and guard manipulation. People underestimate just how skilled foreman was in his prime.
There's alot of inconsistencies on measuring boxer's height and reach.      Liston was measured 80.5 on the Leotis Martin fight.     Lennox Lewis flipped flopped around 82 but during holyfield it's 84 now.     Also I dont think Wepner is the best example. He kinda gets outboxed hard by anyone, including Duane Bobick. Obviously Liston still kinda had it in Wepner.
Jon Jones is 3 inches taller than Liston max, not half a foot.
Prime Usyk clearly can. Stylistic mismatch for Liston
his arms would just be stacks of bricks too lol
In the martin fight he was KOed and counted out while prone. Again, watch more tape rather than going by tables online.
No doubt, but even if it was only 80.5 inches, for a 6 foot tall man that's still a crazy long reach.   You'd expect that on someone around 6'5. Joshua is listed at 82 inches for example at 6'6
It was listons last fight, but I get what you mean
I always thought Jones was 6'5, turns out he's listed at 6'4. Fair enough.   He does have the reach of a 7 foot tall man though at 84 inches.
I'd definitely recomend the book Journeymen by Mark Turley. It offers a lot of insights into journeymen like this on the British boxing scene, including interviews with some of them.   A lot of them were decent boxers with good amateur records, but weren't able to sell tickets for their fights for various reasons, so ended up fighting in the away corner to ensure a guaranteed purse.   They all mention often feeling they could beat a lot of their opponents, but if that happens the promoters stop using them as opponents as they don't want there big ticket sellers getting beat.
This guy is really getting his moment in the spotlight and it is great to see. ID Boxing did a little documentary on him as well
Article Text:  It all ended much as it began. Ten and a half years after outpointing Latvian Arturs Geikins on his professional debut, Lewis van Poetsch climbed into the ring for the 170th and last time.  The setting was apt for a small hall veteran whose other job is driving lorries: an events space converted from a loading bay, beneath a Bristol shopping centre. He won on points again.  For both those bouts, the bookends of a long and storied career, the 32-year-old from Lydney in Gloucestershire sold tickets and was roared on by vociferous, hometown supporters.  But between them he spent a decade travelling up and down the country, carving out a niche as one of Britain's best-loved journeymen.  One hundred and fifty-two ring-savvy defeats, augmented with flamboyant ring walks and plenty of humour, tell their own story. He has been with the same trainer, Richard Farnan, for most of his career.  A self-proclaimed professional loser but an entertainer too, Van Poetsch always understood the sport and the business perfectly.  Promoters in need of super-middleweight or light-heavyweight opponents knew exactly who to call.  "I was the biggest ticket seller on the show," he says proudly of his final fight. "Which was funny because I'm not used to that any more and the situation made me a little apprehensive.  "As a journeyman you turn up, do your thing and go home. That's all I had done for years. I hadn't boxed in front of a home crowd, expecting a win for such a long time. That creates pressure."  Any nerves were not apparent on the night and Van Poetsch let no-one down.  "The pooch, the pooch will tear you apart, again," his 150 strong army of fans sang, to the tune of the famous Joy Division song, as their man controlled the action behind his jab and coasted to victory.  There was even a feeling that perhaps he was holding back, that if he wanted to he could have gone after his beleaguered opponent, Steve Davies from Aberdare in Wales. But Van Poetsch says he has great respect for every one of his opponents, especially his fellow journeymen.  "I knew Steve from before," Van Poetsch says. "We swapped messages online. He's a good lad, at the start of his journeyman career, and I had been giving him some advice.  "I boxed well and felt good, but I was never going to try and finish him off. That wouldn't have been right. It would have been against the journeyman's code."  As he walks away from the sport to which he has devoted most of his life, Van Poetsch insists he has no mixed feelings.  His decision to box as a journeyman came in his early days.  "I realised there was a way to make a name for myself and I took it. So I'm really happy with the route I took in boxing," he says.  "It's given me so much and I love the sport. I absolutely love it and I have a lot of knowledge.  "Boxing is the one thing in life I consider myself an expert in. But you can love it and still know your time of doing it is up. The time is up for me."  Wear and tear has taken its toll on the 170-fight warrior's body of late. He has developed problems in his elbows, shoulders and back.  Sometimes the pain has been so intense he has been unable to lift his arms. Unlike some, he is sensible enough not to push his luck too far.  "I don't want to end up an invalid. I've got a lot of miles on the clock from fighting every week, weight-cutting and especially all the heavy bag work," Van Poetsch says.  "As a journeyman you don't tend to spar as you fight so often, but hitting the heavy bag affects your joints. If I kept going, there's a danger I could suffer some sort of permanent damage."  In other ways, 'Poochi' counts himself lucky.  Towards the end of their careers, many fighters start to recognise the debilitating effects of neurological damage: slurred speech, co-ordination difficulties, mood swings.  Despite his lengthy record, Van Poetsch remains lucid, articulate and never more than a few words away from a quip.  "In my opinion, a lot of that damage is done in the gym," he says.  "A prospect or a champion, they are gearing up for that one night. To get their ring sharpness they do copious amounts of sparring.  "If you're in the gym every day, getting hit in the head, it's going to take its toll, but as a journeyman that didn't apply to me - although I have always been thick as fudge, so I don't think anyone would notice if it did."  Originally, the post-retirement plan was to take a break and assess options. But in a move that has even surprised himself, Van Poetsch is now in training to be a professional referee.  Marcus McDonnell, a British referee, suggested he would be a perfect fit for the profession. "A lightbulb moment," as Van Poetsch puts it.  He completed his first night as a trainee referee on the biggest of stages - Anthony Joshua's victory over Jermaine Franklin on Saturday.  "I've got good boxing knowledge," Van Poetsch says.  "I'm still going to be around. I'm retiring as a boxer, but I'm not retiring from boxing."
Would love to see a series where the main character is a journeyman boxer who is actually really good, but needs to keep finding inventive ways to lose, similar to the South Park episode where the kids don't want to play baseball anymore.
This was a lovely, lovely article. Always wanted to hear more about this side of the sport.
Can someone copy-and-paste? BBC website never works for me.
I watched a podcast with him and Carl Frampton where he says how he made a prospect look shit and never got a call from their promoter again. From memory it was pretty clear it was Hearn.
Met him a few times as he was training out of the same gym for fights.  Yes a really nice bloke, I wish him all the best in his next career.
Then he'll do some bad early stoppage or something and everyone will turn on him. Such is the way.
Fantastic documentary on him but can’t remember if it was audio or video will look it up. Impressive to avoid being knocked out and therefore not able to compete for 30+ days as per concussion protocols.
what a likeable guy pooch is. looking forward to seeing him back in the ring as the 3rd man!
Pp
Isn't that throwing a fight?
Yeah a lot of people don't realize these "cans" are perfectly solid boxers. They generally just don't have the time/resources//drive to be anything more, but they are still well trained. You don't fight 170 times without learning a thing or two.  And to your point, they know their role and fill it.
I've read that book I recommend it to anyone that doesn't know why boxers with shitty looking records carry on fighting. It even mentions that if they do beat a prospect they won't get booked for a while as punishment. The bit that stuck out to me was the two brothers that was heartbreaking. I think they were from Wales.  Probably the best book on boxing I've ever read.
Great book! I bumped into Jody Meikle at a boxing show once. Lovely fella, Stayed until the end to watch his fight. Was just as entertaining as I had read about
That last part is pure cope.  The best journeymen in Britain pick up many wins against the A-Side and enjoy good, prosperous careers.  EDIT: I find it very ironic that I'm getting so heavily downvoted for saying 'they all mention often feeling they could beat a lot of their opponents' is cope for a fighter like Van Poestch, but next week people will watch a prospect bash around a journeyman for 4 or 6 round and then ask what the point of that was lol.
If you love what you do.. You love what you do 🤷‍♂️ What more can I/we say
That sounds like a mint idea
Someone’s done it in a comment above for you 👍🏻
Have you tried VPN to go through it?
I honestly don't understand why this is praised. Imagine having this in any other sport.
Kinda. But the thing is the chances a journeyman will get a title shot is low. They could beat the new kid who is trying to work his way up the ranks but then what? That $10,000 he gets for fighting goes away cause promoters don't want to use a journeyman who is gonna beat up their guy. If the journeyman tries to take a step up, while they are a competent boxer, would probably lose bad because they don't have the resources to be at an elite level. So they are stuck with a choice, push the new kid and see what he has, don't hurt him but lose, or risk embarrassing the new guy and lose future work for no gain.    &#x200B;  It's a thankless job.
Right? If you fought 170 guys your same size (especially less experienced guys in the beginning), How do you even lose 150+ times unless you give up and just stop trying.
I don't think it's too far fetched. Not every young fighter in their first few fights is going get to a decent level, a lot of them are awful but can sell tickets.   If you look at the opponents for these journeymen, a lot of them only fought a handful of times and amounted to nothing.  Plus even when the journeymen go for the wins they often get robbed of the decision.
You're thinking of journeyman like Chisora who is still a top 15 heavyweight.
Thanks for letting me know!
Not worth the effort for me. It just has a pop up asking me if I want to create an account, but the close button doesn't work.
Honestly, is it any different than being a can for a tune up fight? It's a living.
If you think every athlete in every other sport is giving 110% every time and is existentially devastated to lose to the favorite… I don’t know what to tell ya.
I used to think that until I read journeymen, they play a vital role in giving prospects ring experience in front of a crowd with little chance of getting knocked out or beaten. The journeymen fight nearly every week and are a lot better than their record's show and better than they show in the ring generally. It's just in this day and age it's as much about selling tickets and popularity as it is boxing acumen.
Do you have a metric for the last statement there? I'd be fascinated to see if there's any evidence to support that assertion. (Genuine question, not an internal critique.)
I've been watching UK cards from the first fight to the last for over a decade now so I'm familiar with the good journeymen. I've seen plenty get robbed like you say but usually the ref's scorecard tells a bit of a story however nothing beats actually watching them.
No, I'm thinking of people like Rambaletsa, Ellison, Fidoe, Sokolowski and others. Journeymen that push prospects close consistently. van Poetsch is incredibly tough but as a 5ft7 light-heavy with slow feet I've never seen him do well.  Just think about this; why would a promoter invest in a fighter/ticket seller if they can't even get pass the lowest level of competition?
No probs
It is different.   A can is an opponent specifically picked because you know the chances of beating them is very high. The can will try his best despite being outmatched.   A journeyman intentionally losing fights because they know winning will lead to them not getting any more fights is a whole different thing and much worse imo.
I want to check out the book, but I don't really get it. Do they not try to win so they keep getting work as a journeyman? If so isn't that throwing the fight like originally suggested?
Hard to quantify something that is awarded on a ref's discretion. It doesn't happen that often to be honest. It's usually a question of a journeyman's aggression vs the prospect's boxing so it's the age old of question of whether you score for punches landed or for the more damaging/more appealing shots.
Yep journeymen are guys like Ellison, fidoe, cowboy corrone etc.
That's a problem with the system, not the journeyman. You're asking him to choose between some invented sense of morality in a sport created for entertainment and feeding himself and his kids. I won't criticize anyone for choosing food over honour.
It's a grey area their not specifically told to lose but if they end up winning they get noticeably less bookings.
So yes, they lose and throw fights purposefully. But everyone winks and no one says it out loud so it's fine I guess.
Pretty much
I know Cameron had a rough break with mcguigan but I cant tell if this is about that or MTK trying to stick it to Mcguigan.  Sucks that Scotney is caught in the middle, and it doesn't seem fair.
If it’s related to MTK and a Mcguigan, it’s probably because of Barry speaking out about Daniel Kinahan   You know those few days when everyone pretended to be outraged before finding something else to do it with
What's the deal here? I tried to make sense of it from Twitter comments. Something to do with MTK and Shane not getting along? I didn't know MTK were still operating. Or is it something personal between Shane and Cameron?
Out of order that this effects Scotney, she will still get her shot but just much lower profile card. Got to blame Cameron really- this will have come from her directly because none of her management really have anything against Shane just her as a person
Scotney apparently fought twice on Cameron’s undercards/with Cameron on cards so there is probably more to this then what we know right now
Shane used to train Cameron. They split at some point and apparently it wasn't amicable in the slightest. I don't exactly know if Cameron used to be under his dad's promotion, Cyclone, but usually the McGuigan's take things too personally.
Cameron's saying she actually signed a NCD and can't even say what happened. Must've been bad.
I guess they make their fighters sign those since the Frampton drama
I rate the world championships as high if not more highly than the Olympics so bit gutted for the boxers not attending.
This comes along most of the superpowers in Women's boxing boycotting the recent Womans Amateur championships.  It sadly won't hurt the IBA as they have ties to very powerful people who can offset any revenue losses, but it's a strong stand.  For anyone who doesn't know, the IOC has a lot of concerns about the IBA stemming from a recent nomination of a suspected organised crime figure, to current head of IBA moving what was the AiBA to Russia, and appointing judges and referees at his own discretion, removing oversight and basically have a single main sponsor who is closely linked to Putin and heavily supports the Russian invasion of the Ukraine.   Good for teams like GB taking a stand on this. They are fighting for boxing as an Olympic sport.
It seems the only answer is for a new institution, but nobody wants to spend the effort and money that is required.
You still have the Olympics and the “sub-Olympics” like the Pan-Ams and the European Games  I think the amateurs can survive without the IBA and their World Championship tournament. There’s still a bunch of international meets in between the Olympics, so I don’t think the fighters will be missing out too much
Tyson Fury: "Best I can do is 85:15"
At least AJ is fighting.
Frank loves an opportunity to bash Joshua
Why do people ask promoters for their opinions on fighters they don’t manage?
He’s still a massive draw - particularly in the UK.
Suck a fat one fish eyes
Frank bashing Joshua when Joyce can’t sell out the copper box.
Fury can't turn you a profit, Frank.  You get your return in a pat on the back from Bob, and views on Tyson's social media tirades.
AJ is still the biggest draw in the biggest division in boxing
Pure marketing from a rival promoter.
What a completely unnecessary column from Frank, not his fighter and bar Fury AJ is still comfortably a bigger draw than everyone in his stable
Popular opinion bait
Tell us something we don't know you fucking muppet Frank!
Whilst true, Fury isn’t exactly taking AJ’s place, greedy ducking pykey
He's not wrong. If Joyce looks the part vs Zhang then he's clear Number 3 after Usyk and Fury.   Joshua needs a bit more time with his new coach before I'm ready to say he's on the scrap heap though.
Yeah. Think it's done. One thing I notice is just how much people were turned off by the Franklin figure. PPV were always going to be modest but it was a poor showing too. And it's on DAZN. Joshua just isn't managed well. They took advantage of a weak division but since its started to see some names, he's had nothing to show for it.  There's a contingent of weirdos who'll insist Joshua is the "da best Eva!!!!" No matter what he does. He could lose to Dave Allen and they'll still be talking about "resume". But to a lot of casual boxing viewer, his diehard fans are beginning to seem like utter dorks. Look at how stupid McGregor fans look now. No single man will be bigger than the sport itself and superstars come and go all the time. If anything I think the Canelo/Joshua 1 and 2 era are coming to an end. Tyson could be the next face of the division but he's a potential duck and a tosser. The wider boxing landscape looks promising but I don't see any big crossover stars except for maybe Garcia and Tank. If anything, youtube boxing is making a dent.   At the end of the day what a lot of redditors don't understand is that the world doesn't adhere to people's expectations of likeable/politically correct stars. Fundamentally you need to win in impressive fashion. Joshua isn't doing that so interest will wane.  Edit: downvoted already. Exactly what I'm talking about loool, like Connor he attracts this really weird diehard subsection of fans who are looking more and more like cornballs.
He’s actually right about this. There’s not a buzz about AJ anymore. Even if he fights Fury it won’t be as big as it was a few years ago.
The sport is diminishing on the global stage bc we punish people in social media age for taking fights. Also probably because he’s a racist fucking asshole and spewed absolute gibberish after the loss to Alexander, shits embarrassing.
Facts
ITT: a bunch of loser Joshua fans clinging to his marketability and ppv sales… cause that’s all they have left! They know damn well their boy can’t win on the big stage anymore, so they have to act like their aj’s own personal accountant. The copium is strong with u blokes, of course the guys gonna sell out in the uk; it’s the only place he isn’t scared to fight in anymore.  Member when this sub was all “aj is coming to take over America ? What happened to that?…. Ohhhhh right! He lost at the garden, and has been terrified to come back since!   I ain’t a fan of fury, either. It seems usyk is the only heavyweight atm w the talent and willingness to fight anyone, anywhere, anytime. Thank god for the lower weight classes, those lil guys are starting to fight each other, at least.
Honestly I hope Zhang wins just to shut Frank up.
Something something you sausage
“He’s rapidly disappearing”
If you score the Hrgovic Zhang fight properly it's hard to argue for a Zhang win.
yeah, he's not biased at all
You’re a diminishing force on the global stage
He should focus on getting Fury in the ring
Yeah he probably is but he’s still one of the biggest draws in the heavyweight division and probably the biggest fight Fury can get outside of Usyk
Such a diminishing force, you cannot shut up about him.
Frank “IT’S HAPPENING” Warren
AJ is still the biggest draw. There’s a reason Buffer calls him the pride of England and not Fury
Says Frank who’s not even Fury’s actual promoter and is an absolute joke in the UK let alone global stage.
It's been a whole 17 minutes since this comment- I heard the offer is now 90:10
And you have 4 minutes to sign the contract. Starting……2 days ago, unlucky m8
/thread
Let’s see him after 3 wilder fights
They have both fought 4 times this decade
Bums
Took him long enough to step in the ring, fury last fight was December. AJs September. Plus he called out the LOSER not winner of Franklin Whyte
Once a year?
No mention of Fury ducking Usyk though….
 He must have quickly realised people didn't like the Fury schtick so he had to unload a massive distraction. Probably had this all saved in the drafts.
Clicks.
As someone who went to nearly every single AJ fight since he fought Kevin Johnson, I think it's diminishing very quickly.
Not anymore. They've been slowly omitting viewership data in regards to his fights. The writing is on the wall.   Not only is he not looking competitive, some of his out of ring comments are catching the ire of some viewers. You can be successful as either a likeable fighter or a competitive one. Joshua seems to be neither right now.
He's a drawl fursure, B
O2 was 1/3 empty
I'd say only in the UK. Obviously still will sell well elsewhere if he fights another big name, but I don't think AJ will ever be massive outside of the UK at this point.
That is embarrassing for a promoter. As an American, I know how popular Joe Joyce is in the UK.
No that is Fury now.  He is a big fat 🦆, but credit where credit is due, Tyson can fill up arenas on both sides of the Atlantic.
Clear number 3? What after fighting an unproven Dubois, a boxer in Parker who has now lost multiple times, and Zhang who has just lost to Hrgovic (although for me he won the fight). I don't see how you can say he is the third best, Reddit is so reactionary.   Wait until AJ KO's his next hand picked opponent, everyone will be saying how he is the GOAT
Nah no way. It goes Usyk, Fury, Wilder, then Joyce. Wilder will still take a part Usyk, maybe Joyce, and definitely AJ. AJ is not in contention for shit.
To say he wasn’t managed well is kinda absurd tbh, he’s probably made more money than the rest of the division combined. The hype around him has definitely died down though, if he fights Whyte and gets a big KO then the fans will probably start supporting him again, he needs a big name opponent next time out for sure.
Facts
He's got 6 rounds to win
I just don't get why Fury is avoiding Usyk. Fury taking on Wilder after the breakdown and weight gain was the opposite of his current behaviour. Fury can beat him and cement an amazing legacy, netting tens of millions in the process. Is he afraid to take any significant chance of losing the zero?
I should have said 'fighting people they should be fighting'. AJ is fine to fight a nobody as he has no belts and needs to rebuild after some losses. Fury says he's a figthting man who will fight anyone anywhere for free, but he goes to great lengths to avoid the only other person with belts, so Frank is being a bit hypocritical here.
Less of a deal if a no-belter is fighting bums to recover from some losses, compared to a 'born fighting man who'll fight anyone, anywhere for free' avoiding the only other person with belts.
fIgHt BuMs
Not sure you know what called out is, if so Fury called out the loser of Fury Chisora 2, Fury Chisora 1, Parker Chisora 1, Parker Chisora 2... Etc. I don't really have enough time to complete this list
I kind of meant 'fighting people he should be fighting'. After a couple of losses, AJ did the right thing in picking an easy opponent. Fury has no excuse whatsoever for not fighting Usyk. It's a duck. AJ is a fighter trying to get his confidence back, Fury is a fighter with a belt who should be going for undisputed, especiially after his years of talk about being a fighting man, any time any place etc.
How's it taste?
See my other replies to this same comment.
Selling a PPV in a cost of living crisis is never going to go well to be fair.
What at the hell are you talking about. His rematch with Usyk was on Sky and did 1.2 million PPV buys, which is way more than what Fury did vs. Whyte and Chisora. Its much easier to find Aj numbers than Fury. Frank Warren was afraid to confirm the Fury vs. Whyte numbers because they underperformed.    We all know Aj is now signed exclusively with DAZN, now and they will likely hide the numbers because they don't like to disclose if subscriber numbers are underperforming.
Cam you provide some data? 4 million ppvs average in his last 4 fights before Franklin. And sold out O2 by himself after two back to back losses.  Is there anything we don't know that they told you secretly? Provide some data please.
Franklin fight wasn’t anything near a sellout, 1/3 empty and that’s after a lot of comps
Other than canelo he's probably the highest paid boxer since Mayweather. Perspective.
And Dubois can’t even sell out the Telford Centre.   Yarde fought the best guy in the division and couldn’t sell out the Wembley arena.   Frank’s promotional skills have always been extremely reliant on the promotional skills of the fighter. He’s just not a good promoter, just a boring old bitter dude.
Joshua Usyk did more buys than Fury Wilder
Best is based on current form, not what other people on this sub seem to think ("Oh he has the most potential, oh he beat this guy 5 years ago").   Rankings are solely based on form. Joyce will have beaten 3 Top 20 HWs in last 18 months if he beats Zhang.   Who have AJ and Wilder beaten in the same time.  That's why Joyce is 3rd.
How can anyone rank AJ higher than 5 when Hearn has now specifically said he is going to avoid fighting lefties now.  That's a real championship mindset.
Reactive*
Not how rankings work. You don't get ranked based on hypotheticals.   Regardless of how Joyce looks against Zhang he will still only have around as many professional fights as Joshua has world title fights.   None of that means he wouldn't beat him if they fought, but you can't get the credit until you do the work.
I agree that Wilder should be above Joyce, based on their records.   However, I think Joyce beats Wilder.    Usyk will also dance round Wilder all night, and really show how bad a boxer Wilder is.
What? Usyk would make Wilder look silly.
Let me clarify then.  He is *marketed* well. Immensely well. He is *managed* poorly. I think the Ruiz and Franklin fights were relatively poor fights to showcase his talents but this is essentially hidnsight speaking. I also think the move to DAZN was a foolish one. I have a suspicion that they likely wont pick the next big name opponent well either.
Because he knew Wilder is a wank boxer but Usyk is a brilliant boxer.
Yeah I think so. He may feel he’s already the best heavyweight of his generation and risking his 0 isn’t worth it unless he gets a ridiculous proportion of the purse
That situation seems to be more just waiting for Saudi money
Usyk is the one who pulled out of the fight
OK, set a match with the loser of their last bout. Still not good  Also forgetting Chisora was at least coming off a win... Forgot to include that in your little list
That's very true. I actually think inflation is a big reason why decent fights are actually taking place this year.
>  His rematch with Usyk was on Sky and did 1.2 million PPV buys  .  >  His rematch with Usyk  .   > Usyk
O2 wasn’t anything near sold out
I don't disagree with that.
Ok I stand corrected, I did not know.  Tyson is still a big fat 🦆 though.
Joyce is obviously third best if he beats Zhang. Problem is Joyce isnt that marketable and he doesn't have a pillock like Hearn appeasing idiots social media followers advocating for his career either. The amusing thing about this sub is how much people need to have their knowledge fed to them.   If Under Armour and Sky Sports were pushing Joyce as the next big thing, you'd suddenly see a whole heap of supporters on here. These people only know to like what they're told to like.
Rankings aren't soley based on form. If that's the chase the young up and comers who have won 10 fights in a row with 1 round knockouts will be ranked one.
Not really. Rankings are ranked on your whole career and form. putting an 18 month cap to make your argument doesn’t make it a strong argument. Zhang would be a good win but Joyce needs to do more. If he beat a ruiz wilder aj etc I would agree. But he simply hasn’t done enough. He just beat ajs leftovers and the current parker should’ve lost to chisora. It’d be different if he beats another top ten this year though.
I just think Joyce is massively overhyped, and unjustifiably so. It reminds me of the hype around Ortiz a few years ago, as the 'bogeyman' didn't have a record to justify it.   In the past 18 months Joyce has beaten Parker, good result as a former champion, but is becoming more of a gatekeeper given the losses he has recently, and average (at best) and past it fighters in Takam and Hammer.   Maybe I'm just not a fan of his style, plodding forward and vlocking punches with his chin, I'm just not massively invested in Joyce yet. I want to see him against a top 4 or 5 heavyweight before I jump aboard
So because Hearn (promoter, not his trainer, or his manager) has said that AJ has lost all of his credentials??????  You do realise if Hearn could make a massive pay day he would feed AJ to anybody who flashes the cash.  I'm not even an AJ fan, if the fight is on and I don't have to pay, I'll watch him, but only ever paid for one of his fights, Wlad. I'm just perplexed how now all of a sudden AJ is complete shite and is on a par with the fella Julius Francis smashed when he was working the door in London!
Joyce does look very good but he’s got a lot of credit for beating a really raw Dubois, who hasn’t looked great since, and a Joseph Parker who struggled with Chisora
Wbo has Wilder fought apart from Fury? No one. And he was soundly beaten in all 3 of their fights.
I don't think he would. I think he would outbox Wilder but get caught eventually. Hopefully we get to see it though.
They missed the boat for wilder and fury is almost expiring
There was Saudi money on the table and Gypsy Duck didn't take it.
Hopefully.
Only because Fury made the contract more and more ridiculous until it could no longer be accepted. It's a classic way of ducking without it looking like you're ducking. He did the same thing to AJ with the arbitary and impossible to meet deadline.
This is the finest mental gymnastics performance outside of the olympics
While I think Usyk is an underrated draw, you have to be kidding if you think he was the main draw in a fight against AJ.
Usyk is not really a draw
[Here's the data and proof. ](https://imgur.com/ccKVCog.jpg)  I know your type so here's further proof. A fan fact checking to see how many tickets left on the day of. [Proof](https://twitter.com/dpgilbey/status/1641752068162482176?s=19)  Go talk about his post fight comments. Weird personality or whatever. But numbers and money wise; (Frank Warren voice) *Do us a facking favor yeah? No one geevs eh monkaaayys wot you fink.*
Tyson the biggest sucker.
HOW DARE A PROMOTER PROMOTE
You're not getting this.   Rankings aren't made up by just numbers. It's by beating _people with high rankings that move you up_  Knocking out 10 nobodies outside the Top 250 would not get you a high ranking.  Knocking out 10 Top 40 opponents would.   Joyce has beaten highly ranked HWs. He could beat another in a few weeks. Thats what moves him up over AJ and Wilder who have at best 1 win over a Top 20 guy in the past 2 years between them.
> Rankings are ranked on your whole career and form  No, rankings are based on how good you are now and how you would be expected to do in your next fight. That's the point of them.  If you want to talk about GOAT, then yes "whole career" is considered.
It's the manner in which he's done it and how he's looked doing it. Man's got a breeze block for a head and bowling balls for fists. Everybody wants to see if he could walk through Wilder or Joshua, and if so, he's earned a title shot
> but is becoming more of a gatekeeper given the losses he has recently  God you are so full of shit. You act like people don't have access to the internet and can't see that Joyce is the first loss Parker has had in almost 5 years.... and that was headbutt "loss" to Whyte.
Aj fans credit his win over Parker…
I agree his records not great, especially for an ex WBC champion, but then who has Joyce beat?   Like I said, on records alone, I would have Wilder slightly ahead, but I think Joyce will beat him if they fight.
Arum said it's for the end of this year, once the new stadium is built.
They weren’t impossible terms. Usyk ducked
mental gymnastics aka facts. Bcs youre wrong so why leave out chisora was coming off a win?  And none of this changes my reply to the original comment, AJ has taken longer to fight than Fury
That fight also sold a lot because it was a championship fight. This is why the belts are so financially important to fighters. Usyk was the champion in that fight and was arguably the draw for it.  No one is denying that AJ has outsized popularity compared to his current performance, but these continued mediocre performances are absolutely diminishing his fanbase and his selling power.
Maybe. We'll know for sure when we see how well his next fight sells.
My man.
The week of the fight there were 7000 unsold seats. So either they were comped out or heavily discounted.
"Rankings are solely based on form"   Your exact words.
Who is the top talent Joe has faced? According to your form claim of 18 months Parker isn't. He best win since losing the belt is Chisora, he hasn't faced anybody of quality.  Joyce has beaten Parker, Hammer and Takam. Take Parker out, how many of his opponents ate in the top 20. I hope Joyce goes on to have a great career and bring back another belt for the UK, but he isnt 3rd atm.
Lol I disagree. It’s based more on everything you’ve done and your current form. It has nothing to do with how you’re expected to do in your next fight. If that’s your opinion then cool. There’s many different criterias for judging that but I don’t take the expectation of the next fight into account.
I want to see him fight box of them, but at the minute I don't think he has done anything to justify him being ranked 3rd best.  I do have concerns about his long-term health, as although he has a granite head, he is taking a lot of damage.
Will Parker ever become a champion again? Which top heavyweight does he beat to justify his rankings as a top fighter?   Since losing to Joshua who is a credible victory? Fuck me, the biggest victory on his resume since losing his belt was Chisora.   He isnt a Kevin Johson or Carlos Takam, but everytime he has stepped up, he has lost.
Completely different context though innit  Unification fight against an undefeated champion > a win 4 years later against a fighter who struggled against a 40yo Del Boy
I would say Joseph Parker and Daniel Dubois are notable wins.
So? What's the problem with that Fury still isn't fighting...
They were bullshit terms. 70/30 and you get screwed again in the rematch. Usyk has more belts he should be getting the 70. Fury is a massive duck. He gives an interview before the Chisora III fight where he says the world is more interested in seeing him make history by having a second trilogy than in fighting 'some little foreigner'. Nobody can believe that, it's an obvious duck.
Because it doesn't matter, is what I'm saying. If you're fighting a bum you're fighting a bum. Winning one fight in your last 5 is hardly better than winning 4/5 your last 5.   Your other point stands
Being the A side in a rematch does not make you the draw.    Aj is a bigger draw than Usyk. The belts do not matter in this case. Tank vs. Ryan Garcia will do more PPV than Haney vs. Loma. Having belts does not make you the most popular fighter or biggest draw at your weight class.
Seethe in silence.
Lmao you are saying that like a "gotcha".   My second statement doesn't contradict this.   Please read both again carefully.
Takam was Top 20 on Boxrec at the time. Ditto Parker. Need to see if I can check on Hammer.
Dude thats bullshit.   If that were the case, in 2008 Holyfield would've been the Number HW in the World instead one of the Klitschko Bros.
It's fair to disagree, but I wonder what criteria the actual ranking bodies use (like Ring Magazine)
> Will Parker ever become a champion again?  Parker has the same path to a champion as AJ... hoping for an easy fight to pick up a stripped belt.
Isn't that the same as AJ fans taking credit for Wlad who already lost to Fury? Can't have it both ways.
Probably on the same level as Ortoz, Helenius, Breazeale and Stiverne.  I'm not a Wilder fan boy, far from it, but his record is definitely comparable to Joyce's at the minute
He's waiting for the Joyce/Zhang fight
How much of AJ's selling power was because he had the belts? Seriously. The sales for his last fight is the first real data we have to answer that question.
I'm literally just quoting you mate.
Lol that’s a stretch and a horrible example. The klitschkos were champions so nobody could debate that. What was holyfields form in 2008? Not good
Parker will struggle to get a belt, as he doesn't have a promoter willing to throw money at a governing body to.make them a mandatory.  I'm not qn AJ fanboy, I agree his only chance is to hope the belts get fragmented and he becomes mandatory. I cant see Usyk dropping a belt anytime soon, as he wants undisputed. If he fights Fury, and Fury wins, I can see the IBF going vacant after they stripped him last time.
Again completely different context because those fights were in close succession and wlad was still clearly on it for the aj fight  And even beating that in mind fury’s win against wlad is still ranked as a better one by pretty much everyone   You don’t have to be so binary
I would give you Stiverne 1 and Ortiz as being comparable.
Usyk has had 2 PPV events with more views that Fury has
That's why the rematch split was BS; if Usyk won then he would be the A side fot the rematch. Fury made the contract more and more harsh until Usyk had to pull out to maintain some dignity, allowing Fury to look like he wanted the fight.
Bro, he fought Franklin a pretty much unknown tune-up fighter who most only knew from the Whyte fight. That is like comparing Fury numbers with Tom Schwarts vs his numbers against Wilder.    You don't like AJ and that is cool, but please lets not go down this road of comparing apples to oranges.
But to what end lol!.   "I'm"  See now I've just quoted you too.
Jesus dude pick a lane.  Is it current form of a fighter, or is it what they did in their career?  It can't be both.
Fair enough, you actually debate in a civil manner. I'm used to arguing with AJ fanboys on here who aren't capable of such dialogue.
> Bro, he fought Franklin a pretty much unknown tune-up fighter who most only knew from the Whyte fight  EXACTLY.  Therefore any sales or PPV from this fight should be a direct reflection of AJ's drawing power. Why is this not obvious?
Okay
It’s both. I’m not going to argue Roy jones jr is the best today because of what he’s done in his career. His current form is not good. Aj however has fought the best his whole career. some of his wins are still in the top ten today. Joyce is fighting his leftovers. I understand why you think that but Joyce hasn’t done enough yet imo. He needs another top win after zhang. I do think he’s earned a fight vs aj fury or wilder and a win over one of them puts him up there. How many current top ten guys has Joyce beaten right now compared to aj?
“He looks older but he’s 20” lmaoo
It's crazy that he did as well as he did with his chin up like that. Just goes to show that fundamentals aren't everything. Timing, speed, strength, stamina, and grit can be more important than technique.  If a guy is relaxed and dangerous in the ring, he's a problem.
Aaron Pryor, also known as "The Hawk", was an American professional boxer who competed from 1976 to 1990. He was known for his aggressive style and relentless pressure in the ring, which earned him a reputation as one of the greatest junior welterweights of all time.        Pryor had a very successful career as a boxer, with a record of 39 wins, 1 loss, and 35 knockouts. He was a two-time junior welterweight world champion and held the unified WBA and WBC titles from 1980 to 1983. He also had a famous rivalry with Alexis Arguello, defeating him twice in two memorable fights in 1982 and 1983.        Pryor's aggressive style and impressive record made him a fan favorite, and he was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1996. Despite his accomplishments in the ring, Pryor struggled with addiction and personal demons outside of boxing, which ultimately led to his retirement from the sport in 1990. Nonetheless, he remains one of the most exciting and dominant boxers of his era  Video Credit: @HaymakerBoxing YouTube Channel
Pryor’s win over Cervantes is also absolutely elite, Cervantes was one of the best fighters of all time and dropped Pryor before then being stopped by him in the 4th round.   Cervantes had a rough first 32 fights of his career where he went 23-8-1, but from that point until retirement he went  44-4 with one of those losses dealt to him by Wilfred Benitez by SD, and another from prime Pryor.
Alexis Arguello had him beat if not for "the bottle"
Also beat thomas hearns in the amateurs.   Too bad SRL had no intention of fighting him
Sorry but I can’t praise a guy who was a known cheat and a product of “the bottle mixed” by Panama…he gets no P4P mention  I don’t know how OP can write a blurb about him to go with the video, mention the Arguello fights and not even touch on the magic potion he had in his corner.
Also a cheater.
It's admirable how little he cares for his own safety, willing to take one to give one. Stand-up fighter.
His opponent being 20 and looking that old. Sheesh.
Aaron Pryor is one of the funnest fighters to watch in the HISTORY OF THE SPORT.  Dream fight at 140, Pryor vs. Chavez.  Would have been even better than Pryor v. Arguello.
He beat Alexis Arguello but sure, Mayweather said something nice about him.
Panama Lewis with El Agua de Cocaina.
He was great. Best super lightweight ever. His fight with Arguello is one of my faves https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GMV7Kfj6GkQ
WHAT TIME IS IT?
One of the best to ever do it!
Bobby Joe Young now works at Curtis High School in New York City - the only guy to beat Pryor. lol
also juiced to the gills, but to be fair most of the 80s fighter are.
Check his water bottle.
Damn 70s were really just full of monsters huh? From Ali's era to the beginning of the 4 Kings. No end to notable names in any division.
Pryor was an absolute problem in the ring. But as others have noted, the substance abuse problems (most likely during fights) and the Panama Lewis cheating issues leave a bad taste in the mouths of many fans. One thing I don't think he gets credit for, is his defense. To the casual fan, it probably doesn't look like it exists but he always finished his combinations with head movement and angles. He bullied his way in, completely let his hands go, which effectively neutralized his opponent until Pryor stopped throwing. Then he moved his head and body to thwart counters.
Amazing to think that between beating Jim Watt to a UD and taking his WBA and Ring belts that Argüello fought six times time in less than 18 months. His victims prior to Pryor included Boom Boom Mancini, Kevin Rooney, Roberto Elizondo, James Buscemi and Andrew Ganigan. If he'd won, he'd have been the first boxer to win world titles in four different weights. I guess we'll never really know what was in Pryor's water bottle, but it sure gave him energy in that 14th round...
his style is quite tyson like with the square stance
This is amazing to watch. What an unreal level or relentless pressure. Wow!
My goodness! How is it I’ve never seen this man? This video made me an instant fan and will definitely be watching his fights. Thanks for the knowledge OP.
Holy shit. Very impressive. Relentless, ruthless. What a machine.
Man we really missed out on Ray Mancini vs Pryor. Would’ve been fireworks.
Pryor ruined Arguello. Such a shame.
Being attached to Panama Lewis is a tarnish that overshadows the skill. Pryor was a bad MFer, but could very well be the Barry Bonds of Boxing. An asterisk perhaps? It’s hard to imagine him getting any deserving attention or credit for what he did for the sport, that sucks.
At round 1.20 of round 5, Pryors forward pressure punching is identical to how kovalev generated power,  getting the whole body behind the punch adding to already solid techniques. Pryor throws hard with both hands while moving , it's hard to do fluidly and especially multiple times constantly without noticeable resetting in-between combinations .if that makes sense lol
Hand him that bottle, no the other one. The one I mixed.
Well Pryor threw more punches in one round than mayweather did throughout the whole fight.
everyone he’s fighting in these clips has like 0 defense tho.
Mayweather shits on Muhammad Ali. His opinion on the past really doesn't matter after u say some shit like that.
Mayweather definitely studied his style
As great as he was he had the opportunity to fight Duran and SRL and if he accepted both opportunities and gave a good fight or even beat them, his legacy and popularity would have been unreal and he might have become the 5th king
Pryor sure did love him those mixed drinks!
I hated Aaron Pryor. I was so happy to see Bobby Joe Young stop him.
It’s sad that Panama Lewis sullied his name. He was obviously cheating in the first fight against Arguello, but I still think Pryor is in the conversation for greatest P4P of all time.
I didn't know Freddy Mercury was a boxer, I guess he went by Alexis back then!
Sugar Ray ain't want no parts of Aaron Pryor
[Floyd Mayweather Jr. selected Aaron Pryor as one of his top five boxers](https://talksport.com/sport/boxing/738425/floyd-mayweather-ranked-muhammad-ali-mike-tyson-list/)
“What time is it!?”
Dude had a bald patch the size of a grapefruit.
For a certain age group RJJ set us all back in our fundamentals trying to copy him lol.
AP was high as kite in most of his fights.
He was a very accomplished amateur. I remember Ali commenting on one of Pryor's amateur fights on Wide World of Sports and being very impressed with Aaron even stating that he is glad that Pryor isn't a heavyweight. Aaron had fundamentals but most of the time he was trying to blast his competition away which led to him being careless
Fundamentals isn’t the same as form. There’s some crossover but fundamentals are mostly about how you apply your technique
True, but I also think it shows how much more advanced boxing has gotten, with all due respect to the boxers from the past.
The rapper Ransom dedicated the opening of his 2022 album No rest for the wicked to Aaron Pryor. Its a song called The Hawk.  A young Aaron Pryor with felonies on the wire  Fair desire, man, I'm really too old to be airin' priors  True story, you got no drive for the lane I'm swerving in  I been a star but they labellin' me a journeyman
Both times. I can't believe this shit bag Pryor gets any praise. If not for Panama Lewis, he wouldn't have been shit. Arguello was beating the living shit out of him and he didn't feel anything.
The bottle?
Didn't Ray Leonard sign to fight him and then he injured his eye?
I don’t buy that man. SRL would’ve beaten him anyways
Yeah that always seemed sketch to me but he did beat Argüello in the rematch with Emanuel Steward as his trainer instead of Panama
The "mixed bottle" wasnt the real cheating it was a red herring.
I’m with you, anytime someone mentions Aaron Pryor I think of that exactly..
Came here for this. Doesn't sit well with me.
We really don’t know what kind of drugs he was on.  He certainly fought like a man possessed, but was that hyperactivity drugs?  If he was on something he shouldn’t be revered, but if he was clean (except at the end when he got caught) then he blew it by cheating then…either way he made reputation mistakes.  God is our final and true judge…may he and Alexis (who did it the right way) RIP.
I was thinking the same thing. TF does it matter if Floyd Jr praised him? He was from a previous era, Floyd should be the one hoping for approval from Pryor.
The one where he was given smelling salts and the water bottle filled with amphetamines? Those might have been 2 separate fights actually...Panama Lewis was a shady dude. Still, Arguello is one of my all time favorites, and he got fucked because of Prior's cheating.
Is he fuck. Can't ignore the cheating.
I’m sure they’re all natty now 😂
https://youtu.be/UouwClaqjVg   Water and grounded up asthma tablets
Hairlines were simply built different in the 20th century
Haha yes he did. I'm a coach, and I find it funny how you can tell what fighter was a person's inspiration just by how they move on their first day. Tyson and Ali being obvious examples.  If someone comes in trying to move like RJJ, I know I'm going to have my hands full.
Fundamentals are the foundation of technique. Fundamental.  >forming a necessary base or core; of central importance.
I think Pryor was the exception to the rule even back then, so I struggle to use him as an example for this statement. Plenty of very sound fighters in his day. Id say that the average technical ability of a 2023 prospect has actually gotten a little bit better, but the talent pool has gotten worse if that makes sense?   Even today, I can think of a few fighters who are really good in spite of their chin-up, namely Keyshawn Davis and Ryan Garcia. Pryor had really good timing and distance management which also lumps into fundamentals
It sure has, but sometimes a guy comes along and just defies everything you think you know. Wilder pissed me off for a long time until Fury smacked him down. All of that shit shouldn't work, but he got away with it.
Except Mayweather has been quoted saying Augustus was his toughest opponent he ever faced, whose style is very reminiscent of Pryor. When the grandmaster is playing fundamentals and the unpredictable "novice" isn't playing by the same rules, it can cause problems
Didnt panama lewis get kicked out of boxing?
Almost forgot that was during Pryor - Arguello. ("Not that bottle, the one I mixed.") That guy was a piece of shit. Actually got convicted in court for tampering with gloves in a fight resulting in knockout (Resto - Collins, not Pryor; Resto & Lewis were sentenced to prison for assault [[source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Collins_Jr.)]).  Still, I find Pryor one of the most fun boxers to watch.
https://youtu.be/3UI4s0H4im0
Yes and before that Pryor wouldn't sign because he didn't feel he was getting a fair amount of money. Fair enough on both counts. Unfair offers and unexpected injuries are part of boxing. I'd love to have seen them fight though.
I definitely don't buy that SRL was scared of him.
SRL was not scared of Pryor, he just had no interest
Aaron fought the same way when he was an amateur.
Yeah the water bottle one. Great fight. And Arguello is one of my favourites too I like him much more than Pryor. Still the fight is a cracker.
Came here to say this...
No they were exactly the same actually just today we have technology that can stop u from looking bald. Mayweather actually started going bald in his early 30s and looked so patchy and bad that he had to shave it bald for many years. Then after he retired he got a hair transplant procedure. This is what a lot of men do today that are in the public spotlight. It could have a bald man looking like he has a full head of hair for the rest of their lives. Blows to the head and pituitary gland can cause premature balding as well so pretty common in boxing to lose ur hair faster than normal of ur genetically prone to baldness.
>forming a necessary base or core; **of central importance**.  Exactly. Your application of technique is significantly more important than how strictly you adhere to minor technical details.
The base level of skill has raised but the greats aren't as great as they were in the past.
Yes, for multiple infractions. The most notable was when removed the padding in Luis Resto's gloves before his bout with Billy Collins. He also soaked his wraps in plaster. The blows led to Collins' vision damage causing him to retire.   But he should have been banned for life along with Pryor for doping him during the fight(s). Had the commission had any balls, this would have occurred in '82 (first fight) before the Resto-Collins fight.
Yes
I've always wondered where this narrative come from that SRL didn't want to fight Pryor then.
Yeah, after having a whole day to think about it, the fight is absolutely a fantastic showcasing of the sweet science. Bummer about the outcome, but the dirty details are what catapult the fight from remarkable to legendary.
The top tier athletes go where the money and fame are.
They say that incident led to Collins death too…when he wrapped his car around a culvert by his house. A suspected suicide.
I think the narrative came from Pryor himself when he was pissed off at getting some lowball offers. It's all talk. Leonard wasn't avoiding anyone and as you said eventually upped the offer enough so that the contracts were signed then he fucked his eye up and retired. Pryor was always understandably annoyed at how underappreciated and underpaid he was compared to Leonard and Hearns and co. Pryor was 204-16 as an amateur but missed out on the Olympic team. Leonard won the gold medal and was already a superstar earning massive money from his debut while Pryor was unknown earning relatively fuck all.
Not to mention SRL fought an absolute murderers row. Doesn’t seem he was scared of anyone.
Exactly. Pryor obviously the villain of the story though and and Alexis showed what an absolute warrior he was. They both put on an epic performance though regardless of tainted water bottles.
During the weigh-in, Benny Paret was in high spirits, while Emile Griffith seemed somber. Griffith weighed in at 144 pounds, and Paret laughed at his weight. But things took a turn when Paret insulted Griffith and his sexuality in a high-pitched voice. In 1962, homosexuality was ridiculed and considered cowardly. However, Griffith was focused on becoming one of the world champions in boxing.  Griffith was about to step off the scales when he heard his trainer Gil Clancy shout: “Hey, watch it!” He wheeled round. A smirking Paret feigned intercourse with him as his trainers whooped hysterically. He waggled a finger at Griffith. “Hey maricón(homosexual in spanish),” Paret said in a cooing lisp, “I’m gonna get you and your husband.”  In the 12th round, Griffith landed two devastating right hands on Paret, causing him to stagger. Instead of letting Paret fall, Griffith continued to punish him with a series of sawing right uppercuts. Paret's weak arms could not protect his lolling head, which absorbed each of Griffith's punches with force. Griffith turned his body to add more power to each punch he threw, as if answering Paret's taunt of "maricón."  This moment was controversial and devastating, as Paret eventually died from the injuries he sustained in the ring. The incident brought attention to the issue of brutality in boxing and the taunting that happens between fighters.  Video Credit: @Combatsportsprodigy on YouTube
He landed 29 consecutive punches.
crazy part is that griffith wasn’t even a puncher.
I’ve never heard of gay or bisexual boxers, I remember asking why to one of my friends a while back, he responded that gays just aren’t manly enough in this kinda sport, for some dumb reason I believed that.
That was absolutely brutal to witness having gone to watch the actual fight footage. He was out cold a dozen punches before and he got hit with murderous intentions every single time. Legitimately felt like witnessing an exexution with boxing gloves, horrendous.
I was 11 years old watching that fight and got mad as hell  while screaming at the TV and ref to stop the fight. Paret was hung up on the ropes. As a kid I knew it should have been stopped.  I cried when he slumped to the canvas. I wanted Griffith to win but not like that. Horrible memory but still a big fight fan.
Song name?
Text book, talk shit, get hit.
Never heard of this before, despite it being morbid - thanks for posting, going to read up on it.
Emile Griffith was bisexual, not gay. Just a minimal clarification.
Tragic story, my apologies to Parets family. But does anyone know the song?
Back then you could get jumped or worse for being gay right? Its brutal but getting outed like that makes me not blame Griffith at all.
Song?
SONG NAME IS GALLOWDANCE BY LEBANON HANOVER
Very true, you can "play" tennis,golf, baseball etc...but guys don't" play" boxing, sometimes u die

Spoiler alert: Griffith was gay
Talk shit get hit
Wins by knock out and removes a violent bigot from society? I see this as an absolute win!
>“Hey maricón(homosexual in spanish),”  That's a nice way to translate that word to say the least.
Fascinating story. The context of what happened just prior to the fight really adds some perspective.
I recall reading that Griffith was in fact gay. Also this fight kind of ruined his career, as one might expect, it affected him a lot mentally.
The ref should never let that happen.
It was matchup where neither fighter really had a high KO% (and Griffith’s went down after that KO).  Also one sign as to how things have changed over the years: Paret was knocked out by Gene Fullmer 3 1/2 months before this fight and was 2-4 in his last 6 fights before his final fight. So even with everything specific to this fight, Paret might have been taking a bit of damage for the last 18 months of his life?
Yeah but he threw punches in BUNCHES!
I hate when people say ts it’s boxing every single one of em a puncher 🥸
https://thegrio.com/2015/11/05/philly-boxer-yusaf-mack-im-gay/
It's just way too scary to come out
I'm bi, hold on lemme get off my ass and go win somethin fr ya
[removed]
Wow that is crazy. I have watched this a number of times over the years as a reminder that these guys are putting their life on the line for us.   I really don't understand what the ref is doing even by the standards of the time though.

That and Motorsports… the biggest dangers around.  Oh and those crazy divers in wing suits
Yeah cause you deserve to die for calling someone gay in 1962? 😂
Wow! Gene Fullmer, almost  forgot about him. He was bad ass
To be fair on those 6 fights, all of them were to elite fighters. Denny Moyer, Federico Thomas, Gaspar Ortega, Emile Griffith (2x) and Gene Fullmer.  Mf got KOed to Griffith the first time, only to regain the  the titles to a SD win the next fight with Griffith.   And he looked good even when losing. Fuller had a rough time with him and so did Griffith so it's not like he seemed "washed" or "damaged goods".
Supposedly his loss to Fullmer was pretty brutal, and Fullmer contended that that fight led to the Griffith tragedy. Either way, where was the ref? Holy cow. Talk about a late stop.....
punches in bunches can do way more damage to your brain 🧠
Get fucked
You are Vermin
True that, my uncle boxed during that time and   taught me the rules of the sport and even I as a kid i knew when it should've been called. Use to watch boxing every weekend sponsored by Gillette.....lol.

Emile was quoted in a Sports Illustrated interview in 2005 as loving men and women "the same." That at least shows him on the bi spectrum.
He regularly hung out in gay bars. That's why Paret's comments were so triggering. He was threatening to out Emille in a hypermasculine sport. It was bad strategy on Paret's part, not to mention it's just wrong. He paid the ultimate price for that error. And no, I don't think he would have died had he done that. Emille was extremely motivated given what happened.
Thank you very much
Oh hell yeah, the wing suits...yikes!!
"I'm going to get you and your husband" sounds like a death threat. It's wrong that he passed away, but I'm definitely not sad about him
In the case of Paret/Griffith, the ref (Ruby Goldstein) went from being a top ref to refereeing one more fight and having PTSD as a result of this.
Imagine that, he should have did his job as a ref. They should have barred him after that fight. I need to stop, bringing up sad memories.
Goldstein’s story reminds me of Richard Green killing himself a few months after referring Mancini/Duk Koo Kim so the traumatic stress of watching someone die and questioning your role in that death is very real.
Duke Koo Kim death was nothing like Paret death....ref was not at fault on that one  but obviously to traumatic for him to handle.  Saw that fight live
I’ll be streaming it from somewhere if they don’t want to provide us with a PPV option
Not sure any aussie network has secured the rights to the fight as of yet but if it's PPV historically we have always gotten pretty good deals on PPV prices compared to the U.S which are usually higher with a dollar that goes further. This fight does have a huge casual appeal so going to a pub to watch it could be a great experience.. I remember going to a pub in Melbourne Central to watch pac v Bradley, place was filled to the fucking brim with filos, we were packed in like sardines. after the result got read out (which we all seemed to disagree with) the silence was incredible... You could hear a pin drop... Only to be broken by some American with a thick ass accent saying "Oh hell yeh Bradley won, let's get some drinks" how he got out alive il never know 😂
Being a boxing fan in Australia is annoying Ay
Embrace your cultural heritage as a (non-aboriginal) Aussie
Arrrrrrr matie...
Ok so i found something from 8 hours ago via fightmag Australia  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.fightmag.com.au/2023/04/05/gervonta-davis-media-workout-in-las-vegas-ahead-of-ryan-garcia-fight/%3famp  "In Australia, the event airs live on Sunday, April 23."  It mentions showtime and dazn, since Australia dosnt have showtime but does have dazn im assuming this publication means Australia can watch it via dazn?
Bro just go to your local pub
I think you need to settle down man it will be on main event kayo or dazn as I stated previously.
We get damn near every meaningful fight, it would be unlikely we dont get this one, its on 2 platforms how does Australia dodge that? Im wondering if kayo and dazn Australia are still bidding for broadcast rights ? I want dazn because its $13.99 vs kayo which will likely be around $70 , just my guess though
Kayo/mainevent usually does the pbc fights, but i already have dazn, im actually going to ring a pub and ask if they are showing the fight then ill find out who they are using because they will simply use the same platform as the average citizen, different distribution license but it would be the same platform available to anyone.
Pretty sure I saw it advertised on the dazn app a week or so ago . If not kayo ppv will definitely pick it up . I used to find fights on the fite TV app too , mainly top rank espn cards . Pretty cheap too . Pretty sure the Aj fight was $30 on kayo ppv last week but free on dazn .
It looks like DAZN is only streaming it in US, Canada, UK, Ireland
I thought it was on DAZN as well and I also have the subscription. This has happened a few times already with fights here that aren’t televised in Aus as part of that subscription. I’m wondering if it’s even worth it. Most the content on there are from fights nearly a year old
Hell if you can log in and check that would be nice, maybe a paid subscription displays the full content vs logging in without a paid subscription.
Well i dont think its worth the april subscription unless tank and ryan is on it, I only renew my subscription for specific fights that i want to see
Just checked no mention of it , but their schedule only goes 10 days or so . Fingers crossed
Thanks for checking, also can i ask, are you checking with a paid subscription?   Because i checked as well and i also see the schedule until the 20th though im unpaid, im wondering if users see different content when browsing the app paid vs unpaid  What's weird is that, you would think even if its not listed in the schedule it should be plastered all over the app considering how big the fight is, they would also want to entice users to see it and want to pay for it.
Jose Ramirez has always been an overrated draw and he did worse than Regis the irony. Regis didn’t have top rank pushing his event either. 140 has no big draws right now, great fighters tho
Jose is not a draw anymore, after he lost to Taylor and fighting nobodies people are losing interest
For comparison, [Jose Zepeda-Regis Prograis did a gate of $371k](https://twitter.com/jedigoodman/status/1602461471082164227) at Dignity Health Sports Park.  Jose Ramirez' manager, Rick Mirigian, says that sponsorship packages is the reason for the exempt passes or "comps."
Why so many comps? More than the amount of tickets that were sold. And how promoters normally go about giving out comps, are they given to local boxing clubs or?
Gave away over 9k in free tickets and didn’t generate more revenue than the Regis/Zepeda fight. Ramirez 🦆 head ass should’ve just fought Regis.
Unreal that’s the gate for an event 14k people attended. That’s like something you would see 40 years ago.
He's never been a draw. They've always given out a bunch of comps for his fights
Rick was losing his shit on twitter yesterday when people were calling him out on the poor sales, making up all kinds of nonsense. Dude is a clown.
You give a lot out to sponsors, and a lot for media contests, but thats max 500.  Then you looks at the sales numbers a week out and you're looking at a emoty stadium.  So then you call up local military bases, colleges and make a few high profile mass donations which also serve to hype the fight.  https://fscollegian.com/2023/03/ramirez-and-estrada-donate-1000-tickets-to-the-boys-and-girls-clubs-of-fresno-county/
I’m not saying he shouldn’t have but Ramirez has quite high guarantees which complicates things
He just needs to beat Fulton and MJ to achieve this correct?
Imagine how much he would be absolutely raking it in if he were a HW...
Yes.
Dude would be the real Takamura Mamoru if that was the case.
Underrated comment.
He needs to fight Jarell Miller so we all know who the real big baby is
They should look to set him up with Jermaine  He’s an in prime fighter who’s became a respectable name after Whyte and Joshua, if Anderson could stop him that’d be a massive statement
Leave Chisora alone
Definitely needs to raise his profile so fighting in the UK would be the right move or on big UK heavyweight card. For me is he ready for a Chisora or Josh Parker . Because he wins either or both of them and then he really gets himself into the mix .  He won't fight Fabio Wardley. Wardley is looking for domestic fights.  Dillian Whyte will have his last fight and payday against AJ  Joyce and Dubios are to far up the rankings and on world title challenger level.   Franklin would be interesting but also possibly a bit to dangerous at the moment
I think he goes the Deontay Wilder route, Wilder fought Harrison in the u.k I think, so soft touches like that until he's exposed
Assuming he beats Arias my next 3 fights, and this is a hot take:  1. Chisora 2. Charles Martin 3. Deontay Wilder.  He beats those guys (and he can as he gets more experience) he's a cert for a title shot early 2025.   Beating Martin and Wilder shows the US, who have been starving for a highly skillful HW since Holyfield, that he's the new sheriff in town and builds his fanbase there.  I think the US market will actually get behind him very quickly as they are aching for a big man with excellent skills.
Here are the reasons that I'm not a fan of Jared Anderson.   I feel like he's arrogant and I despise arrogance. Also, he wears this huge boxing skirt that just looks dumb. He makes loud, annoying noises when he punches. He stole his nickname (which is a silly nickname) from Jarrell Miller.
> maybe a British debut  I'd say he beats Wardley with relative ease, and it would elevate his profile a bit
I love how we could see a potential fight between two guys over who's the bigger baby. Stuff like this is why I love boxing.
The winner can be crowned King Baby
Miller gotta get his shit together
I'd prefer the Whyte fight for Anderson. It's not the best look beating a guy whose coming off back-to-back losses even if those losses were respectable.  Whyte if he wins that's a big statement, if he loses he doesn't lose as much credibility.
Jermaine is good af too. I think top rank is gonna marinate the fight when they both Top 10
>Josh Parker  Parker is elite, no way his promoter sets that fight at the moment
Martin could put up a decent fight, he's a much better boxer and brawler than Wilder is(as shown how he ragdolled Ortiz which neither Wilder or Ruiz could even come close to replicating despite Martin having been retired for 2 years and coming of a drug addiction). If Martin had a good chin(and wasn't KO'd in 2 rounds by AJ) he might have actually been a dominant champion.   That would genuinely be a good fight and win for Anderson.
There isn't much for either guy in that fight. Maybe it headlines a regular DAZN show, but it's not going to get much casual interest. Wardley would be better defending the British belt three times, Anderson if he wants to fight in the UK could do with a name like Chisora or Whyte.
When Wardley unlocks berserker mode it’s game over for Anderson
They are still babies cause of the tit sucking
The winner can be pre pubescent man
Top ten? No offense but Franklins best win is fat AF 40yo Rydell Booker and he now has two losses. Doubt he's gonna be top ten anytime soon unless he starts getting matched with cupcakes he can knock over.
I think Jermaine should go the Bridgerweight route tbh, he can easily cut down the weight and I think a fight with him and Babic will sell, with how Babic was claiming he battered Jermaine in sparring  lol
Don't think Parker is elite.  Think he very much a gatekeeper. Losing to Whyte and Joyce.
What, Marting fought Ortiz 5 years after he got koed by Wilder, when Ortiz was 42 and didn't have any legs left and still lost by KO. Wilder would do Martin just like he did Helenius.
Not much for Wardley, so it depends on his promoter wanting to feed him to Anderson. For Anderson it would mean beating the British champion, which would be a good narrative when he fights someone like Whyte.
I don't see Anderson letting him off the hook like Gorman did
I thought they were talking about Jeremiah Milton. Another top rank prospect
I was thinking about the wrong guy Lol. I thought he meant Jeremiah Milton
He barely lost to Whyte and some argue the headbutt was the deciding factor. Losing to Joyce was shit gameplan but Parker is not a gatekeeper that is ridiculous, if Parker is a gatekeeper then what is everyone else? If Parker is a gatekeeper, Wilder who has objectively got a lesser resume and is also a gatekeeper as just like Parker he's lost to every good opponent and also just like Parker looked like shit against a bunch of nobody's(Szpilka, Molina, Duhauapas etc), the only difference being Parkers best win is Ruiz and Wilders is Ortiz(which is worse).   Where's the hate for Parker coming from? I would bet that if he lost to Wilder in a unification when both were unbeaten world champions instead of Joshua, every American would be screaming how great of a fighter he was and saying "boogeyman this or that".
Ortiz was beating Wilder in their rematch, that was the same 2 years Martin was retired and on a drug binge. You really think Wilder would? He could, maybe. But then again he also took 9 rounds for both Molina and Szpilka who have chins made out crack and got demolished in 1-3 rounds by a ton of journeymen. Or Duhauapas, Wilder threw everything but the kitchen sink at that guy, couldn't drop him after 11 rounds. Same guy that Povetkin and others flattened in 1-6 rounds. Same story with the Washington fight, another brittle chinned fighter Wilder couldn't KO but was KO'd by others (including by Martin). So instead of taking the exception to what happens most of thr time like Helenius and look at it objectively, what happens most of the time? A standing stoppage, late in the fight at best against brittle opposition. What did Martin do to that same opposition? He did more damage and beat them up worse but got caught because he's also got a bad chin, but again looking at what happens more often than not, having a brittle chin against Wilders "famed almighty godlike power" doesn't matter all that much because you'll probably get stopped on your feet late in the fight and not get knocked out. That's the objective truth, the majority of Wilders title fights were not knockouts. Arreola, Stiverne 1, Ortiz 1, Duhauapaus, Fury 1, Washington etc. (Btw he only won 9 defences so that is the majority, the rest and minority of actual KO's being brittle low class fighters like Szpilka, Molina and Helenius doesn't prove otherwise at all).
I think Parker when ever he has had to step up to World Level  he had fallen short . Aj Whyte and Joyce all beating him. Hence why he a gatekeeper. He a gatekeeper to that top level. The Ruiz win was very close and if it was not on home soil could of gone differently. I like Parker but I do think he is starting to show wear and tear. Someone like Anderson definitely could fancy putting a former world champion on his resume.
Gatekeeper is someone like Chisora or Ortiz. Parker is not a gatekeeper as of yet.
Matchroom (UK/US)-DAZN  Golden Boy (US)-DAZN  Top Rank (US)-TSN  PBC (US)-Nobody picked up the rights for Showtime so we don’t have a broadcaster. So best way to watch them is to find a stream.

I P T V
TSN has some of the Top Rank stuff https://www.tsn.ca/showtime-and-top-rank-boxing-on-tsn-1.1249247  Not sure what other legal options there are, unfortunately. Could always see if there's anything on Youtube.   There's Fite.tv, but that's not exactly top-tier stuff (bareknuckle, boxing with MMA gloves, plus a bunch of pro wrestling from the US and Japan, etc.)  Sadly, we kinda get boned on a lot of this stuff.
PBC Only promotes on showtime for big fight but I think they show all other fights espn+ which you might have access to since you can already get DAZN but I could be wrong. If anything you can always try a VPN and choose difrent country as host server.
What soccer are you watching on dazn?? They dropped epl right?
Bell owns showtime rights so tsn airs some fights but not too many.
The lost the EPL but they still have Champions League.
Garcia is a really good fighter but I would put my money on Tank.  I'd still watch him fight Haney.
Rematch clause: no
Ryan will likely fight Haney at 147 in the future, not anytime soon
The duality and delusion of boxing fans - want super fights, but ridicule Young up and comers, pushing them selves to fight the best.  This is why we can’t have nice things.  I guess it’s no different than any other aspect of life not just boxing.
I would be fucking impressed if he survives Tank
Goddam
Maybe focus on the task at hand?
Wouldn't have to call him out if you used your mandatory position last year
Finish your breakfast first bruh
Not wise to even mention another name before dealing with Tank.
I appreciate the confidence and market appeal, but I’d worry about Tank before calling out someone next. I personally think Garcia *can* beat Tank, but I’ve got Tank winning that matchup 7 outta 10 times.
He been calling out Tank so much, maybe he sees something he can exploit? I would like his chances better if he was not gonna weight drained for the fight.
LMFAO. Oh wait he's serious?
If Haney schools loma I can see Ryan retracting his challenge
Bro you won the mandatory wbc position and straight up refused a title shot from Devin when he was punking you in the ring for a fight. Clown.
Ryan GOATCIA is going to win against tank. Can’t wait to watch the tank fan boys meltdown. Why is Ryan so hated ?
Call him out, then fight him 2 years later… maybe.
Betting on a Haney KO just because the universe is funny like that
I like Ryan’s confidence but his delusion is only way he beats any top guys. Props to him for stepping up and fighting but I don’t think he’s any good, hope he proves me wrong cause Tank needs to be humbled and Haney
Ryan just lost. Hes already looking past Tank. I put my life on it this mf is getting kod. Tank said Ryan is not a complete fighter. He has heart and determination of a young lion, there's just levels to this as cliche as that sounds.
He’ll whoop your ass!
That's The Dream, baby. Ya can't beat him, Kingry.
Right after what? The Rolly moment that awaits you… I am sure after your bell is rung you will be saying a lot of random things. Tik tok.
*Lomas left overs
I don’t believe it. It’s a miracle he has not pulled out of Tank’s fight yet.
Might as well get his losses out the way back to back at least he’ll get paid.
Tbh I’m not sure he is a really good fighter. While no fighter is perfect, I think he can be quite sloppy with his defence (lack of head movement and moving back in a straight line).  He’s obviously a very fast and powerful puncher though so I think this is definitely a fight where someone gets knocked out. I hope it’s Davis if I’m honest as he’s a piece of shit, even though I love his style of boxing.
there are super fight narratives and then there illusions  I dont see how Garcia wins against Tank, and i hate Tank, the hype around this fight feels manufactured   he is gonna lose and have to reset
I doubt he survives him, he definitely needs to be the one to hurt Tank.
If Haney schools loma, Ryan will call out Loma
But I don't think Ryan thinks he wins a decision against Haney. He probably believes he can hurt him now.
Why does Haney or Tank need to be humbled?
Who is your favorite fighter man cause every time I see your username it is some hating shit
Everyone acts like it's a sure thing but when you tell them to put down a big bet, crickets.
I just don't see Tank losing in anyway. At best Garcia has a solid plan early in the fight, but as we get to the later rounds we will start to witness the variation in levels between the fighters.  Tank by KO round 10.
Loma? The leftover of an Uber driver and an asthmatic kid ?
Tank is my favorite active fighter right now but I hope get gets knocked out by Ryan because of his behavior outside the ring. Also I like rooting for the underdog.
I think this sub obsesses too much over a boxer's technique. One of the best fighters of all time, George Foreman, or right now Inoue and benavidez and Figueroa etc all have many aspects that many would consider "poor technique" and clear weaknesses but their strengths are so massive compared to other fighters in their division that they completely cover up those weaknesses in the ring.   I think tank is a great fighter and he definitely might beat Ryan but Ryan's strengths can overwhelm fighters with much better technique. You can have all the skills in the world but if a hook or right hand hits you at light speed, there's not much you can do. I think the fight is more 50/50 or at least 60/40 than people give it credit. It matters more who performs on the day
So you're only really good if you have no weaknesses whatsoever? What about his strengths being better than most? I get that he has flaws which the top guys can and probably will expose but that doesn't mean he loses against all of them.
Aye one thing I realize Wilder's diehard fans is that all you need is the knockouts, no matter how it comes. To be a God like figure.
Boxing probably Edwin Valero cause he got me back into Boxing as a kid and became hardcore. All around fighting would be Fedor. Boxing now hmm cause I met Wilder before he was champ, I’d say Wilder cause I respect real fighters with true fighting spirit and knock people out. Wilder only good thing We’ve had in the US forever who delivers excitement.  If Haney and Shakur are face of Boxing then you might as well pack this corrupt sport up and toss it away. I’m a Joe Frazier guy too, I don’t like many new Boxers tbh, they all suck and have boring fights even Spence who I once liked.
When it happens I dont wanna hear nothing.
I’m a betting man get at me.
Only variation would be the effect of the weight draining clause. Big reason I don't like tank anymore inside the ring.
No. Tank is the one being active, Tank didn’t took a Sabbatical pulling out of fights. Let’s hope he is prepared
No he hasn’t….he could’ve fought Tank after the Luke fight but he pulled out of talks to chase a exhibition
Davis just has so many more miles of experience at this point. And he has very sneaky ring IQ, not even underrated at this point - very smart in the squared circle.
I always like rooting for the underdog just to see the chaos ensue lol
What's poor about Inoue's technique? Genuine question, the dude has always seemed flawless to me
Most people talk out of their ass on this website. Majority of these people have prob never trained boxing or at a high level. Or a competitive sport.
People in this sub or r/amateurboxing would say Joe Calzaghe lacked technique and should turn into his punches lol
I totally agree on it being 50/50 and depends who shows up. Garcia should also look the best we have ever seen him just from his age.   Tank also has more to lose in this fight too. If Garcia loses it will just be the learning experience of a 24 year old who isn't even in his prime yet. He doesn't become the face of boxing but it doesn't slow him down much. For Tank it will be losing in your absolute prime to a guy you have more skills than. There is just so much less to go back to the drawing board with for Tank.
Nice man my favorite fighters are Broner, Tank, Shakur, Bud Crawford, SRL, Demetrius Andrade, Floyd Mayweather all of whom you probably hate but I like flashy guys.   Anyways respect I thought u were just on some racist shit but youre cool👍🏽
It's an if, just like it's possible Ryan shocks people like you.
Experience, technique, speed, power. He’s a complete fighter.
Inoue is one of if not my favorite fighter rn but he has "weaknesses" or things that people say you can exploit. His defense is very much in his offense. When you watch his fights, he often stands right in front of his target and baits them because he knows he's faster and stronger and he can counter the shit out of them. His defense comes from his targets refusing to open up because every time they do he hits them back with knockout punches. That's not to say he isn't very technically sound but it's not a "complete" boxing style like you see with fighters like Canelo or Mayweather imo.   Inoue gets away with it because his strength (speed and power) far surpasses any other fighter near his weight class and it overwhelms opponents by forcing them to choose between opening up and getting knocked out or stayed closed and maybe surviving.   People who say Fulton has a decent chance in this fight are only thinking about the technical side of boxing and don't realize inoue's power and speed will far surpass any techniques
Lol always getting accused of being racist cause I dont like boring fighters or pieces of shit. I like Tank too btw,even though hes alittle shit head. I like tons of flashy guys, but they make you pay and beat your ass. Not run around jab and hold like Haney or those last 10 Shakur fights that pained me watching.  I wanted to like Shakur and Haney, i kept saying ill give em another chance since its on free ESPN and every time let me down so im done with the Pillow Boys
bruh, Ryan getting smoked 100%
Short arms and height where he was already getting punched down on at 130 lbs
I completely disagree with your assessment. Inoue, like say Gervonta Davis, will often stop being defensively responsible when he doesnt respect his opponent's offense. However, he has EXCELLENT defense when he feels the need to use it.  Inoue has amazing distance control up there with the likes of Shakur Stevenson and Dmitry Bivol, very elusive head movement, and beautiful lateral movement on the backfoot.   To boil his defense down to just being his offense makes me question how much of Inoue you've actually studied. His style is very much complete, he's one of the handful of complete fighters in the sport, that being a fighter who is able to fight at every distance and use every skill at a high level. Its interesting as one of your examples of a complete fighter, Canelo, is not complete at all. However, we may have a difference in terminology here.  That's why Fulton vs. Inoue, in my opinion, is the very best fight in Boxing. You rarely see two complete fighters go against each other these days.
Thanks for the great assessment! Appreciate it. So it's something that could potentially become an issue for Inoue as he moves up weight classes.
I'm sorry Bro, but that analysis of Inoue is really bad
Yea im not a huge fan of Haney I like his sparring clips more than his fights I think he’s cutting too much weight and that’s causing him to lose power and chin durability in the ring but who knows, we’ll see when he moves up. My guess is he’s walking around around 150 and just water cuts a ton instead of dieting down, leading to being dehydrated on fight night. Same with boots Ennis but that’s unrelated, used to be higher on him.   I don’t mind a “pillow fisted” guy as long as he can stand in the ring and do damage to a hard hitting guy without taking damage himself. I don’t like pillow fisted guys who choose pillow fisted opponents and sit there whacking each other for 12 rounds like a slomo amateur bout. That’s why I like Shakur and not so much Haney.
Im tryna tell em
Tyson was a small heavyweight. If you know how to fight your size, and you’re good enough, it doesn’t matter against most  Tyson gave up 10 inches in reach to Larry Holmes and absolutely starched him.   I understand Larry was a bit long in the tooth, but it still goes to show measurement are just measurements
Tank uses his height and short arms to his advantage actually. I don't think height and reach are super important if you know how to fight. Weight and age are far bigger physical factors.
How's Canelo not a complete fighter?
Definitely... I just don't think Fulton is the one to test it because he doesn't have impressive knockout power. A fighter with lots of power and heart to keep attacking through punches (think donaire 1) will make Inoue struggle imo. That being said, I hope he goes down as one of the greatest of all time
That's not a great assessment. Homie doesn't know what he talks about
Nah it isnt
I still think he beats Loma. Im actually a Loma and GGG hater, and u think ima racist lol. I rock with Usyk and Bivol though from that region. GGG is a fraud
kid has limited fundamentals, Tank schools him when it comes to pure boxing alone even without the power shots
If its just measurements, there wouldn't be weight divisions. It is certainly an advantage, otherwise Ryan Garcia who has the same height and reach as Mike Tyson wouldn't be 136 lbs.  You're just pointing out that reach isn't everything. Of course not, nobody's arguing that. Reach has an advantage to hitting the opponent before they hit you just like punching down has a leverage advantage that translates to greater power.
You can overcome it with skill but ideally a 'complete fighter' would have it all wouldn't they?
Complete, as I said, meaning being able to fight at all ranges and utilizing all boxing skills at a high level.   Canelo is insanely skilled but not complete. The most glaring example being lateral movement, a skill he lacks almost completely.   This doesn't make him a bad fighter in the least, many all time greats were incomplete fighters.
Fulton could test it with his wrestling. I don't think he will but you can be pillow fisted and still physically smother a faster stronger puncher like Fury did to Wilder. It's a lot harder with inoue's volume though
Yes it is. Inoue defense is world class. It's very similar to Bivol, as his defense comes from his feet, not his upper body movement. He always takes himself off centerline. And that's just a little snippet of what's wrong with that analysis. Inoue won the fight for the Japanese title because of that, not his offense. Watch that fight, it teaches you that
Hes too flat footed, doesn't move off the line that much. Against Luke, when Luke threw the straight left to the body, Ryan almost always moves his hand away from his face trying to block or parry the shot. The kid is getting kod. I never been so sure of a prediction in my life.
Unpopular opinion but Oscar and Mayweather has some bad blood between them.
James Butler. Sucker punched and KO’d the guy who beat him after the match (Which was a charity fight for 9/11). Was arrested and sent to prison. Murdered Max Kellerman’s brother shortly after getting released with whom he was living with after being released.
When Duran beat SRL the first time, he got into an argument with SRL's brother and knocked him out.
Recently, Fury vs Wilder 3.Though they did hug recently in Saudi Arabia, Wilder went on to say he hates Fury and only did it to not cause a commotion...
Jermell Charlo vs literally anyone
Barrera and morales, even now that they have a podcast together I feel like they still feel a bit of animosity towards one another.
Benn vs Eubank. At the time anyway. A lot of bad feeling there, especially from Nigel Benn..
Deontay Wilder recently said he hates Fury's guts. He has convinced himself that Fury cheated so I can't see them ever kissing and making up
Jermall Charlo vs Julian Williams  After Charlo knocked him out Julian came over to show his respect and Jermall said something along the lines of “get yo ass outta here before I knock yo ass out”. After getting a pep talk from his coach Charlo walked over to Julian but it still seemed hostile as Julian’s team and security had to hold him back. Charlo was boo’d heavily during the post in ring interview.
When Crawford fought Dierry Jean he called out him and his team even after a brutal stoppage win  https://youtu.be/WTwfCTXCix8
After knocking him out I believe  Lennox Lewis referred to Rahman as the “Has Been Rahman”
Wilder and Fury, Wilder definitely still holds a ton of resentment towards Fury.   He’s still going on about getting poisoned and Fury cheating TO THIS DAY
Everyone who fought Mayorga probably hated him.   Vargas and ODLH, Oscar tried to patch things up, but said Vargas just trash talked him the whole time they went out to dinner.
Lara despises Warrington.
I don’t think Frazier ever forgave Ali, for as many public make ups they had on tv
Holmes and Berbick
Broner vs Paulie
Loma and Teo.   Maybe Teofimo was somewhat embellishing in the buildup given that he appeared to mouth “I’m sorry” when the fight was immediately over, but he has since doubled down on most of his anti-Loma shit. Funniest part is how the Lopez’s tried to be all “what? Loma’s not bad because he lost to us!” when they were the ones saying for a year that Loma sucked and was overrated. Plus they perceived likely cultural demeanor differences from Loma in those random encounters as arrogance.   On Loma’s part, he refuses to give Teo any credit for just being the better man that night. He is a sore loser. Had he been classier and accepted defeat, Teo might’ve been more apt to give him a rematch.   I almost want to see a grudge rematch, maybe at a catch weight, if Loma beats Haney. The buildup was fun and the fight was good, would love to see it again
[Doesn't get much worse than this.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=BI3D7h5yxOs)
Mayweather vs canelo 🤣🤣🤣. In recent times it’s died down coz mayweather ain’t been on tv as much
Canelo v Golovkin 1 and 2, especially 1
Barrera morales
Oscar has bad blood with everyone. Lmao
That’s more evil than hate. Disagreeing with the decision and knocking dude out on Friday Night Fights was a ho move, but we don’t know his relationship with buddy before the fight.
Such an insane story - that sucker right was deathly
just looked up about James Butler, it was actually 17 years ago today that he was sentenced to 29 years
If i recall he was bipolar, Sam And Max were his champions, amd trying to get him help, and he just snapped.
>Murdered Max Kellerman’s brother shortly after getting released with whom he was living with after being released.  Sad, but how fucking stupid and naive are the Kellermans to live with this guy?
Is there footage
Yes but it's one sided. Fury doesn't really care about wilder, but wilder really hates fury.
I mean he probably made more from each individual Fury fight than any other of his career — he knows what’s good for him.
He hates him with his whole being
I don't honestly believe that.I feel like Wilder is probably just playing up the villain drama.
Benn comes across as a bitter idiot IMO, and the recent farce with his son didn't surprise me at all. There's a funny bit in Eubank's autobiography about how years after they both retired, Eubank and Benn were competing on some cheesy tv show like gladiators or something. Even though it meant nothing, Benn was taking it ultra-seriously as he thought it would make them even if he won. Eubank just laughed at him.
Underrated win as well.
Joe Frazier also hated Ali for a long time after their fights, for all the awful things Ali said about him and how betrayed him. They eventually made up shortly before Frazier died of cancer.
Wilder makes me laugh. He is as thick as a brick and completely delusional, but I'm glad he's around because how entertaining he is
Understandably so.
It’s probably complicated. Frazier loved Ali before those fights, and probably came back to that when the fights were over without directly forgiving him for his antics. Friendship/brotherhood is already complicated enough when it doesn’t include punching each other in the head
“Larry Holmes was kicking and punching me!”
Lol Broner really got to Paulie but I think they’re cool now broner said it in an interview.   The broner-Paulie press conference was hilarious.
[This one was bad too (both the ridiculous stoppage and what followed).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb6-Wp2Xhlc)
Oh, and then he later killed Max Kellerman's brother. Almost forgot that part.
Canelo was his boy and he tried to fuck him out of his money, look at how he talks about him now  He’ll be at it with Ryan soon enough
I got beef with Oscar. He ruined The Ring Magazine
I think so. It was mentioned in an episode by the Modern Martial Artist on their first fight, and I think he showed it, but the ring was quite chaotic.
Fury must have some annoyance that Wilder gave him the only blemish to his otherwise perfect record...  I do think Fury did enough to win their first fight. Unlucky not to get the decision.
It's not one sided. Fury's father was just recently trashing wilder.
No, he is for sure not.  You could see when they hugged it was like two exs that ran into each other at the store. The fake hug and then they basically said almost nothing to each other.   With the amount of trash talking Fury does I am not sure it can be any other way after 3 fights.
Eubank Jr V Benn Jr was always going to be a farce for publicity.  As for the fathers, I remember vaguely the TV show you mention. Benn did physically push Eubank at one point (but Eubank didn't respond). Their rivalry was one of the best ever. Shame they never had a 3rd fight.
Agree, he hasn’t captured the magic from that performance since. Plateau’d.
>Friendship/brotherhood is already complicated enough when it doesn’t include punching each other in the head  I will never know how some boxers are friends with their former opponents?!!
I think that's the first time I've seen someone get counted out while standing on their feet with their hands up. The hell was that? I'd be pissed too. Definitely not attempted murder on the referee level pissed, but still pissed nonetheless.
I don’t want to say the ref deserved that but… 🤨
Haha, Blue just runs out the ring like "not my problem".
He obviously suffered from cte
Oscar gets credit for coddling canelo early in his career
He was already at it with Ryan a couple of years ago. But he somehow convinced Ryan to stay with GB.
I'm sure fury genuinely dislikes wilder. Both for the reason you're saying, and because who wouldn't after all the crap he's spewed? But it's obvious that wilder is really hung up on it whereas fury isn't.
Of course it's one sided, compared to how personally wilder takes it, fury doesn't give a fuck. He may not like him but he obviously doesn't care nearly as much as wilder does
Yeah, Wilder isn't BS'ing. He genuinely dislikes Tyson for all the trash talking in the run-up to the 2nd and 3rd fights because he felt like he gave Tyson a lifeline in the 1st when he was coming back up.   Tyson holds no grudges with Wilder, though. He absolutely sees all the talk as normal fight promoting tactics.
Derevchenko was a great win
He got a lot of criticism for running away, with one boxing article calling it "the ultimate act of cowardice", but I don't know what he should have done? Had he tried to calm his opponent down - or physically restrain him - he could have made things a whole lot worse...  Though, after the referee handed him the victory, Blue kind of owed it to the ref to save him.  Red - and his team - got banned for life. A bit harsh on his team, who were not to blame in any way.
The fact that Fury's father just went off on a wilder tirade in an interview just a few days ago suggests that there's more bad blood then meets the eye.
What was Wilder expecting? Did he see any of the buildup to the fight with Klitschko?  Fury bullied, disrespected, and was a genuine asshole to Wlad. Then apologized after the fight was over. All part of the game - he got balls deep in Wlad’s head and it worked. And it worked against Wilder too, especially in the second and third fights.
I think the best course would have been to attempt to restrain his opponent, even if that meant a possible altercation between them. The guy was damn near ready to kill the ref.   That being said, I wouldn't trash him for panicking in the moment and running away. It's just a funny visual.
Lol fury's dad also had way more bad blood with James Paul than tommy... He is just very passionate in his hate. And yes of course there's legit bad blood, as was said already wilder fucked fury's record, and constantly called him a cheat etc. Of course he doesn't like him. Even if he hates him though, wilders actions make it obvious that fury is like the first thing he thinks of in the morning and the last thing he thinks of at night. He's obsessed...
Lovely list, Locche Fuji is a great fight

You say in the Canelo vs Bivol comments that Canelo was trying to win a title in his fifth division, but that isn't true. Canelo had already won the WBO title at 175 previously by knocking out Kovalev, and that was his 4th weight class (154, 160, 168, 175).

Unlike his father's fight, Sergio Martínez was able to survive and win an easy decision.  [**2013.11.23**; Carl Froch © vs. George Groves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WrVHmfdES0) - Carl Froch is down for only the 2nd time in his career and comes back to score a controversial knockout.

Why is the post removed?
Your comment is duly noted.
Just want to +1 gatti-ward. I still go back and watch the entire fight once or twice a year. It honestly gets better with age and with each new viewing. It is absolutely in my opinion the greatest fight I’ve ever seen. I’m jealous of anyone that gets to see it for the first time, but like I said it gets even better with age somehow.   No flashy shorts. No shit talking. No grand ring entrances with entourages. No flash. No frills. No hugging and clinching every two seconds. The last truly great throwback fight ever. Two absolute fucking warriors leaving it all in the ring. RIP Arturo. RIP Emmanuel.   I would absolutely kill to see another person like Mickey Ward come along and shake things up in boxing. A true blue collar nobody with an iron chin, heart of a lion, and the kind of left hook you just can’t teach a person.
I have made the appropriate corrections.
great list, but may I suggest Crawford vs Postol? One of the greatest display of skill in a fight in that decade
Those are comments from the original poster, /u/PepperJohn, but they've deleted their account, so you can't ask them.
I have no idea, but this is the second time I made this post, because the first time was also removed.
I asked, and this is the response I got;  "Not completely sure, but I believe one of our mods removed it because your updates weren't really that significant and your additions were a bit lame."
Never liked that fight or understood the Allure from it. There’s no real technique from the fighters they really just are tough. JMM Vs Pac-Man 4 is a good example of step back toe to toe. So much skill and technique presented there
Cool. Shame the post was removed
How fucking rude!
That obviously isn’t true, otherwise any “tough” person could become a professional boxer.
I have no idea why it was, and as it's the second time that's happened, I'm not sure about whether to try for a third time.
A lot of the videos linked to in /u/PepperJohn's post were no longer available. The post needed updating. Yet, for whatever reason, someone disagrees.
Just an opinion
damn it i saved your post so i can come back to it. these mods can be dumb sometimes..no harm leaving it
I get what you’re saying. I think it’s just disingenuous to casually say there’s no skill involved.   I love Pac-Marquez 4, as long as it lasted. I like brutal ugly slugfests as much as I love chess matches.
I've posted it on my profile page as well.
This post has been put back up. I just hope its visibility hasn't been hurt.
awesome thank you
Benavidez, Canelo, snd Morrell all need to fight eachother!
Bro, get more fights. Don’t fight Benavidez yet. There has to be a step between Yerbossinully and fucking Benavidez.
WBA "regular" super middleweight champion David Morrell will be looking to make a statement on April 22, when he makes a voluntary defense against Sena Agbeko as part of the Showtime Pay-Per-View undercard to the lightweight collision between Gervonta “Tank” Davis and "King” Ryan Garcia.      The event will take place at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.      Morrell (8-0, 7 KOs) is coming off a bruising stoppage win over previously unbeaten mandatory challenger Aidos Yerbossynuly in November.       Should he win, Morrell wants to secure a crack at the WBC's interim-champion, David Benavidez, at the end of the year.   “I’m very excited to be the co-main event of this incredible night for boxing,” said Morrell.   “’Tank’ Davis is one of the sport’s biggest superstars and my aspiration is to one day be on the Mount Rushmore of boxing next to him. On April 22 I’m going to dispatch my opponent in sensational fashion. And after this fight I want the ‘Mexican Monster’ David Benavidez, but first I have to get past a tough and very capable opponent in Agbeko. I intend to take care of my business on April 22 and then look forward to taking on David Benavidez in a fight that the fans want to see.”    Agbeko (27-2, 21 KOs) has been on a nice run of wins, after having his hand raised in his last four contests and 12 of his last 13. He picked up a unanimous decision over the previously unbeaten Isaiah Steen last October on ShoBox.   “I’m very thankful to my entire team for this incredible opportunity to fight for the title,” said Agbeko.     “This is a stern test against one of the best super middleweights in the world in the co-main event of the biggest fight of the year. This is an opportunity that I relish greatly and is exactly how I envisioned winning the belt. I’ve had a long journey to get to this point, but I’ve always trained like a guy with a target on my back. I want to win the belt and be the fighter that everyone is going after. I have a great team behind me and I can’t wait to properly introduce myself to the boxing world on April 22.”
Please feed Andrade to Morrell. I need to see him lose.
After being the Co-Main on the most watched fight in boxing, PBC will be eager to make Morrell’s return vs Benavidez or Andrade this Fall
Yes, Morrell you will dominate that guy and I hope you face Benavidez so that you can dominate him too!
Ghost writer shit right there. I’m sure he’s a smart guy but how many guys his age would use the word relish?  Gtfo lol
Throw all 3 in the ring for a battle royale!
[And don’t forget Andrade!](https://youtu.be/00bTqNJyGS0)
Guarantee they’ll fight each other before Crawford, Spence and Thurman do.
Morrell has 8 fights against Tomato cans and y’all putting him in Benavidez circle? Where was this energy when David was stopping everyone in front of him and y’all said he hadn’t earned a Canelo fight?
Canela would rather fight Brits than Mexicans and Cubans.
Morrell has 8 fights against Tomato cans and y’all putting him in Benavidez circle? Where was this energy when David was stopping everyone in front of him and y’all said he hadn’t earned a Canelo fight?
Nah he has a “belt” and he and his team keep running their mouth about Benavidez for over a year. Let him find out.
I thought we wanted "the best" fighting "the best"?
We gotta put these young guys to the fire sometimes....let them be great or be graceful in failure
Wtf are you Al Haymon. Your attitude is what's wrong with boxing. More fights? He's 25 which is his prime. If he's not ready now he will never be ready.
Yeah but it’s good to have guys like this calling out top dogs. The hunger is good to see. I feel with the eye test, he’d put up a fight against Benavidez. Morrell is big asf aswell and might be weighing more on fight night then Benavidez himself. He’ll surely need 3 wins at least before getting a chance at David
"On the Mt Rushmore of boxing with Tank" 😂😂😂😂  Tank isn't even in the Great Yarmouth Pier Waxworks museum of boxing.
Slept would be better, but lose is good too
I'm sure Morrell will see this.
Specially the fact he doesn’t even speak English. There is not a single interview out there where he says a perfect English sentence
We already saw a 2 v 1 with Bayless and Plant vs Benavidez, a triple threat match doesn’t seem that far fetched anymore lol
Benevidez's dad mentioned they have a 3 fight deal offer that includes Andrade. Idk how much of it is real. I guess we will see.
This is such a stupid opinion. Canelo picks guys based on rankings or belts not nationality. I think Benavidez beats him when they eventually fight but to say he’s been ducking is asinine.   To top of off you have a Bronco Lara flair who’s been smashing Brits left and right 🤦🏻‍♂️
I've been saying Benavidez is the best super middleweight for years....
I do, but like why derail a guy who doesn’t even have 10 fights yet? I like Jared Anderson too but I don’t want to see him against Joe Joyce yet.
Solid point. I’d just rather see him against like a Berlanga or Dirrel first. That’s a bigggg step to Benavidez. lol
Not everyone’s progression is the same. Morrell just isn’t where he needs to be to challenge someone like Benavidez right now; but if his team wants to throw him in deep waters immediately they’ll find out fast if he can sink or swim.
Whose prime is at 25 these days? What is he a Jr. Flyweight? Okay, take Joe Joyce for an example. He only entered pro in his mid 30s. According to you he should have fought for the title in his debut. Now he has taken a slow progression of great fighters (Dubois-Parker-Zhang) and could legitimately contend either champion at 36. He would have just got beat out the gate if he fought fury in his 4th fight, and he and we as an audience would be robbed of the opportunity to see him be great against great opposition. Cause he would have lost his shot.
I give the attitude of Morrell 10/10. For sure. I’m good with 3 fights! That sounds right.
Lol
Me, too.
He's 25, he's not that young.  Tyson was champ at 22, and more recently Canelo was challenging Floyd at 23. I don't have a problem with it.
He wouldn't gain anything by fighting those guys. At this stage of his career those are easy wins for him.
Let's find out.
Inoue was already a multi weight champ by 25, Broner was also a multi weight Champ by 25. Canelo was already a champ by 25. Bam Rodriguez is 23 and already a champ. Benavidez is only 26. It's not that guys aren't in there prime at 25 it's that promoters won't let the big name fighters get an opportunity. Boots should of already had a title shot. It's funny thinking that a 25 year old is too green to fight a 26 year old. Morell only has 9 fights but he went 130-2 in the highly competitive Cuban amateur system. If he loses it's not because he's not ready it's because Benavidez is just better.
Deep down the Morrell is inside us all along and that’s all that matters
“At this level of his career” My guy, he’s 9-0 against cadavers. He’s never fought anyone even remotely on their level yet. Nobody who ever has had the ability to hurt him. Nobody who has ever had a big win (though whether Berlanga has is also debatable, but at least they’re in the same place career-wise).
Question: at 25 what was Canelo’s record? At 26 what is Benavidez’s record, at 25 what was Broner’s record? Also I mentioned Jr Flyweight and then you came back with a Jr Flyweight. Hahahaha. Yes, lower weight classes hit prime earlier.   You use this response to a comment I used comparing him to JOE JOYCE, who is TEN YEARS OLDER. It is not age. It’s experience. Reread my fucking comment.
He' went 130-2 as a amateur. Won the best boxer award at the 2017 Cuban national championship. His amateur experience is worth alot . Those Cuban amateur fights are at a much higher level then you think. He's soon all styles and is much more experienced then you realize.
The record doesn't mean shit. Does it really matter that Canelo was 40-0 vs 40 can drivers? The first 20 or so fights for most guys are a waste of time. Your right it's not age it's experience, Morell has massive amateur experience which allows him to skip the filler fights. He doesn't need to beat up 30 cans. He's shown he can go 12 rounds and it's time for him to fight the best.
Oleksander Usyk, who arguably had the greatest amateur career in the history of boxing, and was like 6 years older or something, waited till 10 fights before fighting an opponent of this level.
I reckon Triller should set this up in 2023 and we find out.  &#x200B;  It can be like the sequel of Holyfield vs Belfort
We'll never know because even if they were born in the same era, Fury will never fight Foreman.
How do you figure Wylder is a heavier hitter than Foreman? Granted, Wylder hits like a truck with a signature punch. Foreman simply hits like a train with every one of his punches, watch footage of his training on a heavy bag.....virtually no one hit as hard as Foreman, maybe aside from Ernie Shavers.
If you ignore differences between eras I'd say the more recent athlete has a bigger advantage than you'd assume they have.
Foreman with a head flying into the crowd in Round 9.
Fury beat two of my top 5 rated heavyweight punchers of all time on the road, and George got beat by the 2 most skilled pure boxers he faced in the 70's.   More importantly than that, however, is this: Tyson is on a lot of people's shit lists and it's cathartic to put him in against one of the most beloved champs of all time so we can picture him getting his block knocked off. What the hell good is a fantasy fight if you can't pick a happy ending for yourself?  Foreman ko5
Foreman (like Fury) is one of the most talented HWs in boxing history.  Good balance, versatile offensive arsenal, strong chin, power in both hands and ring cutting skills, no offence to Wilder but Foreman is on a different level imho.  >foremans shaky stamina  Fury can move that well for 12 rounds at 120kg because we have better training/nutrition and because we have more/better peds, Foreman's stamina isn't that bad, he suffered a heatstroke against Young iirc.  There's also the referee, a lot of Fury's "dirty boxing" could get penalized.  Foreman with modern training, diet and peds against Fury would be a very competitive fight, Foreman can probably stop him.  Fury with 70s training and no peds? Uhh? That would be interesting.  Same goes for Joshua (and a lot of modern HWs) , he's a good fighter ofc, but most of his physicality is a result of modern peds/diet/training etc...
Have to take which version of George Foreman into consideration for this match up.  Foreman's shaky stamina was ironically a problem during his youth. Old Foreman interestingly had seemingly unlimited stamina. Honestly, I think Fury beats Young Foreman.   Old Foreman though, is a much more interesting prospect: more defensively sound, focused, and still hits like the devil. He is mad strong and could probably handle Fury's rough housing and give it right back. If Fury decided to take the fight to Foreman, he'd be in dangerous territory because that's where Foreman excels, so I'd put that down as a 50-50 match up. Overall though, I think Fury's height and reach would allow him to outbox Foreman, so realistically, if they fought, Fury would beat Old Foreman by decision.
Foreman was able to chase Ali into a corner and ali had better footwork than fury. Which resulted to ali having to rely on the rope-a-dope strategy or otherwise he would be exhausted from running so much in the later rounds.  Which means fury would not be likely to outrun foreman the entire time. Would be a great fight.
See, I don't think Wilder's a harder puncher than Foreman. Wilder just explodes when he throws his shots, he's throwing everything he's got. And a man his size throwing punches the way he throws, I'd be more surprised if he didn't knock people out.  Foreman however, (specially in his comeback) seems like he's throwing arm punches, but when they land people just crumble. The amount of power and impact he generates with the very little wind up he does is crazy to me.
Inb4 Fury wins by clinching and holding Foreman to death like Ali did.
Unpopular opinion but Fury outboxes George
for some reason i believe 90’s Foreman would do better than 70’s Foreman
It's highly unlikely Tyson Fury could have beaten a prime George Foreman. Change my mind.  Firstly, I'm NOT looking for low effort nonsense from kids who think idolizing a new-school fighter somehow looks cool - if that's their only criterion for supporting Fury, there's other places for that. Not welcome here.  Don't ask me questions in your replies either. Those are a sign you're actually wanting education - if that's what you want, find it elsewhere.  What I'm looking for are convincing, even compelling cases that overcome the 4 decade difference in the comparison of the two very different men's performances against very different opponent groups, and conclude that Fury would have defeated prime Foreman.  We will assume, for the purposes of a cross-time matchup, that somehow each man knows about the other's style.  You may also assume NEITHER fighter knows about the other, but no comparisons with one-sided knowledge.  Good, meaty analyses from Boxing pundits will be warmly welcomed and definitely engaged.
Id want Foreman to win, but I doubt he would.  Riddick Bowe vs Fury would be good.
I think it's a bad move to just assume that the past greats are better than the current crop. That said, I really want to believe that Foreman would knock the hell out of Fury. While Fury is huge, I do think Foreman was strong enough and technically sound enough that he'd be able to quickly push his way out of Fury's clench/lean and uppercut him on the break.
Fury ends up frustrated and bites his ear.
Fury absolutely annihilates him in a masterclass, George was far too immobile to close the distance on Fury and he was so bad defensively that Fury could load up all his power into a shot that would KO him cold.  Fury hits very hard, guys like Wilder are not easy to catch clean but anyone could land on Foreman.  It would be a lot like the Whyte fight.
Fury is basically 70s Ali. Watch Rumble in The Jungle-- that's basically how Fury fights: clinch, one-two, clinch, quick combo, roughhousing, a little elbow, head holding. I usually favor old school fighters, but stylistically I'd go with Fury for this one
Fat George Vs Fat Fury is a more interesting comparison
Depends on what era of Fury and depends on what era of Foreman too
Foreman’s main threat was that he was big, heavy, strong, & had power. He’s significantly smaller than Fury & pretty much any of the big boys at heavyweight now so I think he’d struggle to find success in the same way.
Fury is a super heavyweight. It’s almost unfair to compare super heavy with heavys of the past
Foreman knocks the bum out early. u/boraboca cries hysterically ringside
Fury is just another guy to foreman. George corners him and crushes him relatively early on. No more than 7 rounds.
Didn't Foreman knock guys out by just tapping their chin? Yea Fury stands no chance
I say Fury by decision maybe even late KO if Foreman gases.   Fury would have a huge size advantage and so wouldn't be bullied by Foreman really and His defense is sound enough to were Foreman will struggle to catch him clean.   As some have already stated though, Fury probably wouldn't even fight Foreman for one reason or another.
How do you become a professional 70s boxing era fan, and how much do you make a month? I would love to become one as well.
This fight would never actually be made so no point in the debate imo.
If a crude guy like Wilder with nothing other than a right can come within a second of knocking Fury out I fail to see how Foreman doesn’t get a ko.
If I had to bet I'd say Fury. His boxing iq and movement is too good plus he's bigger than George and couldn't be bullied by him. Add his chin/ability to recover and I've got Fury by 15 round UD.
Fury would beat Foreman whether this sub would like to admit it or not. He would be like a matador against George!
Tyson fury would need a weapon to beat foreman lol there’s no way he could stop foreman from knocking him out. Foreman hits harder than wilder.
Prime Foreman?  He was a certified menace, and tbh, I couldn’t really favor anyone against him (not saying he’s unbeatable, but I don’t really favor anyone over him). Olympic pedigree and experience vs some of the ATGs. Fury is quite good, but this is silly. There’s a reason Ali didn’t rematch George.
I love George Foreman but I don’t rate him highly as a H2H fighter. I could see him bombing out Tyson because of the style and Lewis because I don’t rate him against top punchers. All the pure boxers who can move well would be too much for George imo. Unfortunately Fury is quite good at this sport and I think it would be an uphill task for Foreman. Fury UD.
So you’re not knocking him out…Fury ain’t knocking Foreman out. No one ever knocked Foreman out except Ali(the greatest fighter of all time) and he was honestly lucky to have it all come together the way it did. Big George in his prime eats Fury’s shots and stalks him down…hurts him several times before it’s all over. He beat Joe Frazier, he beat Ken Norton, he beat Ron Lyle, he beat Michael Moorer at like 60 years old…lol.  Look back at his fight with Evander…even though it was a loss…he eat soooo many brutal shots in that fight and just kept coming….Tyson fury is dead tired after nine rounds…knocked down several times…and simply doesn’t have the energy or the heart to get back up…that’s how it would go
I lean towards Fury but George’s sheer power and indestructibility are always an x-factor.
Fury would beat him even though he’s a fucking cornball
George Foreman is something like 75 and hasn't boxed in decades, but I'd still say Foreman by late KO.
https://www.thefightcity.com/george-foreman-ezra-boxing/  Solid argument for why George Foreman, while a great fighter, is broadly overrated in terms of all time rankings.
I would pick Tyson fury over any opponent you picked in the history of the sport lol just don’t get how a big fat flabby man can be so fast and agile and have so much gas in the tank…he’s a walking talking contradiction lol but god damn is he talented and entertaining… dude can’t sing for shit but I can’t wait for his after fight melody 🎵
Only Tyson Fury can beat Tyson Fury
Foreman would do us all a favor and erase Nandro Fury from this actuality.
George Foreman is a top 5 atg. Fury isnt even in that league.
Foreman wrecks him all day. Probably a better contest with 40 year old foreman than pre-Ali Foreman.
>george foreman, though a little less powerful of a hitter than deontay  Is he? From where I'm standing Deontay has fought a grand total of one top tier fighter, he's fought him three times and has a knockout ratio of 0%  Foreman on the other hand sparked out Ron Lyle! Not impressed? He sparked out Ken Norton! Not impressed? He sparked out Smokin' Joe Frazier!
90s HW champ beats fury. Put some respect on Foremans name .
Tyson fury looks great against big slow heavyweights but foreman was superb at cutting off the ring. Foreman by KO within 8 rounds
That would be a good fight. I think Foreman gets him with the body shots.
Foreman was too wild in the 70s and got too much weight.
So Tyson Fury v. Chuck Wepner 3?  3 months of Fury v. Foreman negotiations.  Fall apart.  Fury then announces his real plan all along.  A TRILOGY FINALE with Wepner.
George could be outboxed and I haven't looked at his record closely enough to see how his KO percentage faired above 215lbs so I would have to lean Fury peak for peak due to Furys speed and elusiveness and George being the same height and weight as Usyk.
Lewis smokes fury
It's probably the only fight Fury will take at the moment.
I'd give the old foreman a better chance than the young one. The young one was a destroyer but he was outdone by movement. The old foreman was seriously wily and patient. I could see him sneaking the right in behind a lazy jab like he dis against moorer.  Would be a cracking fight.
>george foreman, though a little less powerful of a hitter than deontay,  I wonder if this is really true.   That said, in addition to the power element, Foreman was a much better boxer than Wilder and a much better chin. That's gonna be a very hard night for Fury.  Going with Foreman.
I can’t wait for Fury to lose just once so people stop thinking he’s invincible in H2H discussions.
Fury will just say” George is a little shithouse he didn’t accept the 3% purse” and go fight a bum.
George would win by default, Fury would dodge him..
I forgot all about Triller lol
Masvidal Productions is where it’s at now
Oh man, don’t remind me of Holyfield Belfort.
Big George is running scared! The big dosser! We offered him 5% of the purse and he ran away scared like a shithouse dosser!!  Getuppppppppp
Why fight prime Foreman, when you could instead use that time machine to have infinite Chisora fights ?
>We'll never know because even if they were born in the same era, Fury will never fight Foreman.  Are you kidding? Fury would absolutely fight him, as long as Foreman agreed to -20% of the purse with Fury getting 120%, and the fight taking place not just in England but in Fury's dad's backyard. Of course, if Foreman agreed to those terms, you couldn't blame Fury's team for pulling out and blaming it on his trainer.
Would demand a 100/0 split. And that his old man be assigned as referee.
Goddamn, this comment was good.
Yeah, he's way too risk averse right now to consider taking a fight with someone like Foreman tbh
I love that this is the top rated comment. It's funny cos it's true. Tyson Fraudy.
I’m not sure how you can say a guy that fought Wilder 3 times and Klitschko is scared to fight anybody, that makes no sense.
Foreman knocked down Frazier multiple times in the first round of both their fights. I don't think Wilder has anything that good on his record
Exactly, also I could see Foreman KOing every single opponent Wilder has had as well.
Shavers KO percentage dropped off fast with guys over 215lbs.
I remember Ali said Liston hit harder than Foreman. I think Wladimir Klitschko had a similar level of power too, imo.
Meh it’s more Foreman has power in both hands and will land his shots more often. But I think it’s undeniable that Wilder right hand has more power. There was a good thread on it actually where they compared all the big right hands in HW history using what the fighters said. I believe Wilder was concluded to have the best power.
I love Foreman but this is Golden Age thinking at its finest. Yes, Foreman hit incredibly hard but Wilder clearly hits harder, faster, and with more snap on his punch. Boxers from 50 years ago are not as strong today. Someone made an ill-advised quip about Wilder below (FreeSpeech bloke). Any reasonable person, and physician, would be able to tell you that Ortiz and just about any other man in their 30s - early 40s will have the benefit of better strength training, conditioning, nutrition, and technical training to torch most fighters from the golden years.  On the training footage, Mike Tyson looks incredibly more lethal than Foreman. Foreman was an ATG but because of the Ali-era, he's been elevated to some mythical status as though 50 years later, elite athletes somehow can't hang with him.  The better question that will never be answered is, what would happen if you gave both fighters equal access to the training and knowledge of 2023? But again, we can't measure that because what you saw of Foreman and Ali is limited by how things were done in their day. This is why eras can't be compared fairly, but if we were to say in most sports, who's the best--it's the current greatest since they've benefitted the most from exercise science, training, and nutrition.
Wilder hits equally or close to as hard to Wladimir Klitschko according to sparring partners  Who hits hiarder then old George foreman. So we are least know wilder hits harder then old George foreman
Wilder is the hardest puncher of all time stop it buddy
*Wilder
Exactly. People hate hearing that though. Wilder, Fury, and Usyk would beat Ali, Frazier, and Foreman. People seriously don't understand the benefits that modern athletes have in terms of exercise, nutrition, sports science, recovery, supplements, and training. Lots of golden age thinking and nostalgia in this thread.
His own, somehow
If Wlad only threw a punch until the 12th round and when he did it shook Fury to the core. Rewatch round 12, That’s why Wlad was confident in a rematch that Fury pulled out of a few times.
They had steroids in the 70s
>with modern training, diet and peds  could you imagine Ali with that shit? OMFG
Fury is one of the most talented heavyweights in history?   Honestly wanna hear what mental gymnastics you have to get there.
But Ali was 4” and 60lbs smaller than Fury
Chasing is harder when you’re eating jabs though
But also look at the height and weight that Foreman landed on, compared to the height and weight of Wilder's opponents. The heavyweights today are way bigger, stronger, and taller. Most heavyweights of the 60s and 70s might, maybe, be a cruiserweight at best. And that's taking away the dense muscle/strength/skeletal development, speed, and technical prowess that modern boxers have. All things being equal, Foreman comes off second best to Wilder and likely not even in the top 10 of the elite heavweights of the past 20 years.
Thats precisely why I think wilder is a more powerful but less effective puncher. Foreman knows his strength. He knows he doesnt have to flail his arms around like a lunatic to KO people, so he just throws a couple, measured power shots and moves on. Wilder is more like earnie shavers. When he throws a punch, he puts his entire body into it, which makes him horribly off-balance but as powerful as a freight train for whatever is in front of him. Foreman could match wilder's power if he punched like that, but under normal circumstances, wilder throws harder punches due to his unusual and risky way of punching.
I'll never understand this subs fascination with Foreman.
Imagine 70s Foreman with his 90s ring IQ
His punch resistance was much better when heavier
Already using the new pasta, love it
Good meaty analysis 😭
I think Bowe at his best could whoop Fury, but he'd take a ton of punishment in doing so.
Well It certanly shows that you never saw Foreman fight.
This is such a lazy nonsense narrative. Everyone’s favourite ’super heavyweight’ Lennox Lewis was getting outfought by the shot corpse of blown up cruiserweight Evander Holyfield. Unless of course quite simply Fury is a level better than Lennox Lewis and boxing does get better over time. But naturally, very few would dare claim that, so there’s the contradiction in that nonsense logic.
Very very likely I never see Fury lose a fight, and he will be the only great HW with a 0
I think I might be rooting for Fury in this one. He's an insufferable, scummy dude, but at least he wasn't a serial woman beater and homicidal bully like Foreman was.
He was 217 lb when he fought Frazier. He'd be a lot smaller than Fury.
Deontay is a lot faster with 4" height and 5" of reach on George.  George would be Usyks size without the speed but with heavier hands. I think 2015 Fury would dance around him to a decision but we'll never know.
I mean there are some ok somewhat interesting points in there but you fell in for the trap of nitpicking fight contexts badly with the Frazier analysis. And I also think you could do the exact same thing for guys like Holmes and Lewis who lack big signature wins. Just a thought.
You forgot to mention that Foreman has -3 days to sign otherwise he's a dosser and beneath Fury fighting him.
Bro what? The fights still on, you really buying into this back and forth between them? And if it isn’t on maybe Foreman was asking for something unrealistic, ever thought about that?
We found the Fury fan
Wilder has never KOed anyone who wasn’t KOed already besides Luis Ortiz who was 43 and on blood medication. I love Wilder but his heart/spirit is what makes him great prob more than pure power. I seen plenty of 175/200 pounds take a ton of his shots..look up his resume. He’s got huge power in long distance right hand , that’s it
Oh for sure. A young Ortiz would give him a  very good fight, but that's about it tbh.
That’s interesting. Just curious, did you see that stat somewhere or find out yourself lol. It holds water in the argument, but I don’t think I ever would’ve noticed that on my own.   With that said, Ali did say Shavers was the heaviest hitter he ever faced and that his punches ‘shook his kinfolk back in Africa’. That’s probably worth something too.
He was sloppy in a sense and bigger men = longer reach   + height which makes it harder to land shots with subpar footwork. Imo it was a matter of technical difficulty rather than insufficient punching power
It was much more common to see heavyweights 215 and under in those days than it was in the latter part of his career
I think others who fought them both said similarly.
Don't think it's undeniable, it's not always lights out when deontay lands. Many of his finishes, his opponents stand up and the ref waves it off.
Interesting, I’ll have to check that out. I’m always looking to learn more thank you.
Wlad has more power in his right hand, too, than Wilder. Wilder resume are all chinny fat Cruiserweights, except Brezeale and Ortiz and Ortiz is chinny anyway
Foreman is the worst person ever to use in this type or argument. He literally fought in the 1970s and 1990s, 20 years of "training and nutrition improvement". And being fat and old still beat the champion.   Nothing changed from 1990 to 2020 when it comes to nutrition or training that can be considered revolutionary. The only relevant change would be in ilegal steroids, if any... People have been doping for ages.   Eras not only can be compared, but Foreman literally proved this point by returning to the ring in the 1990s and having a fantastic run. He couldn't beat the top guys (Hollyfield, Tyson) but he had a hell of a run at the top level of the sport.
I admire you're insight, I will agree with alot of your comments. Harder no, faster yes. Wilder looks like he's flailing in the ring looking for the opportunity to land that bomb. Foreman stalked his opponents and dismantled them with punishing power and accuracy. No way is Wilder stronger, watch footage of Foreman's training, the dude physically picks up a cow and carries it uphill! Plus the guy knocked out some serious talent when he was pushing 50. That is GOAT status. Wilder is talented and strong but not on that level. However, I recognize this is all perspective and anecdotal, and I definitely respect yours.
TBF, Ortiz was like 40 years old when he fought Wilder
How do you figure? He has not fought the breadth and width of talent that Foreman faced, and Foreman simply pulled apart the majority of his opponents. I will not deny the fact that he hits like no one else in boxing NOW, but is nowhere near the calibre and talent of Foreman. Go find video of the heavy bags Foreman worked on, I doubt Wylder could manage anything like that with ALL his punches.
Thank-you for the correction
People are blinded by nostalgia. Look at any other sport with measurable statistics, they have all improved drastically. The boxers now are levels above boxers from previous decades
Mfw a 45 year old fat man beat the modern 90's juiced warriors and still gave competitive fights in losing bouts.  Also have this weird alien dude who was 49 years old and was the unified LHW champ.  So strange how a trainer and coach who sparred in the 1930's still has enough relevant knowledge to carry to the 1990's fighters into greatness  Only real improvements, really, is the PEDs and implementation of weight lifting without being a hindrance.  There is also just the eye test and be damned if you see any modern welter or middleweight that looks even remotely similar to Sugar Ray Robinson or any lightweight to Roberto Duran, guys that stated relevant well to their 40's and still elite level fighter in their late 30's. No one can accomplish what they done.  Knowledge is also a doubleheaded sword. Now that we know CTE is real, there has been far less brutal brawler styles in fear of health and longevity in the sport. Nutrition that allows them to gain so much more weight post fight and be fatter too easily. Recovery in forms of being a EPO epidemic that forces you to be on a disadvantage if you don't take it and rehydration clauses thanks to IV and work around tricks around hydration testing in ONE MMA.  You could argue the old guys are staying relevant due to the advancements of training methods and supplements....but neither one of the old timers popped so oh well.
I like to ponder the question of how good Foreman, Ali, etc. would have been had they had the same tools to work with as modern day boxers. For instance we all know Ali moved better than almost any heavyweight, so how much better could he have been if he had the same strategies as modern boxers. I think you’re right about how much better the modern day boxers are compared to the old guys, but it’s still fun to wonder how much better they could’ve been
Wilder has terrible boxing fundamentals and has beaten nobody of note apart from a 50 year old Ortiz on high blood pressure meds. Fury is huge and a very good boxer, but he refuses to fight Usyk  ATM,and has a very low level resume  apart from Klitschko and Wilder and maybe Whyte. Usyk is a fantastic boxer, and would be a big guy back in the 70's, so I agree with you there.
You're a funny fella.
You're conveniently leaving out that the reason Wlad wasn't throwing was because Fury's length, movement, and feints caused the robot to not compute.   You seriously think a decade long HW champion just flat out *chose* to not throw punches until the 12th round?   He only landed in the 12th because Fury started to tire a bit and that was finally when Wlad threw caution to the wind.   An exchange from their [face-off interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kF5gn4LWS6M) before the cancelled 2nd fight:  Fury: Why didn't you let your hands go  Wlad: I didn't  Fury: Why?  Wlad: I didn't, that's my choice  Fury: So you chose to lose?
Yeah, although Foreman is shorter than Wlad, a bit slower, and had slightly worse footwork and head movement imo, as well as suspect stamina. He made up for it somewhat with his iron chin though.
You don’t think things get better lol?
Ali failed a drug test for diuretics before the Holmes fight TBF.
would be like a superhero
A giant with the footwork of a middleweight, slick and tricky as fuck, incredible boxing IQ and developed solid power in recent years. I’ve never seen that mix before. As if you put Andre Wards brain inside Nikolai valuev and trained by manny steward. (I know that’s exaggerated before you start)  We don’t have to like him and I’m sick of his shit, but it’s casual as to suggest Tyson fury isn’t an incredibly talented fighter who can do things that frankly no one else at HW could. That not saying he’s tbe but he has exceptional and unusual talent. Indeed thats why he’s in the doghouse as we feel ripped off that he won’t put them to proper use for our entertainment.
Mental gymnastics? That is the general consensus of boxing fans in regards to Fury lmfao
Definitely. But it's not like mohammed ali had a bad jab either.
All good points. But then again, if we look at just pure skill, then Foreman is far beyond Wilder in terms of pure skill. In fact, taking away height and weight, skill for skill, the heavyweights of the Golden Era are way more technical then the heavyweights of today.  You can't look at Wilder or even Fury and be able to compare them to the likes of Norton, Frazier or even Foreman in terms of pure skill and technique.  I don't know where the narrative of modern day heavweights having more technical skill then the older generation comes from when the older generation have been under direct tutelage of great trainers.   The only advantage the new generation have in general (as there will always be outliers) are their physique.
Foreman on modern Peds would be scary.
He's easily a top ten atg heavyweight champ, bro.
i’m not sure about that, i feel like his strengths were the opposite of what they were in the 70’s (apart from his literal strength) as 70’s foreman was quite mobile and had long arms he’d get tagged and just have points stolen before he KO’d them. where’s 90’s foreman was very stationary but could block a lot better (look at the holyfield fight where he blocks upwards of 20 in a row) so i think they’d clash personally
It was hard to resist. The opportunity was ripe for the picking.
What’s the original?
I've seen him fight, he relied heavily on his size and being able to walk through guys.  He blocked punches with his face and his mummy guard was easy to get through.  He'd be dwarfed by Fury and wouldn't be able to get past his jab, Fury is like a giant version of Ali, totally wrong for Foreman.
>Everyone’s favourite ’super heavyweight’ Lennox Lewis was getting outfought by the shot corpse of blown up cruiserweight Evander Holyfield.   Why do people love making narratives up in their head? Are we really going to sit there and pretend as if Lewis didn't school him the first fight and beaten comprehensively the second time around?
I love this modern narrative people keep pushing on here that Holyfield was “a shot corpse of a blown up cruiserweight” when he fought Lewis, rather than what he really was; a 36 y/o, three time, unified heavyweight champ.  He was the same age as Wilder was in the trilogy match with Fury, but with less pro fights.  Same age as Usyk now.  You either a) weren’t alive/weren’t watching boxing at the time, because nobody was spewing this BS back then or b) just dislike Lewis and are looking for ways to discredit him
It’s a true statement. If you think modern boxing is peak boxing, then I don’t know what to say..
Meaningless. Fury’s clinch game is nothing to talk about and his jab is laughable; he’s not just bullying Foreman like he did wilder. Foreman also had good timing and a body shot that look like it could total a car. I don’t care how big Fury is, George cracks him easier than wilder.
Luckily when Foreman backs out (without knowing he's backed out)  there will be a hungry, young, up-and-coming English boxer to fill in who's just as exciting a match-up: Derek Chisora.
How can you not be a fan of the guy? Best heavyweight of his generation
Breazele,Szpilka,Malik Scott,etc weren’t KOed before they fought Wilder. We know you don’t like him but don’t create false facts just for the fun of it lil buddy.
I seen some analysis and then I started looking around myself. I've seen a few examples of someone looking like a murderous puncher when fighting 185lb guys, having a 90+% ko ratio and then when it comes to 200lb men it drops, and then at 215 it drops some more and then at 225lb+ their ko percentage looks like they aren't even strong punchers anymore.   Boxers often say someone is a brutal puncher when they've beat them so they look better by comparison.
Every boxer always says the heaviest puncher was some schmuck that they beat. Don’t believe me? Check it out it’s true. The reason Shavers is the biggest puncher of all time is because he never beat anybody.
It's on a website called the heavyweight blog iirc
That is a valid point. I do however also think a larger man can on average take a punch better than a smaller man.
Yep. We aren't saying that every golden era HW would be better. If I recall correctly, Foreman fought for money more than anything so even though he had a great run, perhaps if he was purely focused on being the top dawg he might've used PEDs etc. but hella risky at that age. And you're right: almost everyone juices, except I don't think Wilder or Usyk have. Everyone else has mostly popped or is obviously using or has used (like AJ).
TBF, if you look at Foreman's 69 KO record a lot of those Kos were against questionable opposition, especially in his comeback. Still agree with what you're saying though!
If they had the same tools as modern boxers they'd probably clean out the current crop of heavyweights with relative ease. The only outlier, in my opinion, would be Usyk who is incredibly skilled.
Fury talked a good game leading up to the rematch, but he didn't go through with in the end and failed a drug test. I think a rematch could have been different know that the element of surprise was gone, it's not like Wlad couldn't adapt, and it's not like Fury hurt him badly in their fight.
George also had better punch selection and he was less shy to get into a gunfight and brawl
Testing also got better. There’s something to be said about some of those athletics records standing for so long
Corticosteroids are what my son uses for his eczema.  They have no anabolic or androgenic properties, and are commonly used for a variety of issues, including to treat inflammation (via injection).  I'd be surprised if they were banned, even in the 70s/80s.  Happy to be corrected.  Very different to getting on the tren though anyway.  I also can't find any record of this.  Ali apparently did take diuretics prior to his fight with Larry Holmes.  Fun corticosteroid fact:  The actress Michelle Rodriguez tried to use corticosteroid use as an argument to mitigate her culpability for a drink driving charge.  Didn't work.  She got community service but ended up violating her parole and having to do some jail.
Also a giant duck. Let's not act This legendary fighter didn't have a close fight with a top 30 ranked guy in Otto Wallin either
People like lewis or foreman or frazier are heavyweight greats not tyson fury.
I won't disagree with the skill exhibited by the Golden Era. It was more fun to watch. I think the athletic development of boxers today focused on raw strength and power and less skill for heavyweights. Probably because if you have more size and strength you can gain an advantage, most of the time, over a weaker but more skilled opponent. It's probably an aspect of athletic development that's taken precedence over the hard science for heavyweights.
I gotta say, you threw me off lmao   Started cross checking names and shit
Someone asking for someone to convince them that a ‘67 Ali could beat an ‘88 Tyson a few hours ago, but as you can see from the copy paste above…. There was no mind to change in the first place, clearly lol
How is it making up narratives? Holyfield must have thrown less than 20 punches in 4 rounds in both fights. What other prime ATG is dropping more than a couple of rounds to that. Lewis managed to in the second fight. Watch it when you can you’ll be astounded how badly Lewis dealt with a finished Holyfield. A better version of Holyfield stops Lewis every time. I can’t even imagine what Lewis does against someone like peak Holyfield because his resume is mostly one armed sluggers who he had all the advantages over.
Age doesn’t work like that in sport pal. Holyfield’s body was done at 36. Look at the physical decline from Tyson/Moorer fights in 97 to Lewis fights in 99. It’s not even an off fight either he’s physically done in the rematch as well. Once you’re past 35 it’s a matter of time. Big punchers can delay their time at the top, but it killed someone like Holyfield who’s game is based around volume, footwork, timing and combinations.  But don’t let the facts get in the way of your delusion that Lewis has an impressive win against an ATG.
lol
Why are you lying. Joshua’s KOed Breazrale and he was dropped 10 times by a football player from Bama and a 48 year old Mansoir. Scott is a bum no chin and took a dive cause frinddd and Szpilka I don’t know or care and another former 175er, also Chisoras bum ass KOed Spilza in a round after but he was older I guess. The guys with decent chins never got KOed for real by Wilder.
Could’ve just added a point without being weird and condescending for some reason
I remember Foreman's ko percentage against guys over 225 was in the 70+ percent range, and Klitschko's was 80%.
Don't know how you can objectively say that when he has a 92% knockout rate in general unless the study includes the loses to the guys he failed to knock out, which also hurts cases of Bob Statterfield and Sandy Saddler's power.   Thing is, there is accountability to statements to either losing to or beating the power punchers in the 70's or 80's. The statement is true for Ali, where he fought Liston, Ryle, Foreman and Shavers and said Shavers hit the hardest. Same thing with Caldwell when talking about Shavers over Foreman.  It's also scary of how many guys that fought him and were near unanimous that he was the real deal with the power. Just lacked some other skill and conditioning to be a better fighter but that is a mute point in their eyes. They just see a guy that can shadow realm you if he hits you clean only once or twice.
Except Ali also beat Foreman, Frazier, and a legendary list of KO artists, making your argument idiotic.
Shavers gets so much credit because of Ali quotes. I would assume the biggest puncher Ali actually ever faced was either Foreman, a known massive puncher, or Frazier who actually badly hurt Ali.
Pretty much why they have divisions, it's not just your ability to deliver more PSI that goes up with bodyweight, but your ability to withstand it.
They would have still been smaller men over all if we're talking about hw.
Wlad proved he couldn’t adapt when he didn’t throw punches for 11 rounds
Yeah for sure.
I meant diuretics, sorry. Thank you for all the information!
Yeah he is. Where have I acted like that? But let’s not pretend all great fighters don’t have strangely close matches they should have dominated on paper. Name a great heavyweight and there’ll be a long list of ‘why didn’t you blast them’ fights.
You said 'most talented', not great. You could make a case for Fury to beat anybody in history in a one off fight. I agree he's not up there with the absolute greats yet though
What is your ultimate argument against Lennox? Just come out with the hot take. Is it tko6? You think vitaly should’ve won?
>. A better version of Holyfield stops Lewis every time.   A better version of Holyfield couldn't even knock out a old George Foreman and an ancient Larry Holmes.  You talk about prime for prime but name more than one fighter that Holyfield beat whom was a world class mover in their prime at HW. Go on I'll wait.  >because his resume is mostly one armed sluggers who he had all the advantages over.  He fought everyone he needed to other than except Bowe. Name a bunch of guys whom Lennox didn't fight and I'll tell you why. Go on, I'll wait.
I assume you weren’t alive at the time, but the idea that Holyfield was washed was absolutely not prevalent at the time.  That’s been decided later by people with agendas.  He was the betting favourite in the run up to the fight and Ring’s #1 HW, above Lewis.
Name one better
Lemme use Google translate cos what the fuck are you trying to say?
Sorry boss. I just can’t stand liars and agenda seeking people. Apologies to anyone offended🙏🏾🫡
You're the one who lied bruh
Plus I have to stop using “lil bro/buddy”😂 it seems I unintentionally adopted that lingo from my time on Twitter 😅
Wlads right hand and left hook were nukes. He has a claim to being the hardest hitter in history too
When I looked Shavers KO ratio at over 215lbs was 47.8%, it was 91% at cruiser and below.
r/whoosh  Not the sharpest knife in the drawer, are you?
I’d say Liston but I’m not sure Liston caught him.
Why is everyone sleeping on Ken Norton?
That seems to be an unpopular opinion on here for some reason. I don't get it.
Wlad literally came back from being brutally knocked out several times, but he can't change his game plan for the rematch? When he actually went for Fury towards the end, he started landed hard shots on him and Fury seemed shook imo.
Ah right. Yeah checks out.
True. I can't excuse him ducking usyk though.
This is even better lmao
These Lennox detractors really think they're saying special with their shit takes.
My ultimate argument is that by definition Lewis is overrated. People think the bloke is a God for goodness sake. There’s no evidence to suggest that
Holmes and Foreman were much harder to stop than Lewis. Much better chins and both smarter fighters than Lewis in their comeback.  You know there aren’t world class movers outside of Holyfield himself from the era.   Holmes/Foreman in their comebacks were better  wins than Golota/Tua/Ruddock. So jot those down for a start. Then there’s no Bowe as you mentioned, no tricky southpaw Moorer and no non finished version of Holyfield or Tyson. And the best 90s opponent who wasn’t finished Tyson/Holyfield he fought was Mercer who he got a lucky decision against. So Lewis doesn’t have any top work against the best fighters of his own era in reality.
Oh and a Byrd or even Toney would have been very good on his resume just to see what Lewis looks like when a fighter can make him miss.
It’s not an idea it’s a fact for goodness sake. Watch Holyfield’s career, and when you have done, give me compelling evidence that he wasn’t shot!!!
David Price
We'll never know if he was better than Usyk because he keeps ducking.
The guy he blatantly ducked
Wilder has never KOed anyone with a chin. It’s a literal fact of life. Even when Stiverne was 37 with some chin left he took him 12.
Ok. In that case breazele was sparked by AJ and Chisora did Malik Scott in the distance if I remember correctly. Szpilika barely worth a mention in a resume.  No one’s offended although you seem to be getting worked up
Lied about what?
Yeah fair enough easy to fall into it’s just teenage bullshit and fucks up conversations that could’ve been normal
It's crazy how disrespected he was by certain boxing media outlets, like ESPN. They did a top 100 all time heavyweight champions lists and neither brother was in. They never included Wladimir in any top puncher's list either iirc.
I honestly think this is one of the reasons Fury never rematches him. When Klitschko actually went for him and tagged him at the end of the 12th round, Fury looked like he never wanted to get hit by him again, and he knew that his element of surprise would be gone for the rematch.
Ken broke his jaw and hurt him, but he wasn't known for his spectacularly strong punches (at least compared to a Foreman or Liston), more for his fantastic boxing skills and for being a stylistic nightmare for Ali.
Inferiority complex, to put it bluntly.  The weaker-minded of the small guys already don't like being at the disadvantage that bigger guys usually, obviously hit harder.  They then retreat into the "Please say it ain't so (sob)" that larger biological systems *somehow* don't confer greater protection against the same amount of kinetic energy.
Ur taking fury over him right? Or is it tko6?
>Holmes and Foreman were much harder to stop than Lewis. Much better chins and both smarter fighters than Lewis in their comeback.  Foreman? Smarter? The guy who got hit way more than Lewis is smarter? The guy who got outboxed by Tommy Morrison is smarter? Give me a break.  >Then there’s no Bowe as you mentioned  As we all know, both sides couldn't come to an agreement and Bowe threw his belt in the trash.  They was scheduled to fight then Lewis lost.  They was scheduled to fight again but Bowe got his ass whooped by Andrew Golota.    >no tricky southpaw Moorer  Moorer could've fought Lewis when both were champion but he decided to fight a retired Foreman coming off a loss instead for a bigger payday.  >no non finished version of Holyfield or Tyson.  Holyfield and Lewis could've fought when both were champs in the early nineties but Holyfield was mandated to fight Michael Moorer and then fought him instead.   Tyson offered Lewis step aside money to not fight him back in 96. It's Tyson's fault why the fight didn't happen sooner.    >And the best 90s opponent who wasn’t finished Tyson/Holyfield he fought was Mercer who he got a lucky decision against.  A lucky decision? Nice one. Next you'll be telling me that Lewis got knocked out in that fight.  Lewis won that fight 7 - 3, two swing rounds I could've gave to Mercer and it would've been a draw.  It's funny how you act like you Lewis's career inside and out yet you neglect these reasons.
Toney? An obese middleweight who's best win is over and even more SHOT Holyfield and John Ruiz?  Really? Yet you don't give Lewis credit for his wins over established heavyweights but you'll give him credit for beating an obese middleweight?  >Byrd  Lewis didn't fight Byrd because he went to fight Tyson for a bigger payday.  The guys you listed that Lewis didn't fight, most of the time was because they swerved him to go fight other fighters. Like I said, he fought who he could've in front of him.
He went twelve with Lewis twice.    I did watch his career - not in YouTube retrospectives, live.
Are you trolling
We don’t know exactly why that fight didn’t get made but I find it hard to believe the guy that fought klitschko and Wilder was too scared to fight little Usyk
So he fights Wilder and Klitschko but ducks Usyk? I find that highly improbable
AJ fan girl spotted 🤡
True but Dominic’s was a TKO so he wasn’t necessarily knocked sparked out. I know Spzilka ain’t no Tyson Fury but my point was about him not getting knocked out still stands. Stiverne wasn’t knocked out. Same goes for Duhaupas,Arreola and Washington.
Getting worked up by who/what exactly lol. Just corrected the fella.
Yeah fairs👍🏽
IMO he is undeniably an ATG top 10 heavy. He will age like fine wine
He should have done that from round 1 damn it
Absolutely agree
But my point is we never saw Lewis against an opponent who could make him miss. That’s why I say his resume is one dimensional and there’s not enough tangible evidence that Lewis is the greatest H2H hw ever.
Ok then, how do you explain what has just transpired between the two as anything other than duck on Fury's part? Usyk literally accepted 30%. I think Fury's gonna do a Mayweather and wait till he's older, knowing that Usyk is smaller and relies more on his athleticism and reflexes and speed.
I’ve Met Wilder before he was champ. I already told you I like Wilder and he’s a cool guy. AJ is a literal bum, I guess you don’t read my comments but your account does say you a troll so GJ got me
Out of curiosity. What compels you to downvote during this conversation?
I’ll give you benefit of the doubt. Just figured you were being sarcastic calling me boss and the salute shit. And the downvoting is generally done by someone who’s got their knickers in a twist
Wladimir was way too gun shy at times. Fury's stamina, feinting and awkward movement were on point during that fight too, even though he didn't really hurt Klitschko that bad apart from giving him a cut, but both Klitschko bros had paper thin skin anyway.
>But my point is we never saw Lewis against an opponent who could make him miss.  That same opponent you're saying that could make him miss is the same kind of opponent you wouldn't even give him credit for beating.  >That’s why I say his resume is one dimensional and there’s not enough tangible evidence that Lewis is the greatest H2H hw ever.  Again, he fought who he could. It's not his fault that some of these guys weren't willing to fight him.  You shit on his resume but conveniently forget these things  Ruddock was favourite to win and was seen by some as the best after Tyson got locked up, Lennox took him out in two.  Andrew Golota was seen as the best in the division after he gave two bad beatings. Their fight was seen as a 50/50, Lennox took him out in a round.  Lennox cemented himself as number after beating a unified champion in Holyfield whom was having a career resurgence and beat him convincingly twice.  Americans were hyping up Grant and he was seen as the number one contender and some thought Lennox would lose to him. Lennox took him out in two.  Botha had taken Moorer 12, outboxed Tyson before getting caught and fought in a close fight with Briggs. Lennox took him out in 2.  Tua was Number 1 contender in all sanctioning bodies. Lennox schooled him.  Lennox then beat a past prime Tyson to finally close the chapter and shut those percentage of people that actually thought Tyson would still win.  It's funny how you say he beats everybody that he has an advantage over but then complain that he didn't fight certain people that he would have an ADVANTAGE over. Talk about a contradiction.
No idea, I didn’t have inside access to negotiations on both sides
I haven’t downvoted/upvoted anybody on this sub in a while.
You’d be surprised to know that there are other people on this sub reading this convo.
What are you on about🤣🤣
You think I care to  upvote/downvote you?
The Lewis fans are good at hyping up everyone he faced as some world beaters. There’s a grand total of zero champions there bar a journeyman level Tyson and a Holyfield who turned old overnight after Moorer. Lewis’ resume is solid but my issue is there’s little variety to the opponents and the signature performance is Ruddock.   And there’s no contradiction, when Lewis has the physical and technical advantages over sluggers who have careers built around their size and power it’s a relevant point. But looking at the Mercer Holyfield and even Klitschko performances where the advantages were cut right down, he really didn’t look so good. And you can call Toney and Byrd blown up middleweights but were both champs and good fighters that would add variety to Lewis’ resume.   I’m being harsh I’m aware but I do think there’s some holes in Lewis’ resume that don’t get brought up at all. And I really would love to have seen what Lewis looked like against someone who could make him miss!
These mfs are black belt honeydickers
I think he just trolling
He probably is trolling he and errol have both hinted at a big announcement.
Him and spence toiled with their careers, meanwhile we getting a super fight with haney vs loma and davis vs garcia.  Spence and Terrence are never going to fight.  Add Mungia on putting these guys on protected fighter list.
After years of build up, Crawford and Spence finally decided to settle their fued in a much more spicy fashion than a traditional fight: an orgasm control challenge. Viewers who paid $100 were able to tune in to see Spence and Crawford both laying in bed masturbating eachother in a competition to see who could hold off ejaculation the longest.   The first 5 minutes were intense. As both furiously stroked the shaft of the other, they stared into eachothers eyes, as bitter rivals would. They were both close, moaning, but refusing to give in. Finally, Crawford hatched a great strategy. He moved away from Spence's shaft and began to run his finger in between Spence's head and his foreskin, twirling it around and then up and down his frenulum.   Spence had no way to retaliate, as Crawford was circumcised and did not possess a foreskin that he could play with. Spence's eyes rolled in the back of his head. He let out a cry of anguish as he knew that his effort was futile. Semen started to trickle out of Spence's urethra as a smile spread across Crawford's face. Finally Spence ejaculated a massive amount of semen all over Crawford's tummy. Errol Spence had been defeated by Terrance Crawford by CS (cumshot).
This dude's CTE is flaring up. April Fools was three days ago.
listen here you little shit
Yeah, no one should believe it until both guys are in the ring at this point.
so funny. 🙄 Can we get this guy off the p4p list?
Oscar’s paying him good money to send Rocha to the shadow zone. No way this fight happens
He's trolling lol, it probably wasn't supposed to get off. If it is false, I will be streaming Spence and Crawfords fights for the rest of their career. Reputable people have been reporting. Crawford has a lot of hate with fans of this Spence saga and just wants to annoy the shit out of people.
Boxing died when boxers started imitating Floyd Jr.'s mentality.
Everything Crawford says and does makes perfect sense when you realize he’s an idiot
Yeah we know.
Translation: Oscar told me he’ll give me 10 mill for the Alexis Roacha fight so you can suck my ass because I’m still p4p #1
He's fighting Alexis Rocha.
4 days late lmao y’all thinking he’s serious is funny 😂
Shucky DUCKy, quack, quack!
Well well well the most diabolical haters this side is the Mississippi
It's not April 1st tho
Came for the headlines, stayed for the jokes. This thread is like uber eats: it delivers.
This man kinda funny ngl
Like I said.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/12biu92/comment/jexgrld/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3
Bud is too afraid of challenges
Man I can’t wait for spence to finally beat the breaks off of crawford. The only advantage, outside of boxing skill, spence will have going in to the fight is that he’s younger. Crawford fought more recently, has less wear and tear, and he feels better at 147 than spence does. Tired of this fool and the bs.
Quack quack
Seems like Spence is doing everything possible to make the fight. If he takes another fight, then his mandatories will be due. So I guess it's make this fight or move up.
Odd how certain some are who wins this fight.
So if I’m understanding this correctly all that Spence/Crawford “getting a deal done” was an April’s fools joke?
Like I said earlier.. I wont believe they are fighting until they are in the ring.
I'm glad I didn't fall for the initial tweet.
I mean I'm happy if either Spence or crawf fight boots instead
Boxing is dumb
At this point if it's not any announcement of the real thing, it's just sad.
forgot about both of these dudes at this point. good boxers though.
Not to mention, Fulton vs Inoue
Davis vs Garcia is a belt-less super-fight and Munguia is somehow name-dropped. The state of this sport rn jfc. Ffs give us LHW or HW undisputed.
Munguia at least is still only 26, got plenty of time for big fights even if he's been protected up to now
Can't believe I read the whole thing..
Lmao Jesus Christ. Is this going to be a copypasta? I sure hope not.
I feel like I need to go to church after reading this and I’m not even religious
Oh dear
What…….the fuck
Sitting here laughing like a loon, thank you
$100 PPV is a joke, I'm streaming it instead!
This made me snot on my phone
You walk this earth like a literary God
Every day we stray further from God's light
please tell me this was ChatGPT and no human wrote this... *please*
Bit gay this
This is how bad Spence and Crawford are screwing over boxing fans. They got erotic fanfics being written about them before they ever fought 🤣🤣
Imma wash my eyes brb
You know what, Conor McGregor would be undisputed GOAT in these cumshot elimination. 💀
"It's still April, fool." -Crawford maybe
He’s referring to the reports today about Crawford-Spence being a done deal fight for June.
Nah he thinks April Fools is the whole of April 😂
At this point, It can be the day after the fight, and I will still be checking boxing news to make sure it actually happened.
And replace him with who?
I actually spited my coffee right now… you’re exactly right.
How people consider this dude to be #1 P4P is crazy to me.
Spence is not more skilled than Crawford
When Spence gets countered and wakes up on the canvas. What would be your excuse?
No Crawford is trolling, both he and Errol have been sending cryptic messages for a couple weeks now hinting that it was their next fight
Same here, I think the worst part was after reading all of that, coming across the word “tummy” felt so gross
Yeah dick snot.
Really? It was pretty good?
Comments you can hear lol
Yes, but he's three days late for April fools
Rolly Romero
Jake
Usyk gets two spots.
Honestly kinda disrespectful to Canelo, Usyk, Inoue that people rank Bud higher lol
I didn’t say he was. I just meant there are some things spence is better at than crawford in the ring and vice versa. I just didn’t want to list all of them cause I just wanted to talk about external advantages.
..and that’s just the first mine
Won’t have any excuses but don’t plan on it. Crawford didn’t even look good against his tune up till the 3rd or 4th round, spence don’t need tune ups tho.
>coming across the “tummy”  Bro stop your making it [worse](https://giphy.com/gifs/do-not-want-jKk5t9p12W2RO)
it was amazing. i loved every second of it. i read the entire thing 3 times.

Fury, Spence, Andrade, Jermall Charlo, and Crawford will all be replaced by Usyk until they learn to behave themselves. Josh Taylor is also in danger of being Usykanized as a result of over a year of inactivity and his last legitimate win was  2 years ago.
bud has a better resume than Inoue
Ah I gotcha man
Its called staying active, spence hasn't fought in over a year. People gonna say he had ring rust when he gets beat up
No he doesn't. An ancient donaire is leagues better than anybody on Crawford's resume.
Well no excuses from me. I’ve seen spence get ejected from a car but come back to fight former champ danny garcia after 1.5 years, him not fighting for 1.5 years cause of a detached retina but coming back to fight world champ ugas, and now he’ll fight crawford after 14 months of not fighting. Spence said he doesn’t need tune ups and he’s proved it so far, so if somehow crawford wins that’s fair to me.
Add in the fact that the Donaire win aged really well. I can’t stand Donaire but the man is a hell of a fighter.
Gamboa in his prime was better than ancient donaire (you can see the difference in his movement in 2013 to now because hes an athletic based fighter) postal was better (shouldve beat ramierez, close fight with josh taylor) Shawn porter is better than ancient donaire and so on. He beat a few champs at 118 but... i remember 2011 when he was p4p number 3 and fought rigo, when he went to 126 and got knocked out by walter and then went down weight and got outclassed badly by jessie maldonago. carl frampton made easy work of him at 122 and so on. KEEP IN mind my comparisons to shawn, viktor and gamboa are to 38-40 donaire not prime donaire. Point is you could go years earlier and id still pick these guys over donaire.
Ight, just making sure no one uses the lay off as an excuse
My thoughts on donaire for the most part  rigo beat donaire in 2011 soundly except for a knockdown when he got punched breaking a clinch. Donaire was number 3 P4P at that time. He got knocked out by walter at 126 and then got destroyed by jessie maldonago at 122, again worse than that inoue fight. Donaire is a fan friendly fighter but hes not an A+ class fighter. group think dosent make it right, but the reality is the reality. also the butler guy got the belt because the other champ missed weight. Inoue never fought Rigo (the best fighter there obviously for years, not anymore tho) he fought an over the top donaire whos already been dominated several times when he was years younger and considered a P4P star. Point is, I know you guy havent been watching boxing that long, I watched this donaire thing playout. Max Kellerman was running around saying if he was floyds size hed beat floyd and so on.
Hahaha, imagine calling a guy who started at 112 lbs knocking nearly everyone out and only started to lose at 126lbs not an A+ fighter. He was even P4P no.3 so I’m not sure how he’s not a great fighter.   He’s the 2nd best Filipino fighter ever and that’s saying a lot
he started to lose at 122 not 126 he got his ass whooped in both divisons and beat two small name champions at 118 recently. my issue is how easily he got dominated in the past by rigo, frampton, maldenago.. etc Inoue is at 122 now and he got into a physical brawl with an old donaire. I saw other top guy use their footwork and damn near completely nullify him. Why we acting like 2011-2019 never happened?
P4P just a hypothetical thing, he wasnt even the best in his weight class at the time. weve seen the fights and after they happened his named dissappeared of those lists
You're not looking for anybody to change your mind. You're still going to ignore any argument, valid or not that gets thrown your way. You just want to fanboy for Tyson, stop the cap.
Now THIS is some fresh cringe
So we’re not allowed to argue your point... I’m going to anyway.  Mike at his best was struggling with fighters who were physically stronger and had the speed to move around him with a solid jab and a fraction of the fluidity and foot speed Ali had. Chuvalo lost every round and only got through due to his solid chin and decent gas tank, both of which were of better quality than Tyson’s. Ali was vicious in his day and nigh-impossible to catch with a combination, Tyson wouldn’t have been able to get anything started.
This might sound crazy, but Tyson was not THAT good. He is popular because of how young he was when he became champion and his power, but I believe many fighters could beat Tyson. Is he a legend? For sure. Unstoppable? Nah
Jimmy “The Ghost with the Hammer in His Hand” Wilde would have beaten both if a cross-time and cross-weight matchup in the 20’s with none of the men ever hearing of the other in a French ring occurred.
I see a lot of people referencing fights of Ali post ban - [this Ali.](https://youtu.be/oJUzl0aFHZw), this is the Ali that we’re referring to (nov 1966). He’s an entirely different animal here.   I don’t see many HW hanging with this performance against Williams, who wasn’t a bum  Absolute beautiful masterclass
Tyson, in his prime, barely beat james tillis by 1 point. Tony tucker gave him hell with a broken hand. James Smith also performed quite well against him. What all these guys had in common was that they used jabs, movement and clinching to keep tyson away in the earlier rounds, gas him out and take away his power. Tyson still won by outpointing them, but just barely.  Ali had miles and miles greater jabs, movement and clinching than all those guys, along with hilariously greater speed, acurracy, stamina and endurance. If those guys kept tyson away, ali would do it with his eyes closed and one of his arms missing. And unlike those 3, tyson would never be able to outpoint someone as fast, sharp and talented as 1967 ali, and Im 90% sure ali would even KO tyson in the later rounds.  Also, ali already schooled patterson, who was a faster but weaker tyson, so ali has the mental edge of already dealing with someone that used tysons style. So yeah, I dont see how tyson wins.
Tyson couldn't knock out James Tillis, Mitch Green, or Tony Tucker. These are far worse versions of the outboxing style that Ali had, and Ali's chin was concrete compared to theirs. Tyson would be forced to try and outpoint Ali over 15 rounds, outpoint the fastest heavyweight in boxing history, with arguably the best stamina and jab in boxing history.   I don't think that's happening, especially since we know how Tyson handled adversity later on, and that he had problems making adjustments. I think Tyson is the only guy to never beat someone that beat him.   Also, people love to forget that Ali beat Floyd Patterson twice. Once already before 67' and fighting Liston. Patterson fought in the peak a boo style and Ali punished him. Lol Patterson had all the same flaws and advantages as Tyson, but a little more heart. Ali easily by decision, especially in the later rounds.
7 times out of 10 this fight ends in a one sided UD decision for Ali. The other 3 Mike closes the distance enough times to get a KO/TKO (while still losing most rounds prior).   PS: There is no way Tyson beats Ali on points.
Ali is a bad match up for Tyson. Ali cant be knocked out, he is completely fearless and can go 15 rounds. Tyson is underrated on this sub but Ali would mentally break him down.
I think the longer the fight goes on the more Ali comes into the fight.  I think Ali getting knocked out in the first 3-5 rounds is unlikely. Ali's head movement and footwork was phenomenal. If he wanted to avoid Tyson i think he could.  I think Tyson wouldnt be able to keep the pace and gets knocked out in rounds 13 or 14 (yeah they fought 15 rounds back then)  Ali's stinging quick jabs from distance to a slowing Tyson late in the fight would be hard for Tyson along woth Ali's amazing endurance.
Maybe so, maybe not. But I'd take Ali in the rematch
Tyson doesn’t have the gas tank that foreman has, and foreman hit harder. There fire we know the rope a dope strategy could work for Ali. Additionally Tyson doesn’t have a substantially better chin or recovery than foreman so dropping rounds to Tyson again would not be that huge of on issue. Finally Ali has faster hands and is longer than Tyson so Tyson wouldn’t have the super substandard physical edge over Ali that let him just blitz through people.
Well Ali had an atg chin and good movement. Tough to beat
They also said he won't beat Foreman. What happened?
A matchup between those two, I’d say I’d match it in Mikes favor in the earlier rounds, and in Ali’s with each passing around.  The longer the fight goes, the more likely Ali takes it.
“Mike Tyson has never fought a great fighter in their prime” Max Kellerman.   You’re post comes of as arrogant so it’s not like we want to dialogue. So I guess I’ll leave it at that.
You’re not wrong OP but you’re going to get hated on by Ali fans and dudes with an axe to grind against Tyson.  Here are the facts:    A) Ali was ktfo by a swarming boxer puncher Who wasn’t more gifted than Tyson.  Joe Frazier  B) Tyson was never beaten by a boxer. He was never outboxed or outlasted. The men who beat him (Lewis, Douglas, Holyfield, Williams) were big physical men who stood their ground and bullied him.  That wasn’t Ali’s style or physical gifts   So yeah — there’s literally no evidence other than anti-Tyson and Ali fanboy sentiment that would support Ali beating Mike.
The truth is the division Tyson dominated was superior to the division Ali dominated in the 60s. Many of Ali’s opponents were sub 200s. You are not going to convince me sub 200 lb fighters like Henry cooper and Karl Mildenberger would be top heavyweights in 1980s. Ernie Terrell was probaly Ali’s best title defense win (Liston rematch was fixed). Terrell how ever had little power and was skinny not better then pinklon Thomas IMO. Floyd Patterson was good but small and wouldn’t be relevant in the 80s. Mike Tyson would get heat for defending against someone like Brian London, and far past prime fighters like Cleveland Williams and Zora folley. Tyson faced bigger, stronger, more athletic fighters. Tony tucker, pinklon Thomas, Carl Williams, Frank Bruno, Larry Holmes, Michael Spinks, tony tubbs, bonecrusher smith, tyrell Biggs, there simple wasn’t elite big guys in the 60s like then.
Get out of here. The Ali before his suspension beats any HW in my opinion. Far too fast, too slick and still obviously had a granite chin.
If we’re comparing prime Tyson then you have to compare a prime Ali before the layoff. Prime Ali was sublime, he had it all, speed, power, rhythm, chin and reflexes like Roy Jones Jr had. He’d frustrate Tyson then put him away late in the fight and it’s not for the reasons above but for the intangibles and mind game, two big things Tyson never had in the ring.
Exactly
Fresh pasta.
If Cus wudnuh died
Honestly, I think Ali wins 10 times out of 10, but I think Tyson manages to catch Ali a lot.   Ali relied solely on his foot speed as his main defense. But that foot speed failed him SEVERAL times. Ali took SEVERE punishment from Max Schmeling, Oscar Bonavena, Joe Frazier, and Ken Norton. Anyone who applied a decent amount of pressure to Ali could nullify his quick feet.  But the problem is what REALLY messes with Tyson is what Ali has in spades, that mainly being good reach/height, constant pressure, an amazing chin, and excellent cardio. Ali never went down unless he was put through a fucking war, and Tyson just isn't able to keep up that kind of pace.   The way I see it going, it would be extremely competitive for the first several rounds, but Tyson is inevitably gonna get tired and frustrated, and is going to open up to some extreme punishment from Ali.   I earnestly cannot see a way that Tyson could ever beat Ali. His god-tier chin and amazing cardio are just a nightmare for Tyson to deal with.  Edit: Disregard Max Schmeling. A redditor made a good point that Max isn't even from the same generation of fighters as Ali, which I am aware of. Mind fart moment I guess, lol.
>I see a lot of people referencing fights of Ali post ban - this Ali., this is the Ali that we’re referring to (nov 1966). He’s an entirely different animal here.   >   >I don’t see many HW hanging with this performance against Williams, who wasn’t a bum   >   >Absolute beautiful masterclass  Perfectly said.
Yep you just aren’t ever catching him with anything meaningful.
This is a better summary than I could have written, so I'll just say that I endorse this. Additionally, Ali would really have gotten under Tyson's skin before, during, and after the fight.
There is some points I do have to bring up.  One is that Tucker and Smith is that clinching was their main defensive tool and did not allow Tyson to do much  (thou Tyson was generally busier and landed better shots overall since he came there to fight) like holy hell the ref should of taken more shit away from Smith. They weren't dominating the fight but they weren't becoming a highlight either.  Patterson in the first fight had a bad back and it went out pretty early on so not really indicative of anything. He did miles better on the rematch despite being 37.  Anyone that'll bring up "bututuittiut Cooper floored him and Doug Jones gave Ali hell". That is true the first time. Second time, Ali easily handled and also made Cooper end in a bloody mess. Fought an exbition with Jones later on and according to reports and few screen grabs of the fight, it wasn't even close. Jones couldn't land a damn thing on him.
Im not arguing that Ali would win.  I will point out that in the late 60s Bonecrusher would have been disqualified for holding.  Truth be told I don’t remember the Tillis fight that well, but that was not s prime Tyson.
Thanks, a few questions:      1) What range do you put Tyson's prime?   2) To your knowledge, was there ever a Doctor's report/cert corroborating Tucker's "broke my hand" claim?  3) Do you stand by your claim that Tyson only "barely" outpointed Tucker?  If so, what were your scores per round?
Arguments like these are stupid. I can do this for literally any fighter, Ali included. Ever watched Ali vs Bonavena? It isnt the only fight he struggled in. I still think he is the greatest.   How about Lennox getting knocked the fuck out twice by mediocre dudes, and arguably lost vs a guy who sometimes struggled with cans?
Tyson was 19 against James smith. Ali at 21 was getting a gift decision against 6 feet tall 188 lb Doug jones. At 21 Tyson was destroying Michael Spinks.
And Ali got dropped by some basic as white boy from England. Your point is?
May they bring their hate by the thousands.  For every 3 Ali fans who scream, 1 will bring some actual facts, and I've endured far more adverse ratios in other areas of investigation.  I'm not here for popularity, I'm here - and the great Jordan Peterson would applaud of my open-mindedness - to see if there's anything, *anything* they know, that I don't.   There is quite a lot more evidence than the above that Tyson would have destroyed Ali, I'll be happy to supply you that after the Ali fans have exhausted their reasoning.
Ali was past his best against Frazier. You could have at least read the title properly.
[I tried.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/12bvbxq/tyson_fury_vs_george_foreman/jeyqyic/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)
We eatin’ good 🍝😋
Ali before his ban was much better than after, and I’m not saying that in a baseless manner, he was so much quicker and smoother and used much better upper body movement both offensively and defensively, it’s why his whipping hooks caught people off guard. His feet in his prime were much more agile and didn’t thud on the ring, he was always moving one way or the other and feinted with his lateral movement. He just didn’t do those things after coming back.
Max Schmeling fought two generations before Ali lmao, who did you actually mean?
We are talking the best version of Ali, not the Ali after the suspension. He was lightning fast and let his hands go in a way that would’ve caused Tyson absolute hell.
Im sorry, what did you expect me to do? What better way is there to argue for ali than showing tyson struggle against ali-like fighters? And your examples arent even the same thing with mine. Ali vs Bonavena happened in 1970, after ali lost pretty much everything that made him so good in the first place. Lennox's KO's were flukes, and you are pretty bold to call oliver mccall mediocre. Tyson consistently struggled against fighters like ali despite being in his prime.
Thankfully this isnt 21 years old tyson vs 21 years old ali, this is 67 ali vs 88 tyson. Ali wins.
Something beautiful began today
Good point, lmao. I have no idea. Mind blank moment, I guess.   I think I meant Earnie Shavers, maybe? But that's not a great example because some will just use the reasoning of Ali being beyond his prime years to ignore it (not saying they're right or wrong, just why I avoid this example).   Other actual good examples would be Henry Cooper (Altho tbf, some would say Ali just didn't respect the guy, which ended up backfiring when Cooper floored Ali) and Doug Jones. They both did a decent number on Ali and were basically the reason people thought Ali was gonna lose to Liston.   I also know that Ali frequently brought up Oscar “Ringo” Bonavena as another guy who did a number on him.   “Granite Jaw” George Chuvalo did an okay job tagging Ali with hooks throughout as well, which is important as he managed to do that while being a disregarded contender with one good arm. And that was the PRIME Ali that everyone likes to believe was untouchable.
Always loved the Andries story about losing his title to Tommy Hearns and rocking up the next morning at theKronk gym and asking Emmanuel Steward, "train me.'
Emanuel Steward once told me his best job as a trainer was taking a raw Dennis Andries and turning him int a champion.
Mean set ups. Just hold him in place quick like yup right there say cheese
Hackney during the time he was there was rough as f
That dude looked dead, and if he was he'd sadly be only one of ~1,900 to die boxing since 1890. I love this beautiful sport and any two men should be able to decide to go at it, with whatever rules they agree on, but further padding and weighting of the gloves has only served to damage brains. Does anyone support returning to 2 oz gloves?
This is a really lazy way of trying to understand a boxer's career. There is no substitute for living through the periods in the sport and being able to read a name on a resume and remember the build up, the fight, the perceptions before and after etc. Even the scorecards aren't a great resource at times! lol
Pacquiao has 40... but Jeff Horn is considered a 5 star boxer on Boxrec, so... yeah.
So how do you rate fights? What are your metrics to call it a 3 star?
Boxrec’s formula is dogshit, RJJ is listed as the 15th greatest heavy all time, above fucking mike Tyson and George Foreman lmao. IIRC they still have kovalev as the #1 historical cruiserweight despite him fighting once at the weight against some bum.  Edit: RJJ’s no longer the 15th greatest heavyweight… they fixed it, by making him the greatest cruiserweight of all time (????) and making kovalev the second greatest cruiserweight, brilliant algorithm!  Don’t forget, Tyson fury > Holyfield, Larry Holmes, Mike Tyson and George foreman!
Stars don't really matter IMO, if you go further back in time there would be two ATGs fighting for a title and it would only be like 2 stars on Boxrec. They're meaningless
I wont join in on the bashing of boxing rec criteria like everyone else. I'll just join in on the fun hypotheticals. Gervonta Davis goes from 28-0 to 12 - 0 but those 12 are his last 12 fights lol. His first 16 fights seem to be against "cans"   Ryan Garcia goes from 23-0 to 5-0 with those 5 being his last 5 as well. His first 18 fights seem to be against "cans"   I would like to do Bud and Errol but bud obviously has the better record ranking (winning multiple belts across multiple divisions)
Boxrec star ratings suck. It’s crazy how they inflate c level dudes to being 5 stars
Its a rating of the match up not the fighter
Wilder's career goes down to 5 wins 1 draw and 2 losses lmfao
Box rec rates it 1/5 stars on there thing I’m j going off of them
Boxrec has a rating system for each fighter. Their star rating is based on the cumulative rating of both fighters. The higher it is, the more stars the fight is rated.
To be fair it's called BoxRec not BoxRank and it also serves as a great resource to trap newer fans lol. Just wait till Kovalev retires and a new fan follows the sport and tries to argue he's the GOAT cruiser.
Yeah lol there rankings do puzzle me a lot, it’s by no means a perfect metric and if I have more time on my hands I could maybe formulate a better plan to properly do it.
Muhammad Ali vs Larry Holmes is not two 5 star fighters, though.  The stars are an indication of how good the fighters are *at the time of the fight*.
Thanks for not being hostile about this, I’m the only boxing fan in my friend group all my friends watch mma and ufc primarily so I wanted to see if I could make the records be comparable in a strange sense.
Going by that criteria(only counting legit wins)  Wilder would be 4-2-1  Fury 4-0-1  Joshua 8-3  Usyk 9-0  At heavyweight it seems the less padded the record with bums is also the more wins against good fighters. Lol
they had callum smith as their number 1 light heavyweight at one point. it isn’t even vaguely close to being a good measurement of anything
Even then, it’s not done very accurately. If you go back to Robinson or Greb’s era, the stars aren’t as consistent with the fighters’ primes. It’s a good idea, it’s just not fully accurate.
You have an example?   I just glanced at Harry Greb's page, and his fights against Hall of Famers are 4 and 5 star fights.
that's not quite how it happened the first time gabe...
Gabe on a mission to get his ass beat
Man I hope Gabe wins it again but dude has been operating on that Chisora number of brain cells
I like Rosado, but I think Bektemir hit him so hard he doesn't remember what happened
If Gabe times him again and delivers another KO that would be epic.
This is sad
> “It was tough having the fight against ‘Zurdo’ canceled, but now it’s me versus Bek on the biggest fight card of the year,” said Rosado. “I’m focused and ready to put Bek back in check. I look forward to being part of a historical fight card, and I plan on dominating ‘The Bully’ once again!  > “This is the fight I wanted and the most important fight for me today,” said Melikuziev. “This is the fight to right the wrong. I am so lucky to make it on the biggest card of the year. I want to thank my team, my promoter, and of course, Rosado, for giving me this opportunity.”
Me as a fan of Gabe: 😳
Gabe was getting his ass kicked before landing a home run shot
Rosado was so upset he got a W for once, he's rematching Bek to make this right.
Gabe Rosado: I Plan on ~~Dominating~~ getting CTE.  I don't know how they still allow him to fight, he could get seriously hurt, especially against guys like Zurdo or Melikuziev.
Gabe “Payday” Rosado keeps getting the fights that matter to him  and his pockets. Hats off to his promotional team.
Good add to the Tank undercard at least!
Since when did landing a lucky punch after getting touched up “dominating.”? Bek does what Zurdo was destined to do: he stops this punching bag!
Lucky punch
I said that guy's name and my furniture started floating.
Idk bout that fam
Does Gabe have an agent/manager? Why's he going back to fight this no-name guy who he already knocked out... there's literally no upside.  He's got enough of a name, looks, charisma, to transition into acting imo. Easy money, easy life. Seems he's fixin' on getting CTE
So does everyone in here think Rosado’s win was a fluke?
Exactly
He knows damn well what happened. He has spoken about it.
Wonder how much they paid him for Creed? Dudes certainly not Floyd rich but he's gotta be doing well for himself at this point. He's fought literally everyone.
Why the fuck did i read all this.   Mods please ban this fool and send him to boxing circle jerk.
Luv to watch the old school Italian-American fighters. Fun and deceptively crafty style. Thanks for posting!
😐😑😐
Bro it isn’t that funny jfc, you’re spamming it everywhere
[I now understand Thanos….](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cmEPSW_B0zY)
This is lowkey one of the best matchups this year. One thing ppl seem to forget is Haney is only getting better & has improved since his fight w/ Jojo. Also, you can guarantee judges will favor Loma & TR will give him the fight if it’s close.  This will be the toughest fight for both fighters, can’t wait!
What I will say about Loma is that it's usually pressure which he doesn't like. Haney doesn't apply pressure like that, and he's not a puncher at all.   Haney struggled with Jojo Diaz, a southpaw pressure fighter, which Loma is a better version of, if we are being honest. After seeing that fight, I was sure Loma was a bad style match up for Haney. But seeing Loma's fight with Ortiz changes things... Was it just purely ring rust though? Also, I don't think Ortiz fights similarly to Haney.   Haney is a lot younger and bigger though, huge advantages for him. Jojo performance aside, you can see the other way and say he learned so much from fighting someone with a different style than he's used to. Maybe that's what prepares Haney for a Loma fight.  Neither guy are gonna win easy though.
I think Haney wins but I don't think we should underestimate Loma
Loma will be the best fighter Haney has ever fought. Hell def. Try to jab, duck, and hug his way to victory. And worst of all we have to sit through more press conferences with Haney's weirdo dad trying to live vicariously through his son.
This film brought up some interesting points/dynamics that’s gonna come into play in this fight. I still favour Haney but Loma has the toolbox and potential to make this an exhausting night for Devin. One thing is for sure and that is that both guys will be highly motivated.
this breakdown reinforces a lot of what i've been saying about loma's footwork on defense. against a pressure jab loma really struggles to find his footing BUT devin isn't known to keep his foot on that gas and come forward enough to adequately take advantage of this flaw.   while i favor haney by narrow decision this fight will come down to who's willing to come forward more frequently. devin will have loma's side stepping to deal with and loma will have to get through haney's jab to do any real work.
This fight will be good, chess match. Haney size advantage will play the bigger factor
Good to hear his videos are getting some promotion on this reddit. Worth watching 100%, all his videos.
let's just hope julie lederman has been banned from arena.
This is stupid. Loma was great, but time has taken over. Haney will win, the question will be where will he go from there? Sit out for a year?
It is unfortunate that this fight isn't as hyped up as it should be outside of core boxing fans.   Stylistically this is a great match up. It is for true undisputed title. If Loma wins, we will also likely get a match against Shakur too. If Haney wins, we are very likely to see Haney at 140 immediately challenge for the WBO title.   Winner definitely gets a clear spot in p4p top 10 too.
Loma is one of my favourite fighters of the past decade. I rate him as the best I have seen since a prime Floyd - and Floyd as the best since a prime RJJ.  I'm hoping he wins. But realistically, he is getting older - and Haney is a great fighter with age and size on his side. I suspect Haney will take the win.
Dude spent too much time at the amateur, time is catching up to him. Too bad too. I think Haney and his team picked a perfect time to give this veteran a good fight, in what would been a easy fight, once upon time.  It’s that age old question fight we about to see.
Lomo about to eat his third L
Lord Haney 120 - 108
Lomo about to get exposed for the third time.
Damn Haney fan boys really are the absolute worst jfc the posts from them on this thread
Man this will be a great fight
I’m a Haney fan, but Loma, 100% healthy, will win this fight. It’s fighter code to have no excuses, but I genuinely believe his shoulder injury right before his Loss was legit. You could tell he was limited on what he could throw.  Haney is a defensive fighter with quick reflexes and pretty decent power, but Lomachenko is on another level. Despite the size and reach disadvantage my money is on Loma. This is a dream matchup for me, I’ve been following Haney for years and knew right away when I saw him, unpolished, he was going to become big. Here we are all these years later, and couldn’t be more excited for this matchup.
I think this is so exciting because even though he's undisputed, Haney still has an element of being untested so far. And Lomachenko even outside of his prime will surely give him that test.   Jojo Diaz has lost his last 3 now and isn't a lightweight anyways. Haney's signature wins so far are both over Kambosos who is a bit of an unknown talent himself. I'm not sure if George is even a top 10 lightweight at the moment until he faces a few more names
>Also, you can guarantee judges will favor Loma & TR will give him the fight if it’s close.  Strictly speaking, older fighters on the decline don't get gifted decisions against younger champions. If it's close I'd expect it to go to Haney.  Looking forward to the fight regardless.
It’s an exciting matchup to you cause they might rob Haney?
I think the key is in how Loma downloads information.  He gets a lot in those early rounds, with feints, level changes, slips. Putting pressure on him makes it harder for him to make fake offensive moves to get information.  That pressure doesn't have to be heavy or intense, it just has to stop him from thinking.   Haney's jabs are perfect for that type of interruption. As almost all breakdowns of Haney show is that hes always looking for that tell that you are about to do something in range and tag you as you think about it.   I think Loma's best bet is to sell out inside early.  Skip the download and feel confident that Haney doesn't have the power to hurt you and that you'll get the bettee of any exchange.  If he stays outside for more than 3 rounds, trying to get information, he's going to lose.  It'll be close, but probably a redux of the Lopez fight where he gets it 5 good rounds and haney comes alive late.
Against Jojo Diaz, haney was willing to stay in the pocket much more, he didn’t keep his distance and made it boring like kambosos . He fights based on his opponent seems like. Linares and Diaz, he showed his more dog side while against kambosos he wasn’t gonna risk the undisputed belts .  I think against a technician like Loma , he will make sure to use his distance and will make it boring if he has to in order to win. Great fight either way , better than Davis Garcia
Loma will win.
When did Haney struggle with Jojo? How did that narrative even get started? Haney won 9-3 or 8-4, at worst
The Dad's need to sit in the bleachers and shut up.
Ima fight every comment i see like this, i dont get your guys deal with bill? I think the teos dad hate is justified but bill? Come on. Does bill say dumb shit sometimes that gets devin in unnecessary heat, like w the shakur stuff sure. But that man raised his son and theyre always polite and carry good energy. Hes proud to have trained his son and taken him to world class level in boxing. Does bill stand in devins corner screaming dumb advise like teo sr? No. He gives good instructions like a coach should. He talks about religion and raising his son right. Is he not allowed to be proud of his son and his own journey?  ”Living vicariously through his son” yea ok. If bill wasnt even involved with the training or camp at all then yes it would be really weird for him to be this outspoken but comeon hes one of his main coaches. And he apparently knows what hes doin aswell.   And tbh, haney needs a second man in the press conference, hes not really the most comfortable at speaking in those situations
Julie Lederman, Adelaide Byrd, and Eugenia Williams will be the judges.
Yup bunch of other just as good guys aswell, check out shortboxing if your into learning techniques and not just fight analysis
r/eyebleach
Bob arum would give it to Loma since he can make Shakur undisputed champ easily.
I’m excited bc it’s the best matchup @135 since who knows. But hell yea, the fact Dev will have to put on a pretty convincing performance to secure a victory over Loma is exciting af too!  I think he can do it! Wouldn’t be surprised if Loma won convincingly either.
I can see this all happening, I think you're right that Loma has to have a quicker start. Though I do remember Haney not having as much success with his jab as usual against Jojo though. Could it be that Haney finds it harder to find his jab against a southpaw?
>Against Jojo Diaz, haney was willing to stay in the pocket much more, he didn’t keep his distance and made it boring like kambosos  It's not that simple. Haney did not choose to stay in the pocket against Jojo, he just wasn't able to keep him off. With Kambosos, he doesn't know how to cut the ring off and is not a pressure fighter, so Haney can keep the fight on the outside. Styles make fights. Haney is not comfortable on the inside.  >I think against a technician like Loma , he will make sure to use his distance and will make it boring if he has to in order to win  If he manages to stop Loma from cutting the ring off and keeping him off him, I can see this happening. But it'll be easier said than done.  >Great fight either way , better than Davis Garcia  100%
Stop saying he was willing to be in the pocket, he was forced to by a good boxer.
Losing 4 rounds is a sign of struggling. Haney won the fight comfortably, fair and square, don't get me wrong, but Jojo made him work for it, that's what I meant.
We know Papachenko will do that as he always does. Not so sure about Bill.
Honest question, after watching haneys press conferences do you think hes excellent on the mic, or is he maybe thankful his dad is up there and answering some questions for him? Maybe its haney wanting his dad to talk more
I almost punched my monitor when I saw the words "Adelaide Byrd".
Are those really the judges or you just joking??!?
Cheers my man, I just subscribed. I really want a good boxing instagram page that covers like all boxing/news /content, cos sometimes I find out about a world title fight and I’m like who’s that?? He has a world title but I don’t know who he is?? Maybe I’m asking for too much hahaha
Bingo.
That was mostly because Jojo was trying to push the attack.  His goal was to go through the jab, and along the way he figured out holes in the jab. Loma should be willing to do that.  But judging from Kambosos's face, Haney's jab might have more snap than it did against Jojo.
Haney was choosing to cover up against diaz much more instead of just clinching . Throwing more combos . He was trying to end the boring narrative. Imo he could turned diaz and made it way easier , took advantage of his flat footness.  But he chose to shell up, stay in pocket , instead of clinching or moving .  Yeah it’s not easy as said , I think we will see a lot of clinching this fight . Will be very technical . Ryan vs Davis to me is rolly 2.0
Nah. Dude literally could have clinch so many times but he put his hand up and let Diaz throw combos on him. When has Haney ever done that ?
Diaz is good bemut haney has controlled better fighters.
Diaz is good bemut haney has controlled better fighters.
Jojo made Russell Jr work hard too. He is a solid fighter.
Real Judges, all have a history of very egregious scorecards
Honeslty twitter is way better than instagram for that. I just follow all the boxers im interested in and then i follow some ”boxing community famous people” like michael benson, ray jackson, chicken tawk etc  If your lookin for a fun boxing podcast thats enjoyable and still follows the news check out thaboxingvoice. Pretty much listen to their live shows every day during work
Interesting! That's really good analysis, Loma definitely can't afford to show too much respect. Man, I can't wait for this fight.
Not only that, he wasn’t confident the ref was on his side as he was excessively clinching his last fight before Jojo. It was a Mexican crowd that night
I know Jojo is solid. I'm just saying, Loma is definitely a level or 2 above Jojo, and their base style is similar (pressure technicians), and both southpaws too.
Yeah cheers bro. I appreciate it. I don’t use Twitter, I try to stick with one source, ‘try’ hahaha. I do have reddit and YouTube though, so I use that sometimes to find inside news. I just followed that podcast group, so see how I go. I started listening to teddy atlas’ podcast but sometimes he just rumbles about stuff, like no offence, I’m here for boxing not NBA hahaha. But seems like Twitter is where to go for the latest news, I followed a page called ring of highlights that post tweets from the boxing world, I appreciate and love that type of stuff.
Loma struggled with Linares, Ortiz and even Campbell. People keep acting like Loma is this perfect fighter but he has already been beaten twice by lesser fighters than Haney. If anything, Loma has shown more holes in his game than Devin.
Yeah i find teddy atlas a bit boring, also has some weird takes sometimes🤷‍♀️
He’s an interesting fella, I kinda like him tbh, just rambles a bit but knowledgeable. Also, be good to have another person to chat about boxing, feel free to add me on Insta if you’re keen to chat about future fights and just everything boxing. Roy_m_14
Not with Usyk and Fury holding those belts
It's possible for him to pick up a vacant belt. I could see Usyk vacating the IBF eventually with Hrgovic being the mandatory as there's not really any money in that fight
Only if a belt gets vacated and they give him a shot against Chris Arreola or something ridiculous. At least in AJ’s current form.
looks like andre ward and AJ has a kid in the thumbnail
He's got a slim punchers chance against his current competition:  Usyk: we saw what happened and nothing will change, AJ gets pointed out by UD.   Fury: would knock AJ out by the 5th round   Wilder: would knock AJ out by the 3rd round
Anthony Joshua vs Charles Martin 2 for the vacant WBA belt 2024
Hip hip
People give him way too little credit. I think he looked really good in that fight. Great jab, good movement, good defense, decent footwork,…   And since Fury continues ducking the big fights, I start to question Fury’s abilities.
Of course he can, people are forgetting how much younger he is than the other top guys.   &#x200B;  AJ is 33. Usyk is 36, Wilder is 37, Joyce is 37. Fury is only 34, but I think he probably aged worse than AJ considering how he ballooned up and came back down.   &#x200B;  There's a very good chance that if AJ stays active, and builds himself up again, he will still be near the top of the division (think, top 5 rated at more than 1 governing body). Usyk said he will be retiring soon, Wilder and Joyce can't be that far behind.   &#x200B;  Once Usyk's belts get vacated, AJ is still a huge draw, so there's a very good chance he'll be offered a fight for the vacant title.
Yes. If you've got the money, you'll get a belt. Aj will win again.
Comments here are riddled with naivety.  The question from OP isn't Will he become a 3-time weight champion, it's whether he can.  It's a possibility question.  99% of the people saying he can't, are the same people that said AJ would have beaten usyk, so ergo tuck your money away under the bed until "fight night " like Mayweather says.  Should it be possible, I don't see an AJ usyk 3.   So Fury being a smart man of which he's underestimated for being, knows AJ is forced to go for the WBC, and now just because may/may not have ducked usyk doesn't mean he won't take a fight with AJ.  AJ has a some chances of winning against fury, whether he will is another question, but he has a chance.  I'll extend your question with whether he can be undisputed - wilder, fury, AJ, fury - all can become undisputed.  If fury takes a fight with AJ, and loses, AJ holds the WBC, whilst usyk whose beaten him holds the 3 other major belts. **Fury knows AJ would be naive to go for usyk to become undisputed, so he's team if they're smart will wait out usyk**, fury will then have a chance against Usyk, and potentially be a in position to reclaim an undisputed rematch with AJ.  So essentially, fury by NOT fighting usyk, has opened doors for himself, and insured that the undisputed title will be dictated on *his* terms.  All usyk has to do is defend his current belts, and fight the next WBC title holder to become undisputed.  Wilder - who I'd say is a dark horse in this one, should he face an undisputed usyk would probably give usyk his most precarious fight. He's a 1 punch knockout artist, and so far usyk is good defensively and offensively but he's no Mayweather - whose all defence. Usyk has actually eaten some punches from Chisora and Joshua also, so it'll be questionable how many wilder blows he can take.  For fury to be undisputed, just needs to hold onto his WBC and fight Usyk.  So all 4 CAN become undisputed, but whether 1 can is a question of probability not possibility..
As long as Usyk, Fury, and Wilder are still fighting, Joshua has no chance to become a legitimate champion. He could still win secondary/international belts against guys like Parker, Ruiz, Whyte, Zhang, and Hrgovic.
NO
If I was aj id fight Otto then whyte then 1 last pay day in a smashing to fury. I don’t see AJ beating fury, wilder, Joyce, or Usyk
I wouldn't bet on it, but he definitely "could".  Especially if/when the belts become fractured.
Since Joshua is the money tree at HW he will have a few cracks at the belt again.   However he most likely isn’t beating Usyk or Fury  He will most likely be a front runner if they vacate
No.
..... without ever fighting 2 of the best guys in the division
Absolutely.  Usyk gets stripped of a belt for shenanigans and AJ sweeps in and picks it up.  Usyk or Fury both look like they are ready to announce their retirement (Fury even has practice at that).    I assume 3x means 1 of the 4 (WBA, WBC, IBF, WBO) belts.  And not some 2nd tier version of one of those belts.
I don't see AJ making any money unless he steps up competition. No one wants to see Whyte again or any other regurgitated garbage Hearn has set up. My guess is he'll stick around long enough to get a belt back when Fury and Usyk hang them up.
femi.
Sure, if Fury relinquished the belt and fights Dubois.
On other news a recent barn restoration was completed with the addition of a huge wooden barn door. It's good at moving in two directions , has zero head movement and had nice thick planks.   The farmer has called it  her ant door.
No
I'm sure they can figure out a 3 letter combination that hasn't been used before, get a belt made, and pull Joe Hipp out of retirement to fight him for it. We all heard him calling Joe out. Hipp Hipp!
Sure, once Fury, Usyk, Wilder and Alvarez retire.
Yeah, Usyk's already beaten him twice. And Fury won't fight someone with a pulse so he's not fighting him either.
I think people underestimate Joyce, I see there is great chance him fighting Fury and I think Joyce will be clear winner and absolutely destroy Fury.
Careful. He will accuse you of racism lol
3 time champ baby. 1st time Charles Martin. 2nd time Runnning away from 300 pound Andy Ruiz who trained literally 7 days and 3rd time: Manuel Charr for the regular belt!!
At the same time who else would he fight. Wilder has no promoter, who's putting up thr money    Fury fight is dead.   Anyone else right now is probably as big a name for Usyk
If Usyk gets stripped of one he could easily end up fighting Hrgovic or Dubois for a world title. In such a case it's not impossible to imagine him as a 'three time world champion'.  I think the better question is 'Will AJ ever be viewed by the majority of fans as the top dog in the division again?' and Id say the answer is no.
> Fury: would knock AJ out by the 5th round >  >  >  > Wilder: would knock AJ out by the 3rd round  Absolutely insane this place.
Joyce gets him outta there in 8.
If Fury beats AJ, it will be by a horrendously boring decision. I don't know how you see that fight ending with an early Fury stoppage.   Either Fury neutralises AJ with a bunch of feints, and both fighters throw basically no punches for the whole fight, leading to Fury UD, or by some miracle AJ actually comes to fight (still in the early stages of working with Derrick James, let's see what he can do with time), in which case it would be far more likely to see Fury getting stopped than vice versa.  Usyk fair enough, man went out and proved himslef beyond any doubts.  Wilder - lets see him actually win against any top fighter before we start assuming he'll KO AJ with ease.
Fury took longer to KO a shot, old Whyte coming of a brutal loss. And Wilder remains the most overrated, manufactured hype job in boxing history. This is honestly a hilariously bad take.
>Fury: would knock AJ out by the 5th round   I doubt it. How many boxers has Fury knocked out within 5 rounds?
Fury would sleep this fool, whether he’s a duck or not.
Jermaine Franklin is tough and has heart. Who else fought AJ and Whyte and lasted 12 with both and didn't suffer a knockdown
I get that fury has been duckin big fights and is an asshole but I just don’t see a world where aj beats him
Thing is by the time Usyk who has a belt slows down, AJ will also be on the wrongside of his 30's. It's also not like the division is going to stay stagnant. Younger guys will start hitting their prime.  AJ's in a bad spot where he needs the guys he can't beat to age out before he starts showing enough miles where the division passes him. And even worse if guys like Usyk/Wilder/Fury show some longevity.   My bet is if AJ becomes a champ again, it's because someone vacated and he got the first crack at the belt
Wilder is far more dangerous than aj is
I don't underestimate Joyce, h2h I think he's a great fighter and a clear #3 behind Usyk and Fury, who would both slip and roll around his jab all night. Wilder and AJ don't know how to really pull that off though and so both of them would end up trying to go *through* the Juggernaut which would be a lot harder.  I'll also say that anyone who can't get around that jab is in for a long brutal night. Joyce is 6'6 270 diced and puts all his weight behind that lead jab. If he's touching you up with it...... it's gonna hurt and allow him to pick up steam, just like the Dubois and Parker fights. Hell he fucking flattened Takam with it too.
I don’t know why your being downvoted this is literally factual lol
Anthony Joshua would knock u out kid and so would Charles Martin, so would Manuel Charr and so would a 400 lbs Ruiz!
Idk, anybody. Ruiz even
Wilder I think could easily put him out in 3 but Fury might take 10
I think AJ lasts longer but AJ definitely loses to both badly, Fury / UD and Wilder / KO.   If AJ fights hesitantly like he’s been fighting after Ruiz, he’s absolutely getting KO’d against Wilder. If AJ is too timid to finish him he has no chance. He’s not dancing around Wilder for 12 rds and he’s not surviving that right hand.
Joshua is terrible and looks to his corner for help during the fight. You’re the insane one, he never was good anyway.
What’s insane? Joshua is done. Ruiz made him quit, that is a fact; and you think these other predictions are insane?
I kind of doubt it.
I think AJ is proving to be up there as a manufactured hype job as well, if history is serving me correct.
This is downvoted but AJ had a brawl with Whyte, while Fury comfortably shut him out and then KOd him easily.  Fury was able to take Wilders best flush in his face for three whole fights, I think the current consensus is AJ doesn't have that in him.  With Fury's herky jerky feighnts and AJs cautious tendencies post Ruiz I think the style matchup is a nightmare for AJ. I don't think he'd every get to be comfortable throwing combos.  Realistically, going on what we've seen each guy do since 2019, Fury would be the massive favourite in that fight, no matter how much of an arsehole he is.
Please don't start selling us Franklin as elite, he showed resilience, sure, but he was a handpicked KO victim by Eddie, who promised a KO in 6 rounds, there was no risk in this fight.
And skilled. He has good headmovement and counters
I’m getting pretty tired of hearing about Franklin lol  He put up a fight, good for him. He honored his name. Good for him. The guy is a part time pro boxer prior to all of this. He wasn’t even inside of the top 25 until he took the AJ fight, which was strange bc he just came off a loss in the books to Whyte.   Stop trying to justify AJ’s collapse through his opponent who “showed” heart, who shouldn’t even have been in there in the first place.  This is a former unified, and 2 time heavyweight champion, former #1 in the division. Just taking an opponent of that stature to “rebound” speaks to where he’s at, his performance, albeit a dominant win by points, was even more of a disappointment than taking on Franklin  I’m not spewing AJ hate, I’ve also never been a fan, but fuck it’s brutal to see an athlete on that level fall off, in any sport. I feel sorry for the guy
I’d like to see AJ against Tom Schwartz genuinly believe he could get AJ out of there. Hearn IMO is looking for a big fight for the AJ cash out prize now
Why? Because he beat Wilder? That’s the only thing he has going for him, and Wilder is a terrible boxer who got outclassed by almost any opponent. Fury has a great chin and that’s why he beat Wilder.
Yeah for sure my guy here speaking the truth.   We love Deontay he's the best.
I mean Fury can be evasive but I don't think he slips and rolls most people's jabs. In the first Wilder he was slipping a lot of Wilder's right hands but Wilder was telegraphing his shots like crazy. In the old days Fury was successful with his feints which kept more defensively responsible fighters from pulling the trigger at all.
They act like being 2 time champ means much. Like his fake gold Medal he didn’t deserve they bring up. It’s funny
Great analysis
Oh.  So AJ's 3x champion would be the r/boxing belt.  Beats up a boxing fan.
Ruiz would be a very good name for Usyk. I even think it might be a great fight to watch.
Not sure on Ruiz. He's looked like a one hit wonder since beating Joshua.
>  he never was good anyway.  Still has the best resume right now....
>done. Ruiz made him quit  This narrative that AJ quit against Ruiz is just not true. He got off the canvas multiple times and continued fighting. People say he intentionally didn't listen to the referees instructions, but he was clearly out of it because, well, he was concussed.
You think less than 8? I said 8 because Joyce is a bit slow. Maybe I’m 7, I don’t know. One thing for certain is that Femi will get stopped.
Wilder fought part time journeymen for 32 fights, then was magically placed in a world title elimator by the wbc(which should be between 2 top 15s)he instead fights rates 26th Malick Scott(his coach)who gets knocked out without even being hit. Then he beats Stiverne for his belt, a bunch of non-qualified title defences later his mandatory is a 2 year retired Stiverne on short notice and then he beats his first actual top 10 opponent Luis Ortiz(number 5 by Ring Magazin)who was 40 years old before losing to Fury..  Joshua beat regional contenders, he fought the same journeyman Wilder fought in his 32nd fight in his 11th. He then bears Whyte when both were unbeaten contenders for the European and British titles, cementing his contender status(Which Wilder never did), he then beats Martin for the IBF, beats Klitschko(number 1 by Ring Magazine), beats unbeaten champion Parker(number 3 by Ring Magazine), beats elite contender Povetkin(Number 3 by Ring Magazine)loses to Ruiz(7th by Ring Magazine)then beats him, beats Pulev(previously 3rd, now dropped to 10th by Ring Magazine)then loses to Usyk(pound for pound number 1 by Ring Magazine). In 28 fights Joshua has done all of this, Whilst Wilders whole legacy was getting gifted his belt and beating a mediocre and old Ortiz in 47 fights.   Joshua is the furthest thing from a hype job. Fury's only got 3 wins over top 10 contenders, 2 of which were also beaten by none other than Joshua and the only other one being Wilder himself. So if Joshua is a hype job then both Fury and Wilder are what? Joshua took the hard route, he fought the tough fights win or lose, he's the very opposite of a hypejob. He got where he was by winning(and losing)by taking the harder route
Tbf both AJ and Whyte were different fighters when they fought compared to Fury and Whyte who fought just last year.
I said tough not elite dude. Franklin doesn't beat anyone in the top 10 or even 15.
Especially off the back of fighting Whyte.  'Give Joshua some credit he fought a guy that went 12 with Dillian Whyte'.  What Dillian Whyte that everyone on this sub has been adamant is an absolute bum and is washed for the last 18 months?  Now because AJ struggled against Franklin it means going the distance with Whyte is seen as measure of being a good opponent again?
>Please don't start selling us Franklin as elite  He didn't. No need to get annoyed.
💀
So Ruiz can beat aj but fury can’t ?? Sound logic
Bronze Bomber Wild for Wilder
Yea haha what a fraud winning the HW title twice smh.
What u talking about kid? Weirdo stick to Skyrim u no nothing about boxing!
He is not a boxing fan! Just a coward talking rubbish on the internet about our Anthony Joshua! He’d never have the same energy in real life!
Afterwards there would be posts in r/boxing saying the random Redditor was actually elite and top 10 in the world, he's got a great jaw and he's a shorter faster fighter blah blah blah  *(Seriously the "shorter faster fighter" meme cracks me up because AJ is 6'5 255! Like 98% of the division is 'shorter and faster' compared to that. 😆😆)*
The biggest lie ever told about Joshua. He’s 50/50 or loses every time fights anyone his age. Povetkin who was 37 only good win, rest 40 year olds. Just stop with good resume BS
He’s still concussed now.
Joyce is overrated to me the only person more overrated is Dubois. It is impressive he KO Parker, but at the same time, Parker has looked like shit recently, i thought he lost the first fight to Chisora.   Aj weakness is speed. Ruiz has hand speed on the inside and Usyk has the footwork and hand speed. Joyce is just to slow for Aj he will see everything coming and be able to get off combos before they land.
I'm so tired of hearing this lol. Whyte was never that good. He made a name for himself off of just barely scraping by Chisora and Parker. Not exactly performances that suggested he would've ever given Fury a good fight.
They don't have many common opponents, but I think looking at the whole picture it would be insane to favour AJ if the two were ever to face off.  People clown on Furys resume and inactivity, but Joshua's best win this decade was an ancient Pulev; whereas Fury has two wins over Wilder and one over Whyte which are all better.  Since the Ruiz fiasco Joshua just has not got a great win, and got absolutely schooled by Usyk twice in that span, and the longer that run lasts the more you need to question if he's still at that level.
Think he could beat Martin and Ortiz.
I never said that. That’s a stupid interpretation what I wrote.
DAMN you got my ass! Put all two of your brain cells together for that one, and boy did it pay off
The random Redditor may have lost to AJ, but he'd beat any other boxer.  AJ maybe #1, but the Redditor is clearly #2.  No need to prove it.  Redditor already did enough to prove their (0-1) legacy is on track for ATG, making AJ the GOAT.
He didn't say good, he said the best. When you compare it to the competition, yes it's probably still the best.
He’ll be able to get off jabs, or one twos*
Thank YOU. Whyte was always a guy just below contender level. He's more of a gatekeeper at best. He just got talked up like crazy because of the narrative being built that AJ had some fantastic resume.
>Joshua's best win this decade  Why use the term decade but really only refer to the last 2 and a half years.
Naw your right fury can’t beat a mentally broken AJ you got it
U r clearly the one lacking brain cells 😂 couldn’t be more obvious that I’m taking the piss if I tried!
I mean decade as since the beginning of 2020.  I was just breaking his career up pre and post Ruiz.  I guess it's fair to say his best win since Ruiz is Ruiz, but the Ruiz chapter of his career is just a massive fiasco that isn't impressive on his CV at all.   If we look at the '20s his win over 39 year old Pulev is pretty much his only win worth noting, and that's over the course of 3.25 years from age 30-33.
Bro, you're acting like he fought so many people. Since the begining of the decade (2 years), he has only fought Usyk and Pulev. Do you not see how stupid of a stat this is?
No because my point is, whether it's down to inactivity or not, unless he beats a top guy in the division by December he's going to have gone 4 years without a good win. In the middle of his prime. All off the back of one shock lost that totally changed his entire approach.  If you'd told anyone in March 2019 he'd lose to Ruiz, then his best wins in the coming 4 years would be Ruiz in the rematch and then Pulev theyd tell you that it would be a hugely disappointing twist of his career. And that's exactly what's happened.  So the reality is that ever since March 2019 his career has been hugely disappointing.
Okay. Since he was handed a belt and beat a washed Klitchko on a two year lay off he beat  \- Takem who is kind of a B- tier at best  \- Parker who imo is sort of the same gatekeeper level as Whyte  \- Povetkin who was 38 at the time and winding down and his career quickly spiraled towards retirement in the next few fights after that  \- a fat out of shape Ruiz who looked like crap  \-Pulev a guy who just lost a decision to Chisora   \- Franklin where AJ looked like shit and Franklin is probably the worst opponent he's had since he won the belt.
Dude, we had Covid, and then he had to wait for the rematch with Usyk when a war started in Ukraine. Be nice if he was more active, but shit happens when hou hold majority of the belts,  context is everything.   Its not like he ate some bad boar meat, got PED suspension, and then went on a cocain bender for 3 years.
Did this fight really drop Shakur’s stock? I wasn’t able to watch it but I remember him getting a lot of hate for his performance
This was such a bizarre performance from Conceicao. It was like he didn’t know how to throw a proper punch/ he almost looked like he was in a dream state in there. Shakur also threw a disgraceful amount of low blows that night. Was not happy with this fight at all looking back.
Low blow city this fight, plus Andre dickriding like crazy.
Lol damn I remember Conceicao being much more sharper with his punches in the beginning. In this clip he was swinging for the fences slow af.  Can’t wait to witness Shakur’s 1st fight @135 this Saturday. Next is Loma!
Haney Stevenson would be a technical matchup I’d love to see but that matchup would put the typical non-boxer fan to sleep .
Looking forward for the next Robson Conceicção fight, man have heart.
Don’t get me wrong, Shakur isn’t a power puncher but he’s got some pop with amazing skills. Haney has no pop. He can’t even hurt his opponent, lol. He went the distance with an ancient Gamboa without even hurting him once! He couldn’t even hurt Linares! Do not put Shakur and Haney in the same category. One has A-level skills and can keep his opponent honest, the other is a weightbully with no power and just jabs and grabs with a sus chin. They are not the same!
Wearing brightly colored gloves is a mistake because they easier to see
ZZzzztenvenson Shakur🥱🥱
probs have to watch it back but I don't remember Stevenson 'dominating' like everyone's claiming. Or at least the rounds where he did win were close - I don't believe any round was a shut out?  Edit: with the exception of this one posted, obvs
Shakur is in my opinion the next p4p
He will put anyone to sleep! — outside of the ring
Hurts who?
Robson was so weight drained he was a zombie with no power.
Pretty hilarious how somehow Shakur's stock dropped after whopping Conceicao like 11-1 while hurting him multiple times
The true king of 135's campaign begins this weekend....will you be there?
That's some The Matrix shit.
I was unimpressed with this fight because Shakur couldn't close the show. He has the best defensive, best accuracy (head punches only, his body shots fall extremely low) but absolutely no power.
His spatial awareness is insane.
Seriously conceicao looked horrible here I have no idea wtf he thinks he is punching at or what his punching technique is
Pega e
I don't know anything about this fight, but that dude in yellow has maybe the worst punching mechanics/form I've seen in a while. A lot of unnecessary movement too.
Shakur, Haney, and Tank…ohhhwee the future of the sport is in good hands pick your poison.
Made him look like a jerk, forsure.  But not anything other than that, for me atleast.
He just did alot of unnecessary B.S. low blows throwing his opponent to the ground multiple times, arguing with the ref and missing weight  Whos stock drops for me in this fight was Andre ward he would never say bad word about shakur the whole night even though he was being a shithead clearly but hes allways so quick to trash anyone else about anything.
No idea why other than the weigh in. It was a great performance against a very good boxer. The fight was 1 sided.
People are dumb….dude literally beat up a boxer most people felt was actually the second best 130 pounder for 12 rounds and people on the internet acted like it was a bad performance….smh the internet don’t know shit about boxing
Completely dominated an Olympic gold medalist/ champion, nah it didn't drop his stock
Only to haters. He dominated the fight and hurt Robson multiple times!
The bigots try to trash Shakur at every turn. They will never win.
Nope, he beat the brakes off Robson. Stopping him would have been mercy rather than the prolonged beating. He only got hate because of the low blows, which were exaggerated anyways.
Shakur has 0 power. You saw how the girl on the street moved him around. Newrap needs to stop posting like Shakur is worth watching “box” when all his fights look rinse and repeat and fall asleep by 7th round. I watched all his fights and only twice could I keep attention to baby hands Stevenson
I was there & the hometown crowd was upset he didn’t get the knockout
Shakur makes fighters look terrible. I think for his distance management and he doesn't do much flashy defense, so he kinda makes the other opponents punches look really telegraphed. And then I think as the fight progresses they actually do fight worse and worse so combination of both  The low-blows are frustrating for sure, Bam had a similarly frustrating performance last time around also
Shakur is terrible he had to low blow and foul this dude the whole time. All his fights are horrible besides the 36 year old Marine fight who retired next fight and Valdez who just got popped for PEDs and won a robbery before Shakur. He’s got talent but 0 power and all his fights are pathetic to watch. Boxing will be officially dead if Shakur and Haney are the face of it for 10 years. Make Floyd Mayweather Jr look like Gatti
I remember Roy Jones would do the same for Andre. I think fighters just stick with folks who are inspired by them out of respect. Shakur idolizes Ward, Ward idolized Roy.
Ward and Shakur have both been managed by James Prince so I’m wondering if that’s why he dick rides Shakur so hard
Next is Haney*
Hobson fades badly in fights.
Who cares what a non-boxer fan has to say about boxing.  They are the future of the sport tell those dickheads to go watch MMA.
Shut up! You can’t speak about Lord Haney like that
Lol, talkin about devin like he aint got no skill. U just another hater lol
Dont think it matters all that much bru
Watch it back
Not with those pillow fists.
What??? I  know you can’t be serious
Hobson got cooked like a Brazilian barbeque
Yeah to the nuts
Yes, I will be there sir
ur right. But guy is a gold olympic medalist and should have been a world champ (robbed)
because andre ward fought the same way.
Andre Ward is one if the most openly biased commentator out there. It's not news.
I mostly didn’t like the fact he threw like 20 low blows and before the fight missed weight, he dominated the fight but that was definitely not his best performance
I didn't see anyone say it was a bad performance from his actual boxing.  It was the other shit like missing weight (for a damn title fight nonetheless), the shoving, and the excessive low blows.
I was really impressed of Shakur this fight. Robson is a talent and will go on to do great things now that Shakur isn’t in 130 anymore . I didn’t expect Shakur to run through Robson and walk him down like this at all. Shakur hype is real
Not really dumb. Dude threw 20 low blows , missed weight and was arguing with the ref and throwing the fighter to the ground constantly . Ward was clearly showing major favoritism by not saying a word about him shitty behavior and performance . Just trashy
Not counting the numerous low blows he scored during the fight and was never punished for? I like shakur style but you dont need to call everyone that criticizes him as “haters”, that fight was an awful demonstration of his abilities
Facts.
Bro your profile pic makes me think you might be a wee bit biased, that said I’m not a crazy fan of shakur  myself (although he’s a good boxer, just don’t think he’s gonna carry power from 140 onwards )
I remember Ward used to not call Shakur fights for a while bc of this and the fact he used to managed him or something. Then he started calling them
Haney moves up regardless so it’s likely gonna be Loma
The fighters’ bank accounts …
Loma is no Kambosos. Be prepared for what’s to come.
Yeah, it’s a skill to be that boring in a combat sport. He has no pop, he has no chin, he has no skill beyond jab and grab. At least he has you as a fan. 🤷
He was supposed to hope you wasn’t surprised?
Juicy and tasty?
I didn't know his nuts were on his chin!
And you would be right to not like that. Shakur cheated by missing weight, and cheated by throwing constant low blows the entire fight. It was , while a dominant performance, also a boring fight. So yes his stock dropped a bit from this.
🙄 overblown, and missing weight shit happens 🤷🏾‍♂️ especially when everyone knows your moving up…shit not that deep
"Awful demonstration" yet dominated an Olympic gold medalist, dropped him, and hurt him numerous times. Not bad for a fighter who has this stigma of not having power, when alleged power punchers like Valdez couldn't even hurt this guy and arguably lost!
Yea I’m biased. I’ve sat through all his fights in pain and I can’t sleep and somehow fell asleep in 2 of them. That says it all
Haney is no Jamaica Ortiz. No need to worry though, even after Lomachenko loses he will still be undefeated in his world, maybe in yours too 😂
You going with loma? Wanna bet a 100?😤
The fight played out pretty much as expected. Hobson is a good fighter, but not in King 'kur's class.
They’re on his dick
Cheating? Stop it…y’all better call it cheating if Ryan comes in heavy 🙄
🇯🇲
I don’t make bets with internet strangers.
Robson is a good fighter that looked totally drained even at the weigh in. From the opening bell he had no energy.
When he hurt him in rounds 4, 6 and 11 it was to the chin and body though.....so where are his balls located my kind sir?
Isn’t acting dishonestly to gain an advantage the definition of cheating?
So Danny jacobs was cheating?
Apparently the fight will be announced at the Gervonta Davis vs Ryan Garcia fight massive news if true!
they can’t keep doing this to us, right?
Damn boxing really said fuck it this year lol
Can they please do it for the sport and make a stacked undercard too.  On paper the Davis and Garcia undercard is pretty disappointing considering the years of build up for the fight
This is what it feels like when a girl cheats on you 20 times and keeps coming back.  We forgive her. We let our guard down. And cry ourselves to sleep when she does it again.
Secret service needs to handle Spence vehicle business for this fight to happen. Otherwise he gonna have some Final Destination shit happening.
Fool me once shame on you  Fool me twice shame on me  Fool me thrice and I’ll still be excited
We've been here before. Not believing nothing until its finalized
car crashes, layoffs, retina tears, his own idiocy at times lol, wont stop this dude from fighting top guy after top guy
Meh, I’m done being disappointed.
I don’t believe this until they’re in the ring.
Why would I care right now? Gotta see those ring walks to get my juices flowing
Obligatory “I’ll believe it when the ref asks them to touch gloves” 🤷🏻‍♂️
*appears*
I'll believe it when they're in the ring and the bell sounds.
I believe it just cause remember a month ago spectrum had it on their tv guide as a PPV lmao. Crazy how that might be true
Spence fought Danny Garcia after a 14 month layoff and a horrific car accident. He then unified with Ugas after a 16 month layoff and a potential career threatening eye injury. He is now unifying with Crawford off a 14 month layoff after Crawford refused to fight Spence coming off a 14 month layoff by opting to fight a Kardashian instead.   Spence really is built different
2023 is looking to be the best year of boxing in the last 10 years, if only that fat dosser took the Usyk fight..
"Sources say..."  "It is believed..."  You guys are all dumbasses for taking this article seriously, and deserve to be disappointed.
Lol. Unfortunately for me I’m not excited for it anymore, and they will miss out on a lot of buys compared to if they did it earlier. Of course I’ll still tune in tho. Spence by decision
Crawford is so damn overrated
What are the betting odds on this actually happening? I'm putting $300 on Davis and $3000 on this fight not being made this year?
Please please please please 🙏 🙏
Cap
Hope they get paaaiiiidd.
April's Fools was 3 days ago....
Sure it is. Bud bout to string everyone along then announce another can for his next opponent
“I’ll believe it when they are in the ring.” Shut the fuck up, your ass is excited.
Bud by TKO , just wait haters
Thank you Al Haymon
“Appears”
Everyone says. We will believe it when there are actually fighting
I am going to become the joker
The fact I've heard very little about it this time around makes me believe it will actually happen
I won’t believe it until they’re both in the ring.   I’ll stand by my prediction I’ve had for years. Crawford by stoppage 😁 I don’t want to hear any excuses from Spence fans who talked the most shit over the years about how buds resume is bad after he smokes Spence.
Blame who you want. I lost interest. Spence wins they will say Crawford was past his prime. Crawford wins they will say Spence wasn't the same after the car wreck. Which to be fair is probably true. I was in a bike wreck and was never the same and all I did was  shave my arm like Pastrami on the streets of Bali.
I won’t care until it’s confirmed. This teasing has gone on long enough.
My discretionary funds are ready.
who gives a fuck anymore crawford is 36. this is exactly why they don't make these fights till the end they know you are all dumb enough to still buy it
*Was* a superfight 3 years ago.
Dan Rafael has blown up the reporting in this article. Fake news.
What happened to Thurman?
I won't believe it until I see both of them walking towards the ring with whatever C tier rapper they hire to lip sync their song to.
Yeah I don’t care anymore
"Twinkle toes, rabbit feet..."
If this is true this could shape up to be the best year of boxing since 2013
Spence held out as long has he could to give the fans the best fight out there.
That plant benavidez fight was ass, this will be too
I get a feeling reading these comments, that a lot of people here are feeling hopeful  Can’t wait to get checked, yet again.   Spence and Crawford, even if they fight, aren’t too big of priorities for me, but that’s just one fans opinion.   I don’t even know if I’ll tune in, both these guys are fools. Can’t wait until the next generation of welterweights move these two out, and then maybe the sport can lift itself again
Wtf happened to Spence Thurman is it still happening
Yeah yeah yeah
This time I hope both guys have rematch clauses so we get to see it twice.
This talk happens every year, I’ll believe it when they’re in the ring
I won’t believe this until the first round is over. Even if they are in the ring I won’t believe it. I need em to start fighting
Don’t trick my heart.
Yeah I'm not believing this.
Hopefully this’ll have an amazing undercard rather than the atrocity of tank Ryan
Yeahhhhhh budddy
They could be in the ring together ready to throw down and I still wouldn’t believe it
I'll believe it after the weigh ins
Best Welterweight Fight Since SUGAR RAY LEONARD vs TOMMY HEARNS  Spence/Crawford = All Time Classic
I’ll believe it when another news source confirms it. We’ve had too many of these reports only for things to break down.
“appears”
I haven't read the article but if this is true and they both show up, boxing seems to be looking better these days.   Garcia and Davis, Loma and Haney, and this match. Now all we need is Fury to fight Usyk. Hah!
They toyed with my emotions enough already I won't believe it till it's announced
I’ve heard this one before. Not getting my hopes up until they’re walking to the ring
I really hope this is true
Another news that will break r/boxing's heart.
I will never believe this fight will happen until after the opening bell
Holy shit
Believe it when I see it. 🙄
Cap as usual.
Super frustrating fight more like!!!
Not going to get my hopes up until they’re both in the ring with each other
It is on this time, trust me bro 😎
Blah blah blah we’ve been down this road before
I still don’t believe it.
Wow!!
Please. For the love of fuck. Please
👀
😂 rrrrrightt
Please, please, please be real
These two have been acting like they’re the next Mayweather/Pacquiao, but with the way PPV has been going, I’d be shocked if they broke 500k. Especially after seeing the news about Plant/Benavidez.
It's on my birthday..I'm convinced they are doing this as a present
Believe it when they are in the ring.
Hey I think I've heard this story before.
2023 god damn
About freaking time! Good to see fighters starting to change their mindset and finally fight each other. Now we need Usyk & Fury to pick negotiations back up and for real this time (without the social media 🤡ing BS!).
I’ll believe it when I see it cuz
April fools 😂😂
Common sense finally prevailed  I don't care about what happened before, if it's on, I'm interested
I'll believe it on June 18
I dont care until I see them in ring.
I want this fight to happen, but I don’t see Bud choosing a fight this risky, this late in his career.
It almost feels worse getting my hopes up again. Man I hope this happens...
Dont believe it till they get in the ring on fighr night
Boxing is the definition of the meme   “Call an ambulance…. *but not for me*”  Always on the brink of death. Bounces back every time
Suuuuuuuuurrrrre
If it doesn’t happen this time both fighters look funny in the light.
This is the most random announcement ever lol. Huge if true.
I don’t even care anymore til I see them in the ring  And if it does happen I really hope it’s not that Saturday I’ll be traveling
I won’t believe it until Spence Vs Crawford Rd 1 starts
Is there point getting excited for this once again? NOPE.  Am I going to get excited for this once again? YEP.
ill never forget the day errol got in that car crash, I thought "fuck were never gonna see him fight Crawford". I accepted it then.... in 2019. Better late than never! we should have got this fight last year.
We’ll see
*Appears set*  Lmao. Classic
Yeah. Right. Fury v Usyk on the undercard.
Boxing always delivers. Even if it’s 10 years overdue (see Khan v Brook) it always gets made. We’ll see if Usyk Fury ever comes through.
No it doesn’t
Sure and that light in the sky, could be an extraterrestrial spaceship.
250k PPVs in US tops super fight
I won't believe it until the first punch is thrown.
Imagine believing this.
This will be metal but let’s wait and see too many let downs before so hopefully this is true.
I feel like I won't believe it until the fighters come out of their corners for round 4.
Lies.
Probably too late, but can we all agree to wait until it’s officially been announced before we resume arguing over who (Crawford) ducked who and who (ESJ) wins. Oh, yeah, fuck PBC, Al Haymon created Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, and all hail TR/GB/Matchroom for putting on great cards.
Please Korean Jesus…
Spence will find an excuse some fight time that baby
You should have learned by now. In boxing, nothing is ever set until the first bell rings.
Believe it when it happens
Man all that talk about “tank garcia gonna start a new trend for big fights” really was true huh?
I honestly don’t care that much for this anymore
Yeah, right: y’all are late. April 1st was three days ago
"Appears"
Yes please! Spence v Crawford, Inoue v Fulton, Usyk v fury are the fights we need this year Charlo v Tszyu and Canelo v Benavidez would be great too 🙏
About fucking time. Literally the only fight I’m hyped for now besides Garcia/tank, especially now that usyk/fury seems dead
Key word: Appears
Apparently, appears, could are all bullshit to me when it comes to this sport. Lemme know when it is announced
Looks like this is finally happening. Crawford taking that December fight ultimately could’ve been a ♟️move. Spence will be out the ring 14 months heading into the fight.   I’ve always had Crawford and still do. Can’t wait for the first stare down!
🤔
Yeah sure and my dead goldish is going to resurrect from the toilet on june 18th
This not gonna be the same fight we wanted 3 years ago. I for 1 will still watch it, but I'm a little passed this isn't the rematch already.
are they both gonna be like 53 years old is this mayweather packio 2?
Crawford already tweeted that this isn’t true unfortunately.
I'm not going to believe this is happening until I see both of them in the same ring at the same time.
I've heard this shit before. I'm not believing it until the bell rings to start the fight.
I thought Bud shot that down saying April Fools
ABOUT. DAMN. TIME.   I only went and had 4 kids and some grandkids while I waited for this.   But, as they say, better late than never.
If this is FINALLY true, its continuing the trend of fighters going around their dinosaur idiot promoters and getting fights made themselves.
Imagine if this is just a way just to promote Garcia vs Tank fight lol
I'm not holding my breath.
And now you've gone and spoiled the surprise
You have no idea the physical toll that three mega fight cancelations can have on a person!
https://youtu.be/a3_PPdjD6mg
I just ignore or downvote all news about these 2. Not really interested in hyping up a fight that’s not gonna happen just so they can get some ig followers  Lmk when they start selling tickets
I’m calling it right now. Crawford yet again will have some last minute bs stipulation and it falls through again. He doesn’t want to be the B side.
Oh yes they can.
Everyone is finally getting their shit together except for Tyson Fury
Besides the heavyweight division everything else is kicking ass.   * Davis vs Garcia - April * Canelo vs Ryder - May * Haney vs Loma - May  * Josh Taylor vs Teofimo Lopez * And if Spence vs Crawford is real then there’s June.  * Innoue vs Fulton in July.   Mega fights every month.
Imagine if we got Spence vs Crawford and Davis vs Garcia as co main. That would never happen because the boxing world knows they can charge for 2 main events and Davis and Garcia both don’t want to do anything but main event…BUT IMAGINE.
I’ll only be paying for Garcia/ Tank if it’s in theaters. As much as I wanna see it, $85 ain’t it
The undecard looks so last minute
Why? People don’t pay for undercards they pay for the main event
>Can they please do it for the sport and make a stacked undercard too.  Nobody pays for the undercard. People pay for the main event. That's how it works.
>Can they please do it for the sport and make a stacked undercard too.  Davis vs Garcia Rematch.
An annual supercard superbowl thing for boxing probably couldn't hurt the sport. Make it all title fights, not blockbusters necessarily but as good as you could line up. Get some auto-tuned singers, a comedy act or something and you put it on network tv, revitalize the game.
Yeah but this time it's super duper for real
This gave me a real good laugh.   Thank you.  🙏
Move him around in an armoured vehicle. Have him sleep in a pod. Bring him into the ring on a stretcher. That’ll save some time too cause they’ll need to bring him out of the ring on one after Crawford’s done with him.
Lol
A fool me can't get fooled again
I remember when this fight was slated for November 12
I wish they would leave the fans out of their negotiating process and just announce a fight when it’s agreed and complete.
Survives all that only to get stopped by Crawford.
Its sad because crawford is clearly cherrypicking Errol who is coming off a long layoff but errol is too game to say no.
Garcia was a “Top WW”?
Thats why's he's the 2nd best welterweight rn.
For me it’s right after the weigh in
Inb4 Crawford walks out of the ring after the first round starts to protest getting 55/45 instead of 56/44
It’ll be like when T-mobile arena listed a poster for Jon Jones return and then took it down because the UFC contacted them to say the fight wasn’t announced yet lol. Dana just admitted it was done the same day since there was no big surprise now.
*rebuilt (after those car accidents)
Is it unifying if he’s already unified champ going for undisputed?
Just don't use the layoff as an excuse if he loses.
I mean it's probably the most reputable boxing news source.
Bro trust me bro my uncle works for the WBC it's totally happening
If Bud's kidney doesn't start bleeding by the 10th.
There were a couple vague rumours but usually it’s when you start hearing about details that you know the negotiations aren’t doing well.
If this fight happens, Thurman will take his regularly scheduled 2 year layoff.
Errol doesn’t want that fight. He wants Crawford
Thurman is a backup option. This is Spence first choice if it can be done.
Thurman should fight Stanionis for his regular WBA belt if the Ortiz fight falls through. Then the winner will either get a shot at Spence/Crawford or get elevated if they move up.  Thurman is past the point of deserving a big name, and at least he can say he's fighting for a belt. I think Stanionis beats him into retirement.
As of now, Keith is beneath him
I expect upgrades to B-tier rappers for undisputed fights.
really? what do u care about?
It was ass cause of Plant's outboxing and clinch style. Neither of these guys fight like that.
When are Spence or Crawford ever clinching their opponent, they just beat the fuck out of people lol.
It was either  1. Just a rumor to try and make Crawford feel like Spence had other options. (The same way Crawford fought avenesyan) 2. When this fight falls through, Thurman steps in and it goes down.
No undercard with popular boxers is good on paper because the main event guys ask for too much money.
its not an announcement, somebody told The Ring that shit was going down.
It turns out it was a joke.
errol didnt tho so you never know
this is a case of crawford wanting to get a cherrypick(ava) for a great money before fighting a tough fight, in general you are right tho
I'm interested to learn the background on this story, because I have to wonder what Spence did to force Al Haymon's hand in his case. Remember that Crawford has no promoter, and no television broadcast partner to satisfy in this case, his only concerns that are publicly known are his own desires and those of his manager(s).  Al has been loathe to entertain the idea of this fight because it is a dangerous one for Spence no matter how you view it. If Spence wins, its not that big of a deal (to us fans, it IS a big deal, without doubt) If Spence loses, that's a much bigger deal because where does Spence go next? Al blows his meal ticket. This fight has held up that division for so long that it "releases" a number of possible outcomes for future bouts. I can't even analyze that right now...
I don’t think ppl are paying $85 for an announcement.
Snip snap, snip snap, snip snap!
I think the reality of that situation is that Uysk was down to fight for whatever amount but Fury wanted a super huge hundred million dollar payday. The Saudis weren't ready in time so the new plan is for December undisputed.  That's by read of the situation and all the post-fall out comments from the actual promoters and managers. That is just too much money to leave on the table for too many people.  I think there is still an outside chance that we get a heavyweight undisputed fight this year, but it will be in December and there will likely be some fights in between for both of them.
Usyk’s team pulled out :).
Bam will also be returning for a vacant title.
Is Taylor vs Lopez official?
All we need is Fury v Uysk to close out the year right?  P.S. I know that shit ain't happening but still...
Canelo Ryder? What? That’s the weakest fight
Plus…   *MJ v. Tapales*.   *Bam v. Gonzalez*.   *Shakur v. Yoshino*.   **Stanionis v. Vergil**.    And I know these aren’t as “Massive” but I’m super pumped for *Junto Nakatani v. Moloney, Cordina v. Rakhimov*, and *Teraji v. Olascuga.*  I’m not ashamed to admit that I’m hard right now.
I still have some hope we will get at least a couple of good HW fights (lol me) at the end of the year
Crazy that we could’ve potentially had Fury-Usyk in the mix, too
We just need butterbeaver and Belial to fight now
Not every fight with Canelo is a mega fight lol
and THIS the year I decide to have my first child 🙄. Lesson learned!
Fam, my body is ready.  With that being said, Canelo Ryder is definitely not on the same level as the other matches.  I wish fans would stop being content with these mismatches allowing fighters they like to slide without scrutiny.
Canelo bout to clap Ryder. That’s not a mega fight . After he casually strolls thru Ryder then gets to Benavidez then that’ll be a mega fight
how is spence vs crawford a mage fight now? crawford is 36 years old. i just don't understand boxing fans they have screwed you over from seeing them in their prime but you exited for some reason
That's how it should be. Boxing fans wanna stick up their left pinky and shit on Dana White pretending like they really care about other men's money when MMA shows regularly feature events like that. This is the entertainment business and I want to be ENTERTAINED.
If Dana white steped into boxing he'd make it.
I was going to get some people to pitch, but most of my boxing fan friends are away
Garcia tank also has a high knockout factor. One of the few fights that’s worth it
Free is it.
Zhang vs Joyce should have been the co-main on that card (in a perfect world)
Big main events used to be showcases for future stars and near elite guys   Now those fights are just on $50 PPVs
Herpes this time
Now that she has 2 kids from another man she is ready to marry me lmao
Nice try SPENCE
[Wheel him around like Hannibal Lecter](https://imgur.com/solMJCi)
*Meet the new promoter*…  *Same as the old promoter*.
This guy gets it
no chance in hell crawford beats spence
spence has the thurman fight for feb, but then the car crash fucked that up. it led to this but i feel like errol if he had beat thurman would be in this situation with crawford fighting in the summer. he was always gonna spin back
Porter DSG Ugas and now Bud? whats the issue?
ERROL Spence will PUNCH terrence Crawford in the BODY.
My man coming back as terminator or a transformer 😭😭😭
Yes
yes. It's still a unification fight. The last belt will be unified with the other 3.
Bud is getting his 11th stoppage in a row, Errol hasn’t been active
Typically boxers that follow through with the shit talk. Matches like Haney vs Loma, Garcia vs tank, Inoue vs Fulton. It’s like the boyfriend that promised you marriage after being together for 10+ years but never proposed.
Yeah some kind of back up fight but Spence legitimately hates Thurman and has repeatedly said he doesn’t want to give him the payday so it always seemed a little hollow.
Announcement of an announcement then
But doesn’t it take two to fight? Don’t get me wrong, I want this more than anyone but if one is saying don’t believe it, that kind of squashes it right?
This is Hall of fame hating my guy lol
Lol you know what happened man. Stop being so one sided when Spence needed 5 years before even beginning negotiations with bud only to cause more bs last year. It would’ve happened last year if Spence didn’t drag his feet. Spence confirmed everything bud said.   Whatever is whatever. Hopefully we actually get the damn fight this time.
> If Spence loses, that's a much bigger deal because where does Spence go next?  Everywhere? stop acting like a loss is this devastating event that ruins careers
Yeah but even this post saying that it's gonna happen during the Tank-Garcia fight is reminding us that Tank-Garcia is happening.  It's working!
As someone that has had a vasectomy this is triggering some shit for me
That’s still one of the best lines in the series, but GOD that episode is still some of the most uncomfortable TV ever made.
After Fury’s team moved the goalpost for the umpteenth time. But stick your head into whatever sand you need to in order to sleep at night
Yeah after getting fucked over constantly by Fury's team. Blind Fury fan boys love to leave that part out
Fuck fury
this week too
yeah its still too far off to do the press conferences and shit tho
I’d prefer Bivol vs Beterbiev but that fight probably has even less chance of happening.
Not the worst fight in the world but yeah a tune up defense for sure
Every Canelo fight a Boxing gala and the biggest event in Boxing. Deal w it 👓
Yeah, at no point this year have I thought… “I can’t wait for that Canelo vs Ryder fight”. If Canelo faces benavidez later this year though….
When he’s going to sell more PPV’s and bring in more revenue than any other of these cards it kinda is. Is that the fight I’m personally most interested in? Hell no, but I can’t deny he’s the biggest mainstream boxer in the US / Mexico.
And this is why you aren't a promoter. Why would they have Tank vs. KingRy as the undercard when that fight alone would do around 1 million PPV buys and Spence vs Crawford alone would at least do over 500k?   Lmfao
Dana White can do those things because he has 90% of the top MMA talent in his promotion. Other MMA promotions like Bellator and PFL certainly don't feature stacked cards like UFC ones.  In boxing, all the talents are spread over many different promoters, meaning top-tier fights usually require a lot of negotiation and cross-promotion, which is where things usually go to shit. If 90% of top boxing talent was under one promoter, we'd be seeing all the top fights we want too. White can make fights without having to clash against another promoter's ego. Can you even begin to imagine White trying to negotiate with Scott Coker for a cross-promotion fight? We might actually see steam come out of his ears.
Typical clueless take.   It is the prize fighting **business**. These are decisions about **business**.   Reading this sub always lowers my IQ from reading the thoughts of people like you.
In a perfect world plant vs Benavides co-main
I'm really surprised someone like Rolly or Isaac Cruz isn't on the undercard
Don't be a sucker and become her backup plan my friend lol
If you keep sassing me, you’re gonna pay for it.   The next time you see me—I’ll be your Uber Driver.
Spence is a master of fighting inside while Crawford is a master of controlling the distance. So it'll be interesting in seeing how that will play out.  By pure technical ability alone, Crawford IS the more talented boxer, though that doesn't mean he's the best. I realistically see either Crawford by decision or Spence by knockout.
But it will
Crawford will stop Spence
Yall bouta find out real soon that Bud is him
UPDATE: Boxer plans on PUNCHING his opponent in the FACE in upcoming fight. More at 11.
They should call it “undisputing”
It also might've been a test to see the public reaction to it. I know a lot of times it feels like they don't give a shit what we want, but they **do** see our tweets and posts and videos.  I wanna say like 85% of people were shitting on Spence v Thurman. Maybe our voice actually played a role in it getting scrapped
What's Spence's beef with Thurman
report that there may be an announcement lol
in their contracts their not exactly allowed to disclose certain things, if theirs an official announcement they wouldnt want them talking about it before hand. Much like when a fighter is fighting someone TBD on an undercard. He knows who hes fighting but the promotion cant say so for legal purposes ETC. this could all be fake rumors but we dont know yet.
point is we dont know. He could just be talking shit to hype us up for the offical announcement or he could be saying this is bullshit. I know stephen epinoza confirmed they were trying to get bud for june
its just the truth, he saw an easy BLK bag and got it. He "agreed" to everything for the spence fight but then dipped, but now all of a sudden that same company can make a deal with him. only thing that is changing is bud. spence and pbc was always just tryna make the fight happen last year. spence hasnt been in the ring since last april and the fight is still happening, while bud was trying to push narratives to excuse his cherrypick.
no. he’s saying that due to the issues with negotiation prior to the BLK bout, crawford securing that bag early meant an easier negotiation afterward.
I'm not. That statement was in regards to how Al Haymon sees this bout, not Spence himself.  I do agree that protected undefeated records are a scourge in boxing, but that's not my particular issue in this case. I have always asserted that Al pays his boxers not to fight, and that when they do fight, it is always in A/B matches where anyone with a pulse knows who the winner will be before the first bell rings.  I realize that all promoters are guilty of this sin, but claiming that people like Crawford simply don't exist because they aren't under a PBC contract is ridiculous on its face.  This particular bout has held up the welterweight division for far too long. I think most boxing observers agree that this is a good and important bout and once completed it is hoped that a series of bouts will begin that will designate a group of viable challengers at this weight.  The only interesting quantity in this match is how quickly Spence will demolish Crawford.  Bud badly needs a tune-up bout and a reality check. He's the B-side here, like it or not.  Do I *need* this bout? No. Do I still *want* to see it? Sure I do. It'll be on PPV, so I'll make a value judgement when the price is announced.
Ah I see what he meant by it. My bad.
I can think of at least one worse…  *Hey, Mr. Scott, whatcha gonna do…*
Usyk wanted the rematch because he was scared to lose. He also agreed to 70/30 but this sub leaves that part out too :D.
Maybe we get a start on the 2024 wishlist? We can add Canelo v Benavidez on that one too.
This guy gets it. Is Canelo - Ryder the most competitive fight? Hell no. Will it bring the most revenue and blow the other cards out the water in terms of viewership? Yes.
That’s why he constantly fights bum because y’all let him slide without the same scrutiny you dish out to other fighters.
I guess I just don’t think of numbers when I think mega-fight. Haney-Loma will probably do worse than the AJ-Franklin fight but I consider it more of a mega-fight cause it’s top guys fighting each other
UFC frequently makes cards that have 2-3 fights that could be their own main event. Boxing has destroyed the brains of their fans lmao
Lmfao at KiNg Ry getting 1 million buys at $85. With no undercard. That's why you make a card WORTH BUYING FOR THAT MUCH MONEY.
They don't get it, daddy-o.
Absolutely not lol..And I understand everything you said and have for years. It sucks for us boxing fans. So I'll enjoy this scumbag Dana White while I can because the UFC being run the way it is won't be around forever. Best fight the best and its fun to watch  🤷‍♂️
🥱 lmao OK then genius, take a walk then and get your IQ up somehow. Go visit the library chief
shit man at the very least they could have put the Fundora fight on there instead of it being its own main event this weekend
>Spence is a master of fighting inside while Crawford is a master of controlling the distance. So it'll be interesting in seeing how that will play out.   Despite the fact that the footwork advantage goes to Crawford, it's not like Spence walks in concrete.  He's always had above average footwork to put him in position to go at the body while still maintaining distance.  That combined with Spence being bigger naturally and more than likely the heavier hitter, I think Spence will be the odds on favorite.
I see Spence having success early on given that Crawford is an infamously slow starter. But the second half will be all Crawford if he doesn't get tagged.
YDKSAB
Bud is great we already know that. This is two top fighters fighting each other
ehhh I mean I think that does happen but you don't exactly need a focus group to know that Thurman isn't as exciting of an opponent as Crawford and tbh I think Spence has already fought most of the 147 matchups that pbc could get him anyway so Thurman isn't that bad either.
Never gave him a fight when Spence was coming up, said he had to earn his shot by doing this and that and Spence isn't interested in throwing Thurman a bone now that the roles are reversed
Got it. That makes sense. Hope we hear good news soon!
It's not like Crawford had the final contract in the spring and drug his feet to the fall. Negotiations dragged on and he didn't want that long of a layoff. Getting a nice-payday is true, but it's not like it's a cherry-pick to take a tune-up fight. Negotiations the second time around were apparently easier, likely due to the jockeying from last year.  Also it's definitely PBC's fault that negotiations didn't start until last year, for a fight that people have wanted for like 5 years.
The reason the fight didn't happen in 2022 is 100% on Spence and PBC.  Check the facts dawg.
I’ve never rewatched that episode. Once was enough.
Usyk took the 70/30 split then told fury’s team that if he wins, on the rematch he gets 70% and fury 30% which is more than fair. If he wins he holds all the belts and fury has nothing. As it stands he currently holds 4/5 if you want to include the ring. Fury denied. When he denied Usyk called it off because Fury keeps moving the goal posts - he wants all the money and a rematch where he continues to get all the money because that is all he cares about at this point in his career.
> He also agreed to 70/30 but this sub leaves that part out too  Are you saying he wanted the fight or he didn't want the fight? Because accepting a 70/30 split after originally being offered 50/50 is a pretty big indication that he desperately wanted the fight.  At a certain point Usyk's team had to draw the line, Fury would've continued to move the goalposts forever.
What?  Nobody with a brain on here is denying Usyk took the 70/30 offer.  How is that a win for Fury, by the way?  It was such a smack in Fury's face that Usyk agreed to the ridiculous terms he came up with.  Fury didn't expect a guy to actually care about proving himself against the best competition.
I’m a big fury fan, check the flair. But let’s be real it wasn’t usyk preventing this fight happening.
>Usyk wanted the rematch because he was scared to lose.  Is this a typo? Fury was making the stupid rematch demands.
If Luke Partridge ever takes this fight he's gonna wait until Usyk is 100 years old and aged out of his high-intensity style, with more miles on the clock. Meanwhile plenty of time to shove beer and packet in his greedy face and make the Chisora quadrilogy.
...Tyson?
We can’t make a wishlist. We gotta keep our expectations as low as possible. I swear everytime I see a fight is when I don’t expect it.
That would blow the roof off if that happens in September
No it won't. Canelo vs Ryder is going to do about 300k PPV buys in the US and have a cheaper than usual gate for a Canelo fight because it's in Mexico.   Tank vs KingRy and Spence vs Crawford will do way more than that
Anyone spreading Canelo is fighting bums as a narrative is the lowest of low of boxing fans. Literal scum of boxing worlds.  Name one active fighter who has fought better opposition their whole lives than Canelo has fought in the last two years.
Competitive match ups are just good ass fights to me. Mega fights have that mainstream appeal, it gets the casuals who know nothing about boxing tuned in with their friends and family.
It's insane. One fight is worth $85? GTFO. Ufc cards with 3 title fights still aren't worth that for fucks sake.
Those co main events would sell shit on PPV. UFC has destroyed the minds of its fans lmao
Casuals dont give af about the damn undercard. The casuals are paying for Tank vs KingRy, that is it
>Absolutely not lol..And I understand everything you said and have for years. It sucks for us boxing fans.  Damn bro you already understand this my bad for lecturing you cause there's a lot of people who just think Dana White is a superstar promoter while boxing promoters are dumb dumbs, when in truth White just has a great advantage in terms of having a monopoly on talent.  Yeah, it really stinks. Can you imagine a card with fights like Usyk-Fury, Crawford-Spence, and Inoue-Fulton on it? Shiiit. I wish I were a trillionaire just so I can buy all the boxing promotions and merge them lol.  >So I'll enjoy this scumbag Dana White while I can because the UFC being run the way it is won't be around forever. Best fight the best and its fun to watch 🤷‍♂️  Same. Dude's a scumbag like all fight promoters. I don't see him any worse than any other promoter, except for that Slap League crap he pushes. It's cool that you feel the UFC won't be run like this forever too. I try to tell other people that soon competitors are gonna start drawing other top talents to their promotions and MMA is gonna end up like boxing. Hopefully that's not for a while though.
I didn’t even know he was fighting, I’m going to watch UFC 287 and bam Rodriguez fight
Good point.
Loser leaves town bet!!!!  &#x200B;  To be clear, I am not betting. I'm simply here to egg on
Cope
Correct. Bud is the best welterweight rn and Spence is the 2nd best welterweight rn.
Fair enough I guess, I'm a fan of both so I didn't know if it was something that serious
me and you both.
they dragged on bc of one person. spence has been unifying and fighting top contenders ever since people started talking about that fight, while crawford has largely done nothing, great he got that porter fight. to just say 5 years with no context is funny. not to mention spence has gotten an injury after every big big fight for 3 years straight its not like hes just fighting bums instead of fighting crawford. hes getting hurt, then unifying, or fighting a top contender, then unifying again, not fighting amir khan or mean machine or avaneseyan
Negotiations dragged on because Bud was playing Errol and PBC like a fiddle because at the very same time he was in negotiations with BLK prime.  t's not PBC fault the negotiations didn't start until last year. Its Errol spence "fault" but to his defense he told Crawford to his face he was collecting the other belts first then coming for him, then he's had injury after injury so thats why the fight is late
Sure
How?
Spence was a prospect in 2015. Crawford was fighting at 140
Fair enough, I've been beaten down by life enough to accept this approach.
More like 400-500k, but I agree Tank vs Ryan COULD sell more but that’s a one and done. Tank and Ryan need each other to do those numbers. Canelo doesn’t. Spence vs Crawford will do like 300k. Not enough casuals know who they are for it to be huge unless they promote it right.
Canelo is going to do wayyyyy over 300k PPVs.  If you need to compare Spence vs Bud, a super fight marinating for 10 years to be confident about any comparison with Canelo while he's fighting a no name in Mexico then that says it all. Plus you threw another superfught as a lifeline in case one doesn't do the numbers.  Easy 500k ppvs. Light work.
Spence resume > Canelo resume  No questionable wins either.    Canelo fan base is mentally identical to the Paul brothers.
Fair enough to each their own I just hate that our bar for a mega fight has fallen so low, says a lot about the state of the sport to me
Lmao kInG rY. Jesus. I wonder how many are left after buying Benavides Plant for $75 2 weeks ago. Surly won't be 1 million.
That’s what I’m saying, there’s plenty of fights this weekend and it’s just frankly not a very good main event. You might as well put it on an undercard.
ok
yeah I guess I was being a bit dramatic with 'hates' but Spence has not had a lot of good things to say about Thurman over the years
Boxing needs this!
The promotion with the best fighters froze Crawford out. And spence injuring himself is his own problem.
You know I'm right.
Check the facts.
Lmfao Tank vs KingRy is going to do way more than 400k in the USA, lets be real. This fight has completely crossed over to a different audience. Spence vs Crawford is also going to do way more than 300k, Spence vs. Porter did that amount. Outlets that don't usually cover Spence fights are reporting about Spence vs Crawford for example.   Canelo vs Ryder will do Canelo vs Liam Smith numbers. You can bet the house on that.
> Easy 500k ppvs. Light work.  Absolutely no chance. Canelo vs GGG 3 did 550k in the US.   Canelo vs Ryder will be another Canelo vs Liam Smith, 300K PPV buys. Bet the house on it.
First of all Spence isn't even in his own weight division fam.  [Spence has repeatedly says he walks around 190 lbs.](https://www.boxingscene.com/spence-were-making-weight-right-way-like-i-broke-hungry--148748) Says he gains 6-7 lbs just being all day at the press conference.  Sure Spence fought back to back but man weighs more than Canelo and hasn't taken a lick of chances moving up.  4 divisions brother. F O U R divisions.
yo alex rocha, crawfords mandatory quietly signed to a fight today.  hats a good sign, he might know something we dont. Thats the most positive sign Ive seen that this fights gonna happen. fingers crossed
spence injuring himself is his own problem i agree,  that also mean he wasnt delaying a crawford fight either tho. and no crawford froze himself. pbc doesnt work for crawford they work for their fighters they manage. they got all their guys title shots and ppv fights matching them accordingly, no one needed crawford to get all the fights they needed for legacy. shawn called out bud after fighting thurman spence danny and ugas and got the fight after a year of asking for it. what did arum do at first? shit on him and say he wasnt worth anything. did pbc get in the way of porter fighting bud? why does danny care about bud if he can fight spence for more money and not deal with arum. bud wasnt sending any offers that were better than what they were already getting, he wasnt the 1st or second biggest draw in his division but thinks people would run to espn to fight him. thurman got pac he didnt need to beg top rank. porter got spence and danny same story down the line. crawford had no pull and you think its being "frozen" out
Idk man most of Tank and Ryan Garcia’s fans are young. Like most people I talk to who know them just see tanks highlights posted on Instagram or tiktok and the same with Ryan. I think the fight will heavily be streamed by the younger generation especially at $85 price point. Not trying to be insulting but I don’t think most people could even tell you what apps to buy the PPV and it’s 2 weeks away.   If you were 19 with your friends and wanted to watch the fight, you’re just gonna install some third party app on a streaming device and be done with it.
>Lmfao Tank vs KingRy is going to do way more than 400k in the USA, lets be real. This fight has completely crossed over to a different audience.  My damn *uncles* were talking about this fight and i didnt even know they watched boxing. It suprised me how much this fight has transcended.
I understand the business side of it. PBC was gonna do their own thing until they'd fought everyone, like as you say with Porter, he'd fought everyone and then he got the green light for Crawford. I'm not trying to argue over the semantics of it. Crawford was frozen out whether it was intentional or not. Which put a ceiling on how much pull he had as you point out.
What I don't get is, Okolie just turned 30 and intends to campaign at heavyweight later in his career. Why not target unification bouts? Badou Jack is 40, albeit moves like he's in his mid 30s. Nonetheless, Jack doesnt seem like hes difficult to work with and should be an easy fight for Okolie to make.
Okolie is the only fighter I wish would fight less
Dunno how I feel about CBS getting a title shot before Riakporhe, but I guess it was a timing thing. Decent fight on paper nonetheless, but I really don't enjoy watching Okolie fight 😂 can CBS be able to make it fun?  I'm picking Okolie, maybe even by stoppage, CBS only comes forward and doesn't move his head a lot.
He's boring as hell to watch but you can't fault Okolie's activity.
Real fight, nice one!
Okolie is shitty Wilder without the one punch power.
Same day as the already announced Lara v Wood…   Stay classy sky
Okolie has earned my Fan-dom, because of how often he fights. That simple.
Okolie never gonna unify
Good matchup on paper. But I expect Okolie to make it a stinker
He is horrible to watch
Hopefully CBS ability and tendancy to fight in the pocket negates Okolies' jab and grab style.
Okolie/cruiser weight just fucking sucks hey
Okolie fights are a snooze fest.
You’re right Badou would’ve been the easiest one, I’m sure they know each other too. But I think because Okolie tried to fight the other champs before BJ fought Makabu and they refused to sign, he signed the deal with Boxxer to fight CBS/Riakporhe and I think there was a third name but can’t remember
😂😂😂😂
Riakporhe is fighting Goulamairian next
Remember Riakporhe took a career break and CBS & McCarthy then both leap frogged him in the ranks.   Not to forget CBS was EBU champ, which is one level from World, so it’s only right?
Or the heart, balls and spirit and excitement. Wilder is great cause his self belief, Hugkolie has none
Depending on the timing, you might be able to have a nice nap before tuning into Wood vs Lara.
Clashes with Conlan Lopez as well
I've not seen any news or even rumours about this, this is literally the first I've heard of this. Where did you hear this from?
Boxxer making moves on the Cruiserweight division if true.
Everyone counterprogramming. Insert Spiderman pointing gif.

“It’s a fight, don’t get me wrong. It’s a sport where you take people out, but I’ll be honest with you, Mike Tyson went 12 rounds with people like Pinklon Thomas and I think it was Tony Tubbs. (Note: Both Thomas and Tubbs were stopped by Tyson inside the distance).   Hilarious note added by boxingscene
Probably better he got more rounds with a new trainer and was never in any danger
He didn’t lose so that’s a plus but can he please stop doing that weird shit after the fights it’s getting worse
Its the fear with AJ now, he's lost all confidence in his chin. I hope he gets back to where he was, still huge fights to be had, but a) depends if he still wants it and b) he kinda needs 3 complete cans to just run through. That's not so easy when you are earning 10 of millions a fight and the poster boy for a DAZN platform which is in big trouble.  Edit: maybe "cans" was a little extreme. But probably not top 10 guys.
I don't get why people's opinions of Joshua are so extreme. One week he is the most amazing person on the planet, the next he is a bum who doesn't deserve to live.
This wasn't a fight to see if Joshua could get past Franklin, we all knew he could, it was a fight to see how quickly he could knock him out. Eddie was promising a KO on interviews if anybody bothered to watch those.  AJ's handpicked KO victim ended up being more resilient than expected but it's all good AJ still dominated and won clearly but people would have been more impressed with a KO like Wilder did with Helenius.
Franklin has a good chin and at no point ever looked seriously hurt.  Yes he appeared slightly wobbled at times but not to the point where you’d go in for the kill.    He was also doing a good job of countering Joshua’s right hand with a left hook, and generally looked dangerous when they traded.  There’s negatives to Joshua’s performance but there’s nothing wrong with not getting the stoppage.  He hit Franklin with some serious clean power shots from round 10 onwards and Franklin ate them.  Franklin wasn’t getting stopped that night.
He’s so insecure now, he wouldn’t be saying all of this if he thought he did great the other night. He looks like a shell of his former self and needs to discover his fire again.
His 3rd time going the distance to win....the overreactions are insane on here.  He completely dominated the fight and was never in trouble.
The problem there are a lot of people who don't know shit about boxing.      James changes a lot of AJ's foundation.  His guard is different, the piston jab was different, the angle which he threw the right hand downwards.  His approach and angles were different.    AJ looked tense and uncomfortable with all of it. He didn't look scared but he did look like he didn't trust himself.      Maybe this change is 2 or 3 years too late.  But I think another fight or two and he will be vastly improved.
At least we're on the cope train instead of the hype train now.
Eddie Hearn is smart enough to see Joshua needs to rebuild his confidence a bit w these lower tier opponents, and I def respect how he seems to try and get the most money possible for his fighters… but good god! Does he absolutely suck when it comes time to actually choose opponents that fighters from his stable can build/rebuild their image with.  Between his selection of lara for Josh warrington, ruiz as a replacement fighter for aj’s American debut, and Franklin as a “tune up” for him to get back in the mix of things, the dude just has no clue.   Thankfully, as a fan of boxing, it makes it super entertaining!
Franklin is nowhere near the competition of those who went 12 with Tyson. Prime Razor Ruddock KOs both Franklin and Joshua on the same night
What's wrong? Tyson was always the smaller guy so it's not bad for him going 12 against giants. On the other hand, you can't put midgets to sleep.  Also, you've lost it. Your performance is so lackluster unlike pre-Ruiz.
Cannot believe he is comparing himself to Tyson
I guarantee Franklin doesn’t go the distance vs either one of Fury, Wilder, or Joyce. Heck, even Dubois KOs Franklin
This guys a dosser. Hes not worthy. He never deserved those titles. He never even deserved that Olympic gold. I like seeing him talk on the mic than fight in the ring because he's an absolute sausage in both but I like seeing him embarass himself.   Go and have a look at the KO that our boy Wilder did to Helenius. That's what AJ should have done to what's his name again? Oh yeah Franklin, sorry I've just never heard of the dude before because he's a nobody. AJ ends up going 12 rounds with this guy? It was his chance to make a statement and a statement he did not make.   Watch him fight Dillian Whyte for another payday whilst we have Wilder vs Usyk. That would be extraordinary.
Tyson fought with bad intentions. He was trying to get those guys out of there. AJ lacks the killer instinct. Its crazy how one left hook from Ruiz changed AJ's career trajectory.
The problem is this was the fight where they set up a bowling pin opponent for you to knock over.  You can't compare that to Tyson fighting another champion or mandatory.  It would be like if Tyson went 12 rounds with Henry Tillman.  Tillman was put there to be blown out so we could have the "he's back" fan talk that happens after a big loss prior.
It's not the going distance part that was the problem. For me the issue was that he seemed to regress back from his Usyk 2 performance where he was showing great improvements for his main weaknesses (esp in early rounds). This performance against Franklin was just revert back to his performance in Ruiz II.  AJ is still of course one of the top guys at HW, but we already saw limitations of this version of AJ in Usyk 1 fight. We know already that he can't outbox better boxers (like Usyk or Fury). His pure boxing at this point will never improve to bridge the gap between him and other more natural boxers.  What AJ needs to do is bring in new elements to his game (like he did in Usyk 2 early rounds, more upper body movement, better level changes, better chin position). What Robert Garcia was doing seemed much more useful than what Derrick James did in same amount of time period.
Brave comparing yourself to Iron Mike Tyson.
Might be an unpopular opinion amongst some boxing fans on this sub, but I'm not hyped anymore about the Wilder and Fury fights - if they were to ever happen. It's a foregone conclusion that Wilder decapitates him, and Fury toys him so much as to be seen as cruel/mean/demeaning. I don't need to see those fights to wonder what might happen. If this was 4-5 years ago, then sure. But some of these fights have been discussed for 7 years now, and Wilder is approaching 40. That fight won't happen and if it does, it'll only be because Wilder aged-out and faded.  Man, I hate boxing sometimes. This is why the UFC is basically a global phenomenon now because the best fights are forced, sometimes multiple times, and a loss might give you 1 in-between fight if not, the immediate rematch.  Hearn just said AJ needs another 2 fights of this level. AJ fights once a year, twice tops. So best case, what, end of 2024 he MIGHT fight Wilder when this was first raised back in 2017/2018? It's just a joke now.  I do get what Eddie is trying to salvage though. While AJ was massively overhyped and over marketed, he was pretty solid at his peak (when he had the confidence to brawl). The Ruiz fight changed all of that. On top of that, when he came back he fought scared, apprehensive, and hesitant. I predicted he would do a Vladimir Klitschko and change his style to the more robotic boring one, and I'm sure Vlad is advising him, but it doesn't quite work for AJ and if you all recall, Vlad received a lot of criticism for being the most boring HW of the past decade back circa 2014. Now AJ is becoming that.  The plan now is to grab AJ another title (gift, a la Charles Martin), defend a couple of times, and depending on how much Wilder and Fury are over the hill, try to capitalise on them not being in their peak to claim a win. Retire. Brand AJ reinvigorated. Cue the new Under Armour deals, sports brand line, motivational speaking engagements, the new book, a documentary, and then continue the brand with his 30% Matchroom deal with Eddie as a legacy brand and fighter.  The pressure is immense because if AJ looks again like a boring fighter in his next 2 fights, the boxing world will have absolutely moved on from him. You must understand that everything from here on out is about salvaging the brand for future profit generating purposes (like Conor McGregor is trying to do right now). But in reality, and unfortunately for AJ, he had an advantage of a mostly poor HW roster during those 3 prime years he had, and if he took a fight tomorrow with Fury, Wilder, or Joyce, he would lose. I even think Dillian Whyte would have a 40% chance of beating him now based on how hesitant AJ is.  AJ is trying to become a better technical boxer because he, and his team, know full-well he has a glass jaw and so brawling now is too risky. Only difference is, he hasn't got the boxing IQ of the Klitschkos so he finds himself as a fish out of water, hopefully able to box 12 rounds to a semi-boring finish, and that's it.  The fact that with his size and strength he couldn't take out Usyk with the obvious game plan of swarming him and brawling him is hilarious. AJ's problem isn't that he couldn't be #2 HW in the world, it's that his mind is not there. He's probably at his physical best and mental worst and that makes all the difference in this game.  I genuinely do not look forward to any of AJ's fights and unless his next fight is Wilder, I don't want a bar of it.
So, he disappointed a lot of people by going safety first against Franklin. It was boring as hell, but he really fought a smart fight, giving his opponent no chance.   Did he also fight a scared fight, and was this why he looked so fish-out-of-water during large portions of the fight? And is he even able to turn it up a few notches anymore if he has to? He wasn't against Usyk, and now I'm starting to suspect that this wasn't Usyk's achievement as much as it was Joshua simply not being any better than that.
AJ isn’t going to be a champion anytime soon; nothing impressive or championship level in this bout. Got hit way too many times, countered plenty of times, no footwork, sloppy defense. The guy thinks he’s Ali out there or something but moves like the Jolly Green Giant. Franklin came in and did his thing and props to him but anyone else stops Franklin.
He did go the distance twice in his prime but it was Tillis and Bonecrusher Smith and both were very wide decisions.  Edit: 3 times: Green, Tillis and Smith  I also forgot Tony Tucker up on triple checking so 4 times
Anthony 'student of the game' Joshua
NOTE: Anthony Joshua died on the way back to his home planet.
In pro and exhibition bouts, Tyson went the distance 9 times:  * 1. Tillis - 10 round pro * 2. Mitch Green - 10 round pro * 3. Anthony Davis - 1 round exhibition * 4. Tillis - 4 round exhibition * 5. Bonecrusher Smith - 12 round pro * 6. Tucker - 12 round pro * 7. Ruddock - 12 round pro * 8. Corey Sanders - 4 round exhibition * 9. Roy Jones Jr. - 8 round exhibition
Watching the fight, it seemed like they took things back to basics and round was what they were after. Yeah, a KO would have been nice, but its not like it was necessary. People making this a bigger thing than it needs to be tbh
The reactions to the fight are understandable. Joshua is rebuilding after being shown he's clearly not the top dog at HW, and he's not going to win it all back by trying to outbox Usyk.  So if he wants to overcome that he's going to have to become a destroyer again. He's going to have to prove he's not 'gun-shy' which seems to be the biggest and most common criticism of him.  And he didn't do it at the weekend. He showed he can still outbox a lower ability opponent, but no-one that watched Usyk II would've doubted that.   So he's either going to continue being chess match Joshua that can stifle guys over 12, but not the very best guys so he's just no longer a world champion; or he's going to have to become a brawler again and prove he can bang with the best of him.   The weekend was supposed to be showing he still had that in him, and unfortunately it failed to launch. Luckily for him I think he'll fight Whyte next and his powerful uppercuts will see him get the KO.
He's oddly the most scrutinised athlete in sports, but he does say weird stuff a lot
I think it's more that he was at one point the favourite to beat every current heavyweight including Fury and now it's apparent that he probably doesn't beat quite a few of them, I don't think anyone would deny that he's still a top 10 heavyweight but on current form I don't think the Wilder or Joyce fights look as winnable as they did even after the second Usyk loss
It's the burden of expectations. Deep inside everyone wanted him to represent boxing during his Klitschko phase. Perfect physical specimen with destructive power, good looks, humility and a fighting heart. Just an all around good guy with a vicious style.   So the disappointment is immense when he let people down. It's just the burden of expectations.
I didn't like his weird reaction after the fight and his comments. Especially the "in 15 years none will remember this fight", trying to diminish his opponent and to appear "knowledgeable" at the same time, cringe.  The fight itself alright, but he didn't do anything we didn't know he can do and he wasn't aggressive enough. And he's not gonna get better probably. I thought Derrick James was supposed to tweak his ability to be aggressive smart but instead he just pulled a sort of Ruiz II in this fight. Which is alright, but the expectations of a top 3-5 guy I would say are higher.  I believe he's doubting himself and tbh feels like he's gonna cash out soon. I was expecting/hoping more fire from him and for him to have a second run at HW throne as he's younger than the other top guys.
Salty fuckers bet on a KO.
Because the modern world is based around the fake and exaggerated. Fans love Wilder who hasn't beaten anyone of note, got handed his belt has numerous cases of corruption going for him, was an extremely boring fighter for the large majority of his career and ducked every living soul in the top 10 but they believe he knocks everyone out in 1 round and hits as hard as kratos whilst Joshua who fought literally every dangerous heavyweight he could, brought heavyweight boxing back to the west and has only a handful of boring fights is gun shy nobody with a glass chin that would to lose everybody and their mum.   The duality is crazy.
Cause people are weird, and in my opinion, are extremely jealous of him. Man is set financially, adored by millions, women love him, and it built like a god.
After Klitschko, people wanted him to be the ambassador of the division, as Fury is not much to look up to. After the Ruiz loss people were still holding on to that.  Now they want Usyk to be the ambassador of the division, but that only works if his win against Joshua is a statement.  So there's a need for people to believe that Joshua is the clear number 1 and he passed that ti Usyk, because the alternative is that they are all historically middling and the era that they are watching and paying money for will be meaningless in 3 years.  As people begin to realize that last bit we start to get a lot of the "he's a bum talk"
When you start losing, suddenly those fake fans will turn on you.
I thought it was a flat performance and I’m not excusing Joshua not knocking Franklin out. That was my expectation and he clearly showed a lack of confidence and willingness to push for the KO BUT I think we have to give Franklin a little credit for his punch resistance here. He took some big shots. He was also doing a lot of holding in the late rounds when Joshua turned it up a little.   Poor performance imo and doesn’t bode well for Joshua against top opposition but although our expectation was a KO, Franklin didn’t just come to get knocked out. He trained hard for this fight and spoiled a lot.
When has Franklin ever shown to have another other than a solid chin.
Why? Helenius was what 40 years old? One of Wilders buddy's and his primary and most well known weakness was his chin...just like Malick Scott, Stiverne rematch etc. That fight was a setup, about as real as the muppets.
Calling Franklin a "handpicked KO victim" is a bit rich.  If he wanted a handpicked KO victim he should've fought Dillian Whyte, Franklin is tough as nails, very few fighters in the division would knock him out. Maybe only Wilder tbh.  Helenius is extremely chinny, he's been knocked dead multiple times by very mediocre fighters in the past, Franklin has never even been put down.
Maybe you decided that but I doubt AJ was going for a speed run KO
If he was a handpicked KO victime then they did a bad job as he'd never been knocked out before and looked tough vs WHyte
Parker had a good chin but Joyce got him out of there. AJ has lost his killer instinct, no need to see it any other way. Wilder, Joyce, and Fury (maybe) would have stopped Franklin!
People ignore Franklin skill.  Dude has amazing headmovement and counters for a guy his build and size . He isn’t
It’s not about going 12 round, it’s how you go 12 rounds. He’s scared to commit to a hard right hand and get countered and was literally clinching and looking at his corner for advice at 33 years old…mid fight. He’s always been overrated but it’s crazy dude looking at his corner for help lol
I think most of these people didn't watch the fight.  He won very convincingly and Franklin was in survival mode for the whole fight.  People just hate AJ for some reason.
If there’s one positive to take away from this at least Joshua wasn’t happy with the performance
Franklin’s clearly a bit of a nightmare to box against though and clinches and fucks around his way through. If you come with that gameplan and he’s clearly a tough MF’er then you’re always going to make life difficult for anyone, it’s like a crap football team that sits 11 behind the ball.
What an awful take. Joyce and Fury would both probably go the distance with Franklin - Franklin was just fighting to survive against Joshua and knew when to clinch and how to duck and dive. They'd both win every round but aren't knocking him out. Lastly Dubois really doesn't KO Franklin.
AJ would have KO'd Helenius. Wilder doesn't fight people with a chin. He struggled to put away Johan Duhapaus because he had somewhat of a chin
I don't think it did, he went on to beat Pulev, Ruiz and he showed himself well against the second Usyk fight.  All this lack of killer instinct stuff is ignoring the fact that AJ is fighting tougher opponents. If he was fighting people like Helenius he would be getting those early knockouts.
Tillis was not a wide decision. Close fight. Closer than the cards suggest.
Bonecrusher, Mitch Green & Tillis all fought to survive.  They spent a lot of time clinching for dear life.
AJ seems to be the only one to get conditions. "If he loses this fight his career is over" "If he doesn't knock Franklin out his career is over" "If he doesn't knock Franklin out in under six rounds his career is over" "He didn't fight super aggressively like I wanted him too, his career is over".  They picked a bad opponent if they wanted a knockout. Franklin can box. He's not there to get knocked out. And he clearly has a pretty good chin.
A win is a win.  We don't give Usyk 'conditions' that he must win by KO to be respected.  We don't give Mayweather 'conditions' that he must win by KO to be respected.  Why AJ? Because he *used* to be a KO guy? Well, that's fine, but if he wants to play a different game then that's his business.
I think the gun shy comments are unfair. He hit him with hard shots but you have to take into account Franklin just came to survive and clinch and clinch and clinch.
British sports, he's a total unknown outside the UK except to hardcore boxing fans.
I'd say he has to be top 5 at the least. Outside of Fury, Usyk, Wilder, or Joyce I don't think any other current HW would be a favourite against him.
He’s not even wrong saying that but it’s odd to say that to an arena full of people who’ve just paid to see him, basically telling them he wasn’t arsed about it and they should’ve just stayed home
He would KO AJ in a few rounds
The Joshua haters are coming out of the wood work to downvote you for telling the truth lol.
While I'm sure that's true with some people, it's because he acted like a total asshat after the Usyk fight that turned me off.  The argument after the Franklin fight just reinforced my negative feelings about him.  I seriously wonder if he didn't get a TBE in the Ruiz fight as it seems like he's lost some degree of self control since then.  He's a super poor sport these days.
It would have been more interesting for the division if AJ blew him away so in a way everyone was rooting a little bit for AJ but we still gotta respect how resistant Franklin was, for a rank 30 or so he punched above his weight.
> That fight was a setup, about as real as the muppets.  Both fights were setups, confidence builders for men coming back from big losses, Wilder got a KO for his highlight reel out of it so obviously that's more exciting than a clinchfest, it is what is is, let's not try to sell AJ v Franklin as some elite vs elite contest.
Whyte was considered too dangerous
AJ had every advantage possible. Dude was handpicked. And AJ could barely phase him.
Don't tell me, I'm not the one that was going around promising a KO in 6, it was his manager.
Try boxing someone who is just trying to survive, they're very hard to hit clean if they know what they're doing. Parker turned up to win against Joyce, whereas Franklin turned up to survive.
Joyce stopped Parker and AJ could not. Joyce walks him down and pummels him into submission inside ten rounds. YDKSAB
Tillis would’ve won on two judges cards without the knockdown actually. It was a very close fight.
I must've missed that one. Born in the early 80s and I thought I went back and saw all the major 80s fights but I likely missed a few.
The Tucker decision wasn't that wide either, iirc
>Tillis was not a wide decision. Close fight. Closer than the cards suggest.  Cowboy Tillis was that low-quality fighter who gave a great a tough fight.
I don't remember Tillis doing that, I just remember him boxing well and being light on his feet but ultimately being a little overwhelmed. I'll have to rewatch
They were calling Smith Boneclutcher after the fight.
Tillis came to fight.
I think it has more to do with the hype surrounding him  It’s almost like people forget that he was once seen as a Goliath type of boxer   I wouldn’t necessarily say his sudden change of personality AFTER losing is nothing of concern
Because Usyk and mayerather can actually box…they’re also multiple weight champions
I mean the guy was handpicked by Joshua's management for a KO and he didn't KO him.  The initial shout was he was going to fight the winner of Whyte Vs Franklin. Instead he chose to fight the loser and still didn't show anything close to championship level. It wasn't a good night at the office, and Joshua himself has admitted it.  In fairness it was step one of the rebuild, it'll be interesting to see what his next fight goes like if he chooses to take a step up in quality.
Joshua's Wikipedia page has more [views](https://pageviews.wmcloud.org/langviews/?project=en.wikipedia.org&platform=all-access&agent=user&range=all-time&sort=views&direction=1&view=list&page=Anthony%20Joshua) than any North American-born professional athlete under the age of 35.  The only ones who are even close are [Kevin Durant](https://pageviews.wmcloud.org/langviews/?project=en.wikipedia.org&platform=all-access&agent=user&range=all-time&sort=views&direction=1&view=list&page=Kevin%20Durant), [Canelo](https://pageviews.wmcloud.org/langviews/?project=en.wikipedia.org&platform=all-access&agent=user&range=all-time&sort=views&direction=1&view=list&page=Canelo%20%C3%81lvarez) and [Pat Mahomes](https://pageviews.wmcloud.org/langviews/?project=en.wikipedia.org&platform=all-access&agent=user&range=all-time&sort=views&direction=1&view=list&page=Patrick%20Mahomes).  If Joshua is unknown, then those guys are too.
Not true at all he’s a globally known brand name.
Not favourites but I don’t think a Ruiz trilogy fight is a foregone conclusion the way I did before
Or he's just been pimped his whole career like he was going to go down as an ATG and despite his career not supporting that, we're all supposed to still believe he's on track.  Have no hate towards Joshua himself, but I'm also not stupid and blind.  He's nowhere close to being an ATG.
He did some weird shit to Franklin right after the final bell as well. It's getting worse.
Franklin was a tune up, Helenius was a setup. Franklin was picked to fine tune Joshua and get him back to winning, Helenius was picked because he's Wilders friend and would be a quick night, not because he would fine tune Wilder or give him a legit win. Just like Malick Scott getting KO'd in 1 round who Wilder didn't even connect with.  One was for making a fighter better the other was a money grab and setup by both parties.
How would you know that?
Stylistically Jermaine Franklin is very very poor matchmaking if you want your fighter to get a highlight reel KO. Fast, tricky, good defence, and incredibly durable. He's the opposite of what you'd want for a knockout.  There's about 15 fighters ranked higher than Franklin who would've been better choices if they wanted a KO, including the guy who beat Franklin a few months ago.  Its either incredibly stupid matchmaking from Hearn or they didn't actually give a fuck about knocking the guy out, because Franklin is not the guy you pick if you want a knockout.
"YoU dOnT kNoW sHiT aBoUt BoXiNg" - fat guy who's never boxed.
That’s actually crazy to think about. It was a flash knockdown too. Doubt this “prime Tyson” discussion would even be a thing.
Important fight to put the PRIME TYSON mythos into perspective. Tillis did a lot of things right in that fight. Mike was just a little bit green, but more importantly Tillis used a good gameplan.
Not really close either. 116-112, 119-111 and 118-113.
He didn’t clinch as much as Bonecrusher, but he clinched when Tyson got in close and moved a lot as well.  I might have to rematch that fight myself.
I thought it was Bonehugger Smith.
Not sure how you watch that fight and draw that conclusion.. he fought as well as could be expected, beating Tyson to the punch on occasion, but he wasn’t effective at any point and mostly clinched and moved.
So AJ literally boxes himself to a unanimous win but that’s not okay because he’s still not a boxer in your eyes…
Young people don’t use Wikipedia. Businessmen do
Nice you left out lebron. Again AJ is training in Dallas and walks around and nobody has a clue who he is. Can’t say the same for those other guys.
No, he's totally unknown outside of England. He walks around Dallas and nobody knows who he is.
And AJ has every right to have a tune up, but people don't have to be super excited for it, jumping up and down like crazy, AJ is one of the biggest names in boxing people want to see him in big fights. If you think Helenius faked getting KOd and it wasn't a legit win, that's fine, I'd love to see Wilder and AJ fight, people have been asking for it since 2018 ffs.
hater
Because the fight wasn't made
You put all your brain cells together and came up with that, nice!
I thought the actual fight was a bit more competitive than the scorecards would suggest. I thought Tucker did really well, especially considering he came injured into the fight.
That too lol. He took a lot of abuse for it.
Wasn't effective at any point? He won multiple rounds and took advantage of Tyson's average stamina. You need to watch it again.
Beating a tin can doesn’t make you a good boxer. If anything it looks bad because it should have been a quick KO for him, he clearly came in looking for it
I said "under the age of 35". LeBron is 38.
How old are you 12? He’s one the most famous people on the planet
Wilder won't fight Joshua, he never wanted to, he never will. Nearly 50 fights, almost 2 decades as a pro and yet he's fought only 3 ranked heavyweights, 2 of which mediocre and very old and the other one he lost to. He ducked a 40 year old Klitschko whilst having 35+ fights,  the wbc and a bronze Olympic medal under the ruse of being a baby champion, the same old Klitschko Joshua beat with less than 20 fights and not even quarter the time as a pro(or amateur combined) as Wilder.  Why would Wilder all of sudden change now? He'll continue fighting the same level of opposition(Helenius, Szpilka, Molina, Washington etc/national level)and once every 5 years fight a past it or really old contender and hope it doesn't backfire like Fury did.
Either Eddie Hearn is an idiot (very possible) or they didn't consider Whyte too dangerous, because that's an absolute knock over job for AJ or any other top HW at this point.  Whyte is completely washed and his chin is non-existent, he starts wobbling in a stiff breeze these days. Much easier fight than Franklin.
So if Usyk boxed this guy and got a decision you’d be saying the same thing?
Like I said, convenient. And I’m telling you, AJ is a total unknown here.
That's a stretch. He's probably in the top 150.
He's not. He's training in the US and nobody has a clue who he is when he goes around. This is just British people think anyone cares about England anymore.
Whyte has power though
Depends if he went to a heavy weight, fight someone who’s not really good enough and was clearly after a stoppage. There would literally be no point Usyk boxing this guy. AJ only did it for an easy win and didn’t win as easily as he expected to
I don't doubt it, but you said "he's a total unknown outside the UK", which is just blatantly untrue.
His point still stands AJ could walk around Dallas for an hour before someone would recognize him and get accused of racism
Outside of Nigeria and the UK he could probably walk around in any country in the world and be unrecognized. Boxing is a niche sport
Like I've already mentioned, there's a good chance Joshua is more globally famous than any North American-born professional athlete under the age of 35.  You can't tell me all those Wikipedia page views are just from Nigeria and the UK.
Two things.  1st is that after years of poor health due to long covid & pneumonia,  an injury related to a drunk driver hitting me & depression killing any form of athleticism & essentially killing my amateur career (was 41w-10L, based in Scotland)   I have finally got back into boxing myself, easier myself into getting properly fit again and now I suck ass but I hit some pads, did some road work and even saw one of my old boxing coaches at a new gym.   2nd - saw the AJ Laura wood interview, feel it was such a natural AJ he came across super well in the casual setting. Would like to see more of it.
Ring Mag dropping some fire news about a potential big fight this morning!🤞
Spence Jr Vs Crawford rumoured for June 17th. According to ring magazine. Hopefully it's true but you know.
My interpretation of the 168 division as of today:  Canelo is undisputed, fighting one of the “interim” champions (Ryder) as a WBO mandatory. The other two mandatory “interim” champions are David Benavidez (WBC), and David Morrell (WBA). IBF has Scull as their #1. Canelo might fight Bivol at LHW in the fall (or maybe at SMW).  Benavidez camp has said they’ve sent contracts signed by David to Morrell, Mall Charlo, Andrade, and Plant. Plant is the only one that returned a contract, but it had A-side demands. David signed and won on UD. Morrell’s trainer said David Morrell is not ready for that level if a step up yet. Morrell is fight a #21ish ranked opponent on the Tank v Garcia card. Mall is still injured/out. Andrade is being Andrade.   Matchroom signed Berlanga and said he could get a Canelo fight at the end of his three fight deal. Matchroom also has Diego Pacheco in their stable. So, two potential Mexican/Mexican descent vs Puerto Rico for a fight.   I don’t know anything or have ever seen Scull.   Am I missing anything?
So it’s really just Fury Usyk that fell through out of the big fights that were supposed to happen this year, the main ones people were talking about seem to have come through
dan rafael via twr:  *...****per Ring report that Spence-Crawford is set for June 17: two sources directly involved told me, yes, negotiations continue (no secret)*** ***but deal not close & even if made won’t be June 17*****\***. That’s best version of the truth as I know it.\*
I just gotta say it’s a great time to be a fight fan
Why is a fighter like Amir Khan testing positive for ostarine FFS? It's a SARM that costs about 30 quid a month and it's not even very good compared to other shit you could be doing for the same price. It's also one of the easiest things to test for.  The more I see shit like this the more credibility I give to contaminated supplement excuses, no chance Amir Khan was taking ostarine before he fought Kell Brook. That's an unemployed "bodybuilder" drug not a professional athlete drug, it's the pot noodle of PEDs.
The White Rhino is back 🦏
Does anyone know what happened to the WBA’s plan to move HQ to Houston? Did it get scrapped? I haven’t heard anything since last year.
George Groves Boxing Club is definitely my favourite boxing podcast currently.
Am I the only one that thought Joshua looked pretty good? He didn't take a risk and try to get a KO, but his defense looked great, and he his footwork was putting him in the right place to land his right hand multiple times throughout the fight.
Ugh, I can already imagine Fury’s ugly mug climbing into ring after Usyk UDs Daniel Dubois and calling for a showdown with Usyk, issuing him a new deadline while has Chisora IV lined up
Hi all, I'm after an invite to TC Boxing. I got into boxing 4 years ago by chance because a community boxing club opened in my local neighborhood association, just downstairs from my flat. When I started I thought it was a brute sport, and that I would never ever fight, and now I volunteer in that same gym. I'm always searching for the newest fights but also old classics we can show at the community gym, and I really have no reliable way to find them, so that's why I want an invite :D  I can give excellent ratio proof no problem.  I don't think this is against the rules, but sorry if this is not allowed 🙏  Thank you very much!
my predictions  **Loma UD**. Loma is not someone that you can outbox or outpace,  you need to bully and overpower him. Even though Teo didn't exactly maul him, his superior size and how he imposed it was crucial in that fight. I don't think Haney is that kind of fighter. Though I'm rooting for him and believe he could make it interesting  **Tank UD**. When you have two punchers fighting, go for the better boxer and Tank is a *much* better boxer. I don't think we'll be getting a slugfest that some might anticipate. We'll see Tank being the matador as he methodically contains Ryan. Maybe we'll get 2-3 rounds of great action but it will mostly be a chess match  **Taylor UD**. Teo hasn't look good since the Loma fight, and while Taylor didn't look great in his last fight either, his results has been much better both recently and in general. Just more layers to his game and a bigger man to boot  **Fulton SD**. This is the hardest one for me. Both guys are so so good, but I think Cool Boy has the skill and more importantly, the size to survive and squeak through Inoue. His inside game will be crucial
And now Bud is 35 and Spence is like 33 and we won’t even get the best fight we can and will sell 250k PPVs. Good job boys
Charlo Vs Tszyu delayed, again.   Ya boy charlo running scared with his tail between his legs
Rayo was quick to ask for a rematch with 130lb Chris Colbert, but when he got stopped by Edwin De Los Santos…  Rayo: (crickets)
That Bam card is really good
is it just me, or did Anthony Joshua look stiff, and hesitant? looks like he's jumped the shark and probably would do best to retire
I havent followed boxing for a few months, is Usyk v Fury happening or not?
People that say Devin Haney is boring but call Bivol entertaining 😂😂
The reason Crawford and Spence took so long to make is because you morons keep talking about how it’s not a big fight and Eddie Hearn was saying Canelo-GGG 3 will do better numbers than it. Just absolutely ridiculous nonsense. The two best welterweights and a fight that’s been talked about for years, YEARS in the making. The only bigger fight than Crawford-Spence is Tank-Garcia because they’re the two biggest social media stars in the sport, Garcia attracts all the casual fans and teenage girls and tank attracts all the casual fans and middle aged single moms besides that Crawford-Spence will do better numbers than nearly any other fight in the sport, just because of how long it’s been anticipated. Promoters and boxers look on social media like everyone else, public opinion can sway the direction of fights.
I pray Richardson Hitchins doesn’t turn down the IBF title Eliminator fight with Shohjahon Ergashev. Someone will happily take it if Hitchins declines.
Loma has overtaken the throne as biggest dumbass in boxing. Dude is running around w/ 19 fights 2 loses proclaiming he’s undefeated. Should be seriously tested for brain damage, I have a feeling this is only an appetizer of more stupid shit to come from Loma’s mouth.💀
[The fight is never going to happen](https://twitter.com/terencecrawford/status/1643311107140988929?t=XPpO398rU6R1kxh2VSyorg&s=19)
#Otto wallin Vs Joshua should be next  Joshua can get this one in the summer, and go for fury in the winter  https://www.boxingscene.com/amp/tyson-fury-vs-otto-wallin-compubox-punch-stats--142567  Otto wallin according to Compubox maintained 6 rounds where he had more accuracy and punches landed against fury. Fury essentially robbed wallin of a draw at the least. It may not have been a blatant robbery like Franklin Whyte or Canelo GGG 1, but it looks certainly wasn't a dominant performance.
Can someone tell me how to get the Gracia vs Davis ppv when it comes around? My cousin wants to watch it but neither of us are sure where to find it
Jahi Tucker might be the next best thing in boxing. His opponent last week Nikoloz Sekhniashvili started off at LHW & was a HW in the amateurs!  The best thing about Jahi Tucker’s last performance to me was that after out dogging him at Nikoloz own game and walking him back, Tucker during the last round smoothly & effortlessly started outboxing behind the jab w/ range and Nikoloz had ZERO answers.  Xander Zayaz COME PICK YOUR MANs UP & CATCH THAT FADE w/ Tucker
Congrats on getting back in the gym, thats a lot to come back from and not everyone does.
Keep at it champ!
I got Crawford winning, but who knows really.
WRONG. Ronnie Shields DID NOT say David Morrell’s not ready.  Coach Ronnie Shields has said on numerous occasions that Morrell is more than prepared to fight Benavidez & Canelo and he’s confident Morrell would win. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/live/vgi8oyVduwA?feature=share)
They haven't confirmed KSI vs Jake Paul.
Tyson Fury is even harder to negotiate with than Crawford, crazy. He has now ducked AJ and Usyk and led people on for months.
Facts, the highest level have the money and access to get the stuff that is ahead of testing.  Like, A-Rod was dropping 12k per month on the juice and appointments way back when
Why are you under the impression that someone being a professional means they are knowledgeable on PEDs?  Ostarine is not a "bodybuilding" drug. If you go to any respected bodybuilding forum they will tell you that SARMs are fucking garbage and only stupid 17 year olds take them. Ostarine is the weakest drug in the weakest group of drugs.  There are professional coaches of **all** levels giving out shit advice. The amount of broscience in locker rooms is astounding. I have seen massively jacked guys give some of the most atrocious PED advice I've ever heard.   There are thousands of medical doctors who don't even properly understand the best protocols for testosterone replacement therapy. Do you really think a bunch of gym rats are gonna be well educated on it?
The article said an independent tribunal cleared him. I’m just saying, the way UKAD handled Fury should make people question them.
following
He looked *different.* in a vacuum, knowing nothing about AJ, I’d say he had a snappy jab, controlled the pace, and won easy on 9 or 10 of the 12.   In reality, AJ is still hesitant of getting sparked by a left and he doesn’t want to stay in the pocket and bang.  *edit:* scared of the RIGHT
a lot of clinching because he couldnt keep franklin away with his jab, idk I think it confirms hed be dog meat for fury. He should chase the Wilder fight
Don't get excited.
"Twinkle toes, rabbit feet...."
I agree with everything besides two: Tank by Ko, Inoue by Ko. Otherwise, I agree.
the charlos have fought once combined since 2021
No for now :(
I know bro, they fight almost the same way! Though I would say Haney clinches more, but I do get the sense he's changing gears constantly. Bivol, as good as he is without clinching, stays one paced when he could be stopping the likes of Lenin Castillo.
Most of them never saw Bivol fight before he fought Canela.
Make his name Devashek Hanavolchenko and he would be P4p #1
They even say Usyk is entertaining. They want knockouts from a 135-pound Haney, but they are satisfied with no knockouts or knockdowns from a heavyweight Usyk.
Yeah sure you're right, it's our fault. If only Al and Espinoza had been showered with positivity when they browse reddit on their evenings at home, then this would have been made years ago.
Whether the fight happened last November, last month or June 17th, the marquee value of the fight has remained the same.
I don't think we are the reason to blame for the fight not happening, when Crawford ***literally*** said it was because they moved the fight date forward and he wasn't gonna wait that long.
Jake Paul is the biggest social media star in the sport.
I think people underestimate how patient Errol Spence fans have been, for him to return to the ring in over a year to fight Crawford for undisputed is HUGE for Texas. Crawford, not the biggest draw but still bigger than most, has the sweet science that gets the respect from almost EVERYONE in combat sports who appreciates skills that are executed at the highest level.   And because you have a Masterclass Megafight matchup between boxing’s P4P best Spence/Crawford together for Undisputed, you can expect a majority of all boxers trainers executives reporters/journalist both current & retired to support this fight.  Tank/Haney talks are creeping up but Spence/Crawford is still the most talked about matchup in boxing.
That’s the dumbest thing you’ve heard a boxer say? That he thinks of himself as undefeated? I envy you man.
Hmmm so wilder was more truthful than loma. Didnt know that
First of all, he got robbed, and secondly he gave Lopez 6 rounds intentionally. So It was a figure of speech from loma, and I understand what he means.
he could be just talking shit, but i dunno
"According to Compubox"...  This isn't amateur boxing. You don't, and can't, score a fight based on raw punch statistics, which is also secondary to the fact that Compubox is literally people pushing a button when they see a punch landed and is open to human failure.
>Fury essentially robbed wallin of a draw at the least  Oh boy, here you go again....

No, just because Shields changed his tune last couple months, doesn't mean he never said that.   >“It’s a huge fight,” said Shields, who also trains unbeaten WBC middleweight champ Jermall Charlo. **“This kid wants to fight everybody, but sometimes you have to save fighters from themselves, you know, and take a better path, so that you don’t run into something that you’re not ready for.** At the same time, let me tell you something, this kid, man, he wants to learn and he wants to beat everybody.  >“But I just think that I’ll take a clear look at it. Right now, do I feel confident that he could beat Benavidez or Caleb Plant? I think he’d give them all a run for their money right now. **But I feel when this kid is ready, then we do that. I don’t wanna rush him into something.** He goes and beats Benavidez, then what? He’s not gonna get Canelo.”  --june 2022 interview   So you are correct, he's changed his tune last couple months and started saying Morrell is ready, but before that, around last summer he was def saying "we'll wait a bit"
LOL [I’ve posted this link so many times in the last two weeks.](https://www.boxingscene.com/amp/morrells-trainer-on-fighting-benavidez-next-i-wanna-rush-him-into-something--166797)
Paul is putting on more legit undercards than the real promoters at least
I never said it was a bodybuilding drug, I said it was a "bodybuilding" drug. The quotations were there to imply that whoever uses it doesn't have a fucking clue what they're doing, either that or they can't get access to anything better (which is a legit reason to use it tbf).  Amir Khan, a multi millionaire, former world champion and olympic medalist who has trained with some of the greatest trainers in some of the greatest gyms around the world for nearly 2 decades, is not going to be taking ostarine intentionally.
Amir Khan is probably not the brightest of the bunch but to think multimillionaire boxer training with the best trainers and training partners would be taking illegal supplements from "bunch of gym rats" is an interesting take to say the least.
Lol
Yeah, Haney does clinch more in all fairness but at least he's got more punch variety. Most of Bivol's fights consist of him throwing 1-2 over and over and people call it a masterclass yet when beats a guy with Haney just a jab, he gets called boring and a guy with only a jab 😂
[r/boxing if his name was Devibiy Haneybov](https://youtu.be/1e0DgPFizBc)
Him and Yan Garcivskyi
Gotta love the Eastern European bias 😂  It's funny because Bivol, despite being a Eastern European, before the Canelo fight wasn't really getting hyped up by boxing fans but since then, they've gone a little crazy.
To be honest, I've never watched a boring Usyk fight but your point about the knockouts is spot on.
You're totally right, but there's a chance you may not like the implications of that for Haney  Here's the amount of weight Usyk has given up in his 4 heavyweight fights:  Witherspoon: 27 pounds Chisora: 38 pounds Joshua 1: 19 pounds Joshua 2: 23 pounds Total weight disadvantage: 107 pounds, or almost 27 pounds per fight  It's been 4 years since Haney's last stoppage. In the last 5 years, he's 11-0 (3), for a 27% knockout rate. Usyk's stoppage rate at heavyweight is 25%.  So, you're spot on- if you handicap Usyk (who had a healthy 75% stoppage rate at Cruiser) by having him spot his oppenent an average of roughly 27 pounds (and never less than 19), you have a comparable puncher with lightweight Haney over the last 5 years.
Yeah maybe if you guys were positive it would’ve been made sooner.
It should have happened 5 years ago but regardless moronic takes have swifter public opinion on the marquee of this fight which is greatly being underestimating and therefore making negotiations more difficult for the fighters.
That’s just nonsense. It had to do with the guaranteed purse and he said that multiple times.
Haney is a nobody compared to Spence or Crawford. One day he may be a similar or bigger draw but for right now he’s just the undisputed champ who got it by beating Kambosos, who is a nobody himself.
I don’t think I said dumbest thing I heard, but Loma is leading the dumbest boxer race atm.  *“It’s not about bias, it’s about being bribed. There was nothing about honest judging.”* - Loma on losing his WBA WBO & Ring Mag Titles to 23y/o Teofimo Lopez  Mf has shown consistent poor sportsmanship when losing, he losses his mind & his behavior is more similar to Teo AJ AB than anyone would of imagined lol. What a complete idiot Loma is.
Loma=Wilder, good comparison I agree
Please go back to r/NoFap
So annoying. Fear of losing an undefeated record is killing the sport.
Most fights are in compliance to Compubox..  That's the superfluous irony of it.   The robberies we see, when put under scope also are OFTEN NOT IN COMPLIANCE to Compubox.   Josh Taylor Jack catterall - robbery - Taylor only won 3/4 rounds   Franklin Whyte - Franklin won 8 rounds   Canelo GGG - GGG won by 2 rounds or so   Etc.  These are the kind of robberies where people can see it with their eyes that something wasn't right, yet when you look at the statisticas THEY'RE PROVEN RIGHT..
No my fault if you're mathematically illiterate.  If a fighter lands more punches and has more accuracy in a round - they've won the round  Notice I didn't say lands more **or** more Accuracy. If you have both, you win it. It's how boxers win 99% of their fights, name any fight you want, and the winner usually lands more AND has more accuracy or a knockout.  So why's this taken out of the equation 1% when there are situations like Canelo GGG, Franklin Whyte, and other robberies. Even Josh Taylor catterall, for their undisputed fight, there was massive backing that it was a robbery, and according to Compubox it also agrees that it was a robbery, josh Taylor mathematically only won 3 rounds.   Why you even complaining, this is basic.
Oh wow you did the work lol looks like his quote was referencing Morrell not being ready based off his drawing power opposed to not being ready to fight. I’ve only heard Shields welcome fights w/ Benavidez & Canelo when speaking on Morrell.  Funny thing is Benavidez/Morrell was scheduled to fight before Plant returned his interest in Benavidez.
You posted link to a year old article so many times in the last two weeks w/o realizing Ronnie Shields speaks periodically on Morrell & his other fighters? Strange to push an outdated opinion but if I see it I’ll correct it out of respect for Coach Shields.
Paul is overcompensating.
That's how it works buddy. I don't know why you guys think just because someone makes money they are smart. But go ahead and dick ride while being ignorant at the same time.  Can you name us a well educated steroid dealer and counselor? No? Okay then.

Can you ease up on the racism? Bivol is from Socal. What's next you gonna call Joe Joyce strong? I mean yeah he's 6'6 270lb with a 6 pack and legs like Tom Platz but that's beside the point
If you have to do all this math, then just give up. Usyk is 220 pounds. That's not atypical for a heavyweight. Do you want me to start listing all the 220-pound heavyweight champions that have amazing stoppage rates?
I agree on the 5 years ago part, but what real evidence is there that this fight will do big numbers? Spence had a decent number with Mikey (decent, not great), but his buys have been decreasing with each fight. Crawford's highest buys is 150k. If I were to estimate, this fight will definitely sell more than Spence v Mikey, but not a whole lot higher imo.
BRO LOOOLOLOLOL
Good one
>No my fault if you're mathematically illiterate.  I have a degree in Maths, so the joke is on you. You really don't want to go down this rabbit hole.  It is not my fault that you can't use your own eyes when watching a fight! It's not my fault that you lack the skills to think for yourself!! You rely on compubox stats which are scientifically proven to not be accurate!!!
Stop it. “He’s just a baby” is referencing he is pro ability.
Bro. Fucking stop. You said Ronnie shields DID NOT say. He did. I posted NOTHING wrong. If we are being real, it’s real convenient to start saying you’re ready after Benavidez was signed to fight Plant. Now, it’s real convenient to try and jump up now that Benavidez moved into clear contention to get number 1 shot at Canelo (at least as far as Sanctioning Bodies go).  Morrell should just keep quiet for a bit while he stays on undercards fighting boxers ranked in the 20s.
Personally think he's preparing for life as a real promoter.
> Can you name us a well educated steroid dealer and counselor?  I can name plenty. Let's start with Dr Usman Sajjad, who takes care of Tyson Fury and Conor Benn among many other boxers and MMA fighters.  Amir Khan didn't go his entire career without testing positive once only to be caught in his final fight taking fucking ostarine.  The fact that you're trying to belittle the intelligence of boxers when you're thick enough to believe that Amir Khan was taking ostarine is hilarious. The idea of Amir Khan just logging in to receptor chem and getting a few vials of ostarine and maybe some enclo and ibutamoren for about £100 lol.  He's not on the same protocol as we are mate, he's on the shit that we're too poor to get.
The irony of you calling Khan thick when you genuinely seem to believe he picks up his gear from some guy in a locker-room and his cycle isn’t designed and curated by someone much more knowledgeable than him.  You think he plans his workouts himself too?  Writes his own diet during camp?
There are hundreds of well educated steroid dealers and counselors you dummy. Why do you think most of them dont get caught while obliviously being on PEDs?
For a split second you had me 😂
That wannabe boxer is shadow boxing in his mother's basement lol. Keep your head up bro.
>I have a degree in Maths, so the joke is on you  Are you taking the piss out of yourself or what.  Ok let me ask you this?, If You claim to be a logical thinker   Out of the many recent fights that have been under the scope of compubox  Have most of them that aren't robberies YES OR NO been in compliance to Compubox. ?   Keyword: aren't robberies  Then we'll go into the ones that have been claimed or be robberies vice versa.  Simple question for you fella.
I don’t live in Summer 22’
Lol I’m not a Morrell fan, nor do I think he beats Benavidez nor do I prefer Benavidez/Morrell over or before Canelo/Benavidez… so spare me lol  But you can [tune in tonight](https://www.youtube.com/live/RSJbt8aHBrA?feature=share) to listen and ask Ronnie Shields questions for yourself @8pm
Cheers for the save.
‘Mathematically winning a round’ is not a thing. Otherwise fights would be decided by compubox. You can throw AND land more punches in a single round and still lose the round due to damage.
Let me answer your question with another question. Do you believe Thurman got robbed against Pacquiao? Because the CompuBox showed Thurman landed more and threw less, meaning he was more accurate than Pacquiao. But the general consensus was that Pacquiao was definitely the deserved winner in a competitive and close fight, me included, and I was rooting for Thurman to win that fight.  EDIT: Hahahaa your response got blocked by Reddit because you must have resorted to profanity 😂 #WastedEffort
I’m not the one that said “Ronnie Shield DID NOT say David Morrell’s not ready.”  He did say it. They passed. Plant stepped up. JFC, why is that so hard to accept.
>You can throw AND land more punches in a single round and still lose the round due to damage.  You mean knockdowns...that's aside the point.  I'm telling you as a man that's checked out compubox for the 20 fights, of which most were unanimous wins, draws and full 12 fights, that's 99% of them are in compliance to a fighter landing and having accuracy.  >You can throw AND land more punches in a single round and still lose the round due to damage.  And throwing is irrelevant, compared to punches landed, you need actual accuracy and you didn't note the fact I said:  MORE PUNCHES LANDED AND ACCURACY (without any knockdowns   It's basic.   View last 20 most watched fights, and you'll see every fight that's an unanimous decision complies with that expression.   The robberies on the other hand don't.
>Morrell’s trainer said David Morrell isn’t ready for that level of a step up yet  Coach Shields damn sure ain’t say this lol.   Morrell accepted, Benavidez wanted the #2 guy Caleb Plant more than the #3 Morrell. It’s simple whether you want to accept or not idc. Arguing won’t change my opinion duke lol
Nope, wasn’t even talking about knockdowns. Damage alone you can win a round while being out struck and outlanded. It’s not a very foreign concept.
Ok, Turbo. You keep stanning for Morrell. Here’s Shield’s quote: “But I just think that I’ll take a clear look at it. Right now, do I feel confident that he could beat Benavidez or Caleb Plant? I think he’d give them all a run for their money right now. But I feel when this kid is ready, then we do that. I don’t wanna rush him into something.”  Further: “He’s a baby, and I think we have to let him grow.”  Chew on that.
What I'm saying is, from each fight that's a unanimous win without anyone shouting robbery like Joshua usyk 1, Bivol Ramirez, Canelo Bivol, haney kambosos etc. Compubox has a very consistent compliance with the end result, each round from  people seeing whose landing more AND who has accuracy (both)  However, a big however  When there is robberies, Compubox is ALSO in compliance with what people were seeing even without stats, like  Robberies:  GGG canelo - most people thought GGG won, and the stats from Compubox revealed that GGG had 7 rounds where he statistically had more punches landed and accuracy  Josh Taylor Jack catterall - most people saw a blatant win from jack catterall, and the stats showed that josh Taylor only maintained 3-4 rounds where he had more Accuracy or punches landed   Ygm, like 99% of unanimous decision with compubox offer a **positive correlation** with a fighter winning a round based off more punches landed and accuracy.  And   When there is robberies what people sometimes can't immediately point their fingers to (no one's going to count every punche landed) Compubox state also *confirm this overall*.  So there is definitely a good confidence level when looking at stats and the numbers.
Roy Jones is a shit trainer  Someone needs to tell this guy that simply getting your fighter to emulate you without the iq and physical attributes to pull it off won’t work out well  Make the necessary changes and you MIGHT grind out a tough decision, if not your boy will be getting spanked like he did the first time.
Rjj needs to stop trying to teach people his style. It doesn’t work with anyone that isn’t Roy. You need inhuman speed reflexes and power for his style to work
Roy Jones Jr and his boxers are like 0-3 in the last six months, right? Eubank Jr, that young kid that fought in Mexico, and himself. Am I missing anyone?
This is just a terrible partnership.
Eubank needs a proper coach and cornerman if he wants to do something with his career. Keep RJJ as the pad guy or something.
Eubank's career was pretty much over from the moment, after all the years of training himself, he chose RJJ to work with. The guy is 33, with no big wins, just lost by KO to a guy moving up a division and is left with an inadequate style that he is trying to replicate.  Even if he changes coaches there is no time as his greatest attribute - his engine is no longer going to be so good. At this point he really needs to push for the Benn fight and try to cashout.
eubanks style before roy was fine. bro downgraded after doing the roy jones cosplay. a better jab with his old style would’ve made him much better than he is now.
It didn’t even work for Roy himself towards the end of his career
The crazy thing is that Eubank is crazy athletic already and ended up getting sparked trying to fight like Roy, really shows you the type of generational athlete he was.
I mean himself losing may be due more to the fact he’s about 90
Eubank's best option would be to move forward to a different trainer. Doesn't look likely sadly.
Going up to heavyweight and then back down to light heavyweight quickly had a huge cost and would ruin anyone’s body. Think that had more to do with it.   I often wonder how he would have been if he never went up to heavyweight
Because he lost his inhuman speed and reflexes.
Exactly.
I rarely say this about anyone. But Eubank needs to go to train with Abel Sanchez at the summit
He would be the undisputed goat. But man had too much confidence in himself
I wouldn’t recommend Abel Sanchez for anyone
or like a robert garcia, someone who won’t change you as a fighter but rather fine tune and improve what you’re already good at while adding a tool or two to your arsenal.
he already beat everybody he could at light heavyweight besides darius michalschewski which is a shame but he still dominated that weightclass, that’s why he moved up. roy can arguably be put in a top 10 p4p of all time list and definitely top 5 based on skill. beat bernard hopkins who would become undisputed and the guy at middleweight for a long time, james toney at super middleweight who was the best super middleweight of his era and an atg, undisputed at light heavy with wins over virgil hill and montell griffin, and then beating a heavyweight, amazing career.
