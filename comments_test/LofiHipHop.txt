This song has a very nice bassline and hihat pattern.  The kick could be turned up a notch but great job nonetheless.
The rhythm is great, and it sounds very soothing to listen to.

My first album at 15 years old  Feedback Appreciated   https://open.spotify.com/album/6FhL51PuGhHl8RV9BktNKt?si=sBVjT1g0RKur3ct4ePO4ug
This is my newest single „transition“: https://open.spotify.com/track/7cJ7hj3dzp0bJHPP8c22Ai
Just released this single today! I usually listen to a beat on a bunch of different speakers before releasing it, but I was dragging my feet on this one for a while, so I just went for it. Drums ended up a bit too loud because of it. Let me know if you catch anything else that I could do better in the future.   [you.](https://open.spotify.com/track/69Lj7tRJJExk3GZxd1k7Yg?si=yL8IJ1j7TFyJAHY0okAy0A&dd=1)
New release.  Wonder what you think of it.  Any feedback appreciated.  https://open.spotify.com/album/2vzUuLRcRfqSqog2bSXWFd?si=xou3ICRoSK-VsANro7t81w  Thanks
Like the whole album! You've got some great melodies in there. Keep up the good work! If I could give any constructive criticism (and this is just my personal opinion. Your own opinion is what really matters), I would say to focus on your kicks a bit. They were a bit muddled sounding in a few of the tracks. It's hard to say exactly what I would do differently, but i would tighten up the kick a little. And then boost a little bit more of the mid/high frequencies on it so it has a little more presence. Again, that's just personal opinion. I'm a sucker for punchy lofi kick. Everything else sounds awesome, though. Hope this helps you in some way.
I'm sure this would sound sweet in my car, but with the little headphones I have on, the kick and snare are a little quiet, in my opinion. I have a bad tendency to make my drums too loud, though, so take this with a grain of salt. Nice beat, though! Very mellow.

Yeah, it sounds good mate, nice and chill. What piano did you use?
it’s called [meadows.mp3](https://open.spotify.com/track/4X8kosrst012bmM9db2na8?si=N4M61oSWQuWcwEK0O9CLCg&dd=1) if anyone wants to listen :)
I honestly think it sounds awesome. My personal preference is for less kicks but that's just a personal thing so please take it with a grain of salt. I don't ever want to tell a fellow artist to conform their art to my standards cause that's not how art works lol. love the animation loop too btw

Cool
I've been collecting vinyl for about 15 years now. There's some gold out there for sure!
I'm looking to get a zoia! How do you use it in your setup?
I miss going to the local record shops and digging through all the old cheap beat up records and finding magic, good times. Nice beat, keep it up.

love this set up! what’s it called (the vinyl player?) 💕
I use it for a bunch actually! But mainly for pre-processing external audio before sending it into the mpc for mixing.   Anything from running the cab sim on a guitar (or ukulele!) signal, to adding effects to external synths that I route into the MPC.   It handles it all easily, and the midi/CV support make it easy to control and automate effect changes from the mpc as well.
Thanks! It’s the Victrola Eastwood.

You can achieve the same result (minus the pops and crackles) with your DAW's eq, downsampler, and some light pitch automation. Save the FX chain after you're happy with the results so you don't have to recreate it every time.  Not only is it free, but the satisfaction of making it yourself is priceless!
Cymantics is versatile, but you can get Izotope Vinyl for free during their giveaways, wouldn't be surprised if they did another one for Summer

You're a legend.
Thanks boss....

holy shit, downloading it as im writing this! cant wait to use it!
That's great - thank you!  I got good results running the wavs through [Klevgrand Brusfri](https://klevgrand.com/products/brusfri) to remove the background noise, although I realise that this might remove a vital part of the ambience.
This is the third post about lofi hip hop and air traffic controller recordings I’ve seen in a day.   This website mashes up lofi with live air traffic and you can pick the airport you want to listen to.   [LoFi Air Traffic](https://www.lofiatc.com/)
Thanks a LOT man, this is also very usefull for underground techno ;)
Hope you find them useful man
More than welcome

I would say not traditional Lofi but could still probably make an argument for it. Reminds me a lot more dreamy pop, think Beach House.
Thanks! I'm working to make these visuals available for the public to interact with and apply their own beats to the animation. Until that is complete dm me on insta and I'll see what I can do for you.   Insta [@manifest_3d](https://instagram.com/manifest_3d?igshid=ZDdkNTZiNTM=)

When it comes to lofi my mastering chain its a simple compressor so i can glue the mix, then i use a normal eq, a saturator, a vst of a analog eq, stereo shaper, limiter and LUFS reader.
The Glue compressor is very nice to glue all the different layers, I use it always. not only on the master chain. also when I make groups for drums, mid freq, low end etc.

I like that you're trying new ideas. I think I could this song and [this one](https://soundcloud.com/liquos/mysterious-jazzuo?si=a8636daed08f450c8c56ac0ea2778ac2&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing) in the same sub-genre?
soulful!
:) felt like I was in a MMO lobby but for the original Perfect Dark or something.
Maybe. It seems that track is drawing on some of the same sources I was while making this. Things like mid 2000s UK dubstep, Brainfeeder glitch hop, post-bop etc. I feel like more diverse, active listening, album-oriented lofi is going to become a thing here real soon.
