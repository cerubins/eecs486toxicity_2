Why is this whole sub Eminem and NF
This is a typical Em verse tho, but he definitely knew how to flow on that beatüî•üò≠ made Fat Joe‚Äôs verse forgettable.
It wouldn't even be a top five verse on Billy Woods album that year.   ¬†
Nf?
With all due respect. Em does that to everyone. We only remember what Em said üòÇ
They dropped an album?
What about college park
Scaring the hoes
Was another thread about this called for? It doesn't change the fact its not good.
Thank you
Let me guess you didn‚Äôt actually listen to it
Tried to just like all his other work. Same junk different release.

The dude who didn‚Äôt pick drake for all picks except 1.
Hmmm, I‚Äôm going with player 2, but player 1 has amazing songs
Nah it‚Äôs not
Ehhhhhh
Doesn‚Äôt he have a grape (or assault) case; and doesn‚Äôt he like to fondle his mother‚Äôs cheeks üçë ???? Dudes a certified weirdo.
He  got  rappers and fans that ignore all the evil shit he did just because he made no flockin and yeah he did r*pe that girl yet only gets 18 months probation and by that point Kodak should have been sentenced to 30 years but the justice system had to save his lil junebug ass
Yeah‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs a shame. I think he makes good music; he‚Äôs just a weirdo.
Exactly
the first 2 are nice
2nd, would have been 3rd if it wasn‚Äôt 2 yachty songs
None, they all trash.
Shit music
wrong sub for those songs bro lmao
None of them
I'd hang onto it
the walls are closing in no to yes the and
it too late it the oldheads lurk in the shadows

This went hard in the club. I miss those days.
One of the only Wayne songs ik. Its fire
This joint sounds like it took some heavy New Orleans Bounce influence.
I prefer the original but Wayne kills everyone on this.
Is this your favorites?
Where MMLP, Capital Punishment, Illmatic, Paid in Full, TES, Stillmatic,   SSLP, 2001, The Chronic, Doggystyle, AEOM, GKMC, LotPaD,  etc. be at, though?

Man I know u/Kholdstare93 is pissed about this song lmaooo
Meh, Joyner has always done songs with some lyrically lackin' ''rappers''(Young Thug is another example) for crossover appeal; Joyner be on my top ten nevertheless because of how crazy his rapping skill is lyrically. Can't be mad at him doing some songs here and there I don't agree wit' as long as he still puts out that work at the end of the day, too, know what  I'm sayin'?
We made the money for this just like Thug did for the other one
They were trendy for their time, ig and don‚Äôt seem to hold up for their music as time went on. Not sure though, just my guess.
Imo the beat is perfect and I like the style and sound he is going for but the lyrics take me out of it way too much. Between the American Express bar and the Pitbull line and the word mommy and the Kim K sample there are just too many mediocre lyrics that it kinda ruins it but I hope I change my mind and grow to love the song despite the lyrics because the sound and beat are really cool.
Drake still SOFT! REAL TALK!
Yeah, those lines are wack.  They don‚Äôt ruin the track for me personally because with these tracks, I don‚Äôt really need good (not even great) writing. It could just be me though.  Like, give me a romantic vibe and a great beat and unless you‚Äôre Jack Harlow levels of dogshit writing (I give them sweet, sweet, sweet semen, I like to dictate things Kim Jong, etc) and shit mood capturing (Harlow is forever racing to reach the chorus üòÇ) and I‚Äôm generally fine (which is what this song is).
Von was a natural but lol let‚Äôs chill. RIP MF DOOM!
Ay nah von dumped on dis tho

Wow I can‚Äôt believe Lupe won over J Dilla, TI and Clipse hahah that is a massive L  Graduation got this easily but Below The Heavens is right up there too
Lupe Fiasco - The Cool
I‚Äôm torn between Below the Heavens by Blu & Exile and Desire by Pharoahe Monch. Maybe I‚Äôll go with Blu & Exile?
Anything other than Graduation is wrong. That‚Äôs something we should all agree on.
American Gangster
Crazy how everyone was anti Kanye for like 4 months now everyone forgot about his 2022 antics. He DEFINITELY wins‚Ä¶not just this list but @ Life in general.
Prolly useless with the Ye dickriding but Below The Heavens by Blu & Exile was better
American Gangster
Drake‚Äôs Comeback Season mixtape. /s
I'm bored of Kanye domination so kala
2007 is obviously Ye and 2008 is obviously Wayne
This is the first year Kanye deserved it with graduation but he already got 2 spots on the list so I‚Äôll say lupe fiasco-the cool
gonna say curtis just to fuck with it
seriously?
It isn‚Äôt close but I have listened to Non Shall Pass more than Graduation.
Souljaboytellum.com-  Soulja Boy Tell 'Em
DJ Khaled - We The Best
Oh me oh me! I just love Kanye! Kanye is the greatest! Kanye! He's so dreamy! Kanye! He raps about how he is born inherently better than everyone else and I want to feel like that, too! It's so relatable! Kanye! Vote Kanye! F√ºhrer Kanye is the greatest! I just wanna snuggle with Kanye!
The cool - lupe fiasco
Lupe making the list is unfortunate
Curtis by 50 cent
Lupe fiasco? Da fuq?
You guys are Kanye dickriders
Sean P - Jesus Price Superstar
Wtf is lube fiasco? I‚Äôm blocking you for that shit choice. You shoulda veto‚Äôd it mf.
2008 better be wayne, 808s isnt even a rap album
Anything but Kanye. Was Garth Brooks rapping that year? I choose his album.
Evidence The Weatherman!!
Not going against the grain on this one, Late Registration my fav from 2007.  Honorable mentions: Dirty Acres, Below The Heavens, None Shall Pass, Underground Kingz.
for 2015 barter 6
Pharoahe Monch - Desire deserves some love
American Gangster - Jay Z
2007: Lupe Fiasco is my favorite rapper, & The Cool is my favorite album from him. But, Graduation monumental on another level. Graduation all day.
Me so happy
Below the Heavens
Lupe Fiasco‚Äôs The Cool
Can we all agree on Carter III for 2008?
The Cool- Lupe Fiasco
Lupe Fiasco‚Äôs- The Cool

Curtis - 50 cent /s
This list gets more terrible each year they get through.
UGK - Underground Kingz, cuz the Pimp wasn't no damn white supremacist.
We know the answer but HONORABLE MENTION: Epiphany (T-pain), The Real Testament (plies) T.I vs T.I.P (T.I)
If 2008 isn‚Äôt tha c√°rter 3 then fuck this sub
I know everyone is chosing Kanye, but 07 was a great Year. The Cool, Getback, Weather Man LP, Ear Drum, Underground Kingz, Desire, Red Gone Wild, and Jesus Price to name a few.
can i vote in advance?

No love for Curtis? Lmao jk
Gotta be graduation tbh
Graduation.  808s needs to win for 2008
I think the cool is also a valid choice, better then graduation imo
Definitely didn‚Äôt see the comments on 2000
Only because Drought 3 doesn‚Äôt count though
50 cent - Curtis amd Kanye's Graduation were both good in 2007.
See you guys in 2010 when MBDTF destroys the competition
Only answer

He's my pick for 04, 05, and 07.  Albeit a reluctant pick, because... nazi.
i thought he was gonna sit on the stick
Good morning...
Would you look at that, all of the words in your comment are in alphabetical order.  I have checked 1,443,252,357 comments, and only 275,088 of them were in alphabetical order.
2008 should be Carter 3
808s ain't even rap
"I LOOOOOOOOVE HITLER"
This
Shame this gets hidden cause the only album these fools remember is Graduation
corny
This won‚Äôt win but I agree with this the most
UGK fuck them other niggas
üíØ ugk had way more bops to me that‚Äôs why i picked it.
Intl players anthem is forever goated
Who the duck
That part. This sub doesn't represent the culture.
i could also go for M.I.A.
Below the heavens is a fucking masterpiece
808s
Fun Fact of the day  Crank That music video is more popular than any of the videos for Graduation üêê
Tf you on
Be soooooo fr
Relax
Shut the fuck up  Bros mad that kanye is a genuinely good artist
![gif](giphy|xT5LMxmFQ37UyhH344|downsized)
What is you talkin about
Uhhh‚Ä¶ yeah?
Or maybe he made the best albums in those years?
Nah your just mad that he made three phenomenal albums, Kanye is an incredible artist
Indeed they are.
The Cool by Lupe dropped that year
Nah the albums are good  Nothing about the list is ‚Äùbad‚Äù
They‚Äôre gonna vote for 808‚Äôs
LOVED the Cool too but Graduation is no skips
And a true upset in 2011 with WTT?
And it‚Äôs not even close
Why did he stop using the bear
Separate art from the artist
He apologized though
A bot can't determine that.
Anybody saying anything other than Carter 3 in 2008 is delusional.
I think you mean You‚Äôll Cowards Don‚Äôt Even Smoke Crack
Facts
I think tha Carter II should have won ‚Äò05
it‚Äôs a great album but it‚Äôs simply not better than graduation
Graduation is better then that album, that‚Äôs why
Lupe maybe shouldn‚Äôt have won 2006 but he should definitely win this year. The Cool is like a top 20 album oat
Ignorant and proud lol
Not all of the videos from the album together though
Oh but F√ºhrer Kanye is the only hip hop artist worth talking about. If I talk about anyone else I might... *gasp*... be Judged. Kanye is SAFE! Is safe to talk about F√ºhrer. He's is amazing. I love Kanye. This is reddit. KANYE! I LOVE KANYE!
He's sooooooooo amazing. He's like always talking about how amazing he is and was born with this gift that makes him more special than anyone else and completely didn't misrepresent the whole tradition of hip hop because F√ºhrer West is born with better traits than everyone. ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è I LOVE KENYE. LIKE OMG I'm a biggest fanboy ever.
talkin about fax
The cool holds a special place in my heart. I love graduation too. I think the cool has better themes, high highs that are on par with graduations highs, and the cool is probably my favorite concept album
"Drunk and hot girls"
I mean Section 80 did come out that year but yeah WTT will still sweep the popular vote
I feel like take care might win
Bro I get y you feel that way about 98 but Outkast with Raekwon, the are the reason the south is on top today
He moved on ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è the bear did make some cameos in MBDTF and KSG

That 21 Jump Street post just dug him into an even bigger hole of stupidity.  Even before coming out as a Nazi, I haven't liked him for years, too crazy and narcissistic
In the night I hear em talk
"Ok I'd like to thank Kanye, and my nigga Deezle for giving me this diesel"
I think 808‚Äôs would be valid
You are going to be VERY dissapointed my friend lol
I was HUGE on Wayne back the early 2000's.  T.I. Paper Trails is the better album in my opinion.  Carter III was great, still.  Call me delusional.
I would put paper trail tbh
Never heard anyone say that but lowkey I might agree
Ok idrc
I get you hate Kanye but it‚Äôs probably worth it to put your time into something else instead of wasting it doing this on Reddit
hope they find a cure for your mental illness üôè
Kanye shifted hiphop, not misrepresent it. Sure he can be braggadocios at times, but he can also be very deep too. Not all his songs are about him talking about how good he is. Also you're painfully unfunny shut the fuck up
What don‚Äôt you like about lupe
That‚Äôs fair, the Cool was an amazing album no doubt about it
I can see KDot getting 3-4 albums on here too. I‚Äôve also been wondering how strong the Drake vote is in here.
Take Care is a solid contender for 11. I was thinking Drake‚Äôs win comes from NWTS. But means a win over Yeezus, Long.Live.ASAP,  and Acid Rap among others.
I feel you, but X had two albums in 98 that pulled NY hip hop away from the abyss of the shiny suit era.
How can a Christian be an antisemite if Jesus was a Jew?
The coldest story ever told
‚ÄúI want to give this award to Wayne for this year. If this was last year, it would be my award, this year it's Wayne's award‚Äù
Not really, I understand this sub is a bunch of fanboys and not lovers of the genre.
I respect that way more than somebody saying 808s, paper trail was lit too, TI had shit on smash in late 08.
People be wasting time.talking about mediocre F√ºhrer West anyway
This coming from someone that idolizes... Kanye... West. Lol.
Omg. You are SO Right. He's so amazing. ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
https://i.redd.it/96buuryx6lsa1.gif
Nwts should win but idk if it will, this sub has a knack for drake hate from what I‚Äôve seen
Somewhere far along this bone she lost her soul
ü§ìüëÜ
Kanye dick eating is strong.  But his first 3 albums were masterpieces in my opinion.  Now if he starts winning for 808s, tlop, then that's an L
Hell yeah.  It's all good music and it's all subjective like that.  I hope you're having a great day!
I just like his music, goodbye have a bad day üòà
Hahaha. I love what you‚Äôre doing here.
I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôve never listened to him and think he‚Äôs some random ass rapper that could‚Äôve been topped easily
It‚Äôs so much better than the others listed above!
To a woman so heartless
Typical ye fanboy.
I actually love 808s but its hardly a rap album and it certainly was not the better album over the carter 3.
I just love his music too! He's so dreamy! Kanye is for lovers not haters. He's the best F√ºhrer West doesn't hate anyone. Don't be mad. Kanye is the answer! There is no reason to question Kanye. Kanye is love. Love is God. Kanye is God! F√ºhrer West is all of us!!!
I mean he couldn‚Äôt even give a reason why he doesn‚Äôt like him lol. Lupe just doesn‚Äôt have the mainstream appeal, it‚Äôs kinda difficult to get into him especially if you‚Äôre not into his style of rap but I think all the rap fans know he‚Äôs great, cause if you listen to a lot of rap you know/learn to appreciate Lupe.
I listened to him and I agree he trash
Not better than tcd, food and liquor, late registration, mmlp (take care I prefer), any 1990-2002 album (I prefer take care to most of these though)
purely on quality Carter 3 wins anytime but 808s is one of the most influencal rap albums of all time, Carter 3 does not have that level of importance even though its an amazing rap album. 808s changed the sound of rap for ever and the influence of that album is prominent in rap music even now, just the amount of artists whose whole style and career are based on the foundation that 808s laid is something that Carter 3 doesn‚Äôt have even if in quality it has the better songs.
You‚Äôre epic. Absolutely agree. Kanye is worshipped here for some damn reason. His attitude and ego are so majorly garbage it overshadows anything he does. He deserves 0 attention.
Lupe in his era was indeed a very accessible rapper with main stream hits for his first few albums. His later stuff is when he‚Äôs purposefully not accessible
Sorry I meant the ones listed in u/underrenderrdbacon ‚Äòs comment above - the others from 2011.  Yeezus, long live asap, acid rap. (Asap is the only one of those I even like lol)
What sound did it change? It influenced drake, but wayne influenced drill and 2010s trap off of what he did with the carter 3 he‚Äôs just as influential.
Drake being the biggest artist from that influence yes, but Travis Scott Kid Cudi, Lil Uzi Vert, Juice, XXX and pretty much all melodic rap / emotrap sounds to date. 808s and Miseducation are the two core albums for melodic rap music. Also that kind of use of autotune and the 808 drum machine was revolutionary for it‚Äôs time. Also Chief Keef, Jeezy and TI were sooo much more important for the early trap and drill sounds respectively. Carter 3 did not have influence, it‚Äôs a great rap album and has amazing quality but it is not influencal just because it‚Äôs legendary. It didn‚Äôt change anything in such a major way that 808s has for 15 years and counting.
He would be making Disney movies
and then he‚Äôd be the president and play Spider-Man in one of the movies and play the voice of Luigi in that new Mario movie man
üòÇ
No.
There's a very possible chance suge knight killed easy E with an injection
Name checks out üíÄ
no wtf?
‚Äùa longer career‚Äù u do know that 2pac & Biggie are dead? atleast they didn‚Äôt drop any bad albums. Consistent catalogue > long career.   Gucci Mane has dropped almost 100 projects and has been in the game for almost 20 years, he is not anywhere even close to the ones like 2Pac or Biggie or Lauryn Hill
Lmao wtf happened to this sub
Lmao nah pac and big never put out a whack project like Em has. Their lives were unfortunately cut short so they never had the chance at a long career and maybe didn‚Äôt even hit their peaks. Em is probably top 10 but I‚Äôm not sure if he‚Äôs in my personal top 5
I agree
Eminem is the Goat for more then just his longevity tho. His commercial peak was unmatched by not just rappers, but Pop Icons in general. Also if y‚Äôall want to ignore his literally impct on Music and dismiss sales and accolades, and go purely off of being a emcee; Shady is objectively a better rapper then PAC and Biggie.  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è people can get mad at that statement but it‚Äôs true. PAC ain‚Äôt a better rhymer or lyricist, and Bigge ain‚Äôt outrapping em. Given thier short careers, they are obviously the biggest rappers of all time, but Em was Number 1 in many eyes by his sophomore album too.
I gotta say the goat gotta be someone like Nas or Hov
Eminem didn‚Äôt really influence the game the same way. Biggie and Pac literally made rap what it is today. And ems my favorite rapper it‚Äôs just legacy wise doesn‚Äôt hold the same weight
King Von>>mid white old corny eminem
Neither Pac nor Biggie made me listen to the sound of puking or farting.
Honestly listen to Gucci more than Em take that for what it is lmao

Sting wasn't.
Drake is appropriately rated.
Yachty saying serious rap is boring is a fat L
I‚Äôve been seeing this Dr Dre take a lot. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I his music, The Chronic changed my life, but he is not some elite wordsmith by any means lmao
Dre didn‚Äôt even write his lyrics. Tf. üòÇü§£ü§£
Drizzy is like the Mike Tyson of rap hes overrated by casual listeners but underrated by hardcore rap fans. He top 10 all time tho thats fs
yachty never hated on rap tho
I disagree I personally bump eazy ice cube and ten way more than Dre, the only time I listen to Dre is when he is an Eminem feature
just because his ass couldnt do it
maybe top 10 right now, definitely not all time tho, otherwise I agree
i wouldnt say top 10 but he is underrated
he did say rap can be corny and started saying conscious and serious rap is boring‚Ä¶bro talking as if he‚Äôs made itüíÄ
It‚Äôs mad corny too
Def all time. The fact that hes the highest selling rapper for like 10 years straight now is enough to put him there
im getting downvoted for saying smth yatchy told and which is disrespecting the genre just because he doesnt make good musicü§£
nah just sales definitely aren‚Äôt enough. so many rappers have skill, catalogue or influence greater than Drake‚Äôs. Just by that metric Eminem would be better than Drake since he has sold even more and Eminem isn‚Äôt top 10 all time either. Catalogue and influence should 100% be looked at before going to sales, ofcourse if you go pop you are gonna sell high whereas older rappers or other non-mainstream rappers who aren‚Äôt as much focused on the sales obviously won‚Äôt sell as much as a pop-rapper. Are Ed Sheeran & Taylor Swift top 10 artists of all time since they have the most sales? No they are not. Just getting pop-rap numbers won‚Äôt earn you a spot amongst the greatest rappers OF ALL TIME. I would consider Drake for a top 10 spot of his generation or maybe top 10 right now but saying ‚Äùall time‚Äù is wild when his influence or catalogue is still nowhere near rappers like Tupac, Nas, Ye etc.
Sales is def enough and when you add Drizzy‚Äôs versatility, consistency and pen game that makes him top 10 all time
eminem is top 10 oat, what are u smokingüíÄand drake is nowhere close to eminem nor doesnt have a better album than eminems sslp-tes run
He is versatile I give you that and not saying that he has above average pen game sometimes, but looking at his projects he 100% does not have the consistency that some of the more established rappers do (again looking at Tupac or Nas or Jay-Z etc.) And his pen game is good for what it is, he is a pop artists, he has admitted so himself and that‚Äôs ok but his pen game or concistency is not even close to what most rappers are. He definetly is like top 50 all time and as I said I would easily put him in top 10 of HIS GENERATION, but if we are looking at all time, so many other artists are above him in both pen game and consistency and even versatility tbf. And as I said if we make sales such an important metric that would mean that Eminem is then a better rapper than Drake and that artists like Ed Sheeran are the best artists of all time in the whole world. Influence, catalogue and pen game should always be looked at before sales as a metric of ‚Äùthe best rapper‚Äù Eminem is not the best rapper of all time just because he has sold the most, neither is Drake a top 10 rapper of all time just of his sales, when tens of rappers have better and more consistant catalogues, a greater influence and a better pengame. Drake is a great rapper and is definetly one of the best out of his generation and the greatest in his own field (pop rap) but looking at the entire genre and ‚Äùall time‚Äù he is not up there especially in the top 10.
Probably??? It‚Äôs safe to say that dudes career is done. But wait, six nine is still getting show money, so maybe there‚Äôs hope for gunna too
Im not a fan of sixnine but you can‚Äôt really compare gunna to sixnine, sixnine has a far larger audience than gunna when you think of Latin America. And the fact that he just released a song with so much media attention on him was actually really smart. Buddy released the song 7 days ago and already racked up 14+ million views on YouTube
Behind this track üêø
Who is he ?
Drake, who came in as an immigrant and dominated or Kanye, who started as a producer that everybody ignored are greater success stories imo. Durk monetized beef and violence. He's basically the Adam 22 of rap.
I'll ask. WHO?
üêê
ü§î
Isnt that Durk lol. What even is his story?
This man is mid
like 100 rappers out there with greater success stories lol
Man what!?
I wouldn‚Äôt say monetized. It‚Äôs jus what he lives
Those are cute stories but   Durk grew up in one of the worst hoods in America, his pops went to prison for 30+ years when he was a lil kid so he grew up without a father figure. He has lost 30+ of his homies to street violence, his own cousin bleed out in his arms and his grandma blames him for the death of his cousin.    Even tho he was putting out fire music in the early 2010s, he was barely getting any recognition at all cause all eyes were on Chief Keef. He signed to Def Jam tho where his music got shelved and it pretty much killed his career cause they didnt know what to do with him. So he had to start over and moved to Atlanta where he made connections and grinded his way to the top. It took him 10 years to finally become an established mainstream rapper when he secured a song with Drake. And even tho he‚Äôs tasting success, he still facing hardships when he lost his brother DThang and King Von in 2020 & 2021 for example.  And btw Durk didnt ‚Äùmonetize‚Äù on beef, there was no beef in rap to monetize on. He started the beef with his song L‚Äôs Anthem.
‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏èKanye is so dreamy I just wanna cuddle ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è Kanye  Kanye Kanye Kanye I love Kanye he's so amazing I love Kanye oh my god have you heard Kanye I love Kanye he's so amazing Kanye.
immigrant?? HAHAHA, that sounds like he's from some distant country, not fucking Canda haha  Kanye came in a producer, as an art student from successful art parents,  which allowed him to gain TONS of connections in the music industry and make his successful debut as a rapper haha.   Durk came from the dirt, poor as shit, in a violent environment. I think this post is ridiculous,   but to act like Durk doesn't haven impressive come up or that Drake and Kanye had it harder because one is Canadian and the other is a successful producer.. is laughable.   But when you do compare the trajectory and how fr above they are from Durk.. it is still impressive.   but the hate on durk is stupid
I dont expect an Eminem fanboy to know anyone outside of Logic, Joyner and Eminem
comes from a very violent side of chicago. Gangs, street, dead friends etc, from a young age.   Started making music and really blew up initially from Chief Keef's wave which popularized drill,   kinda fell off after the initial wave, and has managed to have a resurgence in his career as of late, a 2nd wave, while being consistent and constantly improving his craft imo.   I'm not gonna ride his D like op and say he has the greatest success story, but that's his story if you were interested.
Name them
I'm not even joking, for a million ¬£ I couldn't tell you the name of this person.
The content in his music is beef and violence, he makes money off his music, therefore he montetizes from beef and violence.
Dude wrote all the lil durk loreü§£ ultimate meat rider
Chief Keef>>
Relax Chance
Lmao the fact that you don't know what an immigrant is and also being loud about it is really representative of the state of the US. Very sad.
Ah ok. Thanks! I was gonna mention a diff rappers success story but decided not to
Jay-Z  Kendrick Lamar  Ye  Tupac  Biggie  Nas  50 Cent  Dr Dre  Eminem  Method Man  Ghostface Killah  RZA  Andre 3000  Big Boi  Lauryn Hill  Future  Eazy-E  Talib Kweli  Lil Yachty  Coolio  Joey Badass  Freddie Gibbs  Tyler The Creator  Mac Miller  Jadakiss  Lil Wayne  Ice Cube  Snoop Dogg  J Cole  21 Savage  Anderson. Paak  ASAP Rocky  Travis Scott  DMX  Childish Gambino  Kid Cudi  Chance The Rapper  Nate Dogg  Cyhi the prince  Rick Ross  Pusha T  Meek Mill  Royce da 5‚Äô9‚Äù  Rakim  Asap Ferg  Raekwon  Mos Def  Young Thug  Ja rule  Scarface  not 100 cause I really cant bother enough but should be enough to make my point clear. Also in order to have ‚Äùthe greatest success story of all time‚Äù you gotta have the ‚Äùgreat success‚Äù part too
You on the wrong sub bro
He makes money from rapping about what he is living, Whats wrong about that?  ‚ÄùDrake monetizes romance‚Äù  ‚ÄùJuice Wrld monetizes depression‚Äù  Retarded argument lol
You‚Äôre right can‚Äôt even debate that,Atleast he practice what he preach unlike everybody else I guess lol.
Its like he's paid to make it sound more butt-hurt
Coming with the facts is meat riding now I guess üòå
I'm sorry if I can't contain my love for F√ºhrer West! It's so easy to talk about how much I love him and have people affirm my taste! I don't have to have ANY original thoughts or ideas. I can just like KANYE and people will love me. And it's amazing because his whole success is built on that premise. F√ºhrer West is King of kings and lord or lords!
I come from a family of immigrants, like my parents.   I know the struggles they faced first hand.   But its not AT ALL the same or even much of a relevant challenge in the story of already successful actor on a popular teenage nickalodean show,   going and traveling ALL THE WAY TO THE us lmfao, with all the struggles of the different culture shock between America and Canada LMFAO  Being able to pivot from this tv show actor into the image of a rapper, who DOES rap about violence and drugs, despite not living any of these type of lifestyles, and having the longevity at the peak of rap that he does.. incredible unironically impressive.   But to act like he faced some sort of difficulty as an immigrant because he is from *Canada,* is one of the most ridiculous things I've heard,   and its more ridiculous to compare it to the struggles of really being poor af in Southside Chicago and making it from there imo.
Buddy just named any rapper that came to mind üòÇ
Comparing romance and murder is why this sub is trash
This is such a sheep way of thinking. Imagine if people said the same about R. Kelly. "Well at least he actually rapes the girls instead of just talking about it". Sad
im¬∑mi¬∑grant /Ààim…ô…°r…ônt/ noun a person who comes to live permanently in a foreign country.  First thing that comes up on Google.
all of which have had a greater success and a greater success story than Durk, that comment being your comeback tells me enough
What does Lil Durk rapping about murder have to do with him having a worse success story than Drake and Kanye? If anything Drake and Kanye‚Äôs content in their rap reaches a far wider audience than rapping about murder does üòÇ
Didn‚Äôt say it was right and comparing rape to gang beef was jus stupid üòÇ
What is really sad is ppl rapping about shit they don‚Äôt do and kids actually doing it cus they‚Äôre favorite rappers talks about it
i'm aware buddy. you gotta think
Lil Bro said Chance The Rapper üòÇ
I did and he had a better story and greater success than Durk lol, you still haven‚Äôt found a comeback to save yourself so you result to making jokes in order to change the subject since your argument was proven wrong  I could‚Äôve ended the list at Jay-Z and you would‚Äôve already been wrong
Nah, OP is D riding, and you're hating lmfao.
Goats. Drake been the biggest rapper for over a decade, his run is unprecedented. Regardless of the hate, nicki is top 10 competing with men.
NF makes the most NF-sounding song ever.
I don‚Äôt think much about it. Just like every other NF song
I don‚Äôt listen to NF so stop asking me
On the flip side, if he sounded like another artist, he would get criticised for trying to be someone else lmao
W
eak
I like his music, don‚Äôt go out of my way to listen to it much tbh. Love that food show he did with his boys
He seems like a cool dude. He has worked his ass off to lose a ton of weight as well. He gets a pass in my book.
Love Action.  First heard him featured on a Domo Genesis song and was like "Who the hell is this?!".  He definitely is not for everyone but his beats selection is incredible, his 80s and 90s pop culture references are awesome and he seems like a genuinely good dude.
Went crazy on Red Dot Music w Mac
Fucking love him. I am fully convinced he‚Äôs my brother from another mother. Maybe the first rapper I‚Äôd pick to just chill with, smoke a blunt, go get some good food.  Love his music, his personality, and his shows.
He's in my rotation for sure. His latest projects have been some of my favorite modern rap projects. Great production as well, with real instruments and samples. And I like the fact that he's a bit under the radar. The only time I listen to him is when I want to. His music is not shoved down my throat (no homo/homophobia) like a lot of modern rappers (mainstream or not).
Fuck that‚Äôs Delicious is a great show.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs me‚Äù
He‚Äôs easily one of the rappers in the world.
I fucks with bam bam
Mr wonderful is a banger of an album, also fuck that‚Äôs delicious is a great watch while stoned. He seems to be really down to earth and a good dude
Action is that dude. He has fun with his music and Fuck That‚Äôs Delicious is the best food show.
Love action love his vibe seems like a genuinely good dude. Unpopular opinion on his music is his earliest shit was his best work. I don‚Äôt think anything later he did ever came close to tracks like the come up or imported goods. His rap style on his earliest stuff was far superior imo.
Bronsolini!! First heard Action on an Asher Roth mixtape, and like everyone else, thought it was Ghostface at first. Dr. Lector, Rare Chandeliers, Mr. Wonderful, the Blue Chips series, all fucking bangers.
Dr. Lecter will always be one of my favorite tapes. More than music he seems like a guy who genuinely likes to make people smile/make people happy. I used to berate my homies to listen to him back in 2012 lol
White Ghostface Killah, but it's not a knock. He's dope but damn does he sound just like him sometimes.
This dude can rap his fucking ass off
Personally not a fan of his latest stuff, but he isn't a trash rapper.
Second favorite rapper right now
FUCK that‚Äôs Delicious is one of my favorite shows
Love Bronson. Blue Chips is my favorite project of his.
Huge fan across the board. Too many reasons to name why he is one of my favorites. People‚Äôs champ 100%
["Be For Real" by Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes plays in background]
He got his own sound , always got the funny rhymes creative metaphors that creates imagery for the listener ‚Ä¶. He also rhymes words too that‚Äôs a plus with a post 2010 rapper ‚Ä¶..
Not a massive fan but i respect him so much
Havent listened to him in quite a while..but damn hes lost so much.. lookin better than ever imo
I don‚Äôt know if wants to or just does sound like ghostface. It‚Äôs a bit off putting but the food show is good.
Siraz is the shit
I like him but I feel full after listening to him.
He‚Äôs really solid!
Fuckin love action. Most people can‚Äôt handle him but he‚Äôs a monster.
Got put on to "Dmtri" not to long ago, and haven't stop listening to it since. Love that song. But it's worth noting I been a fan of Bronson since "Strictly 4 my jeep." F*** that's delicious just made him that much more relatable.
He's dope
Actually a fan here
The CookingSoul remixes are Goated for life
He‚Äôs my goat. A lot of my rapping style is heavily influenced on him. He can do no wrong in my book
He looks like somebody I‚Äôd hang with.
Some of his shit is classics I just picked up his mr wonderful album yesterday. And fuck that‚Äôs delicious is a classic too. Love his energy.
Fuck that‚Äôs delicious
Baklava?  Guys dope.  Definitely recommend seeing him live if you ever get a chance, solid live performer
That crew neck is üî•
100%, althoughhhh, I'll take Ghostface over him any day
2nd best white rapper after Mac Miller (RIPüôèüèæ)
He feels pretty original all though you can definitely tell he‚Äôs a New York rapper
He's good generally, but loses points for trying to diss ghost
I didn't mind him but then I heard the line about sucking a baby's dick and decided that I'm good.
GOAT white rapper
idk if probably pay attention to him if ghostface killah didn't already exist
That Ghostface video really made Bronson retire from rap. After that the only time I heard about him was about his cooking show or pro wrestling LMAOO
WuTang clan ain't nothing to fuck with
üöÆ
Dorky try hard GFK wanna be
Bro is posed up like he on r/malefashionadvice
He is dope
Solid.
Underrated. He has made dope music . Better lyricist then rocky and big Krit in my opinion .
Multitalented bam
Incredible rapper with a unique style and vocabulary. Has some classic mixtapes, cooking shoes and now shoes.
The man raps about food and sounds like ghost.  Makes him a g in my book
Action Bronson is so underrated. He‚Äôs a beast
heard him first on baby blue with chance and fell in love with his music hes underrated for sure
Dude‚Äôs a beast! If he ain‚Äôt bench pressing a feind, he‚Äôs get head from a whore as he eats a bowl of pasta. Flushing Whaddup!? He‚Äôs as rawest since NecrO, gotta dope ass flow, fuck, that‚Äôs delicious, and he‚Äôs white. Mr backava always putting in work. These kids have no idea what what real hip hop is. To spit bars. Being part of a cypher. Getting to know the culture. Weather it‚Äôs breaking, scratching, off the dome, blackbooks, shell tops, b-boys or fright lines. I‚Äôm truly blessed to be able to listen first hand to the golden years of hip hop. IYKYNK, TF happened backpack rap? Just don‚Äôt to AB that he sounds like Ghost. Just let hip hop come from NY. It shoulda never left.
Bars for days.  Especially over Alchemists beats
I like him! Let‚Äôs keep it üíØ and acknowledge that he kinda bit Ghostface‚Äôs style a little bit initially (harder when he started coming up but settled into a more laid back version of himself eventually).  I think he should have kept it real when pressed about it rather than take a shot at the gawd on that interview, but I‚Äôm glad the OGs took the apology and let him carry on üôèüèª
Bronzelino! Dudes a beast, his bars aren‚Äôt crazy but his whole aesthetic and personality is elite! He is a funny NYer and a hell of a good Chef.
Fucking stinks
I played basketball w/ 20 different guy who look like him, ofc all at the Y
his song latin grammys is just good. idk what is it is , its fucking good
So good, so much of his music is so slept on, lamb over rice needs more love
I‚Äôm only human after all don‚Äôt put the blame on me
I like Ghostface-face.
P4p best food bars in the game
Seems like a pretty cool down to earth dude from his TV show and interviews. Not a big fan of his music tbh though. It‚Äôs mediocre at best.
Not always a fan of his lyrical skill being lazy with his rhymes sometimes, I can use 1 song as example, sub-zero, which also has a great music video
Hard to accept his üá¶üá± heritage  Meh
My favorite thing he ever did was when they did the ancient aliens smoke seshes
no one noticed when he said the n word in that one song but idk
Dr Lectre, The Program, Blue Chips 1 and 2. He was real nice
Love ‚Äòem
You might appreciate [this](https://techhopuk.wordpress.com/2017/09/20/blue-chips-7000/) piece I wrote on Mr. Baklava
He's the hawmie
Eh he‚Äôs whatever: mid rapper
Well-read, well-traveled, soulful, diverse, creative, prolific. I like em!
Love his show F*ck that‚Äôs delicious. Saw him live on the NBA leather tour, amazing performance. His verses are always entertaining.
Love this dude
Solid!
One of my favourite artists forsure. He‚Äôs different, I respect his pen üíØ how he raps food with funny hood shit always stood out for me. You can tell he really trying to spit but have fun with this rap shit at the same time.
Saw him with boldy James and earl. Love all three of them but listen to boldy and earl way more. Action stole that show for sure. He‚Äôs valid
He‚Äôs a good food tour guide.
Style jacker. I mean it would be one thing if he just sounded like Ghost but dude legit bit his flow too.
Seems like a cool guy to hang with and get fucked up.
Raw
I still watch his cooking(eating) show
Personally love his voice and style, ‚Äúbeen a minute but your boy back innit, time to enjoy my chicken!‚Äù
Saab Stories and Blue Chips 2 some of my all time most played tapes. Even got to see him perform live in Hawaii. Def fw AB
Only listened to his collabs with alchemist but he aight
He‚Äôs talented.  Spits bars. Transitions to TV well.  You can‚Äôt hate on the man
bar for bar ‚Äúsubzero‚Äù might be the greatest rap song of all time lmao
Gem
love him, he‚Äôs consistently in rotation for me
One of the goats
 Who
He‚Äôs badass. Saw him years ago when i snuck into campflawgnaw
Used to be dope but was never the same after the ghost face debacle.
Stole ghostface‚Äôs flow
Queens get the money
Early Bronson was dope... he had a good run.
opportunity be knockin‚Äô
He's a solid spitter üî•
Absolutely love his work.
Anyone who works with alchemist is someone I will listen to. I had lamb over rice in rotation for quite a while. Bronson is a very entertaining rapper.
Great guy, never meddum
Blue chips 2 is goated
I CRIED WHEN TONY KILLED PUSSY
Fuck that's delicious! Great show!
Bruh, we are literally in the same boat
I saw him in Portland Maine, and it was awful, even tho his music is great, he was also a lot heavier when I saw him.
If you‚Äôve seen interviews of him he‚Äôs a total douchebag
Yeah he has a great ear for beats
Fuck that's a delicious take
elimination chamber?
He played that in DC last year and gave Mac a shoutout ‚ÄúRIP my brother‚Äù and pointed at the heavens, loved it
groupie bitches wild enough to suck a baby‚Äôs dick üò≥
His character in king of states island is hilarious too
He‚Äôd insist on cooking probably
Agreed
Completely agree. He's been on a run the last few years even though its a little more lowkey. Alchemist the goat for lamb over rice.
Crocodillo Turbo was awesome. Probably my favorite release of his.
Wait he's gay?
Yessr u ain‚Äôt lying. At the moment definitely
Big if true
Bronsolini
Imported goods is such a good song üî•
Not really an unpopular opinion, but I will say that Only for Dolphins has the most depth. Might not have the most quotables or intense energy but easily the best production. Rare Chandeliers is a close second
Sounds too much like Ghost for me but his show is hilarious and he seems like a good guy.
Obviously you haven't seen his ass
his regular speaking voice is in line with his voice when he raps. I certainly don't think it's intentional, they both just share that same NY rasp.
He was one of the only performers at RL Miami without backing vocals, AND he was doing that shit at his heaviest too. Good live rap is hard to easily come by when everyone else is just on stage dancing to their studio cut these days.
Wait wtfüòÇnever heard anything about that
Retire? He literally still puts out music and tours.
Not accurate at all, not to mention they squashed the beef
Do you remember the name of the song? Never heard about that.
Action Bronson‚Ä¶
Also saw him in Portland Maine, you‚Äôre lost. Dude put on a crazy good show. What does him being heavier have to do with him performing?
Really?
He‚Äôs hilarious. He‚Äôs being funny
Definitely comes off as a pompous ass that thinks he's hot shit but he's got some good songs
You mean the alchemist
Yeah, that whole mixtape was insane
That one line alone keeps that song outta my regular playlists lmao
Only questionable line in the song, and it‚Äôs part of the hook lol
I feel like he ruined the song with that line ugh
Yeah, it seems like after his Ghostface controversy, he's been staying to himself. But he still works with GOAT producers and rappers, so I'm with it
Gay af but got bars for days
Ill give those a more thorough listen.   I guess the unpopular bit depends on the crowd. I don‚Äôt think action really got any kind of legitimate following until Dr Lecter which even when it came out I thought was really behind some of the stuff on bon appetite bitch and well done. I remember commenting on YouTube when Mr wonderful came out saying every album action has put out has been worse lyrically and getting called a moron like 20 times lol.
Red dot music with Mac Miller  Must be the drugs that got us thinking crazy shit Groupie bitches wild enough to suck a baby's dick
Meant in a joking manner with the retire stuff. Literally never hear anything about his music and whenever he pops up on my tl, it‚Äôs always about a tv show or pro wrestling
Growin up. On bon appetite.
Who
His other stuff with Harry Fraud, Party Supplies and others are better imo
Mr Wonderful has a lot of forgettable songs for sure, but Terry and Easy Rider are top ten Action tracks
Damn I never caught that
DS2,Rodeo and Luv is Rage 2 are my top 3 trap album but Rodeo is the best one imo
my top 3 here would be I am > i was, ds2 and rodeo
DS2 easily
DS2.  End of discussion.
Trap? DS2 then Culture
Rodeo
Thug Motivation 101 and it‚Äôs not even close
DS2 and it‚Äôs really not even close (except for Barter 6)
Astroworld
Flockaveli
DS2
 Rodeo or Die Lit
Rodeo
DS2, every song was a banger
DS2  not even an argument
You don‚Äôt know trap
barter 6, DS2 and die lit
i think rodeo, die lit, and culture cover all the bases
DS2
Ds2 it‚Äôs a no brainer so many classics then I‚Äôd put barter 6 2nd but that just me
Rodeo, end of discussion
None of them wtf
how is without warning not here in the meantime theres astroworld
None
None of these. The correct answer is Thug Motivation 101 by Jeezy.
Tf?   No dolph, no Gucci? Trash.  Some of these albums ain‚Äôt even trap at that ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Most of these aren‚Äôt even trap‚Ä¶
Totally not biased but I got rodeo
Die Lit, no question
Culture and DS2.. don‚Äôt even think about the others
ds2  most of these not even trap albumsüíÄ
DS2
None of these. Almighty So - Chief Keef
None of the above   No TM101, Trap House, or Flockaveli?
Only REAL trap album is DS2‚Ä¶ others aren‚Äôt even trap üòí
Rodeo or I am I was
astroworld and trap in the same sentence is hilarious
DS2 and Flockavelli, get rodeo tf outta there‚Ä¶ that ain‚Äôt trap.
Uh none of these lol
That whole middle row is questionable lol
What is trap
Some ppl gon be talking about ‚Äùwhere is Jeezy, T.I & Gucci?‚Äù just cause they were influential dont mean their music is the best. I wouldnt replace any album on here with their best album. Trap def peaked in 2015-2019
Savage mode 2
B6. Rodeo. DS2 or 21
How u put i am i was instead of savage mode is incredible
Super Slimey with Thug and Future should be here.  Two absolute legends
Middle row and Middle column are the best ones is all I have to say
Rodeo
Gotta say ‚ÄòLuv is Rage 2 ‚Äò has the most consistency out of them all
Die lit
Either DS2 Or Rodeo imo
Rodeo
It‚Äôs rodeo, but how did monster, whole lotta red, or Jeffrey not get put here
Rodeo
Rodeo
Without warning??
Rodeo
Tm101
can't choose between LIR2, astroworld and die lit. that's my top 3 for sure
Ds2
Rodeo> DS2> Barter 6
Barter 6
Barter 6 and DS2
Rodeo and it‚Äôs not close
A$AP FERG - Trap Lord
monster.
DS2 and it‚Äôs not even close
No Thug Motivation 101, Trap Muzik, Roderick Davis vs The State, Jeffery, Pluto etc. Your missing alot here.
DS2 for sure it was SENSATIONAL. üëçüèøüî•  ![gif](giphy|emN0LqTozqRGNwVPAg|downsized)
Barter 6
Astroworld
Savage Mode 2
rodeo
Rodeo easy
Astroworld of this. But, i miss, testing by rocky
Barter 6 by a mile.
Travis Scott and uzi don‚Äôt make trap music
I dont think all of these are trap but of whats here my ranking goes   1. I am>i was  2. DS2  3. Rodeo  4. Die lit  5. Culture  6. Luv is rage 2  7. Astro world  8. Drip harder  9. Barter 6 (jeffery better)
None it‚Äôs tpab
Rodeo is better
This kid doesn‚Äôt know what trap is. If he did he‚Äôd know it‚Äôs Snows debut and it‚Äôs truly not close
Rodeo
Breathtaking album fr
way better than any of this emo/mumble rap crap up there
This is the ‚Äúhip‚Äù take‚Ä¶ we get that it influenced these artists, but I‚Äôd argue that it‚Äôs almost an entirely different genre than what‚Äôs being discussed in this thread.
Bro for real, people forget how fucking hard that shit goes
Right they really slow
![gif](giphy|kaZtgEF9U4rRNRRSua)
Travis Scott dickriders don‚Äôt want to hear this
Lol Rodeo clears
bad take
find better bait
Yeah‚Ä¶ you definitely don‚Äôt know trap.
Get better music taste
I like alot of these albums, but being influential is a factor in good music, the best pieces of art no matter the medium influence others to make art, whether it be Sargent peppers lonely hearts club band, the college dropout, pet sounds, the rise and fall of ziggy stardust, ready to die, or even some of the albums that are on the image, have all inspired others to make good music, influence is a factor
Alright lil bro
wat
Barter 6 is better than Rodeo in every way
Who in the post is emo apart from uzi
They can come get me
One of my favorite albums ever but it barely counts as trap, all of the best songs are slow and allot of the best songs don‚Äôt use that much 808s
yeah...dude, uh, the mixtape was literally called Trap or Die...gtfo with this weak ass mumble rap shit
oh, so , there IS someone up there that whines like a bitch on a drum machine i.e. Lil Uzi Vert...okay, what was your point again? didnt say they were all emo influenced but whatevr

He‚Äôs the best, man!
Cole (Kendrick‚Äôs equal) and Denzel (the master of the beat drop)
Cole and zel fs
Jid and Zel.
First off, I know I goofed with saying Cole is from South Carolina. I meant to fix before this post‚Äîhe‚Äôs from NC.
As for the bracket, I go with JID (unpopular opinion maybe).
Also with the bracket, it‚Äôs super tough for me but Denzel wins out over Zay.
all i know is that tyler will make it to the final round
Those are great descriptors.
I did this with a few of my high school students who are into the same artists, and several of them ended with Tyler either in the finals or winning
Fucking Problems, it had Drake Kendrick 2 Chainz and Rocky,
Sick mode I found socially more interesting, paints a narrative while Fuckin Problems is more of just a mini posse cut with great verses.
Fuckin Problems
F***in problems.
Sicko Mode objectively, charted higher.
Sicko Mode and it aint even close
One dude impregnated Rihanna.   The other dude; his copycat, killed kids and adults. (Certified murderer) ü§îü§´üí≠
They both equally good
Sicko Mode
Problems if we‚Äôre talking better song overall   Sicko mode is only good for that switch up but it‚Äôs way better for the club
U.O.E.N.O remix‚Ä¶.
He didn't say bigger hit
Travis still better
Travis music is nothing like Rocky‚Äôs and is much more successful. Trav was with Rihanna before Rocky was too ü§ß.

Most people are in love w Eminem so this is honestly refreshing
Nah it‚Äôs just an impression
This post is a discussion about which album we consider the GOAT gangsta album
?? I don't think anyone in the comments said his album. Don't get me wrong, I can't stand his music really. I mean there's like 3 songs that I wouldn't change if they came on,but I also wouldn't search for any of them either.
üíØüíØThey aint know bout yb over here
Every post with you is choking on king vons dick.  I've seen you fight over T.roy being a pedo but dick riding his closest homeboy who would hurt you over dissing his best friend.    The original gangsta rap albums are straight out of compton and all eyes on me. Clown.
Fuck wit me and get crossed later, the futures in my eyes
Thought the same thing.

Fuck a beat I was tryna beat a case
Most people that don‚Äôt understand why this is are usually pretty young. If you grew up in his era you‚Äôd understand.
Then why tf is that goof even mentioned?
Yeah, i know. Its not here, its in the totality of the sub. But i agree with you tho
Fax tha shi legendary
I‚Äôve mentioned it to people from the era and they acknowledge his greatness, talk about how he was played in the clubs, but never someone you rush to throw on really
Cause its a discussion about GOAT gangsta album
LOOOOL VONS BEST FRIEND WAS A PEDO ACCORDING TO YOU. clown.
Not a goat. He's a Folk.
Kendrick is better than travis btw.
100% he knew who his boy was fucking, you clown. Keep dick riding von. You look sus to the entirety of reddit.    You're so in love with von you made a collage of all his mugshots. You're worst than T.roy, you stalking a dead dude.
What's really sad is you're so invested in 2 dead dudes lives you legit think you're self righteous.   You're a clown, T.roy and von talked all the time, goofy, it wasn't like they only spoke on the streets, T.roy was putting in work to put money on vons books, this is a known fact.    Infact it's also a known fact that people who do nothing but accuse others of being pedophiles all the time (like you) is 100% themselves a child predator.   You're a goof ball and that's why no one likes what you say.
Them Buffalo boys. Benny, Conway   Some ogs
Griselda, Danny Brown, Coast Contra, Jae Skeese, New Logic
38 spesh and Eto
Shit
Some person said something about some rappers and then other people who liked different rappers said different things
That person said facts as if Drake isn't also white
It‚Äôs stupid, Eminem is famous because he put in the work and has actual well crafted lyrics and Drake most definitely isn‚Äôt better then Eminem in any aspect. Mf‚Äôs will do anything to take down his legacy üíÄ
It's a bad take.. Mostly because talent don't lie... There's like 3 white rappers. So when he says "all those half decent white rappers" makes it sound like there's a lot. There isn't. The other part is... Do people bump Em at the club  or at a party... That's not the music he made. His shit was comical or personal... So it was up to people to like it or not. I think most did and even if they didn't really fuck with it, they still recognized the skill.
Parties, no! Do i hear any of my favorites from the 90's/2000's played at a lot of parties....no!   Do i hear Eminem at the boxing gym....like twice a workout, do I hear Drake at the gym....no I can't say i do...  What does this all mean? FUck all because it's based off generalized location and age range of the people you are around + type of music required for activity. Seems to be the infinity stone of argument these days but it's baseless. Still hear a lot of Biggie at parties, but not a lot of Tupac or Nas.....
My mans DESTROYS Drake, no cap.
Drake does not have an album anywhere near close to Eminem‚Äôs 3 classic album run:  - Slim Shady LP - Marshall Mathers LP - Eminem Show
Eminem is not a rapper you listen to when you're trying to party. He didn't specialize in making club hits or strip club music.  You listen to Eminem for wordplay and lyrics, similar to a Nas, Talib Kweli etc. They tell stories and their music gives you a different thought perspective and emotions.  He came up as a battle rapper and made a ton of great records that people relate to and if you don't respect it dont listen. But to argue Drake is a better rapper is a weird take.
Drake fuckin sucks
The only reason why I dont listen to Em at parties is because my friends don't like him. But I listen to him all the time in the car. Him, Drake and Game are constantly in my top 3 most listen to artists on Spotify
The best verse on Drakes best track was Eminem. That's all you need to know.
Smack That was probably the first eminem club party song he made to be played in clubs and parties
I heard *Without Me* on a fair ride that spins you at a inverted slanted angle. I can tell you that the song fit well with the crazy physics of the ride
This sub in a comment.
Drake is black, he is perceived as a black man in society no matter if he is ‚Äòmixed‚Äô
As if drake isnt also black
Take care, nothing was the same, if you're reading this it's too late album run >
nah he one of us
His mother is white. He is as much black as he is white regardless of what he's perceived as so he would absolutely be in the white rapper cstegory.
You are forgetting about American societyüíÄ yea he is mixed, but he is treated and seen as a black man, he doesn‚Äôt get any of the ‚Äòwhite privilege‚Äô just because he is mixed
Drake is Canadian, has always been considered half white, and yes he does benefit from white privilege. Let's bfr now. If Drake was full black, you think he'd be as popular as he is? Ask any young white person who their fave rapper is and chances are it's Drake. Eminem didn't benefit from that privilege. He was too intense/hardcore for most but Drake making tame music opened up the door for white ppl to be comfortable and open about listening to rap music. He's only half black so he's the safe option. Travis Scott is another that benefits from white privilege and is a "safe" option. As long as he's with that Kardashianner, he'll reap all the benefits of having that type of fanbase.
Don‚Äôt even pull that card lmao, most of the rap game is just as famous and is black. Do.not.even. Kanye west? Jay Z? Andre3000? Ice cube? Rakim? Like why don‚Äôt you be fr for a damn second, nobody is saying drake is better then Eminem ( don‚Äôt even know how they can be compared) but don‚Äôt say for a second that just cause he‚Äôs mixed, he‚Äôs popular
Nothing but facts üíØ besides Travis you got lil yachty that did the same too most rappers benefit from white privilege today it‚Äôs how they have sells and stay on time I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs blacks that love eminem based on his skills and signing 50 etc I do too. but as far as Travis, lil yachty and them a fully color person is not really fw them I have never seen it for myself.
Do you know any young white girls that were listening to Kanye (pre-Kardashian), Jayz, Andre, Ice Cube and Rakim? You're completely missing the point. Rap was mostly a "black thing". Don't act dumb like you don't know rap was called black ppl music. Drake as a half white man, made it so that these same girls had an "in" to the culture. You think Rakim was about to give them that in? ü§£ü§°

This really should win
Always thought this was such an underrated album.
I wish that they put I'll Hurt You on it.
While I have you all here, I'd like to remind everyone that keys open doors, keys open doors, keys open doors, keys open doors
Please
Fingers crossed

W, hopefully this makes it
Yeah no contest imo
Certified classic
This is my favorite T.I. album.
His personal life aside, this album was it in 2006.
I loved this
Man ‚Äútell me when to go‚Äù had the whole Bay Area rally under one banner with that one.
Only right answer
Wayne isn't going to get it till the carter 3.  Although the carter 2 is my favorite lil wayne album the carter 3 is undisputed.
Donuts by J Dilla honestly beats it tho, the influence that album had..
the disrespect the south gets on Reddit is disgusting
This the one
I never understood how a former prison guard got to make it as a serious rap artist.
Do yourself a favour and look up stuntin like my daddy suicideyear remix
Cash money still a company and -
Such a sleeper
A underrated ‚Äúrevenge‚Äù album imo.
This was my thought when I was pencilling in my picks.
no kanye, em, or doom = meh   üíÄ
Graduation, Carter 3, MBDTF, NWTS, 4YEO
I wonder (even though 808s isnt really a rap album)
I hope my mans wins for 2009.
T.I might get 2008... But there's a lot of bias on these threads
This is my favorite of the year but I knew it wouldn't win
Yes!!!
Just my opinion here but while I think madvillainy is truly amazing. I listen to TCD more and have more of its tracks in my rotation. I‚Äôm guessing most of the people here also felt the same way
Fr üò§
Because generic list is generic
That came out in 2006? I have to change my vote...
Igor, not CMIYGL
Basic
Sorry I couldn‚Äôt decide lol
kanye is going to sweep this poll until at least 2010
Nah nah nah that don‚Äôt kill me, can only make me STRONGER
But it would offend F√ºhrer West.
Sounding like Chinese new year
Food and liquor isn‚Äôt valid?
Das crazy‚Ä¶ C2 >>> C3 and it ain‚Äôt even close
Never listened to it but either way this isn‚Äôt a competition, this is r/rap‚Äôs decision on what their favorite album is, not how influential or good it is
I mean its reddit, what can we really expect. They either some fantano type of rap fans that weren‚Äôt around during those eras, or they think that anything not lyrical myrical/boom bap is trash.
Mannnn!!!! At least once a week I say this.
They beat out DMX in 98 tho
As always
Plenty that I liked nothing that really stuck with me. Lots of things I read here I liked the same. I‚Äôm leaning toward KING though. I could go with Clipse, Lupe, or Roots too.
YES FINALLY SOMEONE THAT AGREES 4YEO IS A FUCKING MASTERPIECE
Why not, lets try lol
Because TCD is better
Nah. 2009 gotta be MOTM 1
2010 was kanye'a best album lmao
"You can be my black Kate Moss tonight"  In retrospect it's easy to see how from Yitlers twisted perspective white women are the pinnacle of beauty, and the best thing a black woman could hope for is to be the black version of a beautiful white woman. Personally I could never see myself putting somebody like that on a pedestal, but I guess you guys have chose your hero ü§∑. I'll stick with Pimp C.
Can I get a wamp wamp?
‚ÄúThe only right answer is my answer‚Äù
I don't disagree but C3 was the album of it's years.
Title track really is one of the deepest, hell its one of best rap songs of all time. I remember people hating when it dropped, but I see more ppl, like people usually do, coming around and saying that its a dope album.
You got my upvote, let's push this album to the top, we need an upset!
Kanye didnt release in 2009, but 2008 is not gonna be 808s, carter III will win that one easily
That‚Äôs fair.
‚ò†Ô∏è üíÄ ‚ò†Ô∏è
Carti look like he having a stroke üíÄ.
Who's getting the best head?
Dre Dr. - The Chronic
Personally- Check Your Head, Bizarre Ride II or Don‚Äôt Sweat the Technique.  Realistically, it‚Äôs gotta be The Chronic.
Spice 1 - Spice 1
Chronic
Illmatic by Nas
Isn‚Äôt someone already doing this?
Don‚Äôt Sweat the Technique  Whut?! Thee Album never gets any love though
Wrong year buddy
Whoops

I've seen way more appreciation for asian culture in hip-hop than hate. Wu-Tan Clan might be the biggest one.
Hello, fellow Asian here. I have never felt Asian hate from the rap/hip hop community.
I've seen more antisemitism in hip-hop than I've seen anti-asian bigotry. OP seems like a Fox News NPC.
As an Asian, shut the fuck up.
This goofball trying to divide people.  Not working.  Taking this time to big up a rapper I love, Asian dude from NYC called Bohan Phoenix.
Literally the most culturally diverse genre of music ever. Get out of here with your woke shit. Stirring the pot and starting shit when there needs to be unity. Black, white, brown, Hispanic, Asian, native, Indian. It's us against them. Not us against us.
https://i.redd.it/y2a50pvquksa1.gif
Sounds like you are still in the denial phase.   Think of all the rappers who said their eyes went Asian when smoking.   Think of childish gambino Asian fetish and insulting Asian men  Think of jay z on regrets saying "this buyer had eyes like a Korean"
Have you ever listened to Black Korea by Ice Cube?
I'm not Asian and if you really think that then you don't know rap sorry
I'm actually more the kind of people that fox news hates
The truth will set you free.    But first it'll piss you off
lmao
You denying racism is dividing people bro
You said woke unironically üòÇüòÇ
....oh you're serious lmao so hip-hop never made fun of Africans, Mexicans, France, Canada, Jews, Mulsims, Christians, Gays, Women, fat people, short people, etc, they just single Asians out huh. It's hilarious to see people who want to jump on the victim bandwagon just to have attention. Really tells me how fulfilling your lives are. Hip-hop jokes about everything since the 80s. There are more than 15 other genres you can listen to if you want. Nobody forces you to listen to hip-hop. Unless, of course, you get an errection from being a so-called victim, which I think you get lol
So you are invalidating my feelings because it‚Äôs not what you feel? What kind of solidarity is that?!?! I though we were in on this together?!?!??
You do realize you are showing Asian hate by this right?
I'm Asian and you're a fucking moron
Stop using my people as a cudgel.  Show me where hip-hop hurt Asian people lol.
bad bitches wanna be my bae
üòÇüòÇüòÇ. Why do you hate Bohan Phoenix?
First, I'll listen to whatever I want and I'll criticize whatever I want, thank you.   I'm not Asian bro I'm not a victim of anything lol, you are so low iq to make false assumptions.  I'm black and I stand in solidarity with other groups marginalized by America.(which ain't French, Canadian, Christians, etc) .   But yea hip hop and the black community have an even bigger problem with misogyny and homophobia and antisemitism too, I'm glad you are bringing this to the convo. Luckily I can walk and chew gum at the same time.
Solidarity doesn't mean I tolerate your ignorance of facts
You reaching like a mf. I'll tell a black person who says racism doesn't exist the same thing.
You're in denial too. Bye
...
Nah he sounds cool.  You don't tho
Of course you're not asian. Real asian people who have not been americanized don't even pay attention to that shit because they're too busy building their lives and taking care of their family.   This is why they are the most successful in the West, because of people like you wasting your time on causes that give the smallest meaning to your life but keep you broke.   But keep on fighting the good fight, I guess. Hopefully, they'll hire you to do some minimum wage job that you'll use to pay your wi-fi to complain about a rapper joking about ramen noodle.
Denial?  LoL if anything rap helped me come to terms with being a minority in a white neighborhood.  Stop reaching.
...suck this dick
Clearly you've never heard him speak about hip-hop, you fucking herb
You're a racist at this point bro.  Calling people "Real Asian" proves it.  I hope you heal your hateful heart  Check out r/aznidentity to realize there are real people being hurt by your bigotry
You're giving uncle Tom
What did he say
Call me whatever you like, cause it's truly the only power you'll ever have in this world

You're alone in a basement crying and I'm living my life lol
Do some basic research.  Anyway you can keep screaming into the void
And what are you, a senator?  Tell me of your great power if you're so focused on obtaining it lol.  Bigots are pathetic
That's what they said about black subreddits too
Yea I'm definitely in a basement lol.  What does that even mean. I'm on a balcony right now smoking bro
Just fyi hip hop can be a force for good and still have a problem with Asian hate,  antisemitism, homophobia etc

Lmao another name calling. So predictable. And y'all use the same insults and names like y'all are all ghostwriting from each other
Some probably are.  Aznidentity is a bunch of people complaining about "black crime" and Asian women who want to sleep outside the race.  You're super goofy.  Are the only Asians you know on reddit?
Seems like your issue is society....

Stood over bro with my tears together
troll ass mf lmao
Well, you not supposed to hop on a track and say "The nigga I'm rappin' wit is betta than me." Lmao
the best one
I think the only right ways to do it is go absolutely nuts with it like Kendrick‚Äôs legendary Control verse. Or then the ‚Äùtwo legends can coexist‚Äù way like Cole on Middle Child or like Benny The Butcher on Johnny P‚Äôs Caddy with the ‚Äùbesides Con & West, tell me who else I gotta respect‚Äù like agreeing to be on the top together. Saying ‚Äùim the best‚Äù on a track (especially with other artists) loses all meaning if it‚Äôs just thrown around.
Morray is the only one I've ever heard do this
there are plenty of good british rappers. you just either: haven‚Äôt looked at all or are so biased that u dismiss every english rapper u come across
DOOM grew up in the US, has an American accent, I don't know if I'd really call him an English rapper.
Dave Is top tier
There‚Äôs plenty that are generally good or have some good songs. You have to understand people with accents and the different slang though. Some options are Stormzy, Meekz, Dave, JME, Skepta, P Money, Pete and Bas (very heavy scouse accent so may be hard to understand). There‚Äôs plenty of others but these were just a a few off the top of my head.
Lil Simz and Dave are S tier
Slick Rick?
Yah man agree with u cant understand rest of them
Little Simz‚Ä¶ Dave‚Ä¶ Meekz
Not really.I like some.Central cee is fine.Little simz is good.I just don‚Äôt enjoy other English rappers.
I just put him in because he was born there and died there.
He was raised on Long Island, NY.
adam 22 should be 16 imo ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Joe Budden üíÄ
I think Ak has more power in Hip-Hop than Joe Budden. He helped put on a lot of young rappers and kept them relevant for a while. He even works with their labels. Joe just critics them and apologizes on the next episode
Pedo 22 on the list
FUCK THESE NIGGAS DRAKE DROPPED
TELL ME WHAT TO DO!!!
Cardi easily dominated that year, to the point where I just now realized; this was on G-Eazy‚Äôs album. üíÄ
Omg its Draaaaaaaaaaaake  Sorry does anyone like that whiny fucker anyway?
TELL ME WHAT TO DO!!!!!
Finally. Zay doesn‚Äôt miss. I feel like all three of his projects have no skips. He is massively underrated.
Was my favourite album for awhile when I first started getting deeper into hip hop. Has my favourite Kendrick feature on Wats Wrong and Silkk Da Shocka is one of my favourite songs of all time. Shit brings me to the brink of tears every listen
One of my favorite albums, but I think he fell victim to humiliation ritual
Pretty good overall album, a few 10/10 songs on it
The kendrick feature a bop
Extremely underrated
Isaiah cool
10/10
I love Isaiah Rashad & I live right outside of Chattanooga so that‚Äôs cool
Free P went to work instrumentally.
I did not know who he was so i searched his video on YouTube and he has the same voice as Silkk The Shocker. He has the same exact flow as well, and I mean that in a bad way. I'm sorry but that song was wack. Its called "Wat's Wrong". The beat was horrible and the lyrics were lame. I stopped listening after 30 seconds, and have no intentions of listening to the whole album. (not being disrespectful just being honest)
This will always be a great album. This the album that made me an Isaiah fan
Super underrated. Great for rainy day vibes
Fantastic album. Wats wrong is a daily listen
4r da squaw, free lunch, wats wrong and tity and Dolla are 11/10 songs for me, amazing. I prefer THIB over this album personally.
hes one of those guys that has always maintained an amazing sound, hes super consistent and im glad that whole sextape bullshit didnt throw him off.
Great album, very underrated.
There‚Äôs only one right answer. It‚Äôs a fucking masterpiece. He doesn‚Äôt miss.
fantastic but cilvia demo goes harder
Classic fr
Yeah Cilvia demo fuckin slaps too shot you down is üî•üî•üî•
Not a single skip on any of his albums
Yeah when I first moved out on my own that shit dropped and me and all the homies would play it through while rolling up got some deep nostalgia for me Brenda and free lunch will always slap.
Yeah a little depressing but that‚Äôs my favorite kind of rap haha
Wait what happened ??
Dot said hold my beer üëÄ
Damn you put on Wats Wrong and didn‚Äôt even wait for Kendrick‚Äôs verse üòÇ. It‚Äôs one his best features imo
Totally respect your opinion I understand he‚Äôs not for everyone and on that album he‚Äôs literally has a song called silk the shocka on that album as a tribute to him
"I need smoke just to exhale" hit me before the real feels even came in. That song is gold, my dude. Maybe just not for you, but I think zay and Kenny killed it and then some.
Literally one of the best songs kendrick has been on
Cilvia demo was great but this was the album that made me a fan, legitimately timeless jams on this tape. Stuck in the mud/bday/Brenda/what‚Äôs wrong are all probably top 100 rap songs idc what anyone says
His sex tape got leaked and had to publicly address his fans at big concerts regarding his sexuality. I think there‚Äôs more to the story than it just getting randomly leaked. He also seemed a bit off? Almost depressed and less open when I saw him in concert last year (SF)  There‚Äôs theories of rappers being forced to do things that are to control them.   Here‚Äôs another example https://youtu.be/rKlnq2jOXHE Original video without the guy talking https://youtu.be/7oITy25jAE4
Just to throw some suggestions to you I‚Äôd listen to tity and dolla and 4 da squaw and if you don‚Äôt like him after that no worries music subjective my friend just wanted to shout out one of my favorite rappers
4r da squaw, free lunch, wats wrong, and stuck in the mud were my mf jams üò§
Bruh Brenda is so god damn relatable ‚ÄúI got 2 cigarettes to my last name, I clock in for the check but I don‚Äôt wanna go‚Äù
I‚Äôm never going to Hollywood man hope it gets better for him he‚Äôs a dope person and artist
Dawg how‚Äôd I forget 4 da squaw dressed like rappers and free lunch and park and AA and a lot‚Ä¶ whole album banged
Timeless song
I bought some flashy new tennis shoes online for my gym training.  Found this next day.  Still prancing down the lane lol.

Kendrick Lamar and J. Cole. You may or may not like Tyler, the Creator give him a listen too but them first two for sure.
Saba, Larry June, Lauryn Hill and Stormzy to name a few.
Check out Saba, his music is clean
Jurassic 5 - pretty clean and general feel good vibes. Some awesome lyricism from Chali 2na as well
Look into groups from Rhymesayers Entertainment.Id start with a group/duo called Atmosphere. Listen to song called trying to find a balance to see if you like it. Thats considered indie-rap and his catalog is massive and he still performs even though he came out in 90s.   Or try a group called Blackalicious - blazing arrow album.   Most *popular* rap has been about drugs, women and guns since the 90s, and it doesnt seem likely to changes. Teenagers eat up the misogamy and like to feel tough.
Check out to Pimp A Butterfly by kendrick lamar one of the best albums of all time regardless of genre
Listen to madvillany you will be shocked
To be honest you might be better off listening to instrumentals. DJ Premier has a couple of albums called Beats That Collected Dust. Great sounding hip hop beats without any lyrics
Paid In Full by Eric B and Rakim
Doggyland by Snoop Dogg
Crypt the rapper is pretty dope. I really like Chris webby he was one of the rappers that got me to looking at more underground artists. There's Apathy and the Demi Godz. Mgks mix tapes are wicked. Dm me if you are interested in more
Listen to immortal technique, start with ‚ÄúDance with the Devil‚Äù
Start with listening to King Von  Start with Crazy Story 1 & 3 then Took Her To The O then Broke Opps and then Lurkin
[removed]
I feel like with your criteria you‚Äôre a lot less likely to enjoy a lot of any single artists work but there‚Äôs plenty of songs by plenty of people you‚Äôd like. Not a lot of rappers that never bring up women or drugs in any context lol.
Death grips is a good start or jpegmafia
Check out [Doomtree](https://doomtree.bandcamp.com/album/doomtree) (especially [Dessa's solo material](https://dessa.bandcamp.com/)), Jurassic 5, ¬°MursDay!, Atmosphere, Outkast, Blackalicious, Pigeon John, [Shad](https://shadk.bandcamp.com/music), [Dark Time Sunshine](https://fakefour.bandcamp.com/album/anx), R.A.P.

That‚Äôs song was hard as hell!
don‚Äôt listen to this dude bro. all king von does is objectify women, talk about drugs and murder.
Dont listen to this guy hes a fake rap fan. Everyones introduction to hip hop should be King Von
You're right.  While he's still huge and doing crazy numbers,  his quality has been declining for years
He just dropped Her Loss which is a great project, stop
I keep saying it Drake hasn‚Äôt been good since 2015. Even though since 2015 he has made Afrobeats, house, drill and dancehall songs he hasn‚Äôt developed or changed. No versatility. Passionfruit and Nonstop sound like the same song.  He just jumps on trends in pop culture. That‚Äôs why he got Millie Bobbie Brown killed and groomed XXXTentacion.
Drakes always been mid af tho..
Wait! Drake once had quality?? He's always just sounded like every new rapper to me.... Also comparing someone who uses a ghostwriter to jay is crazy.... They are not on the same level and I'm not even the biggest jay z fan
Lol sure Jay might‚Äôve bossed up at this time but the music suffered and never returned to its former level except for maybe American gangster we saw a bit of a return to form. People really have some skewed perceptions of a loosie nowadays thinking everything gotta be a smash single lmao, it‚Äôs a cool little track
Great he says ü§£ü§£ü§£  ![gif](giphy|ra3uQxvxo6aKAN42Le)
Wait that last part is backwards right? üò¨
He had songs that sounds like a trend at the time but for majority of the album it was his own style. Best example of that is ‚Äúnothing was the same‚Äù most of those songs are drake rapping and singing his best imo.
You‚Äôre forgetting Watch the throne , and 444.
It was though? I know now people want to continue the narrative of Drakes mid album streak so they wanna say it wasn‚Äôt.
Pound cake is still one of his best if not the best
Watch the throne Jay was really nowhere near his former level in terms of rapping lol. I would agree tho and say the music was good. I‚Äôm completely good on 4:44 tho
It‚Äôs not a narrative. This music is not on par with his first 5 albums, you‚Äôre just delusional or bias.
See that‚Äôs the Drake I fell in love wit pause. Bars, flowing and holding his own wit Hov. Drake now is so watered down it‚Äôs bothering me seriously.
Oh I enjoy something, I must be delusional or biast! Millions of other people must be delusional too, there‚Äôs no way they could like something you don‚Äôt ü§°
He knows if he puts minimal effort into any project it will always go #1, nowadays hes just biting off everybody elses style and sound but nobody cares for some reason
No one cares because ‚Äúbiting‚Äù is an outdated concept. Music it‚Äôs art and one way of doing art doesn‚Äôt just belong to one person. It‚Äôs encouraged in the film world to take from others why should it be discouraged in rap?
Rondo re della drill
One i like is [Sosmula ](https://youtu.be/RNauLywgN60) and tho he was raised in NYC, he was born in Brazil
yes. i‚Äôm french so i naturally listen to french rap. but i also listen to latino trap and korean rap.   check out: orelsan (french), myke towers ( puerto rico), august d (korean)
Rondo kinda corny ngl but i like a few of his songs
Drake? Canadian?

Song is cool.
It‚Äôs ok. I guess I would technically be considered an NF fan since I listen to a lot of his older songs, but some of the mixing/post production puts me off of the his newer stuff. Not sure what was going on in Pandemonium (guess maybe the music was taking after the name?) and I was disappointed with some of the post production/mixing in Gone(unfortunate cause I like Julia Michaels as well). Suffice had an extra minute at the end that sounded like it belonged to a different song. There was one other I wasn‚Äôt super keen on that I can‚Äôt remember the name of off the top of my head, but the rest are definitely going in my playlist.

I had never heard of Westside Gunn until you mentioned him now. So i searched one of his videos on YouTube and he sounds just like Ghostface Killah. He kind of looks like him too, face, body, etcetera.
agree 100%
He‚Äôs great and underrated for sure.
My fav
My mom isn‚Äôt a fan of modern rap, but the only MC she can recognize (and likes) if he comes on is Danny Brown.
100%
Fax
Dooms voice sounds like a fresh loaf of bread
DOOM has a sort of similar voice to biggie imo
wdym don toliver that guy sounds like Akon
Thugger def has a unique sound that people try to emulate. Kodak and 42 dugg have great unique voices too i fw them both heavy
Destroy lonely reference??
That can apply for most of DTP Roster. 4 ize, Shawnna, Chingy, even Luda himself had a unique voice and interesting inflections
That's a good one. If you know you know.
Literally the first one that came to mind for me as well
Eh he kinda sound like yo gotti
Lol how
Not even close. Dudes sound more unique now then back then because there are so many different ways to use ya voice now.
First ever mention I‚Äôve seen on this sub about Ghostmane.
I didn‚Äôt know people didn‚Äôt know westside!!! You either love him or hate him there‚Äôs no in between, he‚Äôs a rap god
action bronson kinda sounds like gunn and ghostface
His Brooklyn slang is insane ‚ÄúEast side Buffalo shit!‚Äù Not to mention his adlibs.
Hahahaha I used to call it marshmallow-y, but yes!
Huh
He doesn‚Äôt sound Yo Gotti, at all; at least to me.
Well then who does he sound like?
He deserved to be here
? He from Buffalo
Destroy Lonely is I-20's son
His voice just sounds like any regular guy tbh
Horrorcore and shadow rap is my fav genre I fucking love ghostemane I love how his voice changes and shit
I disagree, but I think that depends on who you're a fan of, whoever your personal faves are you'd be able to identify them from a bunch of random voices
Its so cool imo
as an NF fan, shut up.
WHO?????????
Once again.  Gotta say it. This post sucks.
The bullshit that this sub calls 10/10 is crqzy
Nf fan here he's no where near eminem and never will be and that's fine because most rappers never will be lmao
Yeah I agree. Great album, no bad songs imo. But saying NF is one album from passing Eminem? C'mon OP, I'm a big fan of both, moreso of NF actually, but saying what you said should be a felony tbh.
Real
Took me a while to embrace this album but after listening to it several times I've really grown to love it

This would be awesome but‚Ä¶ some weeks and years as a whole are gonna be drier than others. But I would definitely join
It would just be a sub (hopefully pinned) with people posting whatever albums are about to drop or just dropped on a weekly basis. New albums drop every Friday. i dont know where to look for a place that has them listed let alone discussed.

50 cent, everythin else wasn‚Äôt trash or mediocre but still
imo kayne west
Kid cudi, man on the moon was amazing but everything else after is üöÆ
Lock in with his mixtapes, a lot of work on par with GRODT
Huh? Almost all of his albums are praised. What are you smoking
it‚Äôs an opinion
Let me guess graduation? My fav is late registration
Squidward plays a clarinet
Not getting source material from squidward. Lol
Props for owning it. Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen someone own something like that before.
No because squidward plays a clarinet and as a fellow clarinet player that‚Äôs semi disrespectful, thankfully I fuck with yachty extremely tough so he is all good nonetheless.
Not as bad as saying ‚ÄúI keep it 300, like the Romans‚Äù
‚ÄúLet the suicide doors up‚Äù type beat
‚ÄúBe humble‚Äù. I think I heard that before.
I don‚Äôt even care cause that song is fire
I'd love to hear a similar confession from any rapper who claims that cinnamon is sweet in their rhymes
FLUTE!?
Its a funny line he never had to make ot right
These are the rappers y‚Äôall think are top anything. Meanwhile you will bash older folks for likening rap that makes sense.
 these idiots need to be led by the hand
Don‚Äôt listen to Yachty besides listening to 2 of his hits once or twice so can someone clarify if by yellow he means Asian? Cuz that‚Äôs not a good look.
Nah he need to blame the man in the mirror.   A classic example of kids making silly rap music but having the internet and never using it for good like "looking up shit you dont fucking have a clue about lol"
Thats racist
It still works if you want to talk technical, you gotta have talent to play that instrument and work them hands ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è lol
Blame the mistake on someone else but take credit for "it sound good".  Dude is a dumbass.
Yachty an autotune mumble rapper anyway. SUCKAS IS PUNKS!
Ignorance and dick riders are a dangerous combination
He is one of the worst rappers to ever do it
Is this a huge troll post with every comment playing along???
üòÇüòÇüòÇidk why squidward playing a cello is funny to me
 Like when Nice & Smooth said Dizzy Gillespie played the sax, Me myself I love to max.
WHY DID I THINK THAT WAS NORMAL TOO
I was about to say it‚Äôs the clarinet, but other people of taking care of it
The fact he still aint get the instrument right lmaooooo
homie said a flute
Still giving up. Cause he plays a clarinet
‚ÄúI keep it 300 like the Romans.‚Äù
Could‚Äôve changed it to ‚Äústroke‚Äù.
Not a huge fan but so nice to see people not double down for once
Yellow as in Jaundice?
And he acknowledged that . . . six years ago.   [https://www.thefader.com/2017/05/29/lil-yachty-peek-a-boo-cello](https://www.thefader.com/2017/05/29/lil-yachty-peek-a-boo-cello)
He doesn‚Äôt even play the flute
Flyer than an ostrich anyone?
How did he own it when he placed the blame on everyone around him except for himself?
bro made sure him and yachty on good terms
How is it disrespectful not knowing something?
Damn, and here I was thinking it was Sparta this whole time. How foolish I look.
‚ÄúSoUnDs GoOd tHo‚Äù
Make sense like "dear mama" or whatever coupled with "thats why they call you bitch". 20 year Olds with millions of dollars and an audience do dumb shit publicly while us poors get to keep that shit limited to a few people. I don't even like Yachty but I'm so over the whole "never be Pac or Biggie" shit. Metal heads aren't sitting around listening to Gojira or Behemoth talking like "they're nothing compared to Deep Purple." Music builds on and reacts to its trends. 90's and 00's rap had a lot of saccharine ass Duran Duran samples, over production, ignorant music videos, etc. It became unaccessable to be heard if you weren't backed by a label with a big promotion budget. I'm old AF too but I respect these kids doing their own shit and getting it out there themselves. People over identify with music from their era because it spoke to them them at a time I'm their life where they could have music mean so much to them and nothing will ever come close to that feeling for that person ever again. It's not really better or worse it's just of its own time. Unless it's youngboy, his music is empirically proven garbage
Yellowbone.
That would be tan right?
He literally said ‚Äúi fucked up‚Äù in the blurb, nigga hello?
It is, straight up. Imagine if an Asian rapper said:  ‚ÄúMy new bitch black,  She ___insert racist/sexist joke against black women here__‚Äù  It would be clear as day that this is racist. But because it‚Äôs against Asians, it‚Äôs more accepted.
He‚Äôs better at rock music but lil boat is a good project
True
He literally says "I fucked up" and blamed everyone around him for not even noticing. That's a serious oversight if no one in the fucking studio know what a cello is.   Yachty fucked up, but so did everyone else who let it happen down the chain.
bro said "i fucked up" like 4 times
counter point: shut up
![gif](giphy|l0CLSWibycrDMyYtW)
Shut up boomers
*edit typo
Bruh never heard it simplified to just yellow before. Maybe I‚Äôm the real racist üíÄüíÄüíÄ
I don't think it's widely used for tan
Yellow as in a black lightskin girl smh. No ine‚Äôs being racist thats how some black folks refer to lightskin black girls
He's not even good at that lmao
Like hell I'll be the one telling a rapper he doesn't know what he's talking about. It's a client at the end of the day, he wants to say dumb shit, then as long as he's paying we'll let him say dumb shit
>Yachty fucked up, but so did everyone else who let it happen down the chain.  Nah, they were all laughing behind his back while cashing their checks.
Maybe him and the whole studio suck
Even it that‚Äôs your viewpoint, he said he fucked up at the end. So in the end he owned it‚Ä¶.
Lol you are just mad he is right
Lmao I mean you could be right, too. But I just assumed it was for yellow bone.
Yellow is some historically degrading shit to say about asian people
üòÇüòÇüòÇ facts
then they‚Äôd be idiots for intentionally letting the person that‚Äôs getting them paid embarrass themselves and putting the bag in jeopardy.
He is in fact wrong and suffers from the disability called not being able to read
nah i think he means asian ngl
that‚Äôs definitely not what he meant though, you never heard of yellow bone or red bone black girls?üòÇüòÇ
It ain't that deep
Something tells me you haven't graduated yet
Def Asian as a reference to the stereotype that Asian children are forced by their parents to play instruments (usually string instruments ironically)
This is reddit. So usually, no. Suburban kids don‚Äôt know
‚Äúthey would be stupid for that‚Äù aint that deep a statement champ
I‚Äôm sorry what? Did you mean to respond to someone else? In the comment I am referencing, the op said all Little Yachty did was blame others when he very clearly said that he fucked up more than once.  I in fact have two college degrees, but even so I don‚Äôt know what you could have been referencing originally. As I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre aware this whole post is just a joke anyways. That‚Äôs why I think it‚Äôs kinda funny this guy was commenting that Lil Yachty didn‚Äôt apologize. Nobody in their right mind thinks he needed to apologize for using the wrong instrument name anyways. It‚Äôs just a joke that stupid people on this sub are taking seriously.
even the burban kids listen to music like that and it‚Äôs a rap sub that‚Äôs why i‚Äôm kind of surprised.üíÄguess you right though
I‚Äôm not surprised. Even if they listen to the music, it‚Äôs different when you grow up in a community that‚Äôs diverse
Em's my favorite rappa, but this nigga glazin'. How you gonna make an excuse for a song you yourself said sucks lmao. It's ok if a few songs suck. That don't take away from his greatness. Em like 55 now. That's like sayin' Jordan sucks cause he hasn't won a title in the last 10 years.
