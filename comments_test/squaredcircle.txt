Ahh, yes, Owen Owens.

Get that fucker in the Andre battle royale.
Do they play high school football in Canada? That's a left tackle.

My theory was that he is doing a Boris Johnson, intentionally having a memeable look in order to disarm people against his evil bullshit. "How can he be that corrupt, look at him, he's so funny looking!"

I know they're putting the belt on him because media exposure, but Jesus Christ he fucking sucks in the ring.
All I can muster is a “dang it” at this point.

Unrelated to the Vince stuff, but I wish they would’ve pulled the trigger there. Even if it was a one day title reign, with Cena winning it the next night to start his feud with Bryan, it at least would’ve given Mark that accolade.

Alex Wright    Groundbreaking dance skills aside, he was always someone who I enjoyed watching wrestle. Really smooth in the ring, and always looked like he was a threat (unless he was getting squashed by someone who couldn't lace his boots)  Das Wunderkind, for life
When I was a kid I really liked Tyson Kidd. Not Hart Foundation Era Tyson Kidd or Early NXT Era Tyson Kidd. The awkward period of time where Kidd was just around and had Jackson Andrews as a body guard.  I liked him so match that in my figure federation I made him my world champion, and gave him what kid me thought was a cooler finisher which was the Canadian Destroyer.
I still don’t know how Norman Smiley wasn’t a megastar.
WHOS BETTER THAN KANYON!
D lo brown for me
As a fat kid I was a fan of the Big Boss Man when I was growing up, probably because he didn't do fat guy spots like sit on people. In my eyes he had a little more dignity than the rest
Eugene.
T-Hawk was amazing
Showtime Percy Watson will occupy a special place in my heart.
Alex Wright, Kanyon, Chris Chetti
 *Bad Luck Fale*
Blitzkrieg was my dude. Imagine if he came along 5 or 10 years later.
Sandman and shark boy.
I wouldn’t consider him obscure but I was obsessed with Raven when I was a kid.
Chris Adams.
I've got a good answer for this: I thought mid-90s WCW jobber Doc Dean was just a really cool guy. I always wanted to see him team with Lord Steven Regal.
I started watching in 2014, i was 11 and really enjoyed Goldust and Stardust
Essa Rios
I was a big Test guy as a kid
The Headshrinker (Samu & Fatu)  D-Lo Brown  Hakushi   Essa Rios
Before he got mega over on the indies for awhile it was Zack Ryder.
Steve Blackman! Loved him during AE
Let’s collectively forget Berlyn happened
My dude coming out in the football pads for his hardcore match was legit the hardest I had ever laughed at a wrestling match at that point. Most people don't even remember how good of a technical wrestler Norm actually was, but that is fine because the role he was born to play was a comedy one and he killed it every week.
My answer as well, glad to see a fellow D Lo fan!
D-Lo was my guy, as well.
I always liked boss man
This the right answer
Oh shell yeah
And once pinned Jushin Thunder Liger in a Super Juniors tournament.
And thats the fishing line....

Cause WWE for the most part don’t care about tag-teams. When there are tag-matches at WM it’s usually a way to get more top single stars or celebs into the show.   Usos earned and deserved this but they really should have had a much better WM track record then they have. For years it’s pretty much been them and the New Day carrying.

RJ City has quietly been one of the best AEW gets
This is one of the most efficient backstage interview segments I've seen in ages lmao  Spells out the point of the fued plainly, everyone gets a good line, dialogue moves at the pace of a Sorkin movie and also puts RJ on my TV screen.
More RJ on my tv please.
RJ City is an absolute gem.
"How do you feel about being a criminal?"   RJ's sheer bluntness always gets a cackle out of me.
Hilarious. Give me more segments like this, please.
Like with Eddie Kingston, they should have regular segments titled "RJ City Mediates..."
Watching this segment respectfully
Misread the title as "meditation session"
Im in love with Taya! Lol  ![gif](giphy|ZOStzpF9H5syI)
He really is. Hey! (EW) is almost always must see
Without people really noticing, AEW has been consistently crushing these ~1:30 backstage segments for a while now and its great.   Hookhausen was entirely done via these. QTV same thing. Tonight also had the Mark Briscoe interview same thing. Plenty of other examples I'm sure if I thought about it.  They just start up, dive in, accomplish something, and finish up. Efficient uses of time and since they're pre-recorded, you can do multiple takes if needed to get them perfectly dialed-in and then even edit it down if necessary. Even if someone doesn't like something, its 1:30, who cares (the amount of hate QTV gets for something that after three "episodes" still hasn't even gone 5 full minutes is hilarious to me, that's less than one Roman Reigns entrance I think?)

Bout 4:30 here  https://youtu.be/DbfiLWF8Sck
I liked him better back then
It never stops being funny to me that a move created by a heel character specifically as a shittier version of the F5 became one of the most iconic finishers in the business. Says a lot about where Cena stood in the WWE hierarchy in 2003, as they would've come up with a much cooler-looking finisher if they planned to push him to the top.
Thank you lol thought I was going crazy not finding it
Nobody was really using a death valley driver at all in WWE at the time, so it made sense for the character/rivalry at the time.  If you don't like death valley drivers that's fine, but the move existed long before he debuted
Tbh i never considered the fu/aa a death valley driver. More as just a firemans carry slam
Im pretty sure cena started out doing the dvd and eventually transitioned to just a firemans carry slam like you said.
correct. He used the DVD early on. Then the whole thing about dropping people on their neck came into play. Then the PG era renamed that move.

So Darby Allin was run over by an actual car, yesterday? And he’s meant to wrestle the other pillars in a few weeks? Does this dude autoheal like he’s in a video game? Because he wrestled a full match then took an F10 face first onto the ramp.  This dude’s crazy, man. I mean I’m sorry to say that I chuckled everytime commentary mentioned the car thing. Like it sounds so absurd. Lee Moriarty’s out there in his control session and Excalibur just goes, “Darby, suffering the effects of being run over by a car!” The match itself was solid. Colin Cassidy was doing all sorts of nonsense, Moriarty attacked Darby with a skateboard, and Darby sold being hit by a car. It was all very overbooked like a Ruthless Aggression Raw match… but good.   Anyway, Darby always surprises me with how good of a mat wrestler he is. He spent a good amount of time chain wrestling Taigastyle like a pro. Like, you know it’s a good time when JR’s popping for it, saying shit like, “this a heck of a match” and “I love this kid!” Darby’s one of the best wrestlers in the world.  ^Yo ^Julia ^Hart ^can ^freaking ^go
Mark Briscoe being tricked into joining up with Lethal/Jarrett/Satnam/Sanjay is going to be absolutely delightful.  If you had asked me yesterday what that group was missing, I would not have said Mark Briscoe, but how wrong I was. All I want now is a segment on the chicken farm with everyone chasing chickens around, because I genuinely can't decide who will be the funniest.
The women's matches tonight were better than expected. You could see Julia Hart passing Anna Jay in skill in real time.
More RJ City-hosted mediation sessions in the future! That was a fantastic setup for a backstage segment and was a lot of fun.  Really, just more RJ City in general.
The streak continues: 4 straight Battle of the Belts shows with not a single title changing hands
Ain't going to lie, I cackled when the last thing I heard before the commerical was JR, with a curious inflection in his voice, say: "Eighteen years old.."
I honestly have to say I was really impressed tonight. The cards weren't flashy on paper but almost everything delivered and we got some significant story progression.   They need to get Rampage live every week and preferably 2 hours.
Sammy Guevara the first and currently only person to win a belt at Battle of the Belts.
Good showing for Billie Starkz.
Really solid matches all around
Great to see a women’s match that wasn’t just a “going for the belt” story.   Fun matches all around!!
I was looking at Julia Hart's tweet and its crazy that she's only 21 since she's been around a few years now. She's in that group with Daniel Garcia, Skye Blue, and Top Flight of wrestlers who are deceptively young.
Had really low expectations for both shows but they were a lot of fun. AEW is delivering really good shows lately
Rampage was a fun show tonight, some good story line advancement.   Great to see HOOK continuing to maintain momentum.   Definitely was not expecting the J.A.S to turn on the Acclaimed so soon.   Also didn't expect Swerve to partner up with the Embassy, already a much better teamup.   Good performance by Julia in the main, she's improving for sure. I still feel like Anna has stagnated in the ring.   Dynamite next week already looking good, Keith vs Jericho, Swerve vs Darby and Orange vs Buddy yes please.
That was a fantastic 2 hours of graps.
 Ibushi has gotta be coming in soon since the entire Elite is going to be wiped out
A fun two hours of wrestling, even though these cards are thrown together and come off as slightly underwhelming. The talent always deliver for most part.  Over the two shows Darby/Moriarty, Hook/Ethan Page, O.C match and ROH tag title match were all very good to great.   Women's matches were okay, nice of them to give Anna/Julia the main event spot. Billie looks like a potential future star and it shocked me how tall she is next to Jade. Julia has a cool gimmick but is still a bit ways off before you can pull the trigger on her as even a TBS champ. Anna is still probably the talent form young bunch in AEW, that still isn't reaching her potential.   Loved the Cutler/Naka segment. Poor lads are going to be destroyed on Wednesday though lol.  Very good crowd seemed like they were into everything on the show.   Great card for Dynamite next week though.
Two hour Rampage/BOTB blocks are always fun.      I would love to see them make the new Saturday show two hours instead of one hour Friday and one Saturday.
Seemed like those 2 hours flew by tbh.   That ROH Tag Title match was pretty entertaining, I bit on a few of those nearfalls, Hobbs looked like a beast, and that finish was sick.
That cut to star wars so fast.
Ibushi pretty please 🙏
House of Black wins all the belts, please and thank you.
Was this two different shows or just one supersized rampage
Man I love when the lead out is Star Wars, not to mention it being Episode VI lol ah keep the SWC hype today going (although this one tends to make me cry 😭)
Fucking QT Marshall.
All the matches really delivered, really wish it started at 9 instead of 10 though, it’d be nice for regular rampage but it’s almost  necessary  when we do the 2 hour specials.
Fun shows. Very happy Julia had a great showing. Her entrance is exactly the kind of great presentation that's gonna help get her over.   Taya just has "it", man. She deserves to go over Jade. Also loved seeing my boi RJ on TV.
These were fun shows. They need to get Rampage to 2 hrs and move it up the timeslot.   OC vs. Dralistico was fun. Rush fighting Trent while wearing his coat was funny. Jose unbuttoned his shirt because he can't help exposing his muscles.   Starkz vs. Jade was def a step up from most of Jade's matches. If 1/3 of her matches were like this she'd be thought of more fondly. Billie has a bright future in the business.   JR needs to be stopped. He either needs to be fed or sent to bed. He was horny.   Anna vs. Julia was an okay match. Both of them have come far in where they are with their characters and Julia had an amazing entrance. The more time they spend with their groups the better they should get. Julia winning with the mist to honor the House.   Daddy Magic and Cool Hand Ang attacked the Acclaimed after the match for not scissoring them and joining the JAS. I can't wait to see this play out. 2Point0 are perfect foils.   Darby vs. Lee was a good match. Reminded me of Cody vs. Darby in that a star is getting worked by a young up and comer. Darby needs to wrapped in bubble wrap after he wrestles and skates.   Lucha Bros vs. QT and Hobbs was a hoot. Flippy Shit QT and Hobbs work as a tag team. Lucha Bros looked like they were going to lose.   Solid week of wrestling for AEW.   Settle down JR. Is going to be stuck in my head.
I'm very very very new to AEW but I lol'd at the Cody signs
fun two hours of wrestling.
Is all TNT plays is star wars and FF?
people SHIT all over these cards and what a shocker, ended up being a great 2 hours
Anna Jay has not improved one lick in the ring since she debuted. Julia Hart and Skye Blue have surpassed her by leaps and bounds. Even teenage Billie Starkz is better.
As much as I wanted their feud with Cassidy to elevate Kip and his crew, Buddy being the one to take the title would be perfect. He’s a great talent who needs some signature wins, and he’s someone who seems to travel a lot.
BoTB has kinda become a joke in that nothing is notable and the belts never change hands. But if all the matches go as hard as the ones did tonight, I won't mind at all. Every one of those matches slapped.
Fun shows -- that  Orange Cassidy/Dralistico match was really something.  Impressed with Julia Hart particularly and a good competitive Jade/Billie match as well.  Nice to see Jade with an actual storyline ala Nyla Rose for the first time in awhile.
VERY solid 2 hours of wrestling here. It's not on the level of Dynamite, sure, but still, nothing to sneeze at.  I love how youth-focused Rampage was. Putting aside 2point0 and the enhancement talent in that match, the two oldest wrestlers with a match were Max Caster and Ethan Page at 33. Everyone else was younger.   The main event with Anna/Julia was pretty good for two relative rookies, homegrown in AEW and new to the business. A combined age of 45!! And they're trusted to main event Rampage.  Always love to see Lucha Bros, Hobbs, OC, and Jade. Dralistico/OC was a great match! I loved the storyline setups for next week, Swerve finally getting on the move and Buddy/OC are really exciting.
I pop in and outta AEW. Can anyone tell me if a belt’s been dropped on a BoTB yet?
These shows are always treated like an afterthought, especially when four championships were just defended on Wednesday night.
Not the best night of wrestling they've ever put on in the ring, it's safe to say, but some fun stuff. Looking forward to seeing Starkz work with some of the other members of the women's roster; I hadn't realized how tall she is from interview footage and stills.
You know, at this point I've just come to terms of the fact that Ethan Page is just this generation's Barry Horowitz or Duane Gill, but with a cool toy vlog. I think I'd probably be more attached to AEW in general if anyone I liked was allowed to do anything but job. Maybe Christian Cage will get some wins when he comes back, but that's about all I can look forward to anymore. Miro had the right idea, better to stay home than join AEW's current Job Squad.
Was Taya getting booed or was I not hearing things correctly or knowing context?
Having been following Julia Hart on Dark  for months now waiting for this moment. She's fucking great
Darby wrestled a match so intense, Jeff Hardy seemingly relapsed into pain pills.  I feel like Darby was back like a week or two later.
Goths regenerate by smoking, listening to joy division, and / or complaining. He'll be fine
Satnsm, for sure. Unless Jarrett calls em Slapnuggets
> You could see Julia Hart passing Anna Jay in skill in real time.  It's interesting that has happened because they've wrestled the same amount over the past year (29 matches for Anna, 27 for Julia), but Anna seems to have stalled out after her rapid progress in year 1.  Very possible it has to do with Julia being surrounded by mentors like Malakai and Brody while Anna was too busy complaining to MJF about Jungle Boy's small penis, if what I heard on Dynamite is true.
From what I saw tonight it may have already happened.
Love RJ City
Isn’t Sammy Guevara the only person to win a championship at BOTB?
It was two similar forces coming together and both continued their streaks.  Live Rampage always overachieves and "mid-looking AEW cards" also always overachieve. Tonight was no exception, just a fun two hours of tv.
He clearly cursed it for everyone else.  Sammy the sorcerer, he does hang out with a wizard!
My favorite is Riho is 25 and has been wrestling for 16 years.
Live Rampages and generally unimpressive looking match cards both never miss for AEW. They always exceed expectations for either of those.
>Also didn't expect Swerve to partner up with the Embassy, already a much better teamup.  I missed the show. Did he proper split from Parker and Tattooed Face Henchman Jones?
Neither was I, but then again the Acclaimed should have scissored 2.0.
Agree.  Whether it's Friday, or Saturday I think it just makes more sense to have the two hours be one show instead of two.
Everything was entertaining all around tonight and really flew by. I'm happy when so much wrestling in one day doesn't really feel like so much wrestling.
The convoluted overbooked nonsense of Harley Cameron low-blow on Abrahantes to Aaron Solo breath spray to QT pin with feet on the ropes with Solo holding them down absolutely got me for a half second. Fantastic execution and really fun main event.
For real, got whiplash
Orange Cassidy loses to Buddy Mathews for the International title. Wardlow takes the TNT title back only to lose it to Brodie King. Jungle Boy or Darbie win the World championship at DoN only to lose in the first defense to Malaki Black
It was 2 shows.
Welcome to AEW! It's a fun time.
Welcome to the club!
Yup. That was a really fun show.  Personally, I wouldn't mind making 2-hour Rampages a regular thing.
Flashback to the days of World Championship Wrestling on SuperStation TBS, aka The Beastmaster Station. It was always that, or Clash of the Titans, or Gone With the Wind, or The Blues Brothers. And if there wasn't a movie, there'd be Andy Griffith or Sanford and Son.
6 year old Marvel and DC movies too.
More of a fitness model energy less of a real pro wrestler.   Hopefully she takes note and inspiration
Anna Jay has also just not wrestled that much. Her first match in AEW was I believe her 7th match ever, and then she’s had one lengthy injury (which she came back from looking worse than before she went away) and then another minor one recently. I don’t think she’s at a point where they should give up on her, but I also think there are women backstage who should be getting main event spots before her.
You mean HoB needs to elevate Best Friends by dropping the titles to them.
Imagine Buddy and Rhea posing together with their championships.
I like the booking - give me some interesting match ups with 2 non contracted talent and then have a bit of talent cross paths without needing to be in a program.
There are too many title changes anyway. It's fine.
It's cool that Anna and Julia get that shot. They're not going to have an all-timer, but they had cool moments and looked like professionals.   One of AEW's great strengths is they'll try stuff. It won't all work, but they'll at least try.
Billie Starkz (18) and Julia Hart (21) combined are the age of Daddy Magic (39).  Two Billie Starkzes and a Julia Hart (combined 57) are still younger than Daddy Ass (59).   That's the age range we had going on tv tonight lol.
Sammy won the TNT title twice on different BotB shows.
Sammy won the interim TNT title in a match with Dustin on the first one when Cody was out for COVID exposure (or busy meeting with WWE, lol).  Then Sammy won the actual TNT title from Scorpio Sky on the second one.  I don’t think there’s been any title changes on 3-6.
Yeah, just one I believe. I believe the initial BOTB’s but I don’t remember whom or which belt, but I remember it happening
It’s not just the cosmic gimmick that reminds me of Stat. They’re both pretty big and athletic.
How tall is she? Maybe that’s why it’s hard to believe she’s only 18, if she’s towering over other people
yeah same. But Dark’s a bit of a controlled environment, which is good. It’s where talent figure shit out. Today’s live, though, so it was pretty impressive.   And also, Anna Jay did not have a great showing but Julia still managed to bring interesting stuff to the match. Her mechanics are solid and she’s got her facial expressions down. She should be out there with Hayter, Shida and Toni.
She's clearly been working really hard and has put a TON of work into every part of her presentation and tonight it all paid off. I think she's absolutely going to be another in a solid line of massive Dark success stories.   I was glad to see that the whole thing transitioned well from the Orlando studio to the full tv stage setup.
Yeah I need to go back and watch some Dark matches evidently. That entrance was sick.
Sting and Great Muta taught Darby the mystical secrets of No-Sell, where it transcends from kayfabe into shoot invulnerability
Those opening beats of Disorder, even before the bass are like a soothing salve.
That's what I mean... I first thought Satnam, but then realized that Sanjay is straight up hilarious plus he has his pencil, and then I started thinking about Jarrett and how he might have the edge. I was pretty sure it wasn't Lethal, until I remembered that he could just go Macho Man/Ric Flair on the chickens and that put him back in the running too. Any one of the four could do it!
Anna might also be a little unsure about getting back in there. Apparently she was pretty messed up by that Willow Bomb.
It took me a good 10 seconds to realise MJF didn't say Anna had a small penis.
She’s also involved with the JAS stuff which hasn’t progressed anybody.
Yup. Interim TNT and regular TNT championships.
Was she the 9 year girl Kenny wrestled that one time? I don’t even know if the math lines up they’re both deceptively young
I believe so.    Even his promo tonight he said something about "we lose soldiers but we move on". Honestly this is much better anyway, didn't care much for Parker or Trench.
Yeah that's fair. They did kinda leave em hanging at the end.    Think I was just looking forward to them having some fun, like with the Gunns last year.
Julia beats Jade with the mist
I would also like to report I'm immediately rooting against the House of Black and whatshername in particular for singing along to her own edgy Wiccan song. Booooo
The day Fuck Taylor gets a title belt is the Day TK dies of a coke and white claw overdose
Best friends have been jobbers since the start apart from OC why would you have a team with actual talent  elevate a jobber team 😂
Solid booking and interesting matches can definitely help with whenever there's a lack of title change.
The only thing I found was MLW's site saying she's 5'5" which doesn't seem right at all, considering what we saw tonight. I'm in her hometown & am, sadly, not really into the local scene & only just heard of her in a local news piece. I was pretty impressed by her match tonight. I definitely think she's got a future in the business.
No
She wasn't.
>Trench  I'll never get over the fact that all of wreddit had NO idea who Tattooed Face Henchman Jones was.
In all seriousness, same, but with that being said I liked the turn tonight. To me, it felt like a nice subverting of expectations to have them turn so soon into the program, and imagine them having a full-blown feud should be entertaining as well.
I don't know if Julia is ready to be a champion yet but she does so many little things that better workers don't have that makes me so excited for her potential. I hope Malaki works with her on promos and she keeps improving in the ring because she's got IT
Laughing at Cody is something AEW fans, and fans of Cody in general have done for a long time.
> for singing along to her own edgy Wiccan song  This made me chuckle.
Hahaha. I've noticed she's been doing it on Dark all the time. I didn't think much of it other than the fact that she must really like her entrance song.

I thought this was great but what makes it funny is they give this passionate speech but you know damn well they are going to get beaten to a inch of their lives by BCC.   I'm loving heel BCC even if Yuta is a little shit.
I want to see PPA show up to defend Cutler during this.
They're gonna die :-\
May they rest in pieces
Brandon Cutler gonna do an entire episode of BTE from the hospital.
These dudes are gonna get run over while Bryan calls them amateurs
The Elite hitting Cutler to get him and Nakazawa a DQ win over Moxley >>>
If YTR can tilt Moxley, I believe in the power of the baby oil user Nakazawa.
I’m unironically stoked for this, hope they come out with weapons
I've already picked my funeral clothes
I think One-Eyed Hangman and Kenny are gonna reunite next Dynamite
The elite have unleashed the HOUNDS OF WAR!~
At the end of the day, wrestling is for the kids and the kids at heart, and this was a good message from Brandon and Naka...  I wonder what flowers are elite to send to their hospital beds?
Put Danielson on the Hentai Slide Nak!
Hilarious

Impassioned speech.   You’re going to die on Wednesday but that was a good speech.
paging the Golden Star.
Nah, I'm ready for hardcore Puro combo Nak and cuter too show up the BCC
This is still only the second scariest match Nakazawa has been in recently.  BCC is nothing compared to the Pheromones.
If these BCC fucks hurt Nak I'm fighting Mox myself
Amatuers.
They're gonna die
They basically already did this same thing a few weeks ago with Evil Uno, but maybe this will lead to something good.
 Bryan - *AMATEURS!*
Can you imagine the visual of Cutler bleeding under that mask?
But they will get their ass beat on their own terms and showing as little fear as they can. Its a good message in a way. If you're gonna eat shit, take big bites with a smile on your face.
Yeah, Mox & Claudio are doomed
They should do a call-back to when Cody hijacked the vlog for a whole episode.  Wheeler can steal the camera, hack the YouTube channel, and upload ten minutes of BCC pumping iron in Mox's basement
Its Yano x Mox all over again
Tommy Bahama?
That woman is pure evil
He gets it ⭐
Seeing Cutler ripped apart will push Nick Jackson to the breaking point.  We may see him finally power-up into Merch Freak and go 1 v 4 against the BCC.
no but really how the hell can Moxley expect to apply a bulldog choke on a man covered in baby oil
This I want to see
Or how can Claudio swing the oiled up man? Nakazawa is a natural counter to them both.
Good God.  If he loses his grip, Nakazawa may be launched into orbit!

Seems insane to let McIntyre leave lol
Pay him what he’s worth, easy. Guy has been working through injuries and puts out good quality shit.
I'm AEW fanboy #1 but I really, really think Drew would be a megastar as the next monster gaijin in Japan.  He can still pop up stateside, mix it up at Forbidden Door, etc. But man, he'd look like a world-eater in NJPW.
Fightful reported both sides seem happy to wait until the deal gets closer to expiring before really hitting the negotiations.   Mike Johnson said the deal doesn't expire until late 2023, early 2024.
It would legit not shock me if he left… he’s basically done all that he came back for
Man I just can't see him walking. He debuted, floundered, fired, revitalized himself, came back and got about the biggest push a wrestler can get. And it's not like he's being treated poorly now. He's on TV constantly in feuds, and just had a 5 star triple threat with one of his best friends. Idk, I just don't see it. definitely needs a break though. Feel like he's working hurt/ill every other week
He hasn’t been booked very well since losing the WWE title. He carried Raw for a year with no crowds. Can’t believe he hasn’t even held the midcard title since. He should dethrone Gunther. Drew’s a good hand to have.
If Roman does lose at say SummerSlam after he's crossed 1,000 days and probably Cody decides because he's such a nice guy he doesn't want to hold both Championships hostage like Roman did, Drew surely has to be first in line for whichever one Cody vacates, probably the Bluniversal. Or maybe the Big Gold representing the Universal if Papa Haitch can convince Vince.
I cant see him leaving the E. They'll get a deal done.
Surely we didn't hear the exact same stuff about Owens and Zayn last year
Unifying the belts to this day was one of the dumbest things WWE has done in the last few years and the roster is still feeling the effects of it to this day. dudes like drew,Seth, and Lashley are  stuck in the midcard for the last year entirely cause they don't have a place in the current bloodline story so the only place for them is us/ic title picture.  If drew is frustrated about that when the only time he got to hold the WWE title is  in an empty warehouse I don't blame him.  The problem now is where he goes aew ? They'll take him but they also have no room for him at the top especially with  Jay white signing.
I do NOT want to see Drew leave. He is my favorite person in WWE right now. I will be furious if they let him walk
Honestly cannot see him leaving, I can see him taking time off to heal though.
Give the man his title run in front of a crowd and his money. He's deserved it, I'd say the best face WWE Champ in a very long time.
Don’t blame him, guy carried the company during the pandemic and the second golden boy was willing to come back they threw him to the side.
I mean I do remember this sub going ballistic over the fact that “AEW is really gonna sign Kevin Steen and El Generico”, and then they didn’t. This sub also went “no way Cody wrestling without a contract is for real, gotta be a work. Oh he’s leaving? Nah he’ll be back to book ROH.” Basically it’s best to not jump to conclusions, sit back, and wait to see.  It’d really suck if he left before getting his moment with the world title in front of fans though.
I get it, the guy's biggest match with his biggest win is on the event that is not likely to be watched again.
Came back, proved himself, won the title and main evented mania in a borderline squash against lesnar, beats Goldberg (kicks out of jackhammer too), dips.   Chad
They would be stupid to not keep him and if he leaves he would be able to go anywhere and do fine.
At this juncture, only Roman and Brock are irreplaceable given the buyout.
It sounds like he is correctly trying to get best contract possible out of WWE
I swear to god they better not let Drew leave.
I wanna see him in NJPW. The thought of Drew vs Shingo
Mcintyre in the G1 Tournament please.
SPLIT. THE. BELTS.
Even If Drew went to AEW... how he fits? AEW roster seems too stacked right now.
I think his contract is just coming up at a really good time. Wwe will have merger money to spend and AEW will probably get a new tv deal in the not so distant future. Makes sense he’s not rushing to extend the deal.
I feel like there is something else going on, because he’s been booked extraordinarily well since his return through pretty much everything. I think he’s just negotiating for a bigger contract like everyone does
I know a lot of people have title dreams, but I don’t see titles singling back and forth on a PLE basis until Roman and Bianca loses.  Shit were due for a title change on a regular show.
Realistically, is he going to go to AEW and get a huge response the first night and then get lost in the sauce?
I totally get why he would be unhappy with creative but I don't see what else he can do while Roman is the unified champion. Unfortunately that puts a lot of very talented men in a holding pattern.  Have him beat Theory for the US title after the draft.
When does the deal finish? If it's July or earlier, that's a perfect setup for All In.
Man if AEW could’ve potentially had him for All In in Wembley Stadium that would’ve been mental
I think Drew would be good for AeW, and AeW would also be good for Drew.
Would be sad if he left without having his big moment in front of actual live fans (and not screens or [a literal ceiling fan](https://images.app.goo.gl/xKvme2rT1AWSbmNc7))
Perhaps he wants to do a show at Wembley
I think they be crazy to let him leave to be fair. As even rumours of WWE letting talent go is true, Drew was always one of those talents I'd have in safe column. But he's someone who'll find work easy enough if he did leave.   Great talent, especially during his 2nd run in WWE. Should be a much bigger deal in WWE then he has been in recent times but sometimes you need to take a backseat even as a main eventer.
Dude can go to AEW and be a world champion. Would LOVE to see it. But he may be fine with another WWE run if they pony up more money.  Either way. WTF?
Drew is exactly what AEW needs, a Champion Caliber Babyface, and of the same token, Brian Cage is exactly what WWE needs, a monster who can be built up to take down Roman Reigns.
He's been working banged up and injured for a long time now so I assumed that he was doing that purposely just so they wouldn't add more dates to his contract if he were to go and recover.
Tony can stick him on an ROH taping. 1:00 AM after a dynamite, a rampage, and a dark film.
So Drew Galloway vs. Kenny Omega at Wembley Stadium, eh?   (Yes, I know, I'm getting way ahead of myself)
Imagine if his deal runs out and then he debuts at All In at Wembly
All Elite Drew at Wembley ok?
They brought him in as a main eventer, they're using him in the mid card. They probably want his new contract to reflect that
Lol at people saying AEW doesn’t have room for Drew. He would immediately become a huge star for their brand. Way more credible than someone like Adam Cole.
Don't look back in anger...
Man if they have a chance at getting Drew I honestly think they should hand him the blank check. I don't care who on your roster you piss off I'm talking literally highest paid in the company is worth it. I hope that Drew legitimately tests the free agency because I hold Drew to be in the same tier as guys like Okada or Roman where you just build your entire company around them.
I mean the past 16 months Drew had feuds with Madcap Moss & Happy Corbin which was his mania match last year, wasted time in a feud with Cross where Scarlette was more of a nuisance and an inconsistent storyline with the Bloodline on and off. Drew absolutely wasn't used to the best of his ability in the last calendar year.
Endeavor about to let lots walk, just look at UFC and how they’ve handled contracts.
Ok humoring the possibility of him leaving. I know immediately AEW is the one people will assume he returns to but what if New Japan? He would fit perfectly there.
Part of the problem with a universal title on someone that you book to never lose. All your other main eventers flounder around if they are not currently booked to lose to roman.
Ngl, Galloway in Japan sounds fuckin dope.
what is andrew mick tire doing in the AEW zone
If this is true, I can understand why a lot of guys are frustrated. The main event scene has been all but stunted with Roman holding two world titles. That’s not Roman’s fault, he doesn’t control his booking, but all the guys who really stepped up to guide WWE through the pandemic and whatnot have been shoved to the back burner and sitting in a holding pattern. Drew, Lashley, Seth Rollins; they’re just hanging out because they’ve outgrown the midcard titles and there’s nothing for them to compete for. I’m not a Drew fan, but he’s definitely a valuable asset to WWE, so I’m hoping they work something out.
Drew only got better last time he left.
Drew is Exhibit A at the stupidity of combing the belts
If Drew Galloway is available by the time All In happens in London....  &#x200B;  Fantasy bookers where you at?
McIntyre: I’m leaving and….  *McIntyre eyes a flash drive*  HHH: No…no….Please. I’m sorry we didn’t use it more often!  McIntyre: And I’m taking “Broken Dreams” with me!
People forget Drew ran “the Cody playbook” almost as successfully as Cody.   He’s not scared of life outside WWE.   Galloway Vs Okada at the Tokyo Dome.   LFG.
They would have to be genuinely insane to let Drew McIntyre walk. That would be nothing short of an absolute balls-up if they let that happen and just let his contract elapse. Drew could walk into any company and be the top guy from day one, it'd be a huge shame to see it. But in the modern WWE, we've seen guys like Moxley, Bryan, Cole, and many more all leave at the end of their contract and take chances elsewhere.
Do you really think that Drew McIntyre is unhappy in the WWE or do you think that Drew is doing this to get a good deal on his contract?
Solid worker but Drew leaving won’t really hurt the roster. Makes room for some younger talent to come up. I like Drew but I never really find myself rooting for him. In the triple threat at mania I was hoping Sheamus would win, then Gunter. Didn’t want Drew winning it.
He had a good Impact and NXT run.
With their current model just about nobody is irreplaceable.
allow me to introduce you to the new owners of wwe..
Again!
Endeavor doesn't give a fuck they'll bleed them out
IS insane. He's made of gumption. And money.
I'm not a huge D-Mac fan but absolutely see his value....but from a realpolitik stance this is probably the best time to let him go. I think his body is JUST about on the cusp of falling apart and he's obviously on a fuck-ton of PEDs and those have a price to pay.  &#x200B;  Yet again, WWE has the money, pay your people, yadda yadda, but if they want to have a hardline position about this (and ergo don't feel backed into paying like...Jey Uso and Sheamus a ton as well) I think you can send Drew on his merry way.  &#x200B;  "Creative" means Drew wants a belt, and he's low on my belting priorities especially considering that Bron should be on the main-roster yesterday being a physical badass face/heel (whatever he is right now).
They've completely wasted him ever since losing to Reigns at Clash at the Castle.  Put him in an awful forgettable feud with Karrion Kross (lol), and his Mania run with Sheamus was used to put Gunther further over.  I wanted to see him back in the Universal title picture...
Him against Okada would be a war.
YES, I know Jonah was paying the Vader role in the G1 but Drew is that taken up ten levels. A monster unlike they've seen in decades tbh especially with his size and physique and his style of wrestling.
Drew would be perfect for Japan.  I kinda view him the same as Hangman page.  Has the look and all the skills to be a megastar, just missing that final 10% of 'it factor' to really be a face of the company type guy.  A little more Lex Luger/Sid than hulk Hogan. Still pretty awesome
Good point. I'm also a big AEW nerd and there are some guys I'd rather see at Forbidden Door than Dynamite, you know? Drew's one of them.   Him doing a year-long megarun in NJPW could be a lot of fun.
This is kinda my thought too as a AEW/NJPW mark.  He would be a star in AEW for sure, but he would be THE gaijin in New Japan, would basically overnight be the top of the card. I'm not sure if they have the money to afford him though. I'm guessing he will command a serious contract from anywhere he signs.
Super agree. With Jay leaving NJPW needs another top level Gajin besides Will & I don't think Finlay is anywhwhere near Drew in talent but it looks as if hes getting a shot. Drew vs Shingo would go so hard
Damn. Yes. Please let you be some kind of clairvoyant.
Zero chance Tony doesn't pay well above asking price to nab what would be very easily the biggest star outside WWE  Letting Drew walk would be an absurd move for WWE to make
Does he take over the Bullet Club?
He'd do great, but the schedule for AEW seems much better. Especially if your family lives in the U.S.
I’d think he’d be a megastar in Japan but they won’t pay him anywhere near what AEW or WWE would
Probably smart for both of them. Who knows what's going to happen once the dust settles on the merger.
So the earliest we’d see a potential Galloway return would be Summer 2024?
Bummer, would’ve been cool to see him at Wembley
This is one of those situations where I'm really eager to see what happens. I feel like a deal can be made here, because WWE losing him when they already lost a whole lot of big players would be insanely stupid.  This is one of those times where putting both world titles on Roman looks stupider and stupider by the day. If the titles were split, you could easily have Drew run the show on the other brand with one world title and finally get that title win and title reign in front of an actual live crowd. If he never gets that in the WWE, then they've fucked it up.
He has one bit of story left however. He's won the world title, he's won the main event of Wrestlemania too. But twice he's been robbed of getting that main event win in a stadium. First with the pandemic forcing his main event into a no fans show, and again at Clash with Reigns cheating to win.   Its similar to Naito in a way in that Naito's been robbed of doing his roll call at the Dome, and its the last thing he needs.   I do really want to see Drew fulfill his broken dream.
Feel bad both his reigns came in front of no one. Dude was welcoming people to raw with 0 fans in attendance. Really stinks.
I don't know. I can't imagine he doesn't want a world title run in front of a crowd.
Wrestlers will always strive for the top spot, We have seen it time and time again but people act like everyone is fine to be playing supporting roles to Roman.
Maybe the Clash at the Castle thing really bothered him more than we know.
People said that first sentence when Dean Ambrose gave his notice.
I don't see anything as impossible after Sasha and Naomi walked out and now are no longer part of the company. I feel like anyone can leave if they're not happy no matter how much they're featured
It's shocking he has a WrestleMania main event win that might as well have never happened.
He can still feel unhappy despite that stuff if it isn’t what he wants
That's exactly why I *can* see him walking.  He knows he can have success outside of WWE.  He'd be a top star anywhere else in the world.
It literally says in the title that the issue is money lmfao
I would be very surprised if he left WWE. I feel like with AEW being a thing and picking up momentum again there will be quite a few people 'unhappy with their situation' when their WWE contract is due to end, but suddenly very happy with their situation after being offered more money.
Shouldn't they save Gunther's loss for somebody that hasn't been "made" yet?
I would rather he win the US title so he can complete the grand slam
I mean I would enjoy if they had WrestleMania 40 be Drew walking in as champion vs Sheamus. Why I think there's a strong chance Gunther walks in to 40 as IC Champ again. He'd be perfectly fine to have the match against Lesnar there.
Excuse me? He’s been the top face up until cody debuted.
If they split those titles, then it's either Drew or Seth holding the other title and it's not even close. Have those two battle over the vacant title and we're golden!
This reminds me a lot of the Daniel Bryan situation. Everybody said no way he leaves and look what happened.
You must not be a UFC fan. Drew is exactly the type of guy Endeavor is going to offer a lowball contract. He’s gone.
If Endeavor runs WWE like they do UFC, Drew is the exact type of guy who is going to get a lowball contract offer.
Also thought Jay was a lock to WWE and ambrose would be back. Goes both ways.
They got 9 months left. Everyone here has a lot of time to consider.
This is what needs to happen. There is no sense in 1 person and team holding all the damn belts hostage.
Right at the top what else. They are some talent where you can ask where they fit, Drew's only flaw in my opinion is he wrestles in the same company Roman is in so he's never going to get the mega push he deserves.
His tv time wont be as much there. Get his money regardless
He'd bump a current title contender/main eventer from their spot lmfao  I don't think AEW fans realize how big a former WWE World Champion would be in AEW. There's a reason Moxley and Danielson have never really strayed from the Main Event
I'd love to see him in AEW but I feel like there're a few other guys who should get a world title run before him & being on top feels like it would be a big impetus for jumping ship.
Drew is a Jay White level star, they’ll make room for him
Give me a New Japan run first and foremost. Need my Galloway v Ishii match and a bunch of others.
Which Drew level talent in AEW has gotten “lost in the sauce”? It’s usually mid-cards acts that get kind of lost from time to time.   All the top guys which most see Drew as are still big players on the show: Omega, Hangman, Bryan, Mox, MJF, Cole, Jericho, etc.
... was Danielson lost in the sauce?  Moxley?  None of the wrestlers lost in the sauce at AEW were former WWE World Champions
Unifying those titles was a big mistake
Rumored to be 9 more months. Dave also said no chance he shows up for All In since he'll still be under contract with WWE.
IIRC, he's got nine months or so.
If he leaves AEW needs to back the fucking brinks truck up right into his driveway.
Wouldn’t work that easily.
I really dont see him being world champ in AEW at all tbh
Cage would get lost in shuffle pretty quickly in WWE IMO. I could see him wrestling Roman on a minor show. After he'd probably get relegated to the bottom of the card & or get a silly gimmick.
I honestly don't know where Drew would go if he left WWE. He'd get lost in the shuffle pretty quickly in AEW but I don't exactly see him as a Ring of Honor or New Japan guy.  At this rate I'd prefer if he'd take a hiatus because that man has been getting fucked up like Kenny was before Full Gear for months now.
Brian Cage just joined up with Swerve Strickland and attacked Darby Allin about an hour ago. I don’t think he’s going anywhee
Brian Cage has about the same chance of beating Roman as I do.
Sorry, but I don’t see WWE signing a 39yr old Brian Cage to build and take down Roman Reigns let alone be the face of the company. Buddy can’t even make it onto AEW programming on a weekly basis.
Brian Cage isn't that tall, his monsterness would lose it's luster fast.
Bryan Cage is Mason Ryan with a mohawk.
What about clash of the castle and the aftermath from.that.
He never worked in AEW did he? We poached him from Impact with the hardy boys lashley and Aj
I'm hoping with MITB this year we get a rational holder who can snipe the WWE belt off of Roman. Let him ride the Universal title as long as possible, but get the other belt back into play.
NXT call ups may also play a role. For the money spent on a contract for Drew they could easily give main roster contracts to Bron and the Creed Brothers, for example. Ideally you’ll want (and can afford) to have those four guys but the way WWE runs, and specially after the sale, that’s not what they’re going to do
call up bron or melo to  fill in the upper middle card role and get them to face roman reigns
Imagine Drew running roughshod through the G1, killing everyone, and Okada having to think about facing that beast for the next four months until Wrestle Kingdom.
You could immediately insert him as the leader of Bullet Club.  He'd also help AEW sell those crucial Wembley tickets.
If his contract expires there is no non-compete.
Why? So he can lose to Orange Casidy of all people
> Its similar to Naito in a way in that Naito's been robbed of doing his roll call at the Dome, and its the last thing he needs.   At the rate that the LIJ are going, by the time he gets that chance, the only people to call on will be Hiromu and Bushi
Hmm. I know of a Stadium show late this summer he might be interested in, if that’s all it is….
If there are plans to give drew a world title run in front of a crowd, they better pay him main event money, and reportedly they're currently far apart in money. I don't see why you wouldn't pay him if you plan to keep him as a main event level guy - KO and Sami got paid. Obviously, the new ownership complicates things.
Yea, they have a serious glass ceiling problem. Bust your ass, get mad heat, rise to the top of the card, and your reward is looking good in a screwy finish loss to Roman. They are terrified to pull the trigger on anyone else in a meaningful way. The most ambitious guys like Bryan, Moxley, and Punk saw the writing on the wall. I know they had other reasons to leave, but I think they also saw the bigger picture. You can only be 1B in that company. 1A is not in play. And it's not by merit. It has just been ordained that way.
What happened
No kidding. I thought he'd be a WWE lifer there too.
I'd say with Moxley it's a little different, he wasn't given anywhere near as much as Drew was. In fact, Moxley should've been given a lot more but he constantly had his wings cut from underneath him because Roman was always the focus and Moxley was never seen as 'that guy' by the people up top.  - His feud with Seth Rollins in 2014 never really ended because Bray Wyatt just came in and said fuck that shit  - His feud with Bray Wyatt was cursed as all hell and Moxley straight up lost a match due to an exploding television  - Moxley was hot as hell in the 2016 Royal Rumble and fans wanted nothing but for him to win the world title but nope  - He was hot as hell for the match with Triple H but lost that.  - Though he was granted a match with Brock Lesnar at WrestleMania 32. Where Brock Lesnar proceeded to do absolutely jackshit with him and vetoed everything Moxley suggested.  - He had a great run in the rest of 2016 though thankfully! But after that, man it just got weird  Comparatively, Drew came in and won the NXT Championship, moved up to the main roster fast, won the tag titles with Ziggler, was paired in a stable with Braun and Bobby, got Roman Reigns' return match from his cancer diagnosis, won the Royal Rumble, defeated Brock Lesnar clean, had one hell of a title run, had Clash in the Castle built around him, got to participate in the first WarGames on a WWE show (not counting NXT), huge match with Sheamus and Gunther at Mania 39, etc.  I will say this though, if Moxley, Bryan, Cole, Jericho, Sasha, and Naomi all managed to walk away from what would be a lifetime role for them, then anybody can. It's never a guarantee that people will stay in that one place. Hell, I would say the same for AEW as well, you just never know what could change. We already saw Cody walk last year and that was the first real big one.
Saw this comment and it blew my mind how often I forget that happened. A huge moment in recent WWE was so overshadowed by all the insanity of last year.
Not necessarily. And Drew never got that big title in in front of a crowd. He’s not the only good name to dethrone Gunther, but he’s a good option.
I say no because how often the biz as a whole, and WWE especially since like 2015 at a ridiculous rate whiff on should-be huge stars. The miss rate is extremely high.   It's why I defend Brock ending the streak, HBK retiring Flair, etc... you do big things with people you know you can get that rub out of, not using them as launching pads for the next dude to wind up like Alberto Del Rio or Jack Swagger.
Unless it's like Bron Breaker being called up I don't think so. Losing to a former WWE champ makes it easier for Gunther to move up to the main event picture than losing to someone not made. Cause it keeps Gunther looking strong whereas someone not made makes him look more vulnerable
Yeah I feel like it could go to Sheamus and I'd be okay with that but he's done everything in WWE.   Somebody else that needs the win to conquer one of the best. That's a way to start a career. Like a Sami Zayn type of Babyface.
This is GUNTHER's first run on the main roster, it's probably best for him to lose it to an established world champ level guy like drew so he could transition straight into that level. imo let McIntyre make the future star since he is much more established at the moment and a loss to someone who isn't made would hurt him way less but a win against him is still pretty big.
Oh shit, Drew hasn't actually won that title has he? Fuck it, move him over to RAW and have him take that from Theory (when he's ready) and have him carry the goddamn show and elevate that title just as Gunther has with the Intercontinental Championship. It could be so fucking easy here to keep him signed and interested in wanting to stay.
Yeah I'm curious what happens when the first big contract comes due after the merger. That's going to be really interesting..
Yeah, not really a big UFC fan. I hope not, dude deserves some big money.
I'm not a UFC fan. Why do you think this is the case?
“Jay White’s gonna debut on the Raw after Mania, or maybe even Mania itself, and will align with the OC”. “No way they’d announce Dean leaving this far in advance. This is definitely for a storyline, and maybe it’ll lead to another Shield Triple Threat, this time even bigger.”  It does indeed go like that all around. Anything can happen.
That's the problem IMO. Drew is a top star, but AEW already has Omega, Hangman, Moxley, MJF, Adam Cole, Danielson, CM Punk who are all main eventers. Jay White will likely join this tier.   Then you have Swerve and Starks who are being built to join that level. You still got Keith Lee and Malakai Black who could potentially reach that level. AEW is so stacked right now, I suppose even Drew could join the 'not used enough WWE guy' trope.
That’s the problem, you’ll be catering to “ex-WWE guys” instead of your talent. Creates discourse.
Ohhh a G1 Tournament run???? That be sweet
That’s a lock. He’s gonna be a great addition to the main event scene.
I see it mainly as a negotiation tactic then anything. But I can imagine how bloody and brutal a Mox versus Drew angle would be.
Unfortunately you're probably right, now that the mustache of doom is the puppet master again
True, he has earned time off, which he should take, I think he'd be a star where ever he chose to go  Galloway vs. Suzuki would be deadly
This is a fucking hilarious comment lol
AEW didn't exist before he returned to WWE
Not enough money and TV time for everybody, and if Drew is upset about creative (i.e. winning stuff) then you probably want to wish him along. Too many guys deserve belts and I don't know if The Chosen One is on the list.
Neither of them are ready at all.
After I watched the triple threat I just want to see him slap all the meats everywhere.
You could definitely use him like that.  But I think he might work better as a face there. Japanese fans love a beefy hoss gaijin with a personality. It would not be hard to get the fans behind him in a hurry.
Debut him as Super Switchblade. Now bigger and Scottish.
Well, it’s obvious you don’t watch AEW. Sit this one out
I imagine he'll get paid. I think Drew McIntyre is a WrestleMania 41/42 World Championship match guy against Gunther.
He lost in the UK and then they had him smile and sing like a goof to end the show.  Idk it was just a thought, it's probably not 1 specific instance.
he lost to roman
He lost
Seeing Drew with the Intercontinental Championship again would be awesome, full circle moment. I hope Sheamus dethrones Gunther personally to get the Grand Slam but I wouldn't mind this either
"Mr. Kennedy is the next Steve Austin and should end Undertaker's streak." - every forum poster in the mid/late 2000s
Endeavor is very cheap, don’t pay top fighters shit. Google Francis Ngannou.
See I think that's where we differ I think Drew is a better top guy that every single guy you mentioned there. Maybe Starks or Swerve are guys who maybe have the potential to surpass him but as the guy who you send out to represent your brand I think Drew stands above him.  Also man taking Keith Lee over Drew is literally a crime as far as I'm concerned.
Is Drew really an ex-WWE guy? Drew McIntyre v1 was a skinny nerd. Drew Galloway reinvented himself and became a huge stud.   WWE's contribution to Drew's transformation was to give him a sword.
Maybe my opinion is to high on Drew but this is like if WWE randomly let Orton or Punk go during the height of TNA. Sure some people will be mad but like I said I don't think anybody in AEW is on the level of Drew. Some can wrestle better, some can promo better, none have a better look but especially nobody has it all like him.
Why because he lost? He got one of the biggest mayches in recent memory that should be a plus.
Yeah That's what I thought
You're forgetting how good a champion he was during 2020 and didn't ever get to have a crowd there for him. Ever since he lost to Bobby on Wrestlemania 37 Night 1, he's slid down the card harder than anyone. Even with Sheamus, he's only there to get Sheamo more over, which is good but he beat Brock for the belts with no shenanigans - he should be treated bigger than that.
I do and Orange Casidy doesn't do it for me
Wasn't him singing, something that wasn't actually planned by anyone? I thought I had read that he  said he wasn't told to do it,  he just didn't know what else to do so he joined in.  Maybe I'm missing remembering though.
But that was not supposed to air tho? So I don't think it was part of the show
It wasn't supposed to be shown on screen. WWE had a production error there.
Lol he did that himself, but sure how dare WWE
Honestly think Sheamus should of won last weekend. Would of opened Gunther up for new feuds in the upper card then we could of gotten a couple more Drew Sheamus matches for the title.
From what I know UFC hasn't paid fighters well *literally ever*, going back to the one-night tournament days. It might just be Endeavor allowing UFC management to do their thing.
Right, I've heard about UFC pay being shit. Is there anything about Drew specifically, or is it just bec he's a guy high up the card with a presumably fat contract?
I'm not taking Keith Lee above Drew. I'm just saying, these guys are already there with storylines going on and Khan already invested on them.   I don't think Drew is too big of a name to change the picking order in Khan's booking right now. That sounds absurd, right? Exactly, AEW roster is that crowed imo.   Adam Cole is being built as their next mega baby face. Jay White and Swerve as mega heels alongside MJF. That's why I mentioned them.  I didn't even mentioned the rest of the pillars who Khan surely want to be main eventers in the short term.
Yes, in the same sense that CM Punk is an ex-WWE guy that bleeds ROH.
That’s my problem though, he can easily slingshot to the top, unless you stick him in a program with Hobbs but that’s the TNT title.
Why does he deserve that over anybody else in particular? There's only so many belts and there are a number of people whose championship reigns make more narrative sense.  &#x200B;  He's not a bad guy for wanting a belt, but it would hurt WWE if Drew won a top title soon.
That nice, but also irrelevant to the discussion. Can you get me a list of all the wrestlers on Drew Galloway’s level that Orange Cassidy has defeated?
It did though and made him look pretty bad.
You think he went off script and wasn't punished for it?
I wanted to see Sheamus win too, but I understand if they want Gunther to break the Intercontinental Championship record. Hopefully Drew vs Sheamus for the title can still be a reality later this year
That's exactly what it is. Endeavor let Dana White and the UFC do what they want.
Even Keith Hackney?
Just not gonna paid what he deserves. Roman and Brock will, maybe a few others, but that’s likely it.
If let's' say for a hypothetical Roman Reigns left WWE tomorrow and for some unknown reason decided he wanted to be a fulltime wrestler still. What do you do if your AEW? If you ask me it's wipe your ass with any of your plans of the future and give him whatever it takes to show up on Dynamite the next night.   While Drew McIntyre isn't quite on that level, I think he's a guy who merits the same exemption to the rules. In Drew your getting somebody who's main evented WM while still in his prime. A great wrestler, promo, and probably has the best look of a pro wrestler in the modern day (or atleast top five ish). And unlike CM Punk or Bryan, your getting a guy who actually does media and even better is really good at it. All while being a 6 foot 5 mountain of muscle.   Plus even since Cody left AEW's dying for somebody to be the face of their company and being honest Tony is definitely not it. So if your best hope is that Jade becomes a Sasha/Charlotte level talent overnight, maybe that Drew option looks very appealing.
you dont know what drew is feeling lmfao
Dude, company wouldn't be hurt with Drew as a champion. He's an excellent wrestler with an excellent look and is a great talker. He should be at a Seth-like level of 'always important' because he has everything to be a stable of the main event scene.
Yes but it was not planned to be shown on TV but meant for the live crowd, that's the difference. This is why I always ignore that part and don't think of it too deeply.
Wrestlers do unscripted stuff like that after shows literally all the time.  It just normally doesn't air.  He thought the PPV had already ended.
Yes.
He was doomed as soon as Vince gave him that sword. Makes him a character instead of a human. It’s stuff from the 80s and it was stupid back then. Like what’s he going to do with the sword? Act like he will stab someone or is it like He man or Thor type. Reigns looks like Aquaman so maybe he should carry a trident to the ring.
Well I can see Drew being pissed that the segment aired, and maybe that is one of the reasons he's less driven to renew his contract at the moment, especially if production tried to justify it to him rather than apologise (this is pure conjecture though).
Yea, Cody ran around with banana on his head, he wouldn't do that on air.
That sounds like the least parsimonious explanation for that cluster of a segment but okay.
Sauing  Ideally We’ll Separate The World Titles And Get Them Back On Their Respective Shows" dosent mean hes un happy
It was reported at the time because everyone was confused about what the fuck that ending was.  Unrelated, but do you work in a field where the word parsimonious comes up often? Because I was an English major and I had to look that one up. Cool word.
Haha yes. I'm a wildlife biologist, we use statistical modelling a lot, and we're told to use the most accurate, but also the most parsimonious models to explain relations and trends.
>you can either read between the lines  Id rather not make wild speculations

RIP Cutler and Nakazawa 🫡
Moment of silence for Landon and Nak.  https://preview.redd.it/j98umhr3jmsa1.jpeg?width=748&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ecf5ec1e32c89e57c1057c46365a605884b9e350
So basically Tony Khan booked 4 possible murders in three matches on Dynamite next week. Cool.
the buddy vs orange match is intriguing. wonder if they’re gonna put the title on matthews.
BCC kill Cutler/Nakazawa and don't stop after the bell Kenny comes out...  Get beaten down... Hanger comes out...  Gets beaten down... Ibushi saves the day and the golden lovers embrace?   Make it so Tony!
Also with Jericho/Lee. That's a strong card for Wednesday.  Poor Stooges are going to be slaughtered.
Am I really gonna have to see Swerve and Keith Lee lose in the same night?
You can't big swing a man covered in oil. A sure fire win for Nakazawa and I choose not to believe otherwise even if there is another man in the ring trying to kill him!
Bro you can't really be putting the Stooges against BCC rn lmao
Oh my god Cutler and Nakazawa are some hardcore dudes, I don’t think Moxley’s got enough blood to hang
This card. So stacked. AEW firing all cylinders now.   Elite vs BCC - storyline can't wait for punished Hangman  Swerve vs Darby is intriguing.  Orange vs Matthews is even more intriguing. I can see the House of Black starting a domination over AEW titles.
Cutler and Nak vs BCC is the equivalent of having your level 1 starting character go straight to the final boss in Elden Ring.
Buddy should 100% win it on Wednesday
OCs been narrowly avoiding defeat the past few defenses. Someone’s gonna beat him emphatically. Feel like it could be buddy
Well, at least Strickland and Matthews are gonna lose.
Good lord.
Glad to see a Buddy singles match
Perhaps if Nak lines the ramp with Turkish oil the BCC will slip and injure themselves.  It's their only shot at evading death.  Edit: Never mind, I just remembered they don't use the ramp, RIP Cutlerzawa.
buddy in a single match   hell yes
Yeah, Cutler & Nakazawa are gonna breeze through that one
Cold War vs Cold Spray
Cutler and Nakazawa are gonna go nuclear on those carny mudshow bleeders
SOMEBODY STOP THEM! YB DO SOMETHING!
Tony Khan is stern, stern but fair
To be fair, one of those Is Darby and it will be more of a self inflicted murder than anything
Buddy as International Champ, Brody as TNT Champ, Julia as Women’s Champ, Malakai as World Champ. Then they beat everybody. Book it.
I really doubt it, but they will put on a great match.
They probably will cost each others matches. Swerve will first do it to Lee and then later in the night Lee will return the favor.
Punished Hangman? What do you mean?
I’d rather see it go to someone who doesn’t already have a title.  Plus HOB have two wins over Best Friends.  It’s time they get a W in this feud.
Counterpoint: Malakai
We just separated the International Title from the Trios belts when Orange won it, keep your goddamn pants on.
It's going to be Malakai at Double or Nothing.
Now I want to see AEW do the Gumball 3000 rally one year
Yes please.
Then Miro returns and wins each belt from all of them. Finally some creative he would accept.
Julia as TBS champ sounds better. Leave the women’s belt for the others for now I think will be better.
It’s a reference to the video game protagonist Venom/Punished Snake from Metal Gear Solid V who wears an eye patch and is… beaten down to say the least.
Ooooh. I thought maybe I had missed some backstage drama haha. Thank you!

Oh this could be really good. Theres a lot of interesting ways this could go. And everyone involved has a very unique kind of charisma.  Mark just thought he was gonna get some help on the chicken farm.
It would be perfect if he ends up turning the whole group babyface.
This... This could work...
Mark's reaction at the end made me laugh really hard.
Mark has the ability to turn them all into faces. I believe.
Calling it now- this leads to Mark getting a title shot for something, winning, but only after interference from the group and it not sitting well with him.
Arguably the best part is thinking about how Mark Briscoe somehow didn't see 7'4" Satnam Singh standing 3 inches off camera. DUDE IS 7'4" TALL, NOT LIKE HE'S HIDING BEHIND A MONITOR!
Something I really like about this is the real life aspect. Jay Lethal had a harder time during their match than Mark did. He can be with his friend for a while and offer some spectacular comedy to boot. Then, when they inevitably turn on Mark, the heat will be volcanic.  This...this is *perfect*!
Having never followed the Briscoes until recently, the more I see Mark the more I love him, he's so cool and funny. What's Jay like as a character?
Man I want Mark, Jay & JJ as Trios Champions
Turn them babyface. Have them work their way into a Trios Title match as he slowly teaches them to not cheat.  Have them JJ, Lethal & Mark win the Trios Title in 6 months. Could be some fun stuff there.
Really? I feel like JJs heat is extremely valuable.
I can’t speak for later in career, as I wasn’t following as closely.   His promo’s were the grit of the team. His words always had purpose. He could be funny, but more smoothly. If that makes sense.   Character wise, I mean, pretty no-nonsense. Want to fight you and win titles because that’s what is most important as a wrestler.
I'd really like a Satnam & Danhausen friendship to form.
There isn't really a shortage of low card heels, and I think it would be fun to transition the new found good will JJ has earned with hardcores into a goofy babyface run. I especially want to cheer Satnam, he's great.

enjoy the show. im going to bed soon so I can wake up to for Sakura.
Shino Suzuki's quite good given how inexperienced she is. A lot of potential there.
Nao & Mizuki's Korakuen match is gonna be a fucking banger.
Have this on in the background for the hijinks. They're down 6 people today so eh.
Nao might be the most underrated worker on TJPW's roster. Glad she's getting a big match, even though Mizuki's almost certainly retaining.
I don't think so. No harm in having one, though.

I didn't even see a stumble
what are we looking for?
Had to watch it a few times to actually catch it.
It's when Seth goes to go back to the center of the ramp from the right. You can see his gait hiccup a bit. Was so jacked for his match he almost passed out. [Easier to see here.](https://streamable.com/uiev3y)

I was waiting for Jr to say he’s got a bigger ass than Anna jay. Boom Boom
Somehow, Horny on Main JR returned.
I just have a flat ass and am happy to be here  &#x200B;  Put that on a shirt and it will be a best seller
This is hilarious and I’m a little pissed that this didn’t make it on air.
🤠 boom boom
Excalibur knew he had to step in before Jim carried on and came in with a great joke too 😂😂
Lmao
Excalibur with that Hank Hill ass.
"Her words, not mine....but also mine"
[Jungle Boy confirms](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E4_BpFrWYAAkRhh.jpg?name=small)
Do you know who hates fat asses though?    🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨
Flat-Asscalibur
I’ve never heard her say that before so I gasped when JR started saying it.
J.R and Tony go together so perfectly. Infuriates me that they won’t just go with Excalibur/Taz for one show and JR/Tony for the other. Bah.
Be carefull Jr it's 2023, some trolls will ruined your life because you repeat her words!
THIRTY MEN WILL ENTER
He never left lol.
It's so off putting
They are pretty wild in the Picture in Picture
MY ASS 🤠🤠
Pretty much, and it was a great save at that.  Also, it's okay Excal. Some people like William Regal love your flat ass.
Scott Steiner fears Anna Jay
It was in a promo she did recently. Want to say on Rampage last week?
It was directly before the match in the promo package.
Technically she said she had a fat ass, not a big ass though.
Wait...
It is, this one I'm glad Excalibur came in with a joke before Jim could start saying anything else
it got even worse in the Battle of the Belt TBS title match with Billie Starks 🤦‍♂️
It is impossible for him to not mention "beautiful" and "young" for every women's match.
Time to let JR retire to podcasting
Picture in picture jones over here.
They replayed it right before the match
Ah I haven’t watched yet. Just clicked on the clip because I was curious.
The smiling cowboy emoji after every inappropriate tweet makes me laugh every time
It's creepy when it's lads in their 20s I have no other word to describe it when it's someone JR's age
Let's not forget Riho, who he has to constantly remind us is "very small" and "only 98 pounds, folks!"
Hanging with Lawler for decades will do that to ya
But I digress

Fandango! At the packed Dungeon. is my favorite Panic! At the disco cover band.
Why did I think he retired
No OP. It's Fan-dan-goo.
Fuck I gotta make the drive from Reddeer for one of these shows
Watching PPV. First time watching Dungeon Wrestling. So glad Stampede is being revitalized. The Billington Bulldogs are a team to monitor.
It was a great time. Rowdy crowd
Is this at the pavilion? Look at those steps lol
How was it. Had a friend's event tonight and couldn't make it
"NO DOGS! Dogs are cool."
Did he say he was going to go to a local strip club? That’s what he said during a match at a local event I went to not too long ago.
I like the colored ropes. It reminds me of AEW which reminds me of WWF back in the 90s. How many people were there?
So he tweeted "I'll be stepping away from the ring in a couple months. Goodbye forever." He later clarified that the stepping away was due to needing surgery, and the goodbye forever was due to leaving Twitter. Not sure if clickbait or a dumb way to word it, but that's what happened
Bollywood Boyz should have won! How did it sound on ppv cause it was loud
Yup haha
Great fucking time
No idea how many exactly. I would say over 1000 for sure

She's been developing her entrance for months on Dark.
Interesting that she lip syncs her own theme. Can't think of anybody else who does that.   That is a hell of an entrance though.   JR sure does love calling heel women "Jezebel."
Julia Dark is so fucking cool
Always good to see the young talents getting something that lets them stand out in different ways with their entrances.   The Gunns on Dynamite and now Julia. Just adds that little extra.
HOUSE OF BLACK FOREVER AND A HUNDRED YEARS
Julia making me want to listen to Cradle of Filth's "Nymphetamine" album
i love how, when she got to the ring, the lighting and camera angle made it look like she was floating. great touch.
Awesome entrance. And I like her singing/lipsyncing along it
Great entrance. So happy to see her get such great presentation. Hope she can be built up as a solid force on the main women’s roster.
This is so cool! Imagine the whole crowd screaming "The House Always Wins" as well during this. Hope they keep building her up!
Fucking aces, love the lip syncing. Very mantra/trance demeanor.
Spooky Julia is up there amongst AEW's strongest character elevations of young talents to bigger roles. They've done a great job giving her a *presence*, and she's clearly stepped it up as far as her in-ring to match with her standing as an equal amongst the House of Black.  It's gonna be great when she eventually breaks into the women's division and starts becoming a legit title competitor there.
That theme is so good
Future TBS champ
I wish they had 1 or more of the guys accompany her for the match.
I'm on the Julia Hart bandwagon after that entrance and match. She really impressed me tonight!
the light coming back on to her on the rope almost looked like she was floating, so badass
Chilling
They got the presentation on point with Julia with this entrance. She's still got a bit to go in the ring (her match with Anna was ok for the level both are at) and she's someone should be on every house show AEW do and would like to see her go on excursion to Japan with this whole gimmick even without HOB guys around her, it would still be cool.
Easily one of the coolest intros I've seen in a bit that wasn't a one off like The Gunns and Hangman. It makes me want to see even more of Julia on screen.
I was Dark routinely, so I hadn't realized that for most people, this is their first time seeing Julia's "House Always Wins" entrance. She has improved dramatically on Dark the past few months.
What song is this?
Chilling
Her theme is a banger. Glad that we were able to hear it on actual TV finally.
Love it! Heel Julia has been really good
Damn, just when I thought I couldn’t like her anymore. She is killing it in this role! Push her to the moon!
First time I had seen her entrance. That was pretty badass
That was dope as shit
Her theme is so good. It’s great. Her escaping Brian Pillman Jr was the best thing for her. Hoping for Griff too.
God, and she is only 21, she’s going to be great
What a great entrance
Julia needs to learn to lay it in (safely) of course, but she's getting the character side of it.  So much improvement there.
Erect.
Only thing I don't like is the hat, makes her look like she is on her way to Coachella. The entrance is top notch and the theme song is a banger for sure.
Unreal.
Really fucking cool. She looks like a banshee or siren.
Entrance of a star.
She's been developing the entire presentation on Dark for a while now and the results can speak for themselves at this point, great showing IMO.   First Dynamite/Rampage tv appearance in almost exactly a year, with 21 Dark/Elevation matches in between. She feels like a completely new wrestler, in a good way.
Not all the time but Rhea does it for her entrance song aswell
She’s been doing that on elevation, I’m happy that carried over to TV, it’s clear they’ve been slowly working on her character bit by bit.
Scarlett always does it for Kross' entrance
I can think of one. https://media.tenor.com/swPgxzefRwgAAAAM/taichi-entrance.gif
Meltear in Stardom lip sync their entrances, as well
Austin Gunn lip synched for the new theme they have.
Julia Hart and Maki Itoh to tag together!
Asuka did sometimes with her old theme
&#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/px384ltcvmsa1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6d9e790040959005cab1872097e18c94e03cea2e
Bliss did it during her playground run
> Interesting that she lip syncs her own theme. Can't think of anybody else who does that.  Scarlett.
It’s the best kind of creepy
She sure doesn't look nearly as corny as Scarlet does
lol first thought i had was "oh she lip syncs her theme like scarlett"
Jrs commentary here is the one thing that drags this clip down.
helps you get more into the wrestler's reality. gets you a little bit more interested in the action. at least for me.
The best thing was getting her away from varsity athletes. That was a sinking ship
I've long since said AEW needs to put 200% more choreography into the talents' entrances and music. Not to mention better pyro.
![gif](giphy|Ow92RY3iSoa76)
can you imagine how she feels right now compared to when she was the butt of french baguette jokes?
She recently did a match on Dark and for the finish, she screamed out “THE HOUSE ALWAYS” and the crowd answered with “WINS”, she did a curtsy straight into a submission. It was fucking cool.
Hmmm. I have mixed feelings. I like the idea since it's so common to see women in factions accompany the guys just as eye candy basically, so it would be nice to see a switch. But until Julia is more established as an in-ring competitor I worry the guys would overshadow her.
I think I've seen them stand on the ramp a couple times on Dark/Elevation.
Same here. It would have been cool to see some of the poison mist on her face around her mouth after spraying it. The image of the poison mist spray coated around her mouth while she is standing on the ropes after she won and singing her theme would have been a great visual. Instead, the mist just coated her teeth a bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lrvTyqLzWg
Salvaged herself by distancing from Pillman and Jungle Man.
You take that back that man is gracing us with his beautiful voice.
He stopped syncing at the correct line lol
God that was such a sick entrance
she's done it a few times with the newer "shut up and fight me" song too
It was a random lower card act. It was what it was. Not every act is designed to become a top-of-the-card main event level thing. Sometimes things are designed to be one-note/basic and just get destroyed by the actual stars.
…..did I just come across an IT Crowd reference of all things?
That stretch of time on Dark was great. You had the Acclaimed as jobber heels but already over as fuck, the Gunn Club stacking jobbers like cordwood, and the Varsity Blondes gaining momentum. Now the Acclaimed are one of the most popular acts in wrestling, and both the Gunns and Acclaimed were tag champs. The Blondes just never broke out for several reasons, but Julia saved herself from be being a Dark jobber by changing her gimmick and basically willing herself into the HoB and has a 21 match win streak.
Can I get a link, brother? or the date at least, thank you.
Maybe so. But I like the idea of the faction being together and present with each other. Maybe just have them for the entrance
thank you
Who the fuck is Griff Garrison!?
I totally thought that she was gonna say it lol
This is what I LOVED after Anna Jay originally joined Dark Order. For most matches for Dark Order members a few others would accompany them to the ramp, but when Anna Jay wrestled she had the entire Dark Order including Brodie on the ramp the entire match. It was such a a cool visual
The entrance would be incredible if they focus on Julia and as she walks towards the ring you see Malakai sitting on the ramp flanked by Brody and Buddy in the background and they just stay there for the match.
HOB could walk out with her then disappear during the blackout

I think Darby took more of that bump with his face than you'd hope.
![gif](giphy|12ey1CgA3uTqfK)
Average night for Darby
Starting to think Darby is nursing a concussion most of the time
Darby purposefully landed like that lol.
Darby wtf are you doing!
Fucking hell Darby's face bounced off the floor  That shit's gotta be a concussion
There's no way Darby could pass a physical lmao
Someone please tell me that his head did not bounce off the ground and he masterfully made it look that way.
holy fuck Darby
As God as my witness, he is broken in half
Darby is absolutely going to have a very short career where he regrets doing all the dumb shit like this week to week.
Cage 360’d Darby there
Darby needs to call upon Hakim The Machine for revenge.
If anything else he's upset he didn't have more face to land on
The concussion is nursing Darby at this point.
That's my secret, Sting....how did I get here?
Well he definitely got his hands down first but I don't know if they actually broke his fall enough.

It could have been saved for tonight, although it was made a bigger moment on Raw it would have been cooler having it as a surprise today. But probably Raw needed something that made it look like a Raw after Mania
They did have a dark match tonight. Although Jey caused the DQ and then Sami ran in with a steel chair for the next save.
I think that's the whole reason it was done. I'm thinking it was to make you wonder why, that night and all week, and then have the payoff tonight on smackdown.

Man, I love Prince Nana, but I’ll always wish he was yelling “JIMMY RAVE!”
I didn't mind Trench and Parker personally, but if they want Swerve to have a faction this is way better and probably a good move for Cage/Embassy too - gets them involved in a bigger story
I’m guessing last two guys are done for
I cant believe Parker was so fucking bad that they had to put the whole feud with Keith on ice just because Swerve tried to put his boy on lmao  This is much better, Kaun especially about to look like a god in this faction
Swerve/Darby should be a fucking great feud, and him being with wrestlers who can actually wrestle is nice too
The Tom Macdonald looking dude was so green they wouldn't put him in the ring, and Alibaba Lesnar was the absolute blandest dude alive. Cage did more for Swerve in 30 seconds than the previous goons did total.
Way better than the last 2 doofs
A guy like EJ Nduka fits so well with Swerve
An upgrade for Swerve.
Dig it. Good for both factions
This rules. The Gates of Agony have a ton of potential.
The last 2 guys just showed no progress
I've been waiting for some Swerve and Darby interaction. Didn't disappoint.  That f5 was nuts.
I'm just here for the Prince Nana and Swerve promos together. That's going to be entertaining as hell.
The two jacked meth goons he had with him with so laughably out of place, they need to be dropped immediately from the company because they are going nowhere.
Mogul Embassy?
Shrimp cocktails for everyone!
This is perfect, tbh. Swerve as the Crown Jewel of the Embassy feels right.  I just hope we get Rick Ross and Prince Nana on screen together at least once
This just seems like too much. Why can't Swerve just come to the ring himself or have 1 muscle? Why add the ROH faction onto AEW when you have been working so hard those separate for months?
So we've taken two bumass factions, and merged them into one gigantic bumass faction.
How many random stables do we have here in AEW that they’re merging? Sorry, but Swerve would’ve been better running solo. The attempt to give him a group cooled him off so much after the Keith Lee breakup. Should’ve just had him rack up wins before Lee came back.
Parker needs work at every level, but the potential is definitely there. I hope he gets the chance to reach that potential.
I liked Parker and Trench and am unhappy with this development.
Damn man
this is good. I'll believe parker and treach or whatever can get over when I see it.
Pretty sure Trench and Parker are injured
FLAMMABLE TO THE EYES
I honestly didn’t mind them when they weren’t wrestling, letting Parker have matches was not a good idea.
They were cinderblocks on swerves ankles
Kaun needs to be getting private training/coaching to perfect his act if TK is smart because he has everything look wise to be a billion dollar megastar. It’s all about developing him correctly, he has the intangible WWE guys always talk about where you’ll stop seeing him in an airport because he just *looks like he’s someone*
Only issue is Darby should be focusing on MJF & the AEW World Championship.
*Rick sees Brian Cage* "Yous a big muhfucker, isn't you!"
How many chances does this guy need? He’s flopped multiple times already and shown zero progress.
Bro Parker couldn’t even do non match beatdowns right
I thought the Tom McDonald guy was cool
for sure. He's a good worker right now, never heard him talk. But if he develops those skills he has no ceiling because he looks like a guy who should carry a world title
The airport thing is horseshit.
You aren’t wrong but it’s still two months out and I don’t mind the idea of Darby going into that match having had to take the toughest road
Eh it’s okay to have a side quest. We’re still over a month and a half away from DON.
He is. Do you watch the show???
I think he is. But he's got to have a winning fued to go up the rankings and earn a shot ...   I miss the rankings.
Swerve where you keep finding these big mutherfuckers?
Parker's problem was he was spamming taunts *DURING*  moves
*Rolls shoulders aggressively, clenches fists, grinds teeth*
I do? That’s exactly my point. He’s currently in a four way feud with the pillars for the title, and now he’s gonna feud with Swerve & the Embassy. Which is fine, I guess, but IMO, Swerve/Darby is big enough to be a standalone feud instead of a side quest for Darby.
They were just fucking weird too. Everything he did was like he was trying to parody pro wrestling
Dumb for Swerve to neither looks good taking a loss cause Swerve has to fight Keith

I hope MJF comments, saying something to the effect that he was out for a drive
Ahh, so a normal day for Darby, then.
Sue?
Surely they have to be trolling? No way that happens and no one hears anything about it
"Hit a homeless person, no big deal"
Pretty normal day for anyone skateboarding in NYC.
Darby doesn’t seem like the type to seek litigation. But what if it was Trent’s mom
It's probably something more akin to "car just barely couldn't brake in time and Darby got banged up from the fall" than "literally ran over by a car."
Seriously,  odds are atleast one a day if the weather is decent

Whenever old wrestlers come back for 1 night they seem to completely destroy everybody without any effort, so I'm gonna say they got worse in kayfabe.
Based on the fact that wrestlers from the 90s and 00s come back and beat the current guys ima say it's the opposite
Hulkamania is gonna run wild on all these flippy spot monkeys brotherrrrrrr
I like to think in kayfabe terms, younger wrestlers train to defend themselves against certain moves better… which is why moves that were finishers 20-30 years ago like cutters and DDTs and piledrivers now result in 2 counts.
Brock Lesnar broke the Streak and was defeated by 50-year-old Goldberg in 90 seconds.
I think it’s the rare occasion where it’s the opposite actually. Legends always come back to squash current talent and are seen as better.
Not at all. They really do almost position it as “listen to your elders, you stupid kids”
Maybe it you go back 50 years, but if you go back 25 and theyd get cream'd BALCO era was a blast
They sure do a lot of flips. They love to take high risks but are those really advantageous in a pro wrestling fight. I can't see Ricochet or Gargano stand a chance against Goldberg or Triple H for example.
No. Stone Cold hadn’t wrestled in decades and still beat Kevin Owens. Trish and Lita can come out of retirement and beat a trio of full-time wrestlers.
Maybe sometimes?   Considering all of the successful multigenerational talent on any given roster, there are a lot of kayfabe examples of them being better just because they grew up in the business.  At the same time, there are so many wrestlers that grew up as fans and trained all their lives to be WWE/AEW Champion. It's why the announcers or video packages highlight this.
I think to some degree.   But it's more of a far different style than it was way back when. It the early days, it was two strong guys trying to out maneuver one another with strength and skill.  That was all, like North America, knew for decades. But, now that we live in a fully connected world, we've learned about all the other styles.  Puroresu from Japan, Lucha Libre from Mexico, Catch-As-Catch-Can style of the UK, and so on.  All those styles have merged to a degree, so wrestlers can be all shapes and sizes, as there are more than just basic grapples as offense.   In 1963, someone like Darby Allen would be laughed out of the building, as soon as he appeared through the curtain. But, today, he's a top tier attraction.   So, to answer your question, I don't think wrestlers got *BETTER* over time, as they simply *EVOLVED* over time.
Idk remember when Jericho beat three older wrestlers in one night. Forget the ppv though.
In kayfabe, they’ve gotten significantly worse. Anyone from 30 years ago shows up, they’re getting trounced. Maybe two or three of them get beaten up.
Goldberg has won like 3 world titles in the last ten years, NOAH had people close to 60 having runs with their heavyweight title. So kayfabe wise I'm going to say no.  I guess u could argue title reigns being shorter these days means the competition is better.
Yes. It would also explain why matches are so competitive, take so long, and feature tons of kickouts. It's the weaklings fighting weaklings.
Yeah Goldberg hadn’t wrestled in about a decade when he came back and he demolished Brock in about 2 minutes. Kayfabe power just builds up over time it appears.
I think in kayfabe its more that you have one guy that is a specialist with a move, other people then copy them but aren't as capable with the move.  Jake the Snake with the DDT is the best example. He could put you down with the DDT - but others can't do it as well as him, so it only results in 2 counts for all the people that have copied him afterwards.
Wrestlemania 2009  To be fair, no smokes or mirrors could hide how geriatric Snuka had become or how out of shape Piper was. Steamboat at least had a high enough power level to hang with 38-year old Jericho.

How can a man be covered in so much clothes but still look naked
My stream crashed right after Jey stopped Solo, and I thought I missed a humongous moment I was so heated 😂
Get some longer trunks please Matt. When you take off that jacket, you look so oddly naked.
Pair the jacket with those tiny-ass trunks and it looks like Riddles Porky Piggin it.
man....no matter what the IWC says, the live crowd still loves Jey/Sami drama
Everyone here is worried about his ring gear, nobody is talking about how fucking smooth that single leg slide through on Jey was. Literally so smooth Alex Hornold couldn't get a grip.
I've said it before, but it bares repeating.  Chekhov's Riddle
Jey has a beautiful physique
Loving the slow tease for Jey. Crowd will go apeshit when it happens.
I think it’s more intriguing to have Jey and Sami have a relationship thats forever tainted because Jey broke Sami’s trust. Like when Jey finally snaps at Roman and gets a match against him, and he gets all the support from the babyfaces or whoever. Sami Zayn is the only odd one out and he’s like “I tried to help you, but no matter what you do, you betrayed me. At this point you’re nothing to me”
Sigh  At least Riddle is wearing more clothing now
I'm just happy Riddle is back regardless of his in ring gear.
I'm so curious how they're gonna make this all work out. A bit worried they're gonna over-rely on the same things they've done. Like they can't keep pulling the Jey betrayal thing, because you risk making him unsympathetic and/or making Sami seem like a dweeb for falling for it repeatedly.
They should have made it solo and sami if we were going to bring him back. Ruining our jey story capital on this weird run in
Jey's part of the story makes less sense as time has gone on since the Rumble.
WWE trios division heating up? /s
And here we saw the beginning of the Brodline.
Guys, hear me out. Maybe, just maybe... the plan all along was for Jay to beat Roman.
So basically, they are gonna keep doing this Jey saves Sami then attacks him thing?
Riddle in speedo doesnt cope well with me. please put shorts back on.
So this week the tag champs were fucking bullied  Last week they bullied the #1 challenger  What the fuck is this storyline
I was worried that they were just gonna ignore the fact that Solo was the one who took out Riddle when he came out Monday. Glad that didn’t happen.
Piss off Riddle.  Thanks OP for sharing, I’ll tune in to the replay.
Great main event, Jey is a sick ruthless a*****e  I guess we know the main event for next week it's gonna be interesting if Riddle is gonna lose right after coming back. Him being entered into this main event just felt weird to me
Samoan Spike is straight-up lame and unconvincing.  Golly I’m glad I got to see it win a Bloodline match for the billionth time!  Bloodline fans: is this still fun for you to watch?   Over and over and over again???
Oh my god, who gives a shit about Matt Riddle? Can’t believe their failure to pull the trigger on anything good or cool actually happening.
I was enjoying it, then I saw “Matt” on the titan tron and exited the video.
Solo is the least intimidating dude there is. He's short,not built, akd just doesn't give off an enforcer vibe.
Other than Titantron, Riddle has lost his first name again.
They dragging this for Summerslam right?   also Riddle sucks
We could’ve really used Riddle on Sunday night
I may be in the minority, but I still believe Jey and Sami have been working together. I'd rather eat the super kick than a Samoan spike and play the long con since we already know Heyman watches the show.
Remember guys. Jey walked out on the Bloodline in JANUARY. Over 2 months later, we have had exposition but hardly any progression.
Not at all what I was expecting, but fuck it, why not?
So, for how long they are going to drag this story.
They’re starting to lose me with this Jey shit, when he actually turns it wouldn’t be as exciting as it should have been.
It’s like he’s wearing nothing at all!   Nothing at all!!   Nothing at all!!!
That speedo does him no favors
I legit felt like I was watching Basic Instinct with my parents
It's not just the lack of boots, but lack of knee pads and even smaller trunks than before. The jacket almost makes it worse because his bottom half is so much more exposed. You even seen that picture of trips with boots but no knee pads. Feels like you walked in on him.
To be fair, if I looked like Riddle this is exactly how much clothing I'd wear
No kneepads equals nudity. Bare knees might as well be scrotum.  I can't believe they allow some of these guys on TV.
It is the lack of kneepads
No boots
Whos got the OSW clip about kneepadless wrestlers are more naked than actually being naked
Riddle is the male Stacey Kiebler
I fucking hate Riddle’s look. No knee pads. No boots. No shin guards.    And we’re supposed to believe that Riddle, without kneepads and boots, is just as strong or stronger, than literally everyone on the roster who has boots.
You arguably got the best ending.
WE’RE OUT OF TIME FOLKS!!!
Its the lack of boots
Oh he's smashable.   My wife constantly reminds me.
Jimmy has been getting a little chonky. But Jey is obviously getting himself in the best shape of his life to have a main event physique if he ends up being the one pushed to the top in this whole angle.
Idk, I think at some point you risk Jey losing sympathy. We may already be there.
But Cole said that was the definitive blow to any possible relationship between Jey Uso and Sami Zayn!
They were apeshit for Cody and it didnt do him any favor, doubt this cheers will be more than a new tag title reign (again) and a loss to Roman at Summerslam.
That kind of sounds like the most hypocritical shit ever. Zayn & Kevin have betrayed each countless times at this point, if anything betrayal should make Jey & Sami even closer lol.
Me too. I’m one of the 7 Riddle fans on this sub.
"THATS GOOD SHIT PAL"
Solo always being the finish and the shenanigans to matches? Oh I hate that shit too honestly, think the story would work just as good or even better if matches ended clean now.
I'm glad someone said it. Rolled my eyes so hard at the same ending we've seen over and over again. And adding Riddle into this story really does nothing for me
It looks so weak compared to the Umaga one I dont know why
It's such good shit (for real)  ☝️
![gif](giphy|eti1qm33pRbaw)
Literally the last words of the show was Cole saying "and his name is Matt Riddle"
Is Cole supposed to say “Matt Riddle” every single time?
Tune in next week to find out, pal
Stupid sexy Riddle
https://i.imgur.com/XRWevUu.jpg
Being bare footed doesn't help either
Jealous
Time for a banana hammock?
You mean [This one?](https://i.imgur.com/IOJXWN7.jpg) I do feel dirty looking at it.
Do....do you think boots make you stronger?
I think the idea is that he's kneeing people in the face without any protection there.
Do the Von Erichs or MMA not exist in your supposed universe?
I mean dude was a legit mma fighter, it fits his background. They don't fight with anything. Maybe a knee sleeve but that's it. Sure Shamrock and Ronda do but it's his decision. Hell for a minute there Rusev also didn't wear boots
Are we supposed to believe that this legit MMA fighter is able to do a lot of damage without any padding or boots? I think the answer is kind of obvious
You think Rusev looked weak without boots?
Lack of kneepads actually
you can't keep going down the "is Jey finally gonna turn? Psyche! He's not!" well too much that it becomes diminishing returns.
I think there's a chance of missing the boat but I don't think the crowd will lose sympathy for Jey, we definitely didn't tonight imo with that reaction to the tease.
I'm not pretending to be everybody but I'm there.
Perhaps but Jey has been so good as of late in every aspect that I think he could get by longer than most. I do think it'll happen by Summerslam but, if it doesn't, it'll definitely need to happen shortly after. Maybe I am overestimating Jey's character connection with the crowd but I do believe he can pull off a massive face turn. I do also worry Vince could kneecap all of it, however.
Yeah I’ve long since peaced out on caring about Jay’s face turn. He’s *way* too quick to stay heel to make any real turn make sense.   He’ll likely turn face because the Bloodline turned on him, and that’s not a real change in his personality.
Ngl you make a good point lol. But I think it’s different with Jey than what Sami and Kevin had because when Sami and Kevin turned on eachother, it’s either about some weird conspiracy or it’s about the title. The title is the title, so regardless I feel like that’s understandable (Kevin would’ve done it to anyone else). The only thing that was similar was the betrayal on KO at War Games, but Sami never had any hints of “I’ve seen your side, now I’m gonna take the others down” Sami was always upfront that he wanted to stay with the bloodline.   Jey on the otherhand  supposedly turned against the bloodline because of what they did to Sami, but week after week he kept adding hints of “I’m with you Sami, Roman needs to be taken down”, but when he turned against Sami, it become very apparent that he was playing Sami the whole time and that had to hit low
Riddlers unite!!!
Seriously.  I know the heels need heat for cheating, but this is just boring and tedious.   A clean win occasionally wouldn’t hurt anyone.
can't imagine your reaction to triple h 2002-2005
Solo stops when he hits them, Umaga followed through.
The pose makes it look more male stripper-y
They do if they're Boots of Strength +1
RPG logic
Wrestler's Boots  +2 Agility  +1 Dexterity  +2 Kick Strength (Hardness)  Slip Resistance  A typical generic wrestling boots most generic wrestlers wear generally.
Protection for their faces or protection for his knee?  How are we to think about this in light of Dusty's bionic elbow and the foreign object in Hansen's elbow pad?
He's gonna do it against Roman, not Solo, and it'll be to save either Sami or Jimmy.
It reminds me a lot of Daniel Garcia with Jericho. Not in a good way.
Fully agree. There's a reason my other post in this thread reacting is just a sigh.
Yeah, this is the one that did it for me actually.
![gif](giphy|J6Dk2cfeC95yEjM3XQ)
it was pre pg too so he looked vicious doing it
Triple H auditioning to join The Dicks right there
Also, Minoru Suzuki has almost never worn knee or elbow pads. And his strikes are powerful af.
They've went to the well too many times already, though.  He's already 'betrayed' Sami like 3 times lol.
Which is why I think it'll be Jimmy, honestly. He's gonna mess up, and it'll be KO/Sami at the rumble all over again.   That's when it'll all click for Jey.
And Sami is going at it just like he did Kevin after they were"done for ever" Jey can mess around with Sami all he wants but Roman isn't going to mess with him specially now that they aren't champion and that Jimmy is used to manipulate him.  Jey will eventually be pressured to stop beating Sami and to aim at taking him out for good and this is when shit will hit the fan.
1 time
Definitely bare minimum 2 times already.

Okay I have to ask is that a wax figure or something?   What is up with the look on his face and pose?
What is that pose/action he is doing?
He looks like Bum Ass Maxwell here
He looks like he just realized that you are about to Kathy-Bates-in-Misery him. Great photo.
I figure he just likes ruining pictures and wasting peoples time.
I have the same shirt. Anachronistic Walmart WWE shirts FTW.
Never thought Ricky Gervais is a big fan of MJF.  They probably roasted each other after this pose.
Haha! Nope that’s the real deal sitting there. He just randomly took a goofy shot and I love it!
The hell if I know!
MJF is an old school reference dork, he's definitely doing a bit that is really obscure, I'm sure. Or he's just being silly. Who knows what goes on in his head.
MJF and Corbin frequently interact on Twitter
Didn’t waste my time!
The chair cracks me up.   I’ve done a lot of comic con type events and can only think of 2-3 celebs who had chairs.   They were Bill Shatner, Stan Lee (both were over 90) and Michael J Fox who has Parkinsons.   So for him to be in a gold chair is very in character as “Better than standing”.
I had an idea of what to expect with MJF but then again, it’s MJF and I was thoroughly pleased.   Also, just before this pic, Mick Foley came in and asked for a pic with him but wanted him to look at him despairingly and MJF happily obliged.
It’s like when I met Denis Leary at a book signing and he said “you want me to sign it “go fuck yourself” ?…..a lot of people ask for that.”  Uhhh sure.
He should sign it "I ripped off Bill Hicks."

Hey what happened to that thing where everybody was gonna chant anti-Vince stuff people kept posting about here over and over?
Buying a ticket, that'll show them!
LMAO Vince.
Wait so a sign based on a hashtag couldn't take down Vince McMahon? I'm shocked, SHOCKED I TELL YOU
Literally what did he expect to happen?
He should have used 2 exclamation marks at the end. That would have worked 100%.  3 exclamation marks and the Endeavor CEO himself would have gone into the crowd to personally ask him to replace Vince.
I’m sure the people around him were relieved. I’m also sure he was disappointed he couldn’t start a fire Vince chant that I was told was going to drown out the shows.
We’re the authority!
Good, attention seeking at its worst.
This dude totally thought he was going to be the leader of a revolution tonight lol
There was a “Where’s Bayley ?” Sign also
That sucks, it probably took his mom some time to make for him, he must have told her about it first thing when she picked him up from the show.
At least he deserved getting his sign taken, unlike that poor "give Dana Brooke a chance" guy
Good on the security guy
Let Vince cooks.
Brave
HHH didn't have to have that sign taken down but he did. So if you had any doubt about their relationship.
Are there pictures of said person taking the sign away? That is stuff that is interesting to me... Like did the guy with the sign put up any fight?
One day people will realize this subreddit is just a very, very small part of the fanbase. I guarantee you 98% of the fans who were at Smackdown in attendance didn't care a single bit or even knew about it to begin with.
anti-vince?  i think they mistook it for anti-dominik stuff
Maybe people were too distracted by the actual wrestling.
He wasn't in gorilla today so all the sexual assault claims are forgotten.
Most people don’t know anything about Vince.  That being said fuck Vince. He’s a POS.
People tried but not enough to keep it going
i honestly dont think chants and signs matter at all to him/them.  all anybody can really do is just ride this out.  the success of AEW wont matter, the locker room doesnt matter...theres nothing anybody can do but wait and see or not see (tune in or tune out).  sounds bleak but thats the reality of it now.
He probably bought his ticket weeks ago.
Well actually the audience of the product ruining the show and showing their displeasure would at least be good to happen. It's certainly hard to ignore if it happens at the shows.
Tbf, it was a sign based on a hashtag which was based on a limerick written on a bathroom wall.
For his sign to be confiscated shortly after showing it probably. You think he's sad about the loss of a poster board?
For Vince to be fired
When he flashed it some noticed and started chanting. Maybe a dozen but it died out. Then he lost his sign
You'd think he'd be in view of the hard cam
Lol
"No sir sorry sir I was just trying to impress my fwendz pweez dont call my mum"
Edit: 99.98%
Saw someone in another thread on Monday say "these days everyone in that arena knows all about these rumors and stuff like we do" and it kinda blew my mind that someone thought all WWE fans were as obsessively into wrestling as we are.
My parents don't even know he's back, they were watching Smackdown today and talking about how he retired
legit so many of them probably didn’t even watch raw

Last table bump looked like a rough one. Really good all around though the chair spot in the ring building to the finish had HOOK turned around a bit; that'll get better with experience.
HOOK is getting better with each match, we're seeing him improve in real time and that's great
Hook has the world championship within 3 years, guarantee it
Seems they got nothing for Hook and Page lol
Really fun match. Hook already understands how to play to the crowd and the crowd loves him, everything else is secondary and will absolutely come with time. Until then he can just keep suplexing dudes, I am 100% fine with that.
Super fun match
Yeah idk if it is because of the table placement or Hook didn’t get enough lift, but it looked like Page landed near the legs which doesn’t seem like a fun time lol
because they’ve both been consistently on tv and working matches?

No
WWECW maybe
WWECW literally was, but given that WCW signed a lot of the original ECW's stars, I am going to say no.
WWE had a longtime agreement with the Memphis territory to partially serve as a de facto WWE developmental pre-ECW.  Also, AFAIK, Vince was only subsidizing ECW starting from 1997.
USWA was to an extent
the fuck
No, ECW was the original AEW.
Depends, Jerry Lawler would claim Memphis was the first territory Vince allowed to live so he could use as developmental.
If this is asking if ECW was a developmental territory for the WWF, then it kind of was. They sent certain newly signed wrestlers to ECW for a spell if they needed exposure/experience (Droz is an example) and wrestlers under contract that they had nothing for or needed a gimmick (Al Snow).  It wasn't an all encompassing system like NXT is today.
I see ECW as the AEW but with much less money.  ECW catered to fans of in ring work, where wrestling ability got you over rather than gimmicks.
Smokey Mountain to ECW to OVW and HWA to WWECW to GCW to FCW to NXT
Allegedly ECW did not get that much financially. The big money WWF loaned was to try and be the highest priority creditor to get the library.  NXT is a developmental territory where the goal is for talent to get to the main roster. ECW was not that, although some talent were sent there (Snow, Brakkus, Austin to get in ring shape before WWF, Credible). Memphis Power Pro Wrestling, OVW, HWA, Deep South are all closer.
ECW is more like Evolve was a few years ago- heavily wwe associated, but lots of stars went to aew as well as wwe.
I don't think we watched the same ecw
Hahaha. That's the opposite of ECW. There was no good work happening in ECW.
This is the better analogy.
The one with the Zombie, right?

Cameron Grimes
I mean lots of people are ready but that doesn't mean they should. Carmelo Hayes/Wes Lee are ready but both are crucial champions to NXT for example
* Cameron Grimes. He disappeared from NXT after his feud with Joe Gacy which ended back in November and still hasn’t been seen since.  * Pretty Deadly. They definitely would add a lot of good character to the main roster division which I think would be fun.   * Roxanne Perez. I feel like the whole collapse angle they did was a way to get the title off her to move her up.   * Katana Chance & Kayden Carter. They seem to have disappeared after that tag match where they faced Meiko and Roxanne. Plus they have been in NXT a long time going back to when it was the black and gold era. The main roster could use a legit team anyways for the division due to how dead it is.  * Ilja Dragunov. That Booster guy who be leaking stuff mentioned about him coming up and potentially joining Imperium.  * Zoey Stark. She did work a few Main Event tapings before Raw and did a house show loop one weekend working with Charlotte, Liv, and Sonya. Plus she just had a title match against Indi this past week which would just instantly put her back at the line again. She still needs work on character in developing it to a T but her wresting skills are among the best in NXT that could definitely add to Raw or SmackDown.  *  Bron Breakker. This one is tricky though due to the fact that he just turned heel. I’m not sure they would bring him up as one. But if so then he could do what KO and Sasha did in working both the main roster and NXT on the side when they eventually dropped the titles they had to Finn and Bayley. He could stick around to help push Melo as the top babyface of the brand while working main roster.
Honestly a bunch of people
Blair Davenport, she can hang with the best of them.
every single UK lad, diamond mine, zoey stark, grayson waller, bron breakker, tiffany stratton
All of the NXT UK is ready to go
Other than everyone who's already been mentioned JD Mcdonagh is ready, would love to see him in Judgment Day
Pretty Deadly, Alba Fyre, Cameron Grimes, Grayson Waller, and Zoey Stark
Pretty Deadly Cameron Grimes Zoey starks Alba Frye it wasn't champion
Noam Dar has already had a run on the main roster.   Summarising the other comments it's looking like almost everyone they kept from NXT UK is ready.
Roxanne Perez
Dragunov and JD are both 100% ready, but as an NXT only viewer I really don't want to see them go.
Bring up Tyler bate plz
Meiko Satamaora has been wrestling longer than many NXT wrestlers have been alive so she's ready.
Bron Breakker, Grayson Waller, Zoey Stark, Cameron Grimes, and Pretty Deadly are all ready to go.   If Alba Fyre still has those tag titles by next month, she's staying, but she's another one that's main roster ready.   As much as I love Chase U, they're not ready yet. The same goes for Roxanne. I'm not doubting her ring work, but her promos still need a little work. Let's see where she's at this time next month before the draft.
It's Hank Walker's time.
Grimes, Pretty Deadly, Waller. I wanna say Zoey too but I go back and forth. Roxanne still needs a bit more character imo but I can see both getting moved up.  I was just reminded Chase U and Tiffany.
Cameron is given. Roddy too if he decides to stay and 100%. Pretty Deadly would be cool. Zoey yeah. If not for the NXT Woman Championship, Indi also.   Veer and Sanga with Jinder back on MR.
Bring up Chase U and send down Hit Row.  Fair trade of 1  female and 2 male.  Hit Row need work and Chase U is so goddamned funny, I'd love to see them with better opponents.
Thank you fellow Redditors for joining with me in this discussion. You guys are awesome for taking part in a post made by a complete pro wrestling fandom noob, and I appreciate you for taking time out of your day to join in.
Grimes should've been called up like a year ago tbh.
Grimes technically has been called up, he just hasn't been put on TV yet.  When Fightful asked about him doing a Smackdown dark match last month a WWE rep replied that they don't use NXT people for Smackdown.
Dragunov joining Imperium is the one I want the most. He's the perfect mid carder for Imperium, while Gunther can climb up the card soon  Also damn, Grimes been out of TV for 5 months now?
I've been wondering where she was. Haven't seen her since the Worlds Collide show.
Lyra Valkyria seems a little rough to me
Yeah, Shawn Michaels included JD when asked a few months ago who he thought was ready if it was up to him.
Alba just won the titles with Isla Dawn
i think Breaker is going to be called up as wel
Injury took her out, just hope she isn't waiting out the contract too.
Nah, Breakker has his heel turn right now. Even though I don't think the heel turn makes sense.
I think it was visa issues she was dealing with. Lot of UK talent was dealing with that. They did the Worlds Collide show and were waiting to get their visas so they could make the move to the States. That's why a lot of them are just now starting to show back up again like Bate, Gallus, and Satamora.
I hope not either. She's great.
For what it's worth, she was announced for the WWE 2K23 DLC, so hopefully they're just waiting to re-debut her.
I stand corrected, appreciate it!

I think OWE shut down.
He works in GLEAT now. STRONGHEARTS stopped working with AEW because of the pandemic and they couldn’t travel, and CIMA didn’t personally abuse Cora but took responsibility because it was his monkey. Shingo is far more implicated in the abuse than CIMA (Shingo was one of the potential ringleaders and it’s alleged that DG helped cover for him because he was a big name and others involved were not) and he wrestled for AEW more recently than CIMA last did
GLEAT
If the animal abuse thing was a factor, it probably would have stopped him from working with them in the first place.  Cima actually left OWE in 2021 with a few other wrestlers.
pandemic killed OWE  CIMA is working GLEAT
CIMA balls in your mouth?
The what?
The DG Dojo had a pet monkey that some of the students abused (the only name I’ve heard was Akira Tozawa)
From Wikipedia:  " In 2009, Cima was one of many Dragon Gate wrestlers embroiled in an animal abuse scandal surrounding Cora, the pet monkey that lived in the Dragon Gate dojo. It was alleged the monkey had been choked until it passed out, burned with charcoal, thrown into a tub of boiling hot water, fed sake regularly until it would pass out, dragged around by a chain on its neck, and burned with fire crackers. Cima was reportedly the one who had brought the monkey into the dojo, but had failed to keep up with the exotic animals preservation laws, though he was not accused of any of the abuse. After the events came to light, Cima took a three-month pay cut and shaved his head to show remorse."  Someone else said Shingo was the ringleader.  It's probably one of the grossest stories I've heard in pro wrestling, and that's saying something.
Oh.  Yikes.
CIMA and Shingo were also involved to an extent

I remember rolling my eyes when he turned heel and joined judgement day. I thought it would be terrible, very wrong I was.
I do remember the posts on here not really that long ago declaring he'd be useless forever.  He's done amazingly well and made the absolute most of this angle.  I do wonder how well he'll be able to maintain this kind of heat when he eventually moves on to another feud against someone who's not his dad.
And people say Judgement Day would have been better with Edge. They seem to be doing just fine.
This sub had the biggest hate boner for him last year, it’s insane how a heel turn and joining JD has made him into what he is today.  I really don’t think he should ever take the Rey Mysterio mantle tbh.
>	My brother is watching smackdown in the other room and I heard boos through the wall  People on this sub are now straight up afraid of admitting they watch WWE lmao
I remember comments here calling for him to be moved to NXT for ‘at least’ 3 years and that he would never make it in the business.
Dom is doing great, I hate him and I love home for it. Can’t wait to see where he goes.
God bless Konnan
Dude the arena was so loud and full of boos. Reminded me of KO and Elias in Seattle level heat. It was awesome!
Me, I do. I called him the next David Flair and I humbly retract those allegations.
I used to ff every Dom segment because he was just hard to look at and was awful.  Dude is now legit one of my favorites on the show.
He's just massively improved. He wasn't good before and honestly didn't really deserve to be on TV but now hes a great heel but it's still average in the ring and has a average look but is just in a great spot with a good story
He's got the best gimmick going right now imo.
Get a belt on him
He's such a shit, it's amazing, kid's got the brightest future of anybody in the game right now
whilst he was straight with his father he was the most boring guy around. he just had no charisma of being likeable.   the moment they started the judgement day story i was like ok here we go lets see adn he's absolutely shone as a heel.
Yeah I didn't see much in the guy but his natural development has been awesome to see. Turns out he has so much potential!
I mean... he caught on faster than Roman did.
Nobody owes him an apology, he was AWFUL as a face and had no character except "Rey Mysterio's son", and basically everyone has acknowledged his improvement as a heel. History isn't going to be rewritten just because he's doing good work right now.
Look, maybe, just maybe, he wasn't as good as before and that's why people didn't enjoy watching him, and that's fine.
Last year I said on here that he was good in the ring, but he needed more character (and maybe muscle mass).   And I had people asking me to explain how he’s not the worst thing ever.
I'm not even remotely ready to put him on the level of Roman or MJF. Those guys draw heat in their sleep.  But I was definitely one of those who thought he wasn't ready for the big leagues yet 6 months ago, and will happily admit that he's one of the best parts of the show now. Taking something as simple as being taken away by police and turning it into such a ridiculous gimmick was a stroke of brilliance, and he's played it so well.  Nothing but kudos for the kid, happy to admit I was wrong and happy to see him finding his role and thriving, especially while his dad is still around to see him having success.
Nah, I'm still not interested in him
I've been cheering him on since he was a "face"
I finally got a chance to watch Dom's promo on SD - OMG he is officially a massive heat magnet.  This was not on my bingo card for 2023.
The dude fucking sucked as a face and at first when he joined judgment day, he's definitely one , if not the most improved talent of the year in my eyes so far. He had go away heat before.
Dom is WWE’s Hook.
He is so much cooler than his deadbeat dad. 😂
I thought so as well, but that was when The Judgement Day was still a generic "dark and serious" heel faction. Once they transitioned into a group of emo friends that are obsessed with one another but hate everyone else, Dom began to shine.
Working With Damien Priest has helped him alot, he finally realized hes 6 feet tall and shouldn't try to use Reys moveset
Yea me too. But I didn’t think he would ever get to this level in the first place lmaoo
Yes he will he had heat when he was doing a promo vs Charlotte
They’re just walking jokes lol . All talk no action . At least when Edge was in charge , they were winning matches . Now they’re just a bunch of losers except Rhea . They get boos but these defeats make them look weak
Wins king of the ring and is now the  real  Rey Mysterio rights itself perfectly.
>I really don’t think he should ever take the Rey Mysterio mantle tbh.  I agree. I do think it's also slightly important to note that Rey Jr isn't the only one who can grant that mantle to a wrestler, either - his uncle still can, too.  There have actually been (at least) three other successors to the gimmick already in Tijuana, the most well known being Rey Horus/Dragon Azteca Jr in LU (which is why they heavily played up the Rey connection, for those who watched).   The current one goes by the full ring name "The King" Rey Mysterio, and works mainly on the indies. He's not bad, but he's not astounding.   General point being, I think Dom is doing a wonderful job continuing his family's legacy without directly picking up the gimmick. If he doesn't, that also doesn't mean it's a gimmick lost forever.
>I really don’t think he should ever take the Rey Mysterio mantle tbh.  What about him joining/taking over LWO later on or reviving it himself many years later, long after Rey retires?
This sub has the biggest hate boner for anyone that doesn't become a star in their first appearance.  Not to long ago Sasha Banks was getting the ["Not as good as she thinks she is"](https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/102yeey/wrestle_kingdom_17_spoilers_debut/j2w7t0s/) treatment, then the finisher botch made them double down.  Then boom Mercedes puts on a [banger in her first match in Japan](https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/1163vtc/njpw_battle_in_the_valley_spoilers_finish_to_iwgp) and people shut up immediately.
Istg It ain’t that😭 Im just doing other stuff rn and don’t have it on I’m not on strike lmaoo
People tend to look at what is happening now and not trying to look at potential.
Did hook turn on taz?
Judgement Day really went from weird gothic heel faction to a surprisingly endearing group of bastards. My favourite work from Finn in WWE by far
[This photo](https://i.imgur.com/klEZbdW.jpg) of JD laughing at Rey after Dom groin kicked him will go down as one my favorite wrestling photos of all time
Now someone please teach Brian cage this same lesson
What are you talking about.  They were horrible with Edge. They still won most of their matches
I’m not sure if it’s the same guy but isn’t El Hijo de Rey Misterio still wrestling
I want Dom to take over JD.
Eh, still not that big of a fan of Sasha. But it’s more the fact I think her promos and presentation never clicked with me. She always had banger matches.
I know this sounds hard to believe, but I've even seen comments suggesting Dabba-Kato is less than an absolute superstar.
Brian Cage does flippy stuff way better than Dominik though.
Careful his partner is going to come after you on Instagram now.
Lol no. No, they don’t
Different guy! You're thinking of Rey Sr's son, who now goes by Rey Misterio Heredero.   To answer you're question though, I'm not sure. I think the last match he wrestled was sometime later last year, but it's definitely been a few months since I've seen him pop up on any cards.
They won at Smack down.  Up until wrestlemania they have been dominating raw and smackdown
Julia Hart being exuberantly happy singing her theme and then switching to absolute fury the moment she hears a single second of Jefferson Starship is the best goth representation in wrestling in a long time.
Julia: this fucking guy, interrupting my exit
Billie has more in-ring experience than Jade. Insane
This is a hell of a showing by Billie. No way they dont sign her in a few months.
You gotta remember folks, JR probably hasn't seen a lot of 18 year old women wrestlers before let alone had to call  their match on national tv. Dude is in full grandpa mode and can't believe what he's seeing
go ahead and make her All Elite when she graduates, she'll be a staple on TV this time next year
Julia's face changed once she heard happy music
that character work from Julia Hart is 👌🏽  make her the international champion
Starkz is 100% the ring general in this match.
Julia Hart: WHAT THE HELL IS THIS HIPPY DIPPY SHIT MUSIC
I love the unspoken thing AEW has where you can beat Penta or Fenix seperately, and you can even beat Death Triangle-- but the Lucha Brothers as a tag team are almost impossible to beat.
They definitely need to end up doing a mist spot to Orange Cassidy with his sunglasses on somehow.
“She is somebodies kid JR”
We're at the point where Jade is now bullying high school students
This has been a fun 2 hours
Honestly Billie has more potential than almost anyone, she’s only 18 and better by far than a lot of older wrestlers already
Julia LOL I loved that who sequence she just did with OC
God OC is so fucking good
Im just happy Billies been able to show out tonight. And I love how over she is with the crowd
lmao Cutler and Nak being the only "elite" left is hilarious.
I love how disgusted JR gets when saying Mar-SHALL.  "Mar-sHaLL... my ass"
Billie makes all of us look like shit.
Jade really out here proud to bully a high schooler. I want Taya to mention that lol
Billie's lasting longer than most of Jade's opponents.
That sequence into the hurracanrana wss ambitious, but they pulled it off. That required a lot of power from Jade due to Starkz's size.
Those two goobers are about to be brutally murdered by the BBC and I'm here for it
Julia is absolutely killing it in her role
Julia Hart ran back to HoB and complained to them that OC interrupted her
ya ever accidentally join a stable?
Billie is deceptively tall.  She is almost the same height as Jade
That was a pretty good match.
Remember when Alex wore that D&D cape when Penta was obscuro
That ending sequence was bonkers. Fun show!
AEW has been on fire this week. Hope it continues.
Julia: Hey dads, tell off Orange, he interrupted my cool theme song  HoB: As you wish.
I know Stat has been the pick to beat Jade for a while but I feel like Taya should probably be the one to do it if Stat isn’t coming back soon. Taya’s the first person to challenge Jade who feels like she’s on her level of star power and presentation.
Yessss the splitscreen interviews concluding with "IT'S TIME... FOR THE MAAAAIIINNNN EVENT" are back
lucha bros are so special man
The book of hobbs - chapter 15 - how QT let me down
Rush has been such a great addition to AEW.
I love the very leisurely rope strolling by OC after all the rope runs we've seen Kommander pull.
The Jarrett crew is unironically one of my all time favorite midcard heel acts.
Billie moves better than Jade, but Jade's look is unrivalled.
That match FUCKED good on the ladies for killing it
Ah thank god Dante had a successful surgery
They should 100% have the BCC get disqualified for something so that Cutler and Nakazawa become their equivalent of Shawn Dean for MJF
youre a fuckin idiot if you think qt is a bad wrestler
Lucha Brothers are insane to watch.  They are super exciting at all times. Big, flashy spots. They are exactly what you want from lucha guys
As predicted, QT eats the pin. No way they were gonna pin Hobbs. lol. QT hell of a hand.
Andrade, Rush, Penta, Fenix, Bandido, Dralistico, Komander, Serpentico, Fuego.....They practically have their own Lucha division
Starkz will be a huge deal down the line
She may not have won, but I’m still so proud of Billie for how well she did!  Maybe she can try again after she gets her diploma
Ngl, the Pump Kick works better for Jade’s finisher. She hits it brutally
Hey look, TWO AMATEURS
Well Cutler and Nakazawa getting murdered next week
The composer of all those samey BK songs is the true heel in all of this
I'm never eating Burger King again.
Cutler and Nakazawa are gonna die
"Settle down JR" xD
AEW really spreading the love with this recent booking. Hart and Anna main eventing, Starkz getting solid TV time, Nak and Cutler next week, Brian Cage, QT in the main event. Granted QT is on the booking team, but still, he plays his role well.
J.R: The enemy of Kayfabe
Holy crap that counter?! That match was so damn good!!
Lucha Bros just don't miss.   Smooth as hell finish/counter by Fenix.
Fun 2 hours of wrestling, was very much sports entertained throughout.  It was a pleasure chatting with you all as always, have a great weekend and see everyone back here on Wednesday!👋🏻
Billie Starks is absolutely a prodigy. She legitimately has the talent to be HUGE in the industry in only a few years' time.    But I'm gonna be honest. JR is super offputting in this entrance segment.
I love Best Friends' galaxy print tracksuits. They just fit Chuck and Trent so well
 I remember Jim Ross just not getting Orange Cassidy at first and now he just loves him. Lmao.
Bryce counting in spanish lmao
I was not expecting OC to put on a mini-PPV match. He always makes his opponents look great when he has enough time.
What a fucking sell on that Orange Punch!
OC vs Buddy?!!! Yes, yes please!
"18 YEARS OLD?!"
"I want you to hire athletic '10s'."  I wonder who told J.R. *that?* *coughJohnnyAcecough*
Jades gear is POPPIN
Man AEW's women are just really gelling lately.
Billie training with danielson would be great for her
This was one of Jade's better matches. Starkz has such a bright future.
Starks is going to be A Star.
Taya Valkyrie is probably the most experienced opponent Jade's had to face. This might be her biggest challenge yet.
Marvez in the Elite-verse is low key one of my fav things
The convalescent Don Callis. Lol. Poor Nake and Brandon are going to die. Lol
 TWO CONTRACT CUTLER COMING FOR YOU BBC
i want Ibushi to debut running in to save Brandon and Nak.
Cutler and Nakazawa are going to look like crash test dummies in that match.  But it's a good opportunity to have Hangman and Elite come together against a common threat.
Mark Henry got his little square back!
Khan going to show he knows how to get the feelgood finale to a longterm story at the biggest show of the year right when Cutler and Nakazawa squash the BCC in a handicap match at Wembley
The roast of Cody by AEW fans continues. Those signs are something. "Cody Loses LOL", Cody is MID at best"
QT gets great heat
Settle down JR make that A flair
Holy Shit, Fenix
Keith Lee vs QT Marshall would be the most sitcom dad vs sitcom dad match of this generation
Women had a really great showing tonight. A lot of talent to build the future around too.
Cutler and Nakazawa are the Yamcha and Tien of the Elite
Orange Cassidy vs Julia Hart LFG
Cool transition.
Dralisticos mask is sick
Dralistico is a pretty damn good lucha addition, along with Kommander and Vikingo, as far as part time appearances go.
Julia is killing it with the character work.
This OC vs Dralistico match is so fun.
Buddy/OC incoming!!!
Buddy v OC? I’m down
YESSSS OC VS BUDDY
FUCK THIS FEUD IS GONNA FUCK SO HARD
God they are so cool
JEEZ Murphy vs. Cassidy will be a hell of a match!
Literally any member of the HoB vs OC will be a certified goddamn banger.
Buddy and OC had a good little sequence in the trios match the other night, the singles match should bang.
Mark got bamboozled.
She is someone’s kid haha
I'm happy Billie's getting a chance to have a real match with Jade
Hey y'all, do you remember in the early days of Dynamite when Jack Evans got pinned in picture-in-picture? Lmao.
Is Billie Starkz much bigger than I thought she was in GCW or is Jade just not as big as I thought she was?
I bet Billie Starks is signed after this match.
She's already better than half the women in North America and maybe more
This match was rough in spots, but not bad really. It went longer than Jade's tv matches usually do.
Fun match love seeing Billie on the big stage
Wasn't expecting a win but the fact that they gave Billie an entrance and let her be really competitive is a good sign for her future here.
Still having a better weekend than Cody.
they're gonna die
Two-Contract Cutler bowing up. He's gonna catch an ass whipping.
The blond woman single handedly making QT Marshall’s faction legit.
JR got a little sassy there lol
Lol JR talking about QT😂
JR fussy. Past his bed time
Tbf JR has always made fun of the Mar-shall pronunciation.
No way Penta put the gum back in his mouth😂😂😂
Y’all stand back, QTs fuckin working
I will never not pop when Fenix does that kick in the corner
Beautiful sell by QT. Good job, king
The Lucha Bros are awesome...
This has been a pretty good night of wrestling.
THIS MATCH HAS FUCKED
Said this in the Rampage thread because I forgot to switch lol  But damn Dynamite looks like it's gonna be killer this week:  OC/Matthews, Lee/Jericho, Swerve/Allin are all amazing ... throw in BCC vs Cutler/Nakazawa in what should be hilarious until it's violent and it's got a LOT going for it.
I'll throw my remote through my t.v. if QT becomes Tag Champion lol.
Yoooo, why tf was this so entertaining??
It was my first live wrestling show since I was a child, and I had a lot of fun! (Was in 201 row F)  The show was awesome overall. I was super pumped to see Julia's entrance, and it delivered.  Ppl around us were pretty good. Hearing a few CM Punk chants get booed out was delicious, and we almost got a dick twist chant started LOL. no one smelled like hot ass, which really surprised me.  Can't wait to go to another show soon!
Totally forgot it’s battle of the belts. What a night of wrestling we are having
I’m hoping for an actual belt change, they need more mystery on these or they’re just boring
Julia looked like she wanted to rip out OC's heart and eat it
AEW is really building up a lot of really good young wrestlers for the women’s division it’s impressive
This is a great dynamic.  High energy vs low energy
I’ll never stop being impressed at all the shit OC can do with his hands in his pockets
Lmao love Orange Cassidy man.
Oof, Dralistico forgetting where hard cam is, making that sequence with him outside and Cassidy in the middle of the ring awkward.
I thought these people were anti masked luchadors, why they got one on their team?
JR's a bit off his game tonight.
I really do think that Jr has been losing the plot more and more lately
Fun match. This is what makes OC great. He just fun
Good stuff right there. OC has not missed with these title defenses.
Let's get that Dralistico is All Elite graphic, Tony.
Lmao Julia went and tattled on OC for fucking up her music
Buddy about to be champ lol
Shock the world Billie
LMAO JR
Buddy about to avenge Julia Hart's exit getting cut off by OC.
Mark Briscoe just got carnied.
JR has been exceptionally awful today lol
Mark Briscoe doing promos with Jeff Jarrett wasn't something I knew I needed until this very moment.
lol She smacked Jade UPSIDE the face.
Billie is tall
At least Billie is getting some offense.
A Jade Cargill match that goes through a commercial break?  GO BILLIE!!!
Billie is great at selling in ways that make you go, "oh my gosh is that girl okay?" She's really great for heels to smack around to get easy heat.
I like how much they built Billie up in the previews and commercial for BoTB. Feels like it's only a matter of time until she's a regular fixture on AEW TV
This match has gone better than I expected.
Good match
That was great match, definitely better then I was potentially expecting it to go.
When is Jade vs Taya happening?
you couldn’t find a greener pair of boots if you tried
Taya looks like she was drawn by Rob Liefeld  (meant as a compliment, strangely enough)
No way she was applying Road to Valhalla with those sleeves and in those boots
That was a better Jade match than usual. I feel like Jade vs. Starkz could be a rivalry of the future.
Im fulling expecting Nak and Brandon to absolutely get murdered by the BCC
Oh no, Brandon, Nak, you’re gonna *die*
Lmao Brandon & Nak representing the Elite 🤣
Oh no. They gonna die.
Hell yes! Brandon and Naka gonna tear up BCC
Cutler getting his breakout promo
Cutler and Nak being the purest baby faces in the Elite makes a ton of sense
Wow, the 2 aces of The Elite
Pleasantly surprised they gave Cutler promo time on TV like that. A really good heartfelt promo as well.
I hope Statlander wins the belt the day she is healthy. I actually like Jade but this title reign is beyond stale at this point
Love Penta’s sexy walk lol
I was actually joking about Ibushi debuting to save Cutler and Nak…but…they were making a point about who was left and…the only ones left after them are Cole and Ibushi.  (I also just had a random though that we might get to revisit Jay White and Ibushi in AEW one day)
Fuckin Sweet kit for Penta per usual
They're doing a good job of telling a story through wrassling: QT and Hobbs are physically talented but much less of a team than the lucha bros.
I remember one of the early Darks where QT started doing flips and Peter Avalon angrily tagged himself in and berated him for flipping, saying something like: "that's not wtestling, flippy dippy doo!" before landing no offense and losing.
this is on some very obscure wrestling knowledge shit- Rey Fenix has added the one legged tassels, the only other person I can recall having them is Art Barr…  TL;DR did somebody else influence Fenix style choice of pants
At some point Penta has to reconsider the tassels on his mask.
I love the Lucha Bros, that is all
Pretty please just use Ross for storytelling interviews. He’s great at that. He’s just not good on the desk anymore
That's Caprice on commentary, right? He's so good.   This match fucks.
This match has very much slapped
This match fucking BANGS.
this has been hobbs best performance as champ
The ooool dick kick!
This match put me over on Hobbs
bruh this match ruled
Yoooo I thought that was it
That finish was sick
The “QT can’t wrestle” comments always confuse me.
Finish to that match was crazy. Fun match
Hobbs definitely went up to the kid he couldn’t dap up on camera/mean mugged earlier and was like “dude, you know I couldn’t dap you up and why I mean mugged you earlier”
What a banger. I love OC as the INT champion.   Also: orange punch > superman punch
I don't care what the smarks say, Jade fucking rules
Has Battle of the Belts ever has a title change?
Julia just staring down OC ha
Top tier segue between shows with Julia/ House of Black and Best Friends. Well done, AEW!
Julia's scowl game was on point the whole match, I must say.
I will never not laugh at Orange Cassidy’s video board for his entrance 😂
I kinda love how much JR enjoys OC
Orange is legit having one of the best title runs in AEW history
I really like OC's body of work defending this title, whatever the hell it's name is nowadays. As much as I love Pac, putting the belt on OC and giving him Ramages has made the belt more featured and made Rampages better.
OC is the longest reigning champion in AEW other than Jade. He has been champion for 6 months.
Julia cleaned up nicely
oh man OC vs. Buddy Matthews is gonna go hard
Dark Orange. Blood Orange if you will might be incoming.
Buddy Vs OC is basically OC vs PAC II and you can pump that directly into my veins.
Jamie Hayter's entrance at Wembley 🤌🤌🤌
I like that the HOB make relatively straightforward announcements spooky just because.
JR being shock made me laugh so hard
The girl already has 4 belts. Why not 5?  https://preview.redd.it/ppeqofxwdmsa1.jpeg?width=1768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=789b52d4bc40db2f090bdd17b3e4cf3c66cecf63
Mark doesn't want to join your Scooby Doo gang Lethal!!!  EDIT: WHAT HAVE YOU DONE MARK, YOU ARE IN BED WITH SLAPNUTS
Mark just got Double J’d
SURPRISE YOU'RE IN A GANG NOW.
BILLIE PRAYER CIRCLE
LMFAO this is perfect for Mark and has a lot of opportunity to keep him highlighted for a while until the next storyline
JR continuing the bury talent
It's kinda funny that Billie is the one with the years.
Imagine getting the chance to smack Jade on national television.. now that’s a something
Nick Wayne and Billie Starkz are the future of AEW (probably)
Oh I really wanted Jade to get Jaded
So yeah Tony I'm gonna need a Billie Starkz is All Elite post by Monday thanks.
Ah, shit, the Elite’s down to their young boys
We're a ways past it, but Taya referencing all of the other women who have used the Jaded in the past was really cool.
AYO Cutler and Nakazawa vs BCC?
CUTLER GONNA GO FULL TILT LETS GOOO
Go get ‘em stooges!
Umm, someone should write their eulogies.
Put Danielson and his flaccid peepee in the Hentai Slide, Nakazawa!
Penta actually said "QTV is ass bruh"
Looks like there’s been enough talk
And there it is. Nak and Cutler are gonna die
RIP Cutler and Nak
Lucha Bros are already first ballot AEW Hall of famers if that ever exists.
Give the people what they want and give us back Mark's interviews on Rampage again Tony!
Who you guys got between BCC and Cutler & Nakazawa?
The Darby Strickland match from 2018 (i think) was so amazing when i first watched it I can’t wait for next week
I'm really glad they brought back the main event interview this week.  Also, Penta is not wrong.
Every time I hear Milwaukie I think of that one scene in Wayne's World with Alice Cooper, Wayne and Garth.
I like how we have the TNT champion in the main-event of this quarterly special on TNT but he's not defending his belt.
First, they canceled CornCobTV, and I said nothing.   Then, they canceled QTV, and no nude bodies falling out of coffins were there to speak up for QT Marshall.
Glad to hear Dantes in good spirits, that injury was horrific
Hey we got a Dante Martin update. Awesome
Man, Top Flight just has the *worst* luck  Although at least it wasn’t Darius this time
QT main eventing Wembley. Book it TK.
QT's hair plugs are holding pretty well.
I will not stand for this QT slander from JR.
"Settle down JR."  KEK
Jim Ross having a normal one on commentary tonight
Hobbs is a bad dude
if AEW/WWE ever do business together, I want to see Penta vs. GUNTHER. Just let me have that before the Earth crumbles.
Lucha Bros might be my favorite tag team to watch, in all of Professional Wrestling right now.  If not number 1, certainly top 3
These Lucha Bros are pretty good
Tony being there because he understands JR's references is kinda sweet
That sell by QT Lmao
The whistling the Lucha Bros do is fucking wild
Holy shit Fenix!
Penta's Slingblade is second in today's professional wrestling landscape to Tanahashi's
Just when I think I’ve seen it all in a ring I watch the lucha brothers and get surprised
QT OUT HERE GOING ALL OUT
Lmao JR
My fav tag team oscillates between Bucks and Lucha Bros. Today it’s LB
Yes, let QT eat it
QT gets pretty good reactions as a bad guy and I think he's very good at it too..good work cutie
QT's feet on the ropes and Solo holding them down really had me thinking they stole this match
WHAT A MATCH  FUCKING QT AND HOBBS WORKED THEIR ASSES OFF LETS GOOOOO
The absolute SNAP of that hurricanrana.  Oof.
Hope Rey’s hip is ok. Looked like he was hurting the last 5 minutes
Wow that hardcut to Star Wars thru me off
Sometimes I actually enjoy JR’s raw and authentic commentary. The way he learn new information about the wrestlers during the match, he is representation for the casuals
Why do they have to keep repeating she’s 18 lol
Since we don't know when Kris will be back, give it to Taya
"What she do for a living?"  KEK. JR's commentary is fire tonight.
But isn’t Rampage first??
Let’s go Billie!!!
That instagram Witch better get out of the way of Freshly Squeezed
Julia staring at OC and he doesn’t even care
Fuck it, gimme Julia vs OC for the title
I think I posted cool transition in like, 12 different threads. Whatever. I like that there’s a special event at 11 pm on a Saturday.
Interesting that Excalibur called RUSH the leader of LFI considering the Andrade situation.
lol the two guys in the crowd reacting to the chops
OC is fucking awesome man lol
One thing i’ll say about old JR is his gradual love for OC over the years
Rush is basically a Batman villain in the trench coat
Not enough wrestling brawls happen in trench coats
Trent? And Rush can just have a match about it. Two of the best around imo
Dralistico is having a decent showing here.
OC has been the workhorse of AEW this year. Been fun
I'm liking what I'm seeing of Dralistico
The Nature Boy? JR is drunk.
Somebody get the mic away from the screaming child.
Bryce counting in Spanish is great lol.
OC’s selling is great
This match rules
 That corkscrew kick was 👨‍🍳💋
That beach break to destroyer sequence was great.
Holy shit, OC folded Dralistico with that punch!
Love how Jose always bares his chest before attacking someone.
Tonight’s show has been really good. Crowds been good also
It's astounding how well protected the Orange Punch is.
Buddy vs OC?! Yes please
Buddy does occasionally go back to Melbourne City Wrestling, not a bad choice to actually defend that belt Internationally again
HoB and OC having dueling theme song interruptions.
Put another belt on Buddy
I was waiting for Brody to smash him as soon as he turned around.
So excited for Billie’s TV debut!
Dynamite was an all timer
You know I wasn't that excited for these shows intiially but so far they've done a great job. They've actually had stories advance like 2.0 turning on The Acclaimed, Swerve joining with The Embassy, and now setting up Buddy/OC as the next international title match.   This is what they need to do more with the Friday shows.
Billie will lose here, but I'm super excited to see her on national TV. She deserves it, and this can be a fun little match.
That’s actually very sweet Jay- ahhhh there it is.
Lethal Boyz baybay!!
Mark is the best
Mark getting carnied into jarretts group is funny
Double J trying to appeal to him as one country boy to another.
Mark Briscoe: "I've made a huge mistake."
I’m down for a Mark Briscoe vs Double J match lol.
Okay but I laughed my ass off at the bait n switch Jay just pulled there
Dark Order should have used that strategy back when they were recruiting.
Why don't belts change hands at battle of the belts?!?!
I can really see JR asking folks in back "Hey who left their daughter back here?" lol
Billie Starkz and Skye Blue for a "right to stick out their tongue" match.
Buddy Matthews (c) vs PAC for the International Championship at Wembley? who says no?
I really hope they don’t squash Billie,  but I can’t see Jade keeping up with her for an extended time
Jade is the second tallest woman on the roster, and Billie's almost her size.
GODDAMN BILLIE SLAPPED THE TASTE OUTTA HER MOUTH
“RUTHLESS AGGRESSION”
Emi bout to sue Jade for gimmick infringement
Lol she spanked her
Imagine if this young lady gives Jade her best match
That is a nasty bruise on Billie's leg 😬
It would be really cool if Briscoe does join JJJ but ends up turning them all babyface in the process.  Mainly because I've wanted to cheer Satnam forever.
I’m pleased
Jade having to sell made it better than most of her matches, but the veteran still looked like the veteran at the end of the day
Taya just doing things in those heels
I'm disappointed that door wasn't superkicked down
ITS BRANDON CUTLER TIME!!!!
The Elite need a Kota Ibushi
Well, looks like Nakazawa and Cutler have signed a death wish.
Cutler and Nakazawa comin' for a piece of the BCC!!!!!
Those 2 are about to die in the ring
Oh cool, the BCC are gonna absolutely slaughter Cutler and Nakazawa. That should be pretty good
They're gonna get their asses kicked and then get saved by Kenny and the Bucks. That'll be fun.
Nakamura and Cutler preordering their funerals apparently
Harley Cameron, respectfully
Pentas gear is🔥
Nak & Cutler are going to die.
P-P-P-P-Powerhouse
**P-P-P-POWA HOUSE**
IT’S TIME!
That guy with the Cody loses sign. I swear...
QT just got off his shift at Hardees/Carl's Jr.
I'm glad Caprice is here.   Always cool when him, and/or Ian make AEW TV.
QT love or hate him can wrestle his ASS off
We definitely need 2 hour live Rampages going forward hopefully in a earlier time slot
9 out of 10 orthopedic surgeons prefer Lucha Bros matches.
That springboard over the top, off of the second rope by Fenix was smooth as butter, and commentary didnt mention it
Never thought I'd feel the need to say this, but AEW needs more sponsors. I can't take these same five goddamn commercials.
QT channeling some Hakushi
Was that a fucking orange crush?
That powebomb looked crazy
Excalibur got stumped by that one lol
QT doing flippy shit is a troll, right? twice he's done handspring stuff in this match
DDP never had to worry about that!  Well I guess against a luchadore.
In kayfabe I feel like winning more belts would be a pain in the ass as it's just more work as a dual champion.
This is great
Penta's off his game after Kittle's betrayal.
RIP Alex's balls.
Damn they did everything but throw Cole Karter at them.
This The Office stable will grow with time just like J.J/Satnam/Lethal
Ray is incredible!  Great match!  Also, fuck QT
Fun night of wrestling
Great finishing spot!
Best BotB so far by a long way. A lot of fun was had by all.
I looked at the time and honestly thought QT was getting that pin.
God DAMN Fenix is good
Appropriate pinfall victim is appropriate
Well that was two hours that was more entertaining than I thought it would be from the match lineups.
JR dripping in sarcasm all night was the best lol
JR has been awful tonight
Are y’all really trying to imply Jade is creepy for wrestling an 18 year old wrestler?   Christ talk about chronically online
Holy shit! I'm gonna be at the show next week and I get Darby/Swerve and OC/Matthews.  Fuck. Yes!
“18 years old?!” FUCKIN HELL JR LMAO
Hey, did you know Billie Starkz is 18? I don’t think they’ve mentioned it yet lol
Every time creepy JR mentions that Billie is young or 18 take a shot and then get alcohol poisoning
I will not allow this QT slander
QT is legit a super solid wrestler, and that somehow gets lost every time he's in a match. Lol
Julia is right to not like OC’s theme  Where is my Mind was better.
God, I was graduating high school when Billie was just born.  *sigh* Fuck, I'm old.
This feels like Jade wrestling an 18 year old.
She didn't need this long of a win streak or title reign but I don't care what anyone says, Jade's awesome and has come a long way. She's better than 90% of the women wrestlers out there in just her first couple of years.
"18 year old Billie Starkz is 18 years old..."
LFG ELITE B TEAM
4 hours of good wrestling tonight, can't really complain
Happy Bill Night!
I would love if  this somehow leads to someone from HOB challenging OC for the belt
OC making zero eye contact lmao
I think Julia needs more aggressive moves added to her moveset
Dralistico is a dope name.
I’m just here for Billie
OC has held onto that International title for a while
Someone will win the title off OC eventually. Will it be Rush?
Is there a rule that everyone who wore the Místico mask needs to keep -"istico" in their name?
Rush's trenchcoat is sick
Orange "The Thinker" Cassidy.  Rodin would be proud.
Rush looking quite dapper I must say
Hell of a way to start!
Five and Ten have kind of petered out since leaving Dark Order.  Though Five is at least in a slightly big angle in Impact.
I believe Dralístico is Dragon Lee and Rush's brother.
Wait, so Dralistico is also Rush's brother? I hope La Bestia has had his DNA catalogued.
Orange quietly praying he's nothing like the Nature Boy...at least outside the ring.
"oh, well now JR's just drinkin' the fuckin' Kool-Aid" -Jim Cornette after hearing JR compare OC to Ric Flair, probably
Bryce counting in Espanol XDD
Tony’s really gotta stop with telling us what someone is saying when we can very clearly hear them.  does it way too much.
That's my champion.
Dralistico really does seem like a mix between Dragon Lee & Rush so he has potential to be my favorite wrestler but he's not as crisp. Is he relatively new compared to thos two?
Good shit
Think that’s the best I’ve seen out of Dralistico, seems to be doing a lot better not forced into someone else’s gimmick
I like oc but I’d like to see a new champion be crowned and built up.
Buddy works too.
Yes Buddy
Buddy vs OC is gonna be a good’un
International Title and Trios Titles seem to cross paths a lot.
If it’s Malakai, no way he loses. Buddy though…hmm
Buddy?? nah give me Malaki vs OC god dammit
Malakai needs more gold!!
buddy two belts
I haven’t heard Buddy’s voice in a minute and forgot he was Australian
HOB just collecting belts now.
Oh fuck I may not survive OC v Buddy
https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/12f7qu4/live_aew_battle_of_the_belts_april_8_2023/jfeh91b/  CALLED IT (kinda)
Would rather it be Malakai vs Orange but Buddy vs Orange will rock just as hard.
Pretty sure JR was kayfabin that last one, guys
Just remembered Daniel Garcia made Brody tap a few weeks ago, anything is possible
This is *not* Billie's "national television debut."  We just saw her compete against Taya Valkyrie for the MLW Women's Featherweight Championship.  For only being 18-years-old, she's certainly getting a lot of title opportunities!
Strap the AEW title on Mark in the future
Just want Billie to get a chance to show out/get a shine tonight. Shes too darn good to be squashed
Mark! Hi Mark!👋🏻
Mark is fine with Jay, not the rest of Team TNA.
Billie getting a full entrance? I dig it!
OH YES FUCKING DREAMS DO COME TRUE HAHAGAH
Mark Briscoe is joining Jeff Jarrett?
Oh no Mark
"No jokes please."  LOL
Man, when I was Billie’s age- actually, I was getting ready for college, so I guess it wasn’t really wasted, but still.
lol that was fantastic
Billie wss told not to come out with the bunny head lol
Mark Sterling quietly rejoined the baddies
Seeing Smart Mark with Jade again   🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
Everybody is somebody’s kid JR
Mark is great. Dude is absolutely an inspiration. Can't wait to see him win a big singles title.  Jay Lethal and Mark working as a tagteam can be exciting.
*Johnny Ace Voice*  "You need to hire athletic 10s JR!"
Mark Briscoe would legit be quality with Jarrett and Satnam Singh hahah
She doesn’t wrestle like a champion though, sadly.  Go Billie!
Somehow Jade doesn't seem that much bigger than Billie
Some time there might be a surprise title change where someone unexpected like Starkz becomes champ. But I don't think that time will be late on a Friday night
I want to see billie vs jamie at some point
With all of these non stop Burger King ADS here is the best version https://youtu.be/VuQ2fG5yLQU
Hell yeah!
Jade retires when she gets handled by a woman in green M&M boots.
I wouldn’t mind Jade as much if all of her matches were like that.  She’d be like 45-0 if you removed all her wins over Skye Blue, right?
Billie looking like she needs a TK tweet after this.  She's looking SHOCKINGLY good. I knew she was good and super talented. But this is orders of magnitude better
I like that they’re using this BotB to advance storylines
Cutler getting promo time hell yeah!
Oh them boys are gonna die
BCC vs. The Stooges when?
Tell ‘em Brandon!!
>They're just bullies  LMAO Brandon pls.
Cutler getting a talking role!  Inspiring.
Damn! Cutler and Nakazawa getting tough!
They are for sure cutting for the BCC next week
I can't wait for Jedi Survivor, to be  free to play on EA Play.
Mark Henry getting TWO paychecks today.
There we go, an interview with Mark again
No need to be polite, JR.
Caprice!
Penta  Must  Strut
Hobbs is Deebo
Bred Penta must be a thing going forward
Time to Main Event QT!
WHAT AN OPTIMISTIC KID jr please don't do this to me
“Marshell my ass” I know it’s spelt wrong.
spicy chicken fries chicken fries with heat
Hobbs can't take an enziguri or a backstabber?
So Far Away.  Speaking of Dire Straits.
You get a kick and you get a kick
QT loves doing handstands
Give em the belts!
Wtf happened to Fenix's hip?
Who is the blonde in the QTV group? Does she wrestle?
Well that was just a tad bit overbooked but that was good!
Beautiful finish!
"Right in the cajones!"  KEK!
I thought they won
Penta and Fenix are everything, man.
HOW OLD IS SHE JR?  PLEASE TELL US ONE MORE TIME
“What does she do for a living?” GET SEXIST GRANDPA OFF OF THIS SHOW
QTV is the shit
I'm starting to get try-out match / "is All Elite" vibes from this.  Might explain the random timing for announcing Skye Blue, they didn't want to leave her out when Billie suddenly gets signed.
i love this timeline when Cutler and Nak get a tv match
J.R is so uncomfortable cringe tonight. A chiclet, who would have thought?
JR makes me nervous everytime he’s about to talk about a female wrestler
Why is there no pinned thread for this or Rampage?
JULIA NEEDS TO SEND BLACK AFTER OC AND THE IC TITLE
Oh no, Jim's not done any reaearch on Billie Starkz
So... Orange beats Buddy, then Brody, then loses to Malaki... then Best Friends go over HoB either later for the Trios \*or\* in an unsanctioned match for no titles?
We know shes 18 JR…
Anyone catch how old she is?
JR is horny
Yknow i don’t care anymore, i’m ready for Jade to be dethroned.
Cutler reminding everyone why he's in the Hall of Awesome.
AEW keeps giving us the best graphics
Dynamite next week is looking dope
Very fun live! The funniest moment was during commercial break of Rampage where Dasha asked if we thought any belts were changing hands and everybody yelled “no”
They say that you either die a hero or live long enough to be a villain.    I think we all know where JR is at after tonights performance.
JR just hit a "my ass".  Mans is having an epically bad night on the mic
Boy Jim Ross sucks tonight.
great interaction
Why was that a sign of Pumpkin Cassidy?
Julia to beat Jade.
Ring crew work fast
Never seen Dralistico, excited for this
Rush wearing the bad guy trenchcoat to perfection.
Turtleneck Rush looks like a menace
Dasha is real damn good at intros for the Lucha talent
I wonder if Preston Vance is learning spanish
Damn I love Dralisticos mask!
if Dralístico wins does he get backpack too?
I though Dragon lee and rush were brothers
Dralístico never liked it when Ultimo Guerrero would get more cheers than him on FantasticaMania tours either
This should be Vikingo going in there and taking the belt off OC. TBH  Run it back at Wembley.
When they showed the TBS title match, the belt in the background was the international title, not the tbs title.
OC using such brutal chops and then switching it up with a soft one at the end is great ring psychology right there
I might've asked this before but is Dralistico part of the Mistico lore? He's got a similar mask.
He's special, so special.  Give it to him.
LUCHA ORANGE
I think Rush might have got most of that, but I imagine it’s happened before
lmao Jose is such a little shit with the hands in pockets
Oof, Rush ate a boot to the head
Speaking of Mistico, whatever happened to Hunico?
Nature Boy and Orange Cassidy in the same sentence. Never thought I would hear that.
HOLY SHIT???
Is that guy in the front row cosplaying magazine cover TK?
Jose is so underrated 😭
It took me way too long to realize there was a separate thread for this even though I read the notification before Rampage.
Why is Jose's shirt open
He Drillistico'd his ass.
OC vs. Buddy LFG!
OC: k
Buddy as a double champ??
GIVE IT TO BUDDY YOU FUCKS
FUCK YEAH BOIS  THE HOUSE ALWAYS WINS BAYBAY
Yep, Malakai is about to take this title off of Orange and continue the legacy of Pac with holding both the International and Trios titles.
Billie clears
I can't see Buddy winning. It'd be kinda weird if the guy who's usually presented as the weakest was the only singles champ
Billie Starkz getting a hell of a TV match
they're explaining who billie is to JR during the commercials
Dam fun night of matches
LEMME SPLAIN SUMPIN TO YA!
She's enamored with Mark Briscoe here
Mark Briscoe vs. The Jarrett Gang? It'll be entertaining at the very least.
Lmao
Mark rules
When your friend has to bring his 4 little brothers to the function
Lmao ok, you got me good
What’s the over/under on someone costing Jade the title tonight?
Hell yeah, I was afraid Billie wouldn't get a real entrance
 Goofy mfs
Lol Double J
Cody loses sign
Let's go! Billie show out!
Billie is so happy to be there
Lol Aubrey’s reaction
Damn, pulling a Chyna
Well, I guess Mark Briscoe *was* in TNA for like a cup of coffee...
Every time Jade does that kick up I think she’s going to snap her ankles.
Rodriguez: In there cookin' like a mother
Is Billie Starks All Elite yet?
A good learning experience for Billie all in all
COWARDS
They need to turn the audio up for Taya's entrance I can't hear it
Taya doing spots in those boots. That's talent in itself.
I feel like it should be Showcase of the Belts instead of Battle of the Belts
Taya should wrestle in those boots
Al Scoops?
I think Brandon could probably take that mask off by now.
Maybe Nak wouldn't get bullied if he'd stop taking his underwear off in public places.
missed Jade's match - how was it?
Who is the women with the QTV gang? Is she a wrestler?
I'll never not be hyping up Mark Henry! Call on, you magnificent giant!
QT is so eating the pin in this match.
Prayer circle!
BUDDY MATTHEWS
Oddly looking forward to stooges vs. BCC.
PPPPPPPOWERHOUSE AND QT BABY!
Caprice yay!
I would say “you don’t know where that’s been, Penta” but it’s a new belt, so he definitely does
Lol whoop QT’s ass!
I stepped away for a min. What happened to Dante?
He broke his tibia right. Man I don’t know if he’s ever doing the high flying routine anymore. Makes me sad
New ROH title designs make me sad the Women's, TV and Six-Man Tags look out of place now. The original 3 share the same design, while the other 3 should share a different but similar design to highlight the different ROH eras.
"Your a big motherfucker."- Rick Ross, probably
all the wrestlers in the world and QT gets the diamond cutter lol
What happened to PAC?
Qt not being able to keep up already what a surprise
Did anybody get the license plate on that truck?  - Penta
How you wrestle in a mask with tassles and shit everywhere is beyond me
Ring mic loud as fuck tonight
Marshéll
Hobbs down for a legit ten seconds to let the other spot go
That Fenix hurricanrana reversal from a vertical suplex was sick!
Going slightly overtime
JR. Fuck. It’s time. Seriously. It’s time.
I'm completely fine with Taya finally being the one who beats Jade.
J.R., are you drunk again?
Starkz looks like she bought Asuka's old gear.
I asked for an 18 but they drew an 81
Maybe Nakazawa brings in those naked dudes he fought last week to help lol.
I would love to see Starkz vs Sakura
Hobbs is a STAR!!!
I just can't imagine being told "he's going to put his hands in his pockets, you're going to look like a putz, and you need to sell your ass off for him"
We're on Battle of the Belts 6 and there has been one title change over the course of the last 5 events.  Looking at the card I'd like it to stay that way, but damn what's the point of these events?
JR is gonna be a wreck and it’s past his bedtime
Not bad at all for a raw 18 year old kid. She’s got a bright future
Mox knows pain but, doesn't know the pain of D4 dice. Don't worry Cleaner Cutler's got this!
For fuck's sake, JR. We get it. She's young.
How many different names are there for hardcore matches?
Who just snarked about Android phones? Lol
I am noticing a lot of the enhancement talent from Wednesday night in the crowd tonight. (I was at the show on Wednesday)
I feel like I always forget what Buddy's voice sounds like, and am then surprised when he talks.  &#x200B;  That's gonna be a banger though. And while I am a big OC fan, give Buddy his flowers. Dude does actual international stuff down in AU
Someone cancelled picture in picture.
does anyone know how old billie is btw?
Double kick to the back of the head. Easy there. We don't hate Jade that much. Lol
Mark Henry stayed up late for this.
How has Alex lasted this long with such a cool tag team? What's he blackmailing you with TK?
Yet another battle of no belts tonight
Preston Vance has more back acne after joining Rush. Coincidence? I think not lol
JR speaks and 2/3 times no one responds.  Uncomfortable.
JR doesn’t know anything 🤦‍♂️
JR:"(Jade) could be a champion as long as she wants."   Yeah, we would prefer not.
I would follow Brandon Cutler into the mouth of hell...  OF HELL.
Is this today?   Damn.. ratings for this are gonna be rough.
OC would look good in Olympic AJ 7’s
Man that close up staring down Stark made me look up Jade's age, 30 - black truly don't be cracking (unless you've been as stressed out as I am)
This crowd looks tiny
The roh announcer Bobby Cruise so much nostalgia
JR wants to say something that will get him fired but is trying not to.
JR blowing by the cues, come on man
Even post watershed this violence is uncalled for
Did JR just realized that OC is blonde?
I think we'll be seeing OC vs Pac in London. Pac will win so that he can defend it on indies in Europe.
Need Billie to take the belt off her later ngl
i want rush to be the one to dethrone OC
I wonder what JR's gonna say when Nick Wayne shows up...
I'm always surprised they don't bring these showdowns to Dynamite.
Dynamite is STACKED
In order to see The Lucha Bros & Hobbs I also have to watch QT??  https://preview.redd.it/pg08zo07imsa1.jpeg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a260b8b81ec0f14521c78b779ece54845dbae073
QT taking his rightful place in the main event of a show is always great to see
Lol who the hell is legal?
Yeah, a mess of match, but highly entertaining.
It’s wild how bad aew was just recently and then turned it around so fast
Bill Goldberg vs Hogan this was not
The fact that Billie is more over and a better wrestler at her age than your champ is just sad
Jade knows the male wrestling audience...sadly
Return of Dragon Cutler?
I’m sorry, but as someone who’s only a year younger than Billie, Jade doing what she did kinda creeped me out.
JR just found out Dralistico is the brother of Rush, good job.
JR didn’t know that Dralistico was the brother of Rush 🤦‍♂️
JR in 2023 is the worst announcer in all of the major companies. JR 2023 version is terrible
JR worried if he said anything to or about her.
 Man nobody wants to see that
A *literal* schoolgirl gimmick.
Jade is such a motherfucking STAR, man
What happened to Jade eyelashes?
Wish the diamond backing TNT Championship was back
QT sponsored by Hardee's/Carl's Jr?
I really hate how Cody nepotism got that talentless hack QT marshall a job and instead of using him as a jobber they out here handing him main events
[removed]
Taya barely touched Jade and that knocked her out lmao
is fucking QT the main event??
that botchy reverse lmao at JR saying "rough" instead of botch
It feels awkward with JR on commentary sometimes. Like Tony and Excalibur are sometimes quiet in their reactions to him.
She won't make 19.
Penta’s taunt spam is so annoying
Orange Cassidy. Freshly Squeezed.
Julia no like OC
Orange Cassidy?
Loved that transition
Forgot to switch over!
That mask is kinda spooky, hopefully he’s good
Who dis
🍊 4life
I mean, does Jose count?
His mask makes me think of Huggy Wuggy.
Why doesn't Dralistico add the dragon mouth to his actual mask
Dralistico might be the p4p sparkliest wrestler. That jacket was super sparkly, his whole kit is.
give me Rush & Dralistico or Vance vs FTR
so Dralistico used to be Dragon Lee, but became Mistico when original Mistico left to go be Kalisto... is that right?
Pat McAfee looking jacked at ringside
Middle School
Lol
Around the world!
Vance and OC are brothers
They never saw it coming… 😂
Sweet jesus that headbutt was loud
Remember when the Canadian Destroyer was the big move that could put anyone away for a few minutes?
Jose is compromised
Dralistico, Rush, and Dragon Lee. What a family of professional wrestlers.
Do it. Give Malakai all the gold.
lets gooo
This has gotta be it. Double champ Buddy! No way in hell are the HOB losing the titles so soon right?
OC vs Buddy on Dynamite?
red bull has the best commercials
It'd be fun if a stable held a midcard title and said they would all defend it. On dynamite, B will defend. On rampage, C. Pay per view, A steps up
Come on Billie Starkz!
Lot of ROH crossover this show
It's still weird to say "This hillbilly is from Delaware".  And sorry for using "hillbilly".
Nice little story there i like that
Lol
I hope Billie gets some offense in
Cody lol
Smart Mark!!
Fuck you Nicholas.  She's out there winning and challenging for titles and not using -math- as an excuse to not defend titles.
Lets go Billie!
Though Nicholas is already Shawn Michaeling at a 20 year old level.
Ouch.
Damn that kick connected
Alex Marvez for BTE champion
Dream team of the Elite
Yo QT just said his own last name “Mar-Shall” is that canonically the first time he’s mentioned it? Probably not.
I would be upset if QT gets a belt before double J
Aw.. I wish they got Rick Abani as the 3rd commentator
Always nice to have Caprice on commentary
Lucha Bros always looking phenomenal
QT ABOUT TO STRETCH THESE TWO WIMPS
This QT Marshall kid is pretty good
There's been more ads and picture in picture than shows earlier on TV. It's been frustrating
Oh man, the goths I know would be all "Jefferson Starship, hell yeah!"
Absolutely. Saw her in GCW with Bryan Alvarez and Tom Lawlor in Chicago and it ruled.
See also, Dax being a jabroni solo and an unstoppable force of nature in FTR
Were at the point where that high school student is more experienced than the champion!
Definitely held her own tonight
I loved that there was no kayfabe reason for Alex going spooky druid, he was just being a supportive friend for Penta Oscuro
I loved Count Chocula Alex and Spanish Inquisition Alex
AEW has been great most of this year. It's a great time for pro wrestling.
goths are so supportive of each other
Taya should do it. Taya would rocket to the top and give her credibility overall. Athena probably should have won it before.
Like Penta said the best tag-team in the universe.
I don’t usually don’t pay attention to him, but his commentary has been particularly terrible today.
> JR is super offputting ~~in this entrance segment.~~
Our favorite midcarder
HOODWINKED
Hoodwinked!
"It's not a masked luchador when we do it"
Dralistico is Rush’s brother so I guess family gets a pass lol
Penta might be the coolest guy in wrestling.
It's cool that someone else noticed what good storytellers they are even while they're doing their flippiest of flippy shit.
No add more!
I always picture him doing the nod of "I can't admit this but, we're cool" in those moments haha
PAC as well.
Sheamus will be jealous that his chest won't be cut open by all the chops
If you want to see a chop fest, it would have to be Gunther vs Roooosh
Tony: "He has good days and bad days..."
One of my favorite things they do lol.
That lady is all of us really 😂
"The Thickburger" QT Marshall
Yes you will
I love the Pixies but this fits his character better.  It's the opening credits to Wet Hot American Summer which is where his gimmick is from.
I think she has on the indie scene
Harley Cameron. She's an indie wrestler but she's actually more successful as a singer. She was involved in those music videos that Shotzi and Scarlet did.
You know when AEW clearly got their sights on someone to sign full time. Especially when they showcase someone and give them a lot in a match.
JR and live commentary may be a thing that should be done sadly.  Can't hide his moments where age has caught up to him.
They are. Dralístico is their other brother
Working in Mexico under the name Cinta de Oro
Picture-in-Picture
The better question is why isn't it open sooner he can't hide those guns
Might lead up to OC vs. Malakai
Wasn't bad, wasn't outstanding, perfectly fine.
alright overall, like two and a half to three stars? a little awkward at points. Hopefully they run it back and it’s smoother.
It was solid in terms of a Jade match. Billie got tons of offense and it had impending signing vibes.
It was okay.
Better than usual. Starkz vs. Jade is worth running back when the two get better with experience.
Fine . Billie looked very good though.
Is this a Seinfeld joke?
He broke his leg on the Supercard PPV last Friday, underwent surgery this week.
Took a destroyer through a stack of tables at SuperCard, and his foot was facing the wrong direction after.
He's a bastard who likes to be back home from time to time
Recovering
Maybe you're trying to hard?
Pheromones will destroy BCC!  Mox about to get a face full of ass!
[It's your lucky day!](https://youtu.be/EKhQSWgMTIc?t=3010)
you missed it, it was on dark/elevation & was a hellova match
They had a great match on DARK some weeks back, go check it out
I'm pretty sure they've had a match already on Dark or Elevation at least a month or so back
Oh yeah, and he weighs 160lbs
And realistically, there won't be one tonight either
She has more experience than Jade.
Wouldn’t exactly call her “raw” considering she’s pretty experienced in the ring herself.
How many towns are there in the world? That many. Chicago street fight, Philly street fight. Peoria street fight. Detroit rock city street fight. Barrow street fight. Etc etc etc
infinity, there’s infinity names
He also only gets 2/3rds into his own sentences before he just gives up and stops talking
Nick Wayne and Billie Starkz will be an unstoppable mixed tag team
Fenix and QT
AEW wasn't bad recently.
Yeah why is a firey young babyface getting cheered over a cocky heel, what's going on here
What's sad is using Billie to put Jade down  Jade has vastly improved and continues to seemingly with every match. She has an amazing look and physique. She's a star that's why she's the champ currently  Billie is also an amazing wrestler and I have 0 doubt she'll be a champion one day
As someone who is Billies age, it weirded me out too
(I didn't know either)
it's all natural, baby!
[removed]
That's a really fucked up thing to say
He has to get his momentum meter up to use his finisher
It recharges his health meter
He’s just trying to get heat yakuza style
I love it.
🤣 I know that just bothered you
Dasha is Latina can confirm.  I swooned.
Dralístico was original Dragon Lee.   He became Mistico II after Mistico left CMLL to become Sin Cara.   His younger brother then becomes Dragon Lee II.   Years later Mistico I returns to Mexico as Caraistico or Mysteziz or something confusing like that.   Mistico I and Mistico II occasionally team up I think.   Some time later Mistico II leaves CMLL and becomes Dralístico which is a mix of Dragon Lee and Mistico.    I think that's it.
Almost, Mistico became the first Sin Cara, and Dralistico's little brother took the name Dragon Lee at that time. Rush, Dralistico, and the current Dragon Lee are all brothers.
OG Místico was Sin Cara.  Samuray del Sol was Kalisto.

That Nicholas is really coasting off that title run.  ;)
18
I would be upset if he ever gets a title
Led astray!
Didn’t stop them from unmasking Dragon Lee before he went to wwe lol
And beads, and a bell, and a mud guard, and one of those things to put in his spokes that makes him sound like a motor-Penta.
All I need to know granted Billie is relatively experienced and Jade is still getting there. Can't wait to watch back later.
Holy shit! Thanks for the update
Is national television ready for “we want asshole” chants lol?
I had to be reminded. The original LFI in ROH was the 3 brothers, their Dad and Kenny King.
Lmao. 😂😂😂
Idk why I always get those two names mixed up off the top of my head. but if I see the masks I know which is which.
They were ready for ADD chants!
![gif](giphy|3oKHWCVJHorZfXrUTm)  Triple H opening Smackdown with Brawling Brutes vs Imperium after Raw had 30 minutes of wrestling
“Why riddle” People literally forgot the bloodline tried to kill riddle
At this point the whole WWE roster is gonna join up Avengers style to take down Roman aka Thanos 🤣🤣
Dominik is the best heel in the business brother
I'm gonna enjoy this, if this is the Bloodline having 9000 different enemies and now they're all coming back to bite them in the ass
lmao the difference between raw and smackdown riddle
Broke: Bloodline  Woke: Broline
Unrelated to the show but jfc I cannot believe Shane legit tore his quad… I feel so bad for him, especially with how he seemed legit emotional about the reaction he got. But good lord I cannot think of a funnier McMahon family moment.
Jey breaking the hearts of men, women and children.
All things considered, this show had waaaaay more of a natural flow than RAW did. Nothing felt "filler"-esque.
![gif](giphy|RGqwKLs11po0iCp4dN|downsized)  Let me talk to ya as ~~Max Dupri~~  LA Knight.  YEAHHH
Super fun episode tonight, people pissed at Riddle even though it makes perfect sense for him to be there… bloodline took him out, why wouldn’t he seek revenge ?
Genuinely thought Sami forgot his titles until he unzipped his jacked
Honestly at this point Sami should just be like "Roman is right about you and you deserve to be abused."
So basically, as long as Vince isn’t in the building to implode the script, these shows will be a good time. Lets keep it that way.
Aw man I really though Jey was gonna stick up for Sami at the end :(  Hope they keep teasing the face turn I really want good guy Jey!
I was confused at first when I saw Riddle come out to save Sami until I remembered that Solo was the one who took him out
Triple H is much more into making money than via merch and sponsorship compared to Vince. Like he reformed the LWO, allowing them to sell t-shirts right before their PPV in Puerto Rico.
Vince is legit at the Eagles concert in NJ tonight, haha.
I am pleased to announce that I once again feel inflated. I will inform you all again this upcoming Monday if I feel deflated. Thank you
I ask again; how can Eric and Braun be banned from ringside for no real reason but Solo is always allowed at ringside(besides when he gets ejected)?
Riddle’s run-in would’ve been better if this was his return and not the Miz stuff on Raw
Omg the boos for Dom!
All I want to see in the end is to see a lumberjack match roman vs whoever. At ringside is every superstar roman ever beat and finally when he's thrown over, gives him an ass whooping.
Dom has so much heat you can name an oven after him.
Did I really just watch a commercial about working with cancer?
What’s the kayfabe reason that Solo is mute? Especially when his brothers are so boisterous…if it was the old USO’s I could understand it…
The difference between Raw and Smackdown was night and day, this was a brilliant show, set up future stories, allowed on going ones to continue and hey hopefully the draft shakes things up
The biggest heel thing dom did was grow that mustache
LA Knight is now banned from UpUpDownDown
Damn I haven’t heard heat like what dom got tonight in a long time. That was awesome
ITT: people forgetting why Riddle was "out" for a couple of months
This being a good show makes this week’s Raw such a fucking enigma.
Far, far better show than Raw. Cole was as good as he's been since HHH took over. Not 100% convinced that Vince isn't gonna ruin everything, but this show was a good start.
Ngl, tonight was alright.
Okay. Smackdown is still good.
Quick, someone tell the Eagles to run more concerts so Vince can stay away from the main shows longer! It’s our only hope!
It’s hilarious how we all are gonna be checking the dirt sheets every Monday, Friday and every PPV hoping and praying Vince isn’t in the building.
I’m fine with Vince having “final say” as long as he stays home
Dominic must thank the lord keyfabe isn't really much of a thing anymore or he would have to have full presidential security teams to go anywhere that boy has absolutely nuclear heat
If Riddle made his comeback tonight instead of Raw it would’ve been much more impactful. Wish Raw had some NXT call up instead
RAW needs some serious help in the draft. This show didn’t have Roman, Cody or Brock and was still a million times better.   Ex Con Dom is in the running for most improved, top heel, and the 2023 MVP of pro wrestling right now. I don’t care if they sweeten the boos a little he’s getting louder reactions than anyone consistently.
Every arena in the world needs to have a picture of Vince with and without the mustache that says do not allow this man in. How anyone can watch this show tonight and not see just how much better it was than RAW Monday night. Those people can’t be helped.
(People actually thought HHH was going to announce his departure. Come on man.)
Too many swerves with Jey. There's no way people are going to stay interested in this much longer.
That felt like an actual HHH run show. Pretty good top to bottom, everything that happened made sense unlike RAW, where very little made sense. Which we know is because of Vince's huge involvement.  Now, if the one tweak Vince made to this show was Ricochets match going from a tag to a singles, that's a good change. We just had the 6 Man Tag prior, and we have the women's tag coming up soon after.   The only additional change I would have done, was have an angle post match. They should have had Ricochet get the W, then have Erik run in and attack him from behind. Which then leads to Braun making his entrance and saving the day.   By doing this, you get that pop from the crowd for Braun, and you also give the fans a reason to invest in this program further.   Without that, this was just a random singles match of no consequence. Even if it's been done before, if gives reason for people to want to see this continue again, as I am fairly sure this feud isn't over just yet.
That wasn’t too bad at all. Enjoyable even at times but I tell you what. I’m all in for Dominic Mysterio. Never thought I’d see the day that he gets that over, that was massive heat.
Not going to lie, the reactions are wild with the negativity. I thought this was a good show
Can imagine how hype it would’ve been at mania if Jey was the one who stopped solo from spiking Cody in the neck lol
the women desperately need a lukewarm story let alone a hot story.
So literally nobody in the Bloodline can win without cheating?
Other than what I mentioned on BL, the Dom react was NUTS. Nuclear heat. Go.
Smackdown was overall better than Raw this week
So the plan will be Roman defends both titles till he drops one which is a lesser moment in its self and it be the title his probably had the least amount so he still can hold the other title for a while still
I do not understand all this Matt Riddle hate it makes sense that he's involved since it was The Bloodline who took him out of action
it's getting lost just how over Sheamus is right now. that match was pretty unimportant and the crowd was still waaay into it.
So Brock attacked Cody because he didn't like going on first at WM? Anyone else find that a bit lame?
Was it a perfect smackdown?  Of course not.  But it was a solid B+ and gives me a glimmer of hope
Man jey still got HOPE, he just in position where he forced to kick sami.
I really don't get the booking for Jey rn. Dude should not be this stupid in kayfabe and its so frustrating to watch as they prolong his face turn longer than they should have.
Great episode honestly.   I just want Jey and Sami to be friends man. lol
Jey, you can’t keep breaking my heart.
good we can have Solo in a fued of his own. Bloodline should crumble on all fronts
I hope they don't start back having Riddle do that thing where he's using Randy's move all the time.  It was great seeing LWO and LA Knight.  I hope they're planning to let Liv and Raquel win some titles and not just waste time.  I think Solo will turn on the entire Bloodline before it's all over.
Ricochet got a clean win, and LA Knight was on TV?....YEAH it's definitely safe to say Vince was NOT involved tonight lol.
I really like Zelina Vega as a face, and she could be a great challenger for Ripley considering her mic skills.
Good SD  Brawling Brutes and Imperium have great chemistry together.  Riddle coming outta nowhere had me going WTF   The draft coming could've been done with a press release instead of a announcement lol
Just give Sheamus the IC title please  Way better than RAW, we also heard hospital instead of local medical facility so suck it Vince
Solo is looking more and more like a cheater than a badass
Jey can't turn yet, y'all.  Not until Jimmy is free.
Sami fights someone in the bloodline. Sami loses thanks to shenanigans (probably by Solo). Sami then gets attacked by members of the bloodline. Jey then slightly defends Sami but actually doesn't. Some random geezer that they want to shoehorn into the story (KO, Cody, now Riddle) comes out to stop Sami getting murked by the Samoan spike.  Rinse  Repeat
What feuds do y'all want to see coming out of the draft? My number one is Rollins/Gunther
chekhov's riddle
Sami’s given Jay plenty of chances, stop trying to turn him
They really need to cut Raw down to 2 hours.
I’m surprised Riddle is continuing the feud with the Bloodline and isn’t just doing a lighter Miz feud. Makes me think Orton will be teased to come back to help Riddle down the road.
Mark my words:  At some point, Riddle will say something like "You're Solo? Then that makes me Sohi."
Entertaining episode and felt much less chaotic than Raw. I'm not sure how long they sustain it, but Judgment Day's dynamic where crowds love Rhea but hate Dom with every fiber of their being is a lot of fun.
That PS5 Controller tonight only had 4 more days til retirement  T&P's to that PS5 controller
What is going on with the Riddle hate right now? Aside from not remembering Solo took him out and thinking his appearance was random, I’m seeing a lot of hate for the guy and I guess I don’t really understand why. Like he was an idiot when Vince was still in charge, but everyone seemed to like RK-Bro, and I don’t remember people being this offended by his presence back before he was injured. What have I missed with him? Was it the domestic stuff with the girlfriend/wife/or whatever?
Great show. It definitely redeemed the clusterfuck that was RAW.   I'm happy to see Riddle going after the Bloodline. That feud was waiting there to reheat. I just hope it means the Orton reports are wrong and we're going to see him save Riddle in a month. Which sets up Orton vs. Roman, which I really want to see.  I think Jey dethroning Roman is a great choice. But it seems like they're going to have Jey cost Roman the title instead of winning it. They're going to keep teasing the split with more gaslighting though for another two or three feuds probably.   Anyway I liked the show. I'm happy a draft is coming. Fingers crossed it means splitting the unified belts and also they don't split any tag teams.
So, did the fans hijack the show or did they not care enough to as expected?
Riddle coming for the save made perfect sense storyline wise since Solo was the one to take him out months ago. Also the tease of Jey turning face was great yet again, they keep working us.  Pretty good show today. The Bloodline story is heating up again, matches were pretty good and our lord and saviour LA Knight is still alive. All in all a great night.
I really enjoyed that. Great stuff.   Jey Uso is my favourite character in wrestling and I'm so happy he was the focus tonight throughout.   Jey made another decision tonight that he didn't want to, but imo HAD to.   That pop and that chance of redemption there was perfection and a great tease of what's to come.
My guess is Judgment Day to Smackdown and Imperium to RAW.
The heat for Dom in the arena was insane!! I could hardly hear him. It was so loud. Good stuff!
Sami: I can save him..  Drake songs hitting Sami hard lmao
I like how you say "someone dropped a road case on Kevin" as if Solo wasn't standing over him.
Jey Uso is gonna win MiTB, tease cashing it on Kevin and Sami, but ultimately cash in on Roman Reigns. I don’t know if he will be successful, but that’s what gonna happen during Roman vs Cody at SummerSlam
   Ok HHH is in charge tonight lol
Idk what hurt more tonight. Jey Uso breaking our hearts when he didn’t save Sami, or LA Knight breaking that Playstation controller. Both absolutely heinous things to do.  Anyways, I’ll have one serving of Solo Sikoa and The Usos vs. Matt Riddle and Kevin Owens & Sami Zayn at Backlash please.
Where the hell is bray wyatt? I hope he’s alright and I find it weird how nobody’s asking what’s going on with him
How they going to handle the champions? Some of the biggest stars (Roman, KO, Becky) are dual show champions so if they'd still appear on RAW if drafted to SD or vice versa.   Plus Bianca and Rhea who are show specific champions.
So is Riddle the new guy that this sub is going to try to pretend isn't any good and isn't over?
Smackdown was very logical after the disaster that was RAW. I enjoyed it tonight. Good show.
Can someone let me know if Vince was there to know if I should like the show or not.
Smackdown was better than Raw.  Yeah.  Though that was thanks to more wrestling.   Yeah.  It felt like there was something missing from it, though.  Yeah.  Newness. Fresh story arcs. These these things should begin after Wrestlemania.   Yeah.  And more LA Knight
Great show tonight. The quality and pacing compared to Raw is night and day.   I’m stoked for the draft. Gives me something to get excited about that’s not just another PLE.   There’s nobody that gets as much heat from crowds as Dom. Nobody. That was insane levels of booing I haven’t heard in years.
Why blunt the tag champs' momentum, and have Jey screw Sami over? Explain that one.
I can see Cody winning the Title at Wrestlemania 41- gonna be quite a ride but it’s just around the corner!
Riddle vs The Bloodline actually makes complete sense. He has history with them, he’s main evented a PPV before, and his one title match against Roman was thrown onto an episode of Smackdown. Have him wrestle Solo at Backlash and then King of the Ring will be his big title shot
I did not have Riddle returning in the main event scene. Good for him
I still don’t understand Rollins’ segment this week- it was like a glitch in the Matrix
wild that Riddle was on track to being a pornstar but is now getting the Post-Mania return push
I would not be surprised if Riddle had no clue he was coming back tonight and just woke up wearing that attire
So Riddle saves Sami.   But Riddle was friends with Ezekiel.   And KO hates Ezekiel.   ……  KO isn’t going to turn on Sami, he’s going to turn on everyone who tries to befriend Sami, while still remaining loyal to Sami.   A true Face/Heel tag team dynamic.
So I'm sitting here thinking, if Riddle isn't scheduled to wrestle, why is he walking in the locker room in underwear and no shoes?
Diminishing returns for this bloodline stuff. This story has officially past it's expiration date.
Did the crowd chant "Fire Vince" or whatever?
Riddle pretty much taking Cody spot in the feud since Cody is busy with Brock now
a really good show. lots of things to look forward to  that reception of dominik was another level. that was an unbelievable reaction i can just imagine him going back stage and everyone being like wtf was that!?   riddle's return was good. solo needs a proper feud. this makes sense. whether we see solo and riddle 1vs1 or a 3vs3 remains to be seen.   was a very entertaining show
I hate you guys . Love you also
Great smackdown. Absolutely fun show.
triple h beat the allegations with tonight's episode
Dam I love watching the Brutes vs Imperium they have so many good matches
Can do without Riddle being in the bloodline feud, otherwise solid smackdown. Interested to see how things unfold with the draft for once
The bar is truly in hell for HHH after Raw 🤣
I can’t take Riddle as a serious threat after he was in full Stoner Mode before he left.  He hasn’t said anything in a mic yet to warrant anyone fearing him.  He was making weed jokes and playing a comedic foil to Elias
A draft?  People are on both shows anyways.
Feels like draft season alright. They're holding off any major update on storylines until draft is over.
Some thoughts:  - Opening match was good stuff, I hope that Sheamus beats Gunther down the line for the IC title, he’s been doing such great work for sooo long, he deserves the Grand Slam.  - Ricochet won a match. Good for him 👍 - Only one women’s match on the show…. it was fine for what it was I guess. Can’t believe I’m saying this, but I hope Becky and Lita retain on Monday. I like Liv/Raquel as a team, but them winning wouldn’t really do anything for the division imo. Ronda/Shayna winning them is inevitable, at least if they win them vs Becky/lita the match will have some name notoriety/could be PPV worthy  - Rocky start for the LWO, but it seems pretty obvious they’re gonna get the spotlight at Backlash. I hope that they all get a match on the card and show out, they’re all so insanely talented and underrated to me, it’s cool to see them shine a bit on the MR.  - FINALLY we’re getting a draft!!! I’m really hoping for some call-ups like Grimes, Pretty Deadly, KC2, etc. This could be a good chance to reset the women’s division, hopefully the booking improves.  - Riddle of all people getting pushed since he’s come back is a little random to me. Jey vs Sami was great, right up until the ending that we’ve seen a thousand times before. No matter how good the story is, it doesn’t excuse the repetitiveness of it all imo  Overall very good show, a return to form. Let’s just hope that Raw becomes an abnormality with Vince changing stuff. I’m gonna try and stay hopeful, but if he fully takes over or starts firing my favs again… yikes…
I'll be honest, I don't understand the Matt Riddle hate in the IWC.  &#x200B;  Not only that, but his involvement in this story makes perfect sense as the bloodline took both him and Randy Orton out.
Can see them splitting Solo and the Usos for the draft.
Or did Riddle attack KO so that *he* could be the one to save Sami, in order to get closer to Roman. 🧐  Edit - AND it’ll be revealed HBK-HHH Summerslam 02 style. Digital zoom and all.
Dominic is melting the CA snowpack with that substantial heat that he’s getting
The Jey fakeout got repeated again, the audience popped but it was not quite like the first time....and oh how it woulda been if Jey had turned back then.  but it was another fakeout now.  while the crowd does like the Kevin/Sami team, i still figure Jey and Sami as a team woulda been even bigger.  surely Natalya and Shotzi could form a tag team called the Ballsy Baddies? XD  while the different matches before the last one were nice there was no story stuff.  LA Knight is back, but retreading old ground. that's an expensive controller he broke too. :0  Riddle appears at the end to save Sami, and Riddle of course has his own bone to pick with the Bloodline. they took Randy out, made kids cry doing it, and then put Riddle in the hospital too.  the Brock attack on Cody remains a mystery.  i also saw a theory that the Draft could end up taking one title from Roman and crowning a champ for RAW. doesn't seem likely to me tho.  no hint of Bray Wyatt on this episode.
Why are the Usos and Sami/ KO *still* feuding? They were supposed to take care of “the Sami zayn problem” at wrestlemania, and they lost. That should be the end of it. Why are they still doing this shit? Move on please.
Same Smackdown they announced a draft, Riddle from Raw appears. I would be absolutely shocked if there’s anyone who cares about this draft
Who would've thought leaving VinnyMac 1000s of miles away would produce a massive upgrade on that hot garbage that was Raw.. oh wait!!!    LA Knight .. that's all!!!
I sincerely hope that they're only getting Matt Riddle into this angle to set up the Wargames.   He was great in RK-Bro, amazing tag team, had a lot of chemistry with Orton, but everything he did after that was mediocre. He had one memorable promo with Rollins but the rest was just plain forgettable.   Cody, KO, Sami, Riddle and Rollins vs Roman, Jey, Jimmy, Solo and Brock (?)   Now Brock's a heel again, so it's possible he might patch things up with Heyman and get called in as reinforcements for the WG.  Something like that.   LA Knight still getting no significant in ring promo time, pretty disappointing. It's his greatest strength.
Any show where I get to see jey uso in the main event gets two ☝️☝️ up from me.
Main Event Jay Uso is dead. He's more Bloodline now than man. Twisted and evil.
Good show, the eventual Riddle/Solo match is going to be awesome.
##Man, what a great week of wrestling it's been!  * Wrestlmania On Saturday * ~~Wrestlemania on Sunday~~   * ~~RAW~~ * Dynamite * NXT * Smackdown * Rampage
The Bloodline story is on life support as it is and Riddle is the absolute last thing it needs. It’s actually impressive how quickly they’ve managed to ruin such a good thing.
Wtf happened that RAW was shit but SD was great?
They should split the tag team belts.
why haven't Dom has all the titles yet?
two guys in the row ahead of me hijacked smackdown by chanting “fire vince” during hhh’s promo
Really good show, which is hopefully the norm from this point forward.
So that main event finish tonight....where did I remember that similar Solo interference from?  Can't put my thumb on it....
Solo v. Riddle I'm here for it. Looks like it's going to be by committee  to take us to Summerslam or even Survivor Series to handle some of the Bloodline  Saw maybe half of smackdown, can say it was a Haitch show.
1. Dominik has more heat than anyone on the roster right now 2. We are back to will he-won't he with Jey Uso, please hurry it up 3. WWE, is it Liv and Raquel or Raquel and Liv? Considering the weirdness of this, maybe a double push is on the cards 4. Draft time is back and needed to shake things up, though I think most want to be on SmackDown 5. Where does Riddle fall into this Bloodline story? (Randy coming back soon???)
The rumors of the demise of WWE’s booking was greatly exaggerated.
It's super lame for Riddle to be the surprise return on both Raw and Smackdown
can’t speak for anyone else but i don’t hate Riddle, i hated what they were doing with him before he left. i don’t know if it was on purpose or not but it felt like they just had him come out and disrupt good segments that didn’t have anything to do with him. i was almost convinced it was their way of turning him heel.   the most egregious example was when New Day and Usos were having a promo segment hyping up their last match. really incredible stuff from all 4 guys, then out comes Riddle with his bongo and i was confused and annoyed. i love comedy but not at the expense of a segment like that. so he left a bad enough taste in my mouth for me to not be really that excited to see him back.
I liked triple h too sweeting finn
I’m extremely over with the Jey “WILL HE TURN?” thing now. Feels like they dropped the ball on that and I can’t get myself to be excited about the thought of it anymore
Thoughts:  -We didn't need another 5 minute recap to begin a two hour show especially after we saw one on Raw  -Imperium vs Brawling Brutes was really fun. I'll lose my shit if Sheamus wins the IC title, he deserves something soon. I'm happy for him on how over he is, he's been on the run of his career since late 2020, when many thought he'd be done after his neck injury. All the props in the world  -Ricochet vs Ivar was good. Valhalla should at least try to help at ringside lol sob  -I like the Bruno shirt KO is wearing. Solid segment backstage with Sami   -I'm writing this before the women's tag match but I'm lowkey scared Nattie will turn heel for no reason, she does it constantly and I've been burned too many times by her  -Ok nevermind the pink ascetic to the tank is so cute... but please don't have "Ballsy Baddies" at Nattie and Shotzi's team name  -I liked the chaotic feel of the tag match. Glad to see both teams add some more tag moves to their arsenal. It did feel rushed and it was the only women's match of the night, they should've taken time off of some pointless recaps and give them more time so they wouldn't have to rush everything. I still am not sure if I want Liv and Raquel to win but I like it more than I did Monday. Just a shame these teams will probably be broken up by Backlash considering that happens all the time  -Why do we see face midcarders play video games and get interrupted by a heel like once every other year. Emma has such a mediocre return unfortunately. Nice to see LA Knight though.  -Draft soon. I hated when it was right before Survivor Series because people would fight for a show they just got on. I'm hoping the draft is more enforced instead of people randomly being allowed on the other show without being UWU, Undisputed Tag Team, or Women's Tag Team Champions.  -I loved Damien's hair on Monday fsr. Anyways, I liked the Judgement Day promo. Dom is so hated it's amazing how far he has come. Zelina's mask was really cool imo.  Good tag match. I think Zelina will be the first challenger to Rhea which would be good as Raquel and Liv are busy atm, and Backlash is in Puerto Rico. I like Zelina as a face I'm shocked this run is the only time she has been one in WWE.  -I love the random attacks backstage like what happened to KO. This story has a lot of layers, Sami was trying to be nice and it didn't work out sob  -Good enough Jey/Sami match. Riddle helping Sami is also solid  Overall: Way better than Raw but not as good as NXT. Some solid set ups for the future. Also the crowds are way better on SD than on Raw.  Pros:   -Imperium vs Brawling Brutes  -Ricochet vs Ivar  -Liv and Raquel vs Shotzi and Nattie  -Judgement Day promo  -Rey/Santos vs Dom/Priest  -Rhea and Zelina interaction  -KO/Sami/Heyman/Solo/Jey backstage segments  -Sami vs Jey/Riddle showing up  Mixed:  -LA Knight/Xavier Woods segment  -Draft announcement (since I doubt it will be enforced)  Bad:  -Ballsy Baddies even possibly being a team name   Hoping for next Smackdown to also be good
Tonight's SmackDown was pretty much on par with most of the other episodes since Triple H took over, and gives me hope that the shows will remain the same quality they've had for the past year. I really don't like them involving Riddle in the Bloodline angle since I don't like him as a character, but the whole bit with Dominik's nuclear heat and the LWO vs JD tag match was fire.
Are we allowed to enjoy wrestling again or is this sub gonna throw a pissy fit again
I missed the show - did [fans of professional wrestling make some noise](https://i.redd.it/xwzp4htwjasa1.jpg)?
Great Matches and an amazing Crowd made this a good bounceback from Raw.  Just shows that Triple H can book good and bad shows and we dont need to have a collective aneurysm when a bad one happens.
Felt like a HHH episode for sure. Not groundbreaking but a solid , coherent, breathable show
Damn Vince booked a amazing show tonight I loved it
It’d be real nice if the Bloodline had a breaking point at Backlash because it’s becoming exhausting now. There’s no reason to be this wishy-washy with Jey’s inevitable turn. Six days after losing the tag titles nothings really changed. So let’s just wrap up this Jey-Bloodline  break by Backlash.
Im a little worried woods is doing more videogames and promos then actual wrestling. Is he one of Vinces boys?
Ladies and gentlemen, long-time viewers, fans of BLOODLINE, the role of "Cody Rhodes" will now be filled by Matt Riddle
That was a pretty good episode damn.   Breathing a sigh of relief rn. Did not feel chaotic and terrible at all. Seems Vince really wasn’t there and barely had any input.   Thank GOSH
Very good episode. Doesn’t seem like Vince was anywhere near it
Dominick and Sammy Guevara sound a lot like each other.
Bloodline plot is spinning it's wheels. I feel like they have no idea where to go with it. We already did this "Will Jey turn for Sammi? LOL NOPE" schtick 2 months ago. They missed the perfect opportunity to end it but they need 'muh 1000 days' so now we're just stuck in storyline limbo.
Riddle doesn't have any juice at the moment. Need to build him back  up instead of throwing him into your main storyline.
So can anyone explain the main event? Where are they leading us?  They hinted at man event Jey Uso, and we can feel the tension within the bloodline but why Riddle? What’s the point?
Why is it so hard for them to hold off on Jey's face turn while still not making him be over the top evil? All he had to do was superkick Sami and maybe get in his face and start slapping him or whatever, trying to get Solo to take him out just makes him irredeemable to the point where it hurts him as a potential babyface. Like obviously the point was to callback Solo doing that to Riddle but does that really do anything?
Where are all of the people that said they were boycotting WWE a few days ago lol
I’m sure this has already been said, but a draft allows them to realign the roster in story, which could be happening in order to do roster cuts after the acquisition. I really hope I’m wrong.
was getting sick of Riddle before he went away tbh. would rather someone else in his spot right now. idk who, just not him
Improvement over RAW but I still have negative feelings overall about the WWE product moving forward. I’m just glad that Hit Row will finally be gone tho.
It was a mid Smackdown by what we've gotten used to, but on the heels of that Raw *gag* it was fucking spectacular.
Something interesting: Jey development transitioned to something much less interesting: Fucking Riddle jesus. Talk about a bad penny.   But still, Ghosts of Bloodline Past is a good way to deal with the Solo problem especially as Jimmy and Jey increasingly appear on the outs.
Not great, not bad. 7/10, HUGE improvement over raw.
I don’t have a clue how this “Bloodline” business is gonna end, I thought Cody would beat Roman now they adding Brock to the story and Riddle 🤷🏿‍♂️and let’s not forget Jey he’s a walking time bomb sooner or later he will snap!
I kinda like the idea of Jey and Sami having a broken relationship, something that can’t be recovered. Supposedly when Jey finally faces Roman and tries to gather support, I feel like it would be interesting for Sami to have a disgust feeling for Jey because he’s been telling him this whole time, but Jey just wouldn’t listen, but idk that’s just me lol
In my anger I didn’t watch tonight. Better show without Vince supposedly around?
In the boat that the Bloodline storyline jumped the shark tonight. See y’all in a year.
It seemed like a good episode, but it was hard to tell with those deafening “Fire Vince” chants.
My only wish is that the Sami beatdown would've been the spot for Nakamura's return instead of Riddle
More boring-ass Bloodline BS.  Bloodline fans: is this even entertaining for you anymore? It’s like Groundhog Day.
So did we overreact to the raw this week?
Good show! WWE Lives! HHH in control.
Fuck Riddle. Keep that stoner away from the Bloodline.
Didn’t need Matt Riddle there
Solid episode. Felt more like an HHH show, so let’s hope that Raw was a one off for Vince.
WWE beat the Allegations today
Opening match was a banger. Ricochet vs Ivar was suprisingly good. HHH gave the same speech but announced the draft to an already blended product. Sami vs Jey was decent.  More storytelling with Jey and Sami that is obviously going to lead to some sort of issue with KO. KO getting taken out was probably so Riddle could save Sami. Solo took out Riddle so theyll feud but I see a 6 man tag at Backlash. 7.5/10 show but a 10/10 compared to Raw. Maybe we arent in trouble after all.
I guess we'll have to Brusier-wait for Pete Dunne to go back to the Brusierweight gimmick
Vince is back and all of a sudden Brock and Riddle are forced into the Bloodline story. Can’t be a coincidence.
Im so glad Triple H is booking SmackDown because all the good stuff that happened tonight was him. Its obvious Vince booked Raw. Raw was dumb which means it must have been him.  Now, I can tell who is booking what. Everytime we get a great show its clear Triple H is in charge. Anytime something crappy happens it must be Vince.
bruh do they really not have anything better for LA Knight then fuckin Xavier Woods?
aliens pointing a death beam at the planet, humanity on the line, one shot to guess who was gonna come out for that rescue to save the Earth and i still would not have guessed Matt Riddle
Jey stopping Solo then doing it himself was very cool
Riddle makes sense I suppose, but they should have telegraphed it. I completely forgot about Solo killing Riddle and I'm sure most of the audience did as well.
I missed Smackdown. Is Vince back or did triple proverbially pedigree his creative ability?”
HHH was right about Wrestlemania records. That second night was the worst ever.
Tonight looked a huge course correction from Trips and company. Those two hours flew by. Got the right amount of action and story.   Side note: Pure shot in the dark, but what if this involvement from Riddle somehow results in a showdown between Roman and Orton?
Smackdown saved a lot of viewers from turning off the product going forward
we're back boys
Bwahahahhah Cody's not buried? Do people really still think this good? Lmfao brock destroyed cody because he was mad at going first? Lmfao that's the dumbest f***ing thing I have ever heard. Cody just got destroyed over a grown man having a temper tantrum. That's so dumb. Lol   I'm sorry guys. This is so dumb. That's vince stuff right there. This is garbage.   Hey maybe next week they can do something different like have jey act conficted but kick sami in the face anyway, they haven't done that yet...🙄🙄🙄🙄  A draft? Lol half the folks on the show today were on raw and everyone is jump between shows anyway. What a waste of time. Nothing matters.  Good luck to anyone clinging to hope about wwe I think youre masochists, but whatever floats your boat kids. Enjoy. I'm fully done with wwe.   Got NJW today, really enjoying the library.
Yeah any hype around the bloodline is just dead for me   None of that did anything
Roman, Brock, Solo, Jimmy & Jey vs. Seth, Cody, Riddle, KO & Sami
Yeah there’s definitely more to tell with the bloodline this story still has legs I know Cody will be WWE champion he’s just going to have to wait really
Perfectly serviceable Smackdown. A proper 6/10.  Better than RAW but that bar is lowwwwwww.  I'm primarily an AEW watcher but dipped back into WWE for Mania/Post mania.  I reckon I'll be dipping back out and just go back to watching the big 4 PPVs.  I hate WWE's pacing. People getting a full entrance, then an ad break, then another entrance, then a video package. Its so fucking weird and commercialised.
Show was just ok . Ending sucked as usual
Still on hiatus after that nonsensical wm night 2 and raw
Damn. Vince put on a good Smackdown tonight. Why we were all worried is beyond me. He’s using the power of mustache to tell better stories.
why Riddle? What a way to ruin things. I hope they don't jam him into this story. So stupid
Riddle lmao what is WWE doing
That was classic shit Vince booking like wtf should of just pulled the trigger on Jay / Siko
What a dumb ending . Riddle ? Really?HHH may not be as great as you all think
Riddle seemed random
Lmao the kid cheering for jey last match is now cheering for jey again, and the kid next to him is explaining that that's Austin theory not jey.
Cole literally spelled it out as well by mentioning that Solo put him on the shelf.
Moreover they took out Randy
That's during taking the RAW belts off of RKBro
Tried to kill him multiple times. Roman tried to kill him. Usos tried to kill him. Solo tried to kill him.
You joke, but I’d pop so hard if the last time Roman was the Tribal Chief character was after losing a lumberjack match surrounded by all his enemies and they just all took their shots on him. He still kicks out at 2.9 but
So what is Roman's "you should've aimed for the head" moment?
I genuinely wonder if they *COULD* pull something like that off if they held firm until SummerSlam. Have Roman run down the WWE roster one by one again but this time *more blatantly cheating*. Then you have them post-match beatdown each opponent until they're "hurt" and off the show.  Then one by one at SummerSlam as the full Bloodline surround the ring against *the* guy they want to win, you have all of those people return one by one on the stage then rush the ringside area and beat the shit out of the Bloodline leaving Roman shellshocked to take a Finisher in the ring and finally lose.  If Wrestlemania was the Infinity War, then SummerSlam is the Endgame complete with the "portals" scene of injured wrestlers returning to help.
Now hold up. You may be cooking 👀👀👀
They did it against HHH and evolution back on the day. HHH is repeating the old story. It happened with NWO as well I think.
I think it's just positioning Riddle as the Cody-equivalent but in a feud with Solo instead of Roman.
Nah they all coming back to win the segments and get they asses beat on PPV like the last 3 years
Who has come back to bite them in the ass? Brock, who immediately turned on Cody and did absolutely nothing to Roman? Sami and Kevin, who got taken out and lost to Jey tonight and had to be saved from a beatdown? Sure, Riddle came in and ran Jey and Solo off, but that's child's play when it comes to inflicting any real damage against the Bloodline.
Went from laughing with Miz to kicking solo’s head off. What a difference lol
vince riddle and haitch riddle
If Vince isn't gonna be showing up to Smackdown, just draft everyone to Smackdown.. I'm sure Vince wouldn't notice.
Maybe if Riddle shared some from his stash, Jey would would relax for a minute and see the light
Motherfucker. I bet anything we’re gonna get a 3v3 tag match between Usos and Solo and KO, Sami, and Riddle and Riddle is gonna call their team The Broline. I’m
Now all I want is for Riddle to cut a promo against the Bloodline and tell them that he would like to introduce them, to the Broline.
You can’t help but laugh at it. Man blew his shit out over a leap frog lmao and Snoop ended up pulling off an incredible audible in real time.
Vince tearing both quads is unmatched
Better flow, definitely, but my biggest tell for Vince booking Raw and Triple H booking SmackDown:   Tonight the women got a *two-minute match* and the newly-crowned women's champion (who had the best match at WrestleMania, BTW) got **45 seconds on the mic.**   Less than 3 total minutes in a two-hour show.   About one tenth of what they got on Raw, which could've been better and should've been more, but at least it was something.   Completely unacceptable, and we've been saying it for months now.
That's honestly the main things that's stuck out to me HHH-era. The matches go longer, sure, but the pacing of the shows is just 1000x better. I usually watch the show later and am less tempted just just fast forward through shit more than ever basically, are rarely consecutive segments. I can usually tell what's actually happening instead of Vince's "fever dream" approach to show-writing
ALIVE FOR ANOTHER WEEK YEAG
Exactly.. and with reports Randy is out for a while he can team up with KO/Sami against them 3
I totally agree Riddle's motivation is there to save Sami. The crowd popped and was chanting "Bro", I think the internet crowd don't speak for how well this got over.
I don't get the Riddle hate. Is it cause of who he is outside of kayfabe? I always enjoyed his character and it seems, at least with the BL stuff, he's gonna be a bit more serious.
Thinking back, it did make sense that he'd still be around for the Raw after Mania, but if this really was a 1 of, I can get behind it.   I'd imagine a lot of people are gonna be on Gorilla watch now though lol.
Jinder Mahal championship run was right before WWE toured India.  It's always about the money. Then. Now. Forever.
Lmao, this seems odd as hell. Maybe Omos took him out.
We are all living in Hotel California watching WWE programming lol, jokes aside, great episode of SD
Robert, I have energy versus Robbie, I’m tired
Eric and Braun aren't gonna beat Adam Pearce unconscious for the disrespect.  Solo and Roman would.
>(besides when he gets ejected)?  even then nobody cares. He was standing there in the ring right next to Roman at the end of WM  after he was ejected and the ref gave no shits.
Dom is such an over heel atm. His gimmick change to jail Dom has been pretty damn good.
make sure to also include all the refs that were bumped in all of his matches
Like when the entire roster killed the Undertaker at the 1994 Royal Rumble
For real! I was there and the boos were so loud you couldn’t hear him for several minute. Definitely topped the decimal meter tonight
God bless America
Maybe going for the Umaga/badass vibes? Silent but solid.
Ate too much sour candy when he was little. Permanent scarring inside the mouth. His facial expressions are muscle twitches from the incident.
Have you had siblings? Especially loud ones
He's just introverted
He isn't mute just a man of very few words.
He’s a bad ass like the guy in Gone in 60 Seconds
**The difference was the show not being rewritten on the fly by a certain egomaniac lol**
That’ll teach me to spend $600 on tickets for the raw after mania
I feel like they got me hooked in The Bloodline story again. That moment with Jey stopping Solo's spike was amazing and a great call back to the Tribal Court segment. When Jey finally turns it's gonna be a great moment.
Cause Smackdown is the “A” show. No surprise here.
Sometimes I think people in this subreddit don't actually watch the shows they comment on.
It’s not an enigma Vince was making changes
Sad but true
Definitely didn't feel like he was tonight.
judging by how much the people in the ring were breaking it didnt seem like they were pumping in boos
I live in Portland and was able to go and at least this time, no need to pump it in. Wwe boo'd the ever loving hell outa him. Legit i could feel the stadium shake cause of the boo's.
The difference wasn't due to the talent on the roster. It was due to Vince not being there tonight.
Ex con Dom. Love it so much. I was watching some of his old shit with fruity attire and to see him now is just great
Who said that?  What galactic dumbass said that with a straight face?  God, this fanbase...
It was interesting the first time they teased it. But it got old after the first couple of [times.](https://times.At) At this point they just made him seem like a major a hole
>Now, if the one tweak Vince made to this show was Ricochets match going from a tag to a singles, that's a good change.   More likely  we'll have Braun vs Eric next week, then team vs team ... just standard stuff.
i was there live. it was fucking insanely loud.
Was there live and as soon as he grabbed the mic everyone just started booing the shit out of him to the point where you couldn’t hear anything for a good minute
It definitely was. Especially compared to Monday.
I feel the exact same lol. Jey should've already turned but dude keeps faking and you start to wonder why Sami keeps telling him these things, that he not only should already know, but he ignores anyways.
seriously i wasnt even fazed tonight when he stopped solo because it was so obvious he wasnt actually turning. they overused the jey thing too much and now its too predictable
I'm guessing KO/Zayn/Riddle vs USOs/Solo for the next ppv.
Sheamus post CoC was the hottest babyface in wwe
Especially when he demanded to go first back at 35.
If that was 100% the reason, then why would they say it was a rumour and then go ask Heyman if he knew why Brock attacked Cody?
You did notice Wade also said that wasn't true when he was saying it...it was "a rumor he heard".
I am reading it as getting desperate, doing what he needs to do, to try and stay in the good graces.  I still think it will lead where we think it will, I just hope they don’t miss the boat
They are going to miss the chance too. There is such thing as too much of a slow build.
theyve teased it too many times. when he stopped solo i didnt believe it for a second. for the whole which side will he choose with jimmy vs sami it made sense for a swerve there but now it didnt even faze me. they cant keep doing this shit so much that it becomes way too obvious
I see you’ve never had a friend that’s stuck in an abusive relationship.
Yeah my problem with the swerve where he stops Solo is that it's only logical if Jey's motivation was swerving the audience because his mind was already made up.  A truly conflicted Jey wouldn't stop Solo only to kick Sami and then work with Solo to injure Sami. A conflicted moment like that would look like Jey stopping Solo, Solo arguing a little and maybe Solo implying that if he's not gonna do it then Jey needs to and then Jey reluctantly doing it. Then Solo can get the chair while Jey simply observes passively without fucking leading the charge to injure Sami.  They're playing the character in a way that's losing the nuance from the Rumble split.
It was reported that Mysterios storyline was gonna continue. Tag titles story will continue for 1 more ppv at least till they can switch to bloodline turning on reigns.
Same as every year, which is why backlash has a reputation as rematchmania.
Well, we have Priest starting up with Bad Bunny, for Backlash. which you mentioned, immediately contradicting your entire premise.  We have Zelina and Rhea starting up, for Backlash  We have Liv and Raquel fighting Becky and Lita, which is rumored to have Trish turning on them.  We have Riddle back and targeting Solo.  We appear to have Vikings vs Ric/Braun probably for Backlash  LA Knight vs Woods  And Cody vs Brock.  so...that's 7.
The world will end before they become friends again lol
I mean the powerslam and RKO are Riddle's moves now too the same way the figure four became a Miz move and the pedigree a Rollins move. I do hope though that like Rollins and the pedigree, he saves the RKO for special spots and mostly uses his own finisher.
They have good ring chemistry too, and it's easy to interweave it within the JD vs LWO/Bad Bunny story across both shows, which is convenient before the draft.
And for her first defence..in Puerto Rico.. it makes sense.
I legitimately hate his character just cheating and facing no repercussions whatsoever. I mean he literally fucking injured a fellow WWE superstar backstage and he is still walking around like nothing happened.
Nah, badasses do get the job done by any means. Sami did interrupt the flow of the Bloodline, he has reasons dammit!
The more Jey willingly help Roman, the less sympathetic he becomes. He should be trying to get Jimmy out, like Sami is trying to get Jey out. But we don't see any of that.
I don't know why people don't get this. Jey is doing everything for Jimmy.
The only thing I disagree with is the shoehorning but. None of those three were shoehorned in.
I've said before how dumb everyone who takes on the bloodline looks because they all see the same thing happen to everyone before then and then act completely shocked when it happens to them.  How has no one going against Reigns or any other member of the bloodline preemptively thought about having a way to prevent outside interference?   You figure you'd lock the USOs in their locker room or take out Solo backstage earlier in the  night. But nope....
Does everybody forget that Riddle lost the title to Usos and Solo injured him and put him out of action for almost 5 months?
On one hand - well, it works, so.. milk it for what it's worth I guess.    On the other - if only it wasn't that fucking obvious. During the segments and matches too.     "Oh, hey, Jey stops Solo. What a completely rational thing to do because surely he will now defend Sami, who just so happens to get in perfect superkick position... yessir.."
This is basically my only complaint, but the biggest complaint.  I don't agree with the shoehorning but that's not important.  The important thing is, its the SAME thing for the past what, 3 years?  Why should I get invested in these bloodline matches when I know exactly how its going to end?  Thankfully they worked me and had zero interference in the tag match at WM, but god damn. Its the same shit week in week out.
LA Knight doing anything meaningful
Unfortunately it won’t happen. More space for ads to air in 3 hours than 2.
i think it’s more of a USA thing than a WWE thing if they really did end up wanting to make the change
"Bro, your name is Solo? Then how come you're always with other people?"
Man really snapped in half when all the stores are closed. Can’t even replace it.
People are not used to the main roster booking remembering stuff that happened before a wrestler took a break.
Nobody hijacked anything.  They were busy watching the wrestling.
It was a good show
Tonight kind of diluted Kevin and Sami’s win at Mania and highlights how bad of a decision it was to have Roman go over Cody. It almost feels like the last 3-4 months we’re pointless if we’re just back at the starting point with Jey still questioning his loyalty to the Bloodline for the millionth week in a row.
I’d argue there’s plenty of meat left on the bone but they gotta stop trying to feed us morsels to nibble on.  Just because you have a lot of chapters left doesn’t mean you have to drag out turning the pages.
Wow, I completely forgot Solo sent Riddle away before Rumble
Until they wait too long and no one cares.
I've got Solo winning MiTB and cashing in on Cody right after he beats Reigns for the titles at SS.  Cody finally dethrones Reigns, but gets a 45 second run. The next night on Raw, Reigns gives Solo the finger poke of doom to regain the titles.
The only person that wanna see as the undisputed champion more than cody is jey.
Maybe the Roman Cody II is at the PPV before Summerslam and that's where Jey cashes in. Then at Summerslam, it's the rematch, and after a month of "will be able to hold on in a real match" he retains, ideally shenanigan free, for a giant pop and the decisive end of The Bloodline
I think fans have just wised up and are not jumping to conclusions like when people thought Malakai Black was unhappy in AEW and was going to leave. He had to come put of his mental health break to publicly say he was still in AEW
Oh God they're going to treat Roman like Shohei Ohtani in fantasy baseball where you can draft either Ohtani as a hitter or a pitcher.    One show gets Roman as Universal champion 1st overall the other goes Roman as WWE champion 2nd overall
There's a chance Becky loses her tag belt on Raw, depending on whether they want her/Lita or Raquel/Liv to eventually drop to Ronda/Shayna when they're healthy.
Seems that way lol. I love Riddle.
Better than when people delude themselves into thinking Roman isn't popular.   But not by much.
Looks that way. I'm not as fan of his (I live in boulder, co...I just HATE stoners...)..but dude's great in the ring.
Riddle is good but his character sucks. They take the stoner burnout trope too far and it generally drags down any segment he's in promo wise.
Riddle the crackhead porn star is so cringe man. Keep him out of this storyline.
Supposedly he was seen at an Eagles concert
Funniest comment.
Apparently he wasn't but revised the script remotely but did minor changes
Yeah!
you think roman is holding it for 2 more years?
I’m curious if Riddle can be that serious main event guy … him vs Roman could be a really good match too
That felt 100% like plans were changed during the ad break because Vince is fucking nuts.
Just riddle things
You don't wanna see "Will he turn? Nope!" from Jey for the 9th time????  Or Solo coming into interfere for the win for the 17th time????  Or Heyman/Roman "you have to solve the x problem" for the 28th time???
100%, it won't last til next WM, if it goes beyond SummerSlam it'll be in nWo territory
It is fizzling out for sure. They had the perfect finale fall into their laps and said nah
Yeah it’s just not good anymore
No 100 smarks online aren’t a representative sample
Lol no
Was there live and it was only me and my buddy trying to get it going. The crowd sucked other then for Dom and HHH. You could not get any kind of chant going.
Yeah I wasn’t expecting Riddle at first until someone pointed out that Solo basically injured Riddle
He also beat seth freaking rollins ass.  Thats gimick a goof ball who will wreck you.
Sorta. Most of the rosters are exclusive barring a few inter-brand feuds and the Bloodline. Usually when WWE starts mixing the pool during a brand split, it usually means they're itching to draft and reshuffle the rosters. I imagine Judgement Day would be fully drafted over to SmackDown to keep Finn away from Edge, allow Rey to feud with Dom, and obv keep Rhea on the show.
Might have something to do with the sexual assault allegations
Because the story is not over just because of one match result.
They probably should, but there's no tag teams they can feud with who are nearly as big. Random face/face stuff with the Street Profits or feuding with Alpha Academy or the Viking Raiders feels like quite the step down.
I suppose they are trying carry the feud into Backlash
You asking too much of wwe. Wrestlemania was predictable enough.
I think it’s a kayfabe way to fill a significant amount of slots via NXT instead of them just randomly showing up out of nowhere
Tbh, give him a serious edge, when it was him vs the bloodline he was good , same with seth  He works well when he operates between funny and serious but they just made him total goofball once he was finished with Seth.  Give him some meat to sink his teeth into. Would love a Riddle Solo feud
A wrestling story as old as time.   -signed, someone who remembers Disco Inferno in the nWo
I bet you were popping like crazy when you thought jey was finally turning. Life support my ass
Vince happened
I think thats the point of the draft
I think by the end of this storyline, they will, just because KO betraying Sami is just such a thing. It might take a while, though.
was tag champion
Fed officially ded.
As they should.
Based
Was one of those two guys, this crowd could not get any kind of chant going. The only thing that woke them up was HHH and Dom. I was also the only one rooting for Dom.
So are we making bad shows a Vince thing and good shows a haitch thing?
Riddle wants revenge on Solo who injured him in kayfabe
5. Riddle and Randy feuded with the Bloodline most of last summer and in kayfabe Solo took Riddle out and it's why he's been gone for months.
>5. Where does Riddle fall into this Bloodline story? (Randy coming back soon???)  Revenge/Feud with Solo and nonrandy's back isnfucked
Bloodline wins due to interference.  If it’s worked 1000 times before, why not do it 1001???  Yawn
He was wasted on RAW it seems and would have been amazing if he was saved for right then. They should have just moved the Miz segment to next week and done the match right after it as a surprised match. Would have been better all around.     That said they did nothing for about 2 hours and 45 minutes of a 3 hour RAW show so c'est la vie.
They did, but at Dom and not at Vince.
That's not real. No way lol
This was never happening lol
[.......](https://i.redd.it/ygzstjn4zjsa1.png)
I mean I do think they should do at least one rematch between Usos and KO/Sami, maybe even two. There's no teams on the level of them rn and they need to build one up before they move on to keep KO and Sami's reign from getting weak. But the way they're doing it with the teases that they immediately undo by having Jey just flip back and forth sucks.
I mean, aren't both of his tag partners injured?  Besides, I'm sure dude loves slinging the new game while also plugging his passion project.
He has a match with LA Knight next week
Riddle has history with the Bloodline, was sidelined because of the Bloodline, and he and Randy were the last team to hold the Raw titles before the Usos
Solo broke Riddle's neck a couple of months ago.
The only connection I can make is that riddle and lesnar are two past opponents that can’t challenge Roman for the championship. So sort of an unfinished business or past is coming back to haunt him scenario. It doesn’t explain why lesnar beat the hell out of Cody Monday, but that’s the only connection I can make to why either of them are involved.
If he holds back, Roman will be on his tail. He needs to either leave altogether or commit to destroying Sami.
Doing what they've been doing for the past 2 years...tuning in.
Don’t they already do cuts post Mania regardless of a sale?    I just hope they replenish from NXT
I'm not saying that they won't do roster cuts but if they do it won't be because of the sale. The sale threatens all kinds of office people. Accounting, marketing, that sort of thing. The sale didn't create redundancies in pro wrestlers though.
bro
Put an S in front of Hit Row then you have my exact opinion of them
Hi hater
I feel like this will definitely happen. The Bloodline storyline has been filled with callbacks so they'll call back to Sami having to convince KO with Jey having to convince Sami.
Much better.  Positive vibe.  Fingers crossed Lord Voldemort stays away.
I get that but Riddle has more of a history with the Bloodline.
Hell no, that show was absolute trash. People who decided they were done forever, on the other hand, probably.
No, raw was bad. Real bad.
It was pretty god awful.   Maybe Vince will just ruin Raws going forward.
Riddle and Randy feuded with the Bloodline most of last Summer and in kayfabe Solo took Riddle out.
What an insult to stoners
Bruh didn't hold back
Solo wrote riddle off on tv months ago in kayfabe. It's exactly what he should've done
Yeah just ignore the reason he was out in the first place, that is wonderful storytelling
Yes, we did. Otherwise Sami is eating through a straw.  Solo took Riddle out with the corner chair shot months ago. Him coming out there makes perfect sense.
Definitely needed Matt Riddle there. It would be wrong if Riddle came back and just forgot about Solo taking him out.
I don't know if they'll ever pull the trigger on that. I know Triple H wants to but he's over as Butch. I think at the very least they'll wait until the Brutes breakup and I don't see that happening anytime soon.
"Forced"  Solo is who put Riddle out of action.  Cause and effect.
...Solo, as has been said... took out Riddle..  And Brock?  Brock who Heyman managed for years?  Brock, who Roman's biggest feud is with..so much they literaly have a documentary show about it?
LA Knight needs a feud to win. He'll get that with Woods.
Another Riddle vs Roman banger plus a KOZN + Riddle vs the Bloodline banger just got put on the menu
trips announced a new draft in a few weeks, no explicit mention of anything to do with creative but the show felt way more like a triple h show than a vince one
Back to HHH show, thank god
It was a standard HHH Smackdown.

How? The wrestling was fine but the thing keeping me tuning in wasn’t the wrestling it was the bloodline story
I honestly can’t tell if this is sarcasm
probably not tbh
Take Roman, Brock, Cody, and Seth out, and I think you’re right.
Any time I try and watch WWE that's how I feel re the pacing. It's really not a fun watch
He’s annoying, but I don’t hate him.
The Bloodline took him out of action months ago. It actually makes a ton of sense for him to be out there lmao.
Solo was the one who attacked Riddle and wrote him off in the first place
Because The Bloodline took him out so he's back for revenge.
Solo’s the one who took him out in kayfabe, now he wants his getback. Micheal Cole literally said it once he came out
They’re not jamming him into anything. Solo was the one who put him out of action.
Jam him into? Him and Randy feuded with the Bloodline all last summer and Solo is the one that took him out in kayfabe.
Him and Solo could be fun and storyline wise it makes sense for Riddle to want payback.
The story has gone off the rails not in a good way
Solo took riddle out. Full circle at this point
Solo is the one that took Riddle out...  Continuity...
Solo is the story reason why Riddle was out.   It legitimately makes all the sense
Why ?
Solo is the one that took Riddle out...  Continuity...
Why not Riddle? Solo was the one that took him out for months.
Yeah man, the same Matt Riddle that was feuding with the Bloodline around this time last year and was taken out by Solo back in December.  Just say you don’t watch the show.  https://youtu.be/4zjnillScB4
Solo was the one who attacked Riddle and wrote him off
He had history with Solo who tried to injure him i think
Solo was the one that put him out for 4 months...so makes sense to come out to beat up on Solo.
Solo took him out. Full circle now.
I swear some of the members of this sub has really poor memory or they just watch clips and end up missing a lot of stuff and then complain when some revelations happen.
I choose to believe he didn't do this for himself, but for his best bro Randy
>Moreover they took out *Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrr*andy
Fatal 6 way match where Roman stacks 5 bodies on top of each other and pins everyone.  edit: numbers are hard lol
Ok, but actually, Roman losing the titles in a lumberjack match and then getting his shit kicked in by *everyone,* that I need to see
Gotta be this past Wrestlemania… and then Endgame can be Summerslam where they have every “fucked over” wrestler have their moment beating up Solo/Jimmy/Jey/Heyman, while Cole lists off their relevancy to the storyline… and then ending it with Cody going over Roman. Cinema 🤌🏼
Ngl that would be dope 😂 have every returning wrestler get their own moment of revenge, while Cole lists off their relevance to the storyline, and then it ends with Cody(?) finishing off Roman
Then post Summerslam after taking the L to Cody Roman just vanishes. Returns at number 2 in the Rumble, sets a new elimination record and wins it setting up Rhodes Reigns 3 in Philly, with the chief chasing. Plays the character straight, not a face, but as ridiculous and as egomaniacal as ever, which I guarantee will be over with fans. The better man takes the clean win in Philly, which I suspect will be Cody.
I'm here for it. Solo needs more of a program than what he's doing now.

Shanky, Roman, Omos, Theory to RAW. Everyone else to SD
Pot is legal almost everywhere and not even expensive. Jey can afford his own sticky icky.
It was so perfect I thought it was worked until the press conference lmfao. Like c’mon! A surprise McMahon return (that no one really asked for), a big pop, and a fucking leapfrog injury spot? For a snoop dogg people’s elbow?
That save from Snoop was an all-timer.  People aren't even gonna remember what was supposed to happen in a few years.
I felt bad, but I've never really gotten over Shane beating Miz in their feud and killing  his face run.. I'll never wish an injury on anyone, but I am glad I didn't have to watch Miz put him over yet again.
HHH booking of the women in general is weird, definitely since it was probably the best thing about his NXT stuff
Well tbf the SD women's division is thinner than a Crepe so they could only do so much..
imagine saying a year ago (before cody came back) that the downfall of the bloodline would be lead by cody rhodes, ko, sami, and now riddle
Internet crowd is almost never right
>I think the internet crowd don't speak for how well this got over.  Pretty much what you could say about almost everything that happened from Wrestlemania Night 2 til now.   Fans in attendance, many of them casuals, generally seem to be engaged with the product and have been WWE's bread and butter for years. And they outnumber the IWC in droves.
The internet is always of the opposite opinion of live crowds. For some reason people think because they don’t understand or like something that it doesn’t make sense for anyone else to.
I would imagine it’s mostly the person he is in real life. When he was with Randy being a jokester everyone loved him
Sacrificing RAW after Mania for a good 364 other days of the year seems like a decently fair deal
Also, are we *really* doubting that Vince hasn’t been in Triple H’s ear some of the time while he was gone?   Vince’s creative instincts are actually ok. It’s just that when he has the headset, he starts to overthink *EVERYTHING* , which is how you get a disaster like Monday
But what about Eric? He’s a damn Viking Raider!
thetes only so much room ringside
There should only be a female ref officiating so that there wont be any possible ref bumps in Romans title matches lol
Did you intentionally avoid saying “silent but deadly?”
Umaga was never silent though, he just didn't speak English.
oof
I just feel like the burn is a bit *too* slow. The plotline of Jey questioning his allegiance started at the Rumble and we're still approximately where we were that night, minus a few fakeouts. It doesn't feel like Jey is any closer to full-on turning on the Bloodline than in January, even after losing the tag titles.  I've been saying this for a while - the whole Bloodline saga could've been told in a year. Not 3+. But they just keep spinning the wheels on most shows for the sake of dragging it out.
This subreddit are the ones that always get up in arms about "WWE doesn't need to remind us of everything every 2 minutes and beat us over the head with everything" and this then this subreddit also reminds me every week of why WWE knows they have to remind people of things every couple of minutes.
Like Alvarez (I think) saying Mauro Ranallo was bad on commentary when he wasn't even on the show.
No one, it's one of those things that gets made up, catches on, and becomes a meme to mock people who don't even exist to prop up someone's ego
I don't know.  He's still a family guy, a good fella. I don't think there's been enough time for Roman to be a nightmare and start beating down on the Usos because they made the family look weak.  I think there's a much longer build and payoff to this than some of the crowd wants.  It seems like current stuff is written and booked to pay off later in the year, and you've got a lot of the crowd wanting payoff by Backlash.
Its cuz he all about family, he said it when he turned on sami on raw. He don't want to be alienated from his family so he's doing what the bloodline tells him to do.
Why does he need to stay in Roman's good graces though? It seemed clear Jimmy and Jey were/are only important to Roman if they were tag champs and they aren't so why does Jey even bother when he clearly doesn't want to be in The Bloodline anymore lol. It feels like they're going backwards.
We already did this angle of Jey betraying Sami after looking like he's going to side with him, though. They're literally just repeating story beats at this point.
Completely agree man.
Wyatt slow burned himself into irrelevance
It gonna come to the point where people will just, "Meh" when Jey finally turns when it really should've already happened.
Zelina frankensteiners on larger people are alway awesome. She really should use it as a finisher.
Exactly. Zelina been also has been wearing the Puerto Rican flag quite a few times over the last year. She knows what she’s doing.
Jey literally rejoined the bloodline after Roman said "I'm gonna blame Jimmy."   It shouldn't be hard to read between those lines.
They must be being purposefully obtuse just to annoy everybody else.
Right, but aside from that, people are acting like Matt Riddle sucks, has always sucked, and was only good with Randy Orton, when I feel like people were pretty solid with him before he got taken out. Now he’s come back and people are acting like he is X-Pac.
Good
And then booking Jey to truly wanting to attack Sami after he initially stopped Solo was a bad call, unless they somehow work the story into that Jey already had Solo in his pocket and was just pretending to want to beat down Sami with him. Sami and Jey reunion is what the fans want eventually.
I agree. Since Finn v Edge is (hopefully?) pretty much over now, it'll give them some extra room to pivot towards something else.
I dont think Roman defends the title at a non stadium show
Riddle has been in this storyline. What do you mean keep him out of it?
For 6, actually.He said "the Title" - he didn't say \*which\* title.  On a completely unrelated note, what happened to the 24/7 title anyway?
SummerSlam is when the Bloodline falls apart. If Roman can maintain 6 months (with actual defenses) until Cody/Sami/Jey finally kills the reign, it’s still plenty good.
Till WrestleMania 40 man....
As long as they turn Jey it won't fizzle
We were hot for Sheamus. I heard some fire Vince chants during trips segment but it did seem like just a few people which was disappointing
The allegations that have had no substance, like almost ever? What happened to innocent until proven guilty?
It got me. Texted my friends after damn they got me again. I knew it wouldn’t be a full turn has the stuck with it more like sami to roman at the rumble kind of a you’ve done enough thing.
What kind of mark thinks after all that’s happened in the last 7 days now is the time to pull that trigger?
The Usos losing their belts on its own changes the dynamic quite a lot.
I didn’t think he was turning
I agree. For me the tag titles just seem super out of place in this storyline. In the early going of the Mania tag match it felt really off that they were having a traditional tag team match. All this talk of destroying the Bloodline and they’re just wrestling a regular tag. Fortunately, the match quickly devolved and got something great in the end. But, I’m a hard believer that the Bloodline’s destruction is Sami’s storyline and so I don’t think winning the tag titles with KO has really accomplished anything.
Yeahhhh! Keep it tight
It was a Definite L on Hunter’s part. He should have known they would be nothing without Swerve.
I told myself I’d see how smackdown was and then I would decided to watch the next raw. As of now I’ll watch an hour of it just to see but it has to prove it’s different than last week
Sorry, is “brought back when the story’s past its peak to try and artificially push one of Vince’s guys” better?
>Riddle out of action.   >   >Cause and effect.  God I'd love to see Riddle & Theory going ham as a tag team.
You can't trust an honest man, because you never know when hes lying. But a dishonest man you can always trust to be dishonest.
RAW is fucking brutal at 3 hours as well. They need to fire it back to 2h.  I feel like they don't have much in the locker in terms of the main event picture and they are gonna milk this bloodline story until we're all sick of it.  This Jey will he wont he already happened like what, 2 months ago?
It’s boring as shit
Yeah but Riddle sucks
Push Jay to become a main event star
I mean I've watched almost every smackdown in the last year and I honestly forgot because of how long it had been
What I like about this is that if you stacked everyone in a six pack challenge, you’d have 5 bodies underneath you, but by stacking 6, that means Roman wasn’t even in the match but still smashed and won. Fuck it book it
a new member of the roman family tree shows up to interfere for every challenger in the ring
Yeah. He needs to get ready for his Solos run
When the camera focused on Miz longer than usual I knew it was real but man that whole sequence was a blur. It lasted like less than 10 minutes but felt like half an hour lol.
im hoping the HHH is waiting till the draft to reset and revitalize the womans division
Yeah I totally cannot work out what has happened here with his booking of the women. Everything else has been pretty solid across the board. But this is a huge glaring black mark against his booking. He and creative in general REALLY need to sort that one out.
Literally had riddle appearing on both show and sent Raquel & Liv to Raw for a half ass match, why not do the same for SD now or debut someone from NXT? Something? Plenty of ways to fix having a thin division.
How is he in real life?
To quote the Hunt-er I mean Thanos "A small price to pay for salvation.
I agree, and someone else said it best, I can't remember where I read it, but Vince even at his age, doesn't get EVERYTHING wrong, and when it comes to the bigger picture, is capable of making good moments, it's the Week to Week that the product is really in shambles.  Outside of him outright misusing some Talent, he certainly still has it in him to book decent/pretty good programs, it's just getting there through all the rematches, and rewrites for the weekly shows that makes it a DRAG.
A lot of the time it’s not Vince’s ideas that are the issue but the execution
Indeed I did
Yeah, I don't think they can keep faking the turn many more times. As of right now the crowd is still eating it up but if they do it one too many times then it can lose the spark. I feel like the same way Rey hesitated to hit Dominik for so long and then got a massive pop when it happened is going to be similar to the Jey turn. Let's hope it doesn't take too long, though.
That’s exactly what all the recaps are for. Because if they didn’t do it you can best believe it’d be a bunch of people questioning the continuity of everything.
Exactly. They're literally just moving backwards and in kayfabe it makes 0 sense as Jey has clearly shown signs of disillusion with the bloodline and Roman in general.
it shouldve either already happened or maybe slight signs of it happening, not the most obvious "swerve" every time like hes actually gonna turn
Could work. Rhea bumps really well for Zelina's Code Red, too, as shown in the Rumble.
Don't besmirch X-Pac like that. He was my favorite wrestler as a kid.
Nikki cross threw it in the garbage can
Yeah, I came for to cheer Gunther but left a more of a Kaiser fan. He was great tonight
Have you MET the internet? Assuming guilt is their favorite.
Riddle was a HHH guy befor he was a vince guy and its not artifical you act like riddle wasnt over as hell
Aw I got my 1st Reddit cares for this guys. Y’all are pathetic
Yeah I guess I came off too aggressive there.   I never forgot personally who the Bloodline took out till now (since its WWE's biggest story atm) and who has a score to settle against the Bloodline.   Nakamura is going to appear next week and he has lingering issues with Roman too so I hope people would remember that.
LOL. im so dumb.
He's been waiting eight months?
Rumours of potential sexual assault, cheating, drug use
37 year old Frat bro stuff
This is the subreddit of "wrestling fans" that 2 years ago had multiple comments and posts over multiple days reaching the top of threads and the front page of the subreddit arguing about how a pin fall works, while posts and comments that were explaining how they work and were wrong were getting upvoted.
Cuz he puts his relationship with the bloodline above all us. Yea he's expereincing cognitive dissonance a bit but that's the point. He's not dumb, he's blinding himself/letting solo blind him (solo death staring jey so he falls in line) so he doesn't have to think about his disillusionments with the bloodline and keeps his relationship with them intact. + they didn't touch on it much this week but the implied reason jey chose jimmy over sami is to save his brother from being punished.  Yall can say the story is going to long but saying it makes 0 sense just ain't it
I mean, in hindsight he was great, but you know damn well everyone hated X-Pac after that feud with Kane and then X-Factor.
Imagine being a poor homeless dude dumpster diving and hoping for half a sandwich and some cans to turn in at the recycling plant so you can get a 40 oz, but instead you find this ugly green and gold belt. Next you know, R-Truth is chasing you through the alley before eventually tackling you to the ground and beating you up. And the entire time he brought a camera crew and a referee just so he had witnesses that he beat you up in an alley.
She actually missed the garbage can and threw it next to it instead
I mean I'd never do that reddit cares shit but everything you've said is dumb enough to make me wonder if you're alright.
Long term booking brother
I had stopped watching wrestling for a bit around the time of x-factor so I forgot about that. But DX PAC was the COOLEST dude to me for some reason. My earliest wrestling memory is PAC beating razor so maybe that's why. I was about 4-5 when that match happened.
Yeah, questioning if Vince had influence over a story on his show is super dumb. Got me there lol
Yea, they coined a term after the hate people had for X-Pac in 2001 called “X-Pac heat”, more popularly considered go-away heat now. When they did the Invasion angle with WCW they had a PPV with WWF vs. WCW literally called Invasion. Every WWF wrestler was cheered and every WCW wrestler was booed………except for X-Pac, who was booed out of the building in his match against Billy Kidman.
Calling Riddle one of Vince's guys when Triple H loved him in NXT and saying either Brock or Riddle were artificially inserted into a storyline they've been heavily involved in is what's super dumb my guy.
Oh I'm familiar with X-Pac heat, I just never understood why he was so hated. He was a workhorse.
Artificial as in now that the Bloodline story is at or past its highest point, which occurred organically, Riddle coming off a lot of bad press can go right back into the story. Riddle’s feud with Sikoa at that time was nowhere near as over as what Sami and Jey crafted. Now Riddle conveniently jumps right back in the feud. Seems like a very conscious effort to push Riddle, Vince or not. My speculation was, because of the timing, was maybe it was a Vince call. Seems like him to throw a guy at a hot story and hope it sticks. If it was Trips it’s equally too little, too late to try and get Riddle a push imo.
That’s how I feel about Matt Riddle right now in this sub.
Your comment still doesn't make sense. Riddle was taken out by Solo so he could go to rehab. He gets out of rehab and comes back to feud with the guy that took him out. There is absolutely nothing artificial about that. It isn't throwing him at a hot story. It's him coming back to a story he was already in and has history in. What would have been artificial is Riddle forgetting all about Solo taking him out.
Again, timing is my issue. Why throw him in with Sami and KO other than to get him paired with the hot tag team? Sure, a feud with Sikoa makes a lot of sense by itself but now he’s involved in the actual Bloodline feud by getting inserted now. They could’ve brought him in earlier or after any of this was resolved to finish what started off as a standalone feud. Throwing him in specifically now seems like a cheap attempt at getting Riddle more over.

So the RAW immediately after Backlash, which makes perfect sense.
QT Marshall has been drafted to NXT Europe!
Amusing time to remember that Brian Cage is reportedly working ROH and holding a belt with no contract, just a handshake deal.
BRO…. WWAEW BRO!!!
Tony Khan will be drafted to Smackdown!
Paul levesque address his enemies
Predicted major moves:  Smackdown:  -	Seth Rollins -	Becky Lynch -	Rhea Ripley (no JD) -	Austin Theory -	Roxanne Perez -	Kevin Owens  Raw:  -	Drew McIntyre -	Charlotte -	LA Knight -	Gunther (with Imperium) -	Grayson Waller -	Sami Zayn  The rosters are kind of shaken up at this point, but I expect Cody to stay on Raw and Roman to stay on Smackdown. Sami and KO being split doesn’t affect them at first since they’re still tag champs, but now it adds pressure for them to keep the titles. Also expect a commentary shakeup.
There's one draft pick that would take their brand To The Moon.
Jacksonville? Interesting...
Always crazy when they run shows in Jacksonville. The arena is literally a 5 minute walk from Daily's Place and the AEW offices.
KENNY BOUT TO BE A WWE MAN…lmao
Honestly can’t wait. Hope Judgement Day and Seth get on smackdown because that’s all I watch really. Little worried they might split the group.   Could be a good excuse to get another world title in there and properly unify Wwe title and Universal title together. Universal will just be a prop for the entrance, which it basically already is.   Split the tag titles as well.
Really hope Seth and Becky go to Smackdown. They have been stuck on Raw for years and it is weird that Becky has barely been on Smackdown since it went to Fox considering she was in the very first segment with The Rock.
Jacksonville oh boy
AEW bought by WWE CONFIRMED
 Predictions for brand changes  Austin Theory to Smackdown  Imperium to RAW  Montez Ford to Smackdown  Angelo Dawkins stays on RAW  Kevin Owens to Smackdown  Sami Zayn stays on Smackdown  Bobby Lashley to Smackdown  Rest of Hurt Business (they teased reforming and I think they will due to other factions on brand) for Bloodline vs Hurt Business   Judgement Day to Smackdown  LA Knight to RAW  Shinsuke Nakamura to RAW  Roxanne to Smackdown  K² to RAW  Pretty Deadly to Smackdown  Grayson Waller to RAW  Cameron Grimes to RAW  Apolo Crews to RAW  Zoey Starks to RAW  Chelsea Green to Smackdown   Asuka to Smackdown  Charlotte to RAW  Matt Riddle to Smackdown  Raquel to RAW  Liv Morgan to RAW  Seth Rollins to Smackdown  Becky Lynch to Smackdown   Braun Strowman and Ricochet to RAW  Brawling Brutes to RAW  Drew McIntyre to RAW
I'm sure Jacksonville is a totally coinkydinkle choice there.
I’ll be there 🔥🔥🔥
So, what show will Kenny get drafted to?
I hope with the draft comes with the world heavyweight title
Usually they do it a week or 2 before a PLE so this is a nice change.
Man if I was running wwe I’m not sure I could resist pulling the throwing the belt in the trash bit. Childish and won’t achieve anything but it would be damn funny
I think they might split Damage CTRL at the draft as well. They'll probably draft one or two members to Smackdown, and leave whoever is left on RAW.
Are KO and Sami currently on different brands? So hard to keep straight. But is Sami SD and KO Raw currently?
Wasn’t there a report once that USA insists on keeping Seth, and Fox insists on keeping Roman and Charlotte Flair? Raw has always felt like Seth’s brand, so I’m not sure he will move. I feel like Cody may go to SD though.
Neil fucking Armstrong baby
I could see it. [Becky's been quite unsubtle about wanting to feud with Rhea](https://www.wrestlinginc.com/1247348/becky-lynch-calls-rhea-ripley-one-of-the-greatest-female-wrestlers-shes-ever-seen-cant-wait-to-beat-her/).
How else do we get Jay White to Raw?!?????!!!?
So many of these moves means you're essentially just flipping the rosters of each show and therefore changing nothing. Better to have like five or six major moves imo (Seth/Becky/JD/Asuka/Montez to Smackdown and Imperium/Raquel/Liv/Drew/LA Knight to Raw), along with call-ups and/or surprise returns/hires to each brand.
If that happened Tony might legit explode
But then you’re stuck with Brian Cage under contract. I doubt WWE will be hiring anytime soon and anyone should be worried they may get let go from talent to office.
I mean sure but hes holding a ROH belt. It wouldnt be nearly as effective
Absolutely see that happening.
Yes, that’s true now, but the brand split stopped being enforced when they began tagging. Now after the draft it seems it will be again.

That's karma for putting Ezekiel in a coma tbh
Clangy poles strike again.
I know it’s because he’s bloodline and so got inserted into the company’s biggest storyline but man  Solo might legit be the best NXT call up of the last 5 years. Look at the moments he’s been apart of already and the moments he’s being set up for in the future.
WWE officials are always the worst in situations like this, all they ever do is scream "WOAH WOAH WOAH" and run around with their hands up shooing away the perpetrator. It's so fantastically ridiculous every time
Karma strikes for Owens
So.. Owens will blame Zayn because he don’t really care about him and used him  just to destroy the bloodline.
Hm. I guess that might be one way to write Sami and KO losing the titles and returning to singles. Maybe.
Great segment, but the camera zooming in and out on Sami and Jey was dizzying.
Not sure where they are going with this. KO going to be out for awhile?
Elrod must've paid off the Bloodline to take KO out
KO was attacked by sentient noisey poles
Crazy to say
Drew?  Gunther?  Becky?  All called up from nxt
Seth? Roman?  Edit: Didn’t realize OP said last 5 years lol
The least nitpickiest wrestling commenter.
it hasn't even been a week and you already splitting them up 💀
El Rod, the luchador of the family
Gunther is the only one who gives him a run for his money.   I know I said 5-10 years but Becky and the 4HW have been on the main roster since like 2014? Really not a comparison to make there   As for Drew yeah he was in NXT but he never really felt like an “NXT Talent” like Gargano, Ciampa, Gunther, KO, Sami etc. it just felt like a pitstop tune up in hai return to the company
2012 debut, and even then I didn’t think people considered The Shield in that popular NXT talent field, I feel like they were the precursor to what we call NXT Talent  The only one who did anything of note out of the three in NXT is Seth
I mean, it would honestly be better than KO betraying Sami again. Them continuing to team up isn’t a problem. It’s just that you have this inevitable feel of someone betraying the other.
That would actually be [El Vagabundo](https://youtu.be/MzYAmfOHzJU)  Elrod is Zeke and Elias’ youngest brother as far as we know
I would argue that drew made himself a bigger star outside of WWE then came with that popularity so NXT didn’t really make him a star.
Gunther is the undisputed best call up.  Two 5 star matches in under a year, longest IC reign of the 21st century and has the longest non winning run in men's rumble history (30 man version)  If we consider the "2022-2023 season" of RAW after WM 38 to WM 39, Gunther wins that year's with Solo taking second but would have won most years
They just won the belts last weekend lmfao. Stupid take

YOU GOT TO SEE THE LIGHT JEY I BELIEVE FOR YOU
The Jey Uso story and character is my favourite thing in all of wrestling.   Jey knows who attacked Kevin. You can tell he knew, imo he wasn't told or was aware that Roman ordered the attack, but after it happened, looking at Kevin, he knows exactly who did it.   Jey conveys his emotions without even talking so well man.   This main event is going to be interesting..
Jey man just TRUST him
I wonder if Jey knew that was gonna happen
Man I can't wait until the entire Bloodline family falls apart  Jey see the light
Not invested in this story anymore. Aligning with Roman TWICE made Jay look like a chump to me. Not to mention losing the tag titles because of that and he’s still with Roman?! It’s just not an interesting character anymore.
Bro, this was literally the Dynamite segment from last week, beat for beat💀  ~~Don Callis gets attacked before commercial as Kenny is about to walk out~~ Kevin Owens gets attacked before commercial as Sami is about to walk out  ~~Kenny gets interviewed backstage after commercial then his music hits and he goes to face a dangerous opponent while distracted~~ Sami gets interviewed backstage after commercial then his music hits and he goes to face a dangerous opponent while distracting  I know what Triple H is doing on Wednesday nights between 8-10:00 lol
![gif](giphy|l3UcwPQnD2yQ62vWE)
>but after it happened, looking at Kevin, he knows exactly who did it.  I mean, there's lots of people left in Samoa they can keep calling up.
And all of this is gone, Jey is fully Roman’s bitch rn
They were literally carrying Solo away and screaming get him out of here, so it'd be kind of hard for him to not know who attacked KO
i mean yeah bc dudes been ordering hits on so many people. this aint groundbreaking lol
Roman needs to put his hands on Jimmy again, put him in the same chokehold that got Jey to quit. Then Jey quits the Bloodline.
You are gonna get downvoted and so will I but Usos aligned with Roman make them look like bitches...I know it's kayfabe but they always gotta save Roman but when they need help he is nowhere to be found...they are booked like Roman's bitches and not his family.
> AEW created the trope of an interview interrupted by a heel attacking a babyface! Look at them copying AEW's segments!  - This guy apparently
I have no words for this comment honestly mate...
This has been wrestling since backstage became a thing
Bro, was that literally the first time you've ever watched wrestling
Hm I don't think fully personally. Jimmy's the key for him and so that's what is making Jey do what he's doing.   That tease tonight was great but yeah it will be frustrating to see Jey follow Roman's orders.   Important thing here is that Jey isn't happy about it at all and that I see a full blowup of Jey and Roman around Summer time.  At least I hope.  **I definitely think there's a chance they will miss the boat on his face turn and I hope they don't.**
I don't think he's fully Roman's bitch, but I think he wants the Bloodline to continue for sure. I get the feeling, just from how Jey acts, he's scared of what would happen after turning on Roman.  If Jey was fully behind Roman then all the glares at Roman, Solo and Heyman and looks of doubt when Sami is trying to talk him down wouldn't mean anything. And the Bloodline storyline has been good at not making things meaningless so far.  I think Jey has doubts, but he's trying to bury them as much as he can, for as long as he can.
Yup. It was the officials who did and they tried to blane it on poor innocent Solo who just so happened to be standing nearby minding his own business.
I completely missed that, my bad xD
Fair haha I just really invested in anything about this story 😅
Jimmy wasn’t even there lol   Jey kicked Sami because that’s who he is now
Jimmy not being there and Jey not even knowing where his brother was imo makes it even more apparent that he doesn't want to do this.   If Roman was the one who sent Jimmy away tonight Jey knows Roman would've immediately got to Jimmy and beat the shit out of him too, way before Jey could get to him.   Saying that, I did hope that Jey turned tonight but that was a good tease imo. I do agree that he is back to doing Roman's bidding.

It will be great to see him back  Miss him with Boogs
Nakamura returning at the Nebraska show as we all expected
i honestly think hhh might book him vs roman to pay off that brutal angle after mania last year
They should run nakamura vs roman in the meantime, it can atleast elevate Nakamura back to a semi threat even losing to Reigns is a big enough push. They should build him up to it first with some small victories, but I miss that NXT mystique Nakamura had, he didn’t wrestle often but when he did man he was interesting.
Draft Theory to SD and have Shinsuke take the title off him
I know it wouldn’t be the same without Pat, but I’m sad that Boogs and Nakamura are on different brands
lets send his ass to the moon
Good to see. Sucks that Boogs isn’t with him anymore though. They were a lot of fun together.
A proper Nakamura run on the main roster (hopefully) mostly under HHH is something I really want to see
High hopes for this. Hoping they give him an Asuka-like redebut so he comes off credible again. He’s an outstanding talent and deserves better than what he was getting when we last saw him
Somehow, someway, SOMWEHRE in a different Universe, we're getting Jay White vs Shinsuke Nakamura next week  😔
He should go to Raw
Hot off the momentum he got from the match against Muta.
I don't know why I read that as Stardust returns next week.
Did Nakamura/Roman ever happen?
Please push this man!
Where has he been?
If they're hyping him up, hopefully he's treated like a big deal again.
that's great, but  where  the  FUCK  is   Shanky?!
Boogs is on raw and was last attempted to bring Elias in  his garage band.
I pray they get drafted to the same brand and become a tag team, fuck that would be killer
Glad I'm not the only one thinking that. Vince made him look like a DAMN fool talking about exacting revenge on Roman picking his moment only for that to NEVER materialize.   It was up there with Finn Balor's "I'll get to him in due time" bullshit with John Cena for me. Empty threats that made them look stupid.
Yeah I'm not sure who eventually dethrones Roman but Roman has feuds with Nakamura, Styles w/the OC and RKBro while the Bloodline civil war goes on.
Didn't they do Nakamura vs Reigns exactly at this time last year?
They'll feed him to Roman to reach that 1000 days.
These comments are funny, it’s been reported numerous times that Nakamura is happy with what he is doing, because he gets to take it easy and surf. For some reason nerds on the internet aren’t happy with this.
I get the feeling if Jay White was going to WWE he'd be on Raw.
He wouldnt of had any with the wwe crowds and you know it.
It happened on a tribute to the troops show.
Yeah right as recently man was becoming the tribal chief iirc and their time in the rumble is all I can think of
They did that and it was just okay, Shinsuke deserves more
It feels like it’s going to be Sami or Cody to actually dethrone him, but I think all of his feuds will eventually team up to completely isolate him.
No, they only teased it and thats the problem. It just made Nakamura look like a dweeb.
https://www.sportskeeda.com/amp/wwe/news-nakamura-responds-wwe-fans-saying-prefers-surfing  this always gets brought up when it is just wrong.  He said on the Bump, he loves to surf and it is a hobby but his main priority is wrestling.
I have never seen this reported by anyone ever. I've seen terminally online redditors regurgitate it as if it's fact because another redditor said it first (like most of the incorrect bullshit that gets repeated here for years on end), yet Shinsuke himself has denied the rumor both on his instagram and on The Bump.
He’s straight up said he’s been sorta disappointed. Yeah he likes to take it easy and surf, but this is their artwork, they want it to be presented well.
Because he should have been a world champion when he went against Jinder fucking Mahal in several title matches. So he should get that chance again.
There’s nothing I said that contradicts this, Nak can still surf and enjoy an easier workload than in Japan under HHH.   nerds on the internet have no reading comprehension
https://youtu.be/Aj5PSSODVBE?t=18m55s  I got you the link to the video with the time stamp too so you can know what Shinksuke wants.
And I was there! I was hoping that it served as a preview of a Roman-Shinsuke feud that was to come soon. Still kinda wanna see it, even though I know Shinsuke isn’t winning.
If by “just okay” you mean “one of the most over things in the company,” sure.
What Nakumura wants >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> what you want
You want something that Nakumra doesn’t and all of you nerds complain about it.
They must of made good money being every single wwe partnership advert. They were selling everything
What if he wants a proper run on the main roster?
When the fuck did Nakamura say he didn’t want to work with HHH on the main roster? Is there a set 9 English for people like you?
What if he doesn’t?
Why wouldn't he?
ospreay i believe
Tons with ADHD. I'm not aware of anyone who had openly stated it on live television. I hope it happens some day
Sami Zayn and Brock Lesnar might be
I would think there would be more than you'd expect
I do and I train. Ospreay has self diagnosed and waiting for an actual assessment. Mine took about 3.5 years so he might not get his for a while yet.
I think Eugene might have had some sort of issue like that.
I think Stone Cold.
Steve The Turtle
Eugene
Yep, Ospreay has Autism and ADHD (which are pretty common comorbidities). Though it’s notable he wasn’t diagnosed until 2019 (ADHD) and 2020 (Autism).
MJF just said this week that he's struggles with ADD.
That character would be a no-go in today's wrestling  and rightfully so  WWE has change for the better
Mjf needs to get from adderall from tony khan. He doesn’t need it and there’s a shortage.
Well thats mean of you to say. I would think mentally challenged wrestlers would more accepted in 2023 and not "rightfully a no-go".  EDIT: You guys must have been pissed when you saw who John Cena brought out with him.  EDIT 2: I've just been informed that apparently wrestlers play a character and aren't real?
Don't get your panties in a bunch

I read he was recovering from a spinal or neck surgery.
He just had surgery not too long ago. Long recovery probably.
https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10057518-wwe-superstar-robert-roode-undergoes-surgery-for-neck-injury  With it being a neck injury, who knows when he'll get back
Neck injury. He had [surgery](https://www.instagram.com/p/ClrwJUUsXa8/?igshid=MTIyMzRjYmRlZg==) back in December.
being glorious
About six feet and one inch
I wanna know what the good brothers and killer Kris’s are up too
evolving into an Omosapien
Enjoying having the best wrestling theme ever
I ask this question about like 85% of the midcard at any given time.
Drinking beer and counting his money.
I think he’s injured but that was a while ago
He’s probably deciding what food to eat in catering
I hope when he returns, he comes out to Glorious Domination and actually has a good singles run under Trips
A crime what WWE has not done with him just give him the opportunity he can easily be a top guy
He's injured
No he won’t give in, he won’t give in til he’s victorious
Good Brothers/Mia got majorly hurt with AJs injury.   Kross I have no idea
Avoiding Vince

ECW Heatwave 98 is one of my all time favorites. Great card top to bottom.
Great American Bash 1989 is probably the best WCW PPV they ever put on. Flair and Funk, Wargames, Luger and Steamboat, Muta and Sting. A must watch.
ECW Heatwave 98 is universally the favorite, I would also say Anarchy Rulz 99 is also worth checked out. Has a little of everything
If you’re looking at the Bischoff era, Starrcade 1996.   This had a couple amazing undercard matches and the main event was really good.   If you want old school WCW, Superbrawl III.   The Sting vs Vader strap match is an all time great.
For JCP/WCW:  Great American Bash '89, SuperBrawl II, SuperBrawl III, Slamboree '94, Great American Bash '96, Bash at the Beach '96, Starrcade '96, Slamboree '98, Spring Stampede '99.  Also some great Clash of the Champions shows: I, IV, VI, VII, VIII, IX, XVII, XVIII.
Halloween Havoc 1998
WCW Great American Bash 1996. Right as NWO was coming in, good matches with Mysterio vs Malenko and Sting vs Regal
Not sure if it is available on tape but the Bunkhouse Stampede is an all time great. Not much comes close to it. Creativity, non stop action, great performances by all of the wrestlers and of course huge amount of fans making for a great experience by all.  10/10 Classic
December to Dismember & Road Wild 97
*Anarchy Rulz ‘99* is pretty good.
Heat Wave 98/Halloween Havoc 97 respectively
Thanks will look into it!
It’s this
I always hated the Road Wild shows because of the non wrestling fan bikers that hated Harlem Heat with a passion and but cheered heel Hogan.
They looked really cool, sea of Harley-riding chuds aside.

Eddie would be proud.
They better keep the Judgment Day together, they're a great heel faction.
The last time any crowd hated someone this match was that time Elias and Kevin Owens made fun of that basketball team leaving a city.
I see Vince let Dominik borrow his Mustache
Christ this boy might be the biggest heat magnet in wrestling right now.
I just know he LOVES this deep down inside lmao
Beyond nuclear heat. Dominik >>>>>>>>>>>> every other heel.
This is so insane.  I know it's been said a million times, but who would have predicted, DOMINICK FUCKING MYSTERIO, biggest heel heat in the company??  Absolutely NO ONE had this on their bingo card.
Man. Dominik is in a freakin groove-such excellent character work. Maybe the best at this moment.
I know it’s been said before, but it is UNREAL how far this guy has come in the past couple years. This whole feud has been perfect.
Finn looks so proud 😭
Finn can't even hide how happy he is for Dom
Daniel Bryan Danielson was right. This crowd was FICKLE! They booed an abused son, an inspiration to all the reformed criminal. How could they boo him?
Holy fuck. He's got NXT Ciampa heat
Hahaha my god. This guy is so good. Crowd drowned him out. Literally the biggest heel in wrestling. Who would’ve thought a year ago 😂  Backlash is gonna be amazing.
When was the last time someone had heat like this? It's definitely been years.
Honestly, this might be Rey’s greatest wrestling achievement… Dominik used to be a green wrestler that the crowd tolerated, but now (also thanks to Judgement Day) he is the ultimate little shit of a heel that the crowd despises
Massive props to all 5 of them for this story. Judgement Day has got Dom and Rhea over to an insane level. Dom is literally the biggest heel in all of wrestling right now and it’s honestly not even close. If they can keep this up, the heat when he eventually retires Rey or takes his mask will be nuclear.
Balor is loving it.
Dominik has officially overtaken Roman for now as the best heel in all of wrestling right now for me.   He is phenomenal.   The boos are fantastic.   What a great job everyone involved has done.
Mans got that “This is my yard now” reaction
He’s a heat magnet.
The fans were molten!   When you can drown out a microphone in the middle of the ring like that...wow.
fuck me i cannot believe how on fire dom is.  the fuckin brat is over the moon
The pride in Finns face of what Mysterio is doing.
Finn can't hold in his sheer joy at this. The kid is O V E R and a star is being born
That’s super nuclear heat
He’s on Muhammad hassan levels of heat…. Dude is killing it
This little wimp dork is the best fuckin heel. I love it.
He's the top heel in the business right now and that's no exaggeration.
Oh man this is great. He’s got major major heat!
Day boy got some LATINO HEAT.
The stache reminds me of that one The Office scene      " He's been growing that mustache for week*s*. Best he can do"
This man to me is by far the best heel in WWE currently. Even better than Roman.
Omg does he have a fake teardrop?
They should've had Dominik win at Mania that would've been the crowd's reaction even better
It's not often you get someone who the crowd loves to boo, not boo because they're sick of whatever character or story that's in front of them. I wonder where you go with him after the rey stuff is over though...
Nuclear
JESUS H CHRIST THAT IS SOME HEAT RIGHT THERE
Biggest HEAT in all or wrestling
I was there at Portland tonight. It was degrees louder than what is shown on tv! Dominik getting booed so hard was an amazing experience.
Dude went from having X Pac heat for being green as grass to getting this insane, genuine reaction. Props to him and everyone involved
i don't keep up with wwe outside of reading posts here, but god damn am i glad this dude is getting unprecedented levels of heat. if you got the skills to put in the type of work required, you should get the crowds response you're working for. even from the outside: 👏👏👏
This amount of heat is so beautiful to see.
That's even more heat than pre burial Theory, most over heel in years.
Dom is great. Rhea making that throwaway line about Papi on Twitter was huge.   I actually think Dom is good enough on his own with JD. Kind of think it’s time for Rhea to go solo and feud with Dom as a babyface (which would provide many hilarious moments).
THERES A REASON WHY DOM IS SPEAKING OUT OF EVERYONE IN JD
Wasn't able to catch the show tonight but my god this guy just keeps getting better as a heel. This heat is deserved and I know he's loving every bit of it. He's a Guerrero at heart.
Dom's nuclear heat is even wilder when you consider [how much the crowd was cheering Rhea's opening part of the promo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GXELVJsos8).
He's become one of my favorite heel right now
MY GOAT 🐐
Dominik reaction posts are the new Cody entrance posts
Who would have thought the only purpose of Judgment Day was to get Dom over.
The best heel today.
Damn. I love seeing reactions like this
Damian Priest is fucking huge holy crow
Dominik growth is so good, he was hated by the fans for being a bad wrestler and they leaned to that and turned him heel and got an actual heel heat.  Quite possibly the best WWE character development in years
Finn's alive?!
LOVE it!
Finn is loving it lol
Now that is heat
Dominik is the best heel in wrestling. He's a genuine heel.
Rocky Maivia to The Rock achievement unlocked.
I cannot believe Dom was one of the matches I was upset I couldn't watch live on night 1, man. It's unreal how much has changed since last year even haha
Nuclear
Reminds me of when Jason Jordan started getting drowned out with the boos. I love seeing this
I gotta admit i wasnt a fan of Dom at all before joining JD but him in that faction has done wonders for him.  His promo game has been a complete 180 over the last couple months and he finally looks comfortable on the mic.  Him leaving Rey's shadows was the best thing that happened to him
This is nuclear heat! I can feel it through the screen! Dominic deserves full praise for his work, as do the writers! Amazing stuff! ☢️
Latino Heat Magnet  Should have been a 'before and after' puzzle to 'Describe Dominic Mysterio' on the WWE edition of Wheel of Fortune they had last week.
Man let Judgement Day main event Backlash with Rey and Bad Bunny. That PR crowd will be nuclear hot for all of this
I was there. My voice is gone hah. Dom cracked the tiniest of a smile. You know he was loving it.
He's so fucking good at this
Damn, Dom has really grown over the past year. The guy is a legit superstar now. People love to hate him. The Judgement Day's greatest accomplishment is helping him elevate his character.
I sincerely hope he doesn't take this personally and relishes in this heat he's getting. Incredible.
The loudest boos since vince mcmahon BEFORE he had entrance music he would just walk out and people who Boo loud af
Bro when he tries to speak they fucking boo harder, that's so funny.
I was there. We booed him so loud in the arena, I couldn't even hear Rey's music at first.
Remember when Dom was just go away heat?   Yeah, I remember.
I was there for this. I could not hear Dominik at all! I was also booing too, so there’s that! He’s great!
Name a better breakthrough star. You can't. All your hooks, Daniel Garcia's, Ricky something's don't add up to one Dominik.  Edit: when has mjf drawn this much heat organically?
Wow, he looks so much like Eddie, it's actually uncanny.
Dom's glow up in the last year is beautiful.
That was some good heat.
Imagine telling someone 2 years ago how over (or anti-over being a heel?) Dom would be right now, its bonkers the reaction he got.
Thought Finn's head was gashed up?
It was so loud I loved every second of it
If prison can't hold this guy back, nothing will!
His heat is nuclear at this point omg!! 👏🏻🔥
I love this group - they all look so proud of Dom getting his character to get that reaction
As someone who was there live this vid doesn’t do it justice. The place booed dom so loud you couldn’t hear a single thing he was saying for a good minute
It’s better to be a heel than a face, especially when babyfaces have been booked like geeks for years now. Heels are just cooler and get more of a reaction, and then more opportunities come from that.
Is it too early to give him a belt?  Put the US title on him at least.
Dom’s a fucking hero. Fast XI: Mami Foreva
He's come a long way. Props to him. 👏
He seriously went from a joke to the biggest heel in the company.  Dom is doing a great job in my opinion.
I got to be there live, it was the most fun being in a crowd I've ever had. I could actually feel the stadium vibrating from all of us booing at once. I loved booing that boy
The close up on Priest when he was talking, he looked like Reigns
Dom is doing it correctly.
They *HATE* hate that man.
So fucking good
People are talking about the Judgement Day's turnaround a lot here, and while it has been great for sure, I can't help but love how much Dominik's grown on me since I started watching again around Money in the Bank last year. He went from being the person I had the most X-Pac heat for, to genuinely one of my favorite heels on the main roster.
MJF could only dream of getting this reaction
Oh boy. The kid’s going to be a megastar isn’t he?
He’s the best heel in the business right now.
This is fucking top-level heel shit but what happens when he eventually goes face. I mean he can't exactly be this.
Dom get’s MJF level heat, you love to see it.
So loud, I half expected him to say "Excuse Meeeee!" as an homage.
I don’t doubt he was booed to shit but this is ultra piped in fake booing lol.
Oh,no, he's not over AT All, right? /s
Finn Bàlor is so proud of Dom for getting that sweet heat. That's what makes JD so good.  They're a bunch of hot goth jerks that support each other.
Die Rocky Die  The Dom is coming.
YESSSSS he put over the fucking belt spot (in spanish) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GXELVJsos8   my post history is full of me going on about that spot lol
Is Dominic the greatest heel in wrestling rn?
Great job, Portland. I shied away from getting tickets after Monday, but it looks like it was a good episode.
Kids got a little heat, too bad they will fuck it up
We’re gonna look back at this someday and be proud of Dominick’s growth
25 years old too what a great signing by WWE. Dom has done nothing but improve
Damn, dude. Bringing the heat.
The greatest mysterio of all time
Just got back from the show and this was legit the biggest reaction anyone got. You couldn’t hear a word he was saying over the boos.
You know what, he is a natural heel. It's rare that you see this kinda heat, only a few can get there.
At first it sounded to me like it was piped in
Screw her, I know. But this reminded me of Vickie getting booed to eternal damnation by the crowd in late 2010 and Cena was there too.
His face turn down the line will be amazing
Dom has the Austin pop but in reverse.
Hear me out.  Not sure how we’ll get there, but let Dom beat Roman. He’s embraced by the crowd. He’s white hot. Future main eventer for the next decade that needs his big moment.
I can’t remember the last time a wrestler was this hated. I don’t think ever tbh.
He's over like rover
Wait, so I guess Edge DIDN'T destroy the Judgment Day?
Wow, that’s unreal, good for him
That's Kevin Owens Seattle heat
Hotter than the fucking sun
That's some good heat. Almost as good as the time KO bashed Seattle basketball.
dominic mysterio is gonna be the most beloved babyface of all time
Bully Ray had an orgasm watching that amount of heat.
Dominik is the best heel they have. And he's opposite one of the most over woman in the company. It is crazy that these two coexist in the same faction.
Finn: "How long did it take you to grow that mustache"  Dom: "Couple of days"
Absolutely. To have Dom grow up and realise what a piece of shit father Rey really was. Eddie was never wrong.
Latino *Heat*
Facts
The difference is Eddie was loved and we just played into the character, seems like folks, myself included, genuinely do not like domink lmfao
Like father, like son.  Guerrero family produces some strong heels.
For real. That's not "go away" heat or boredom heat or cringe heat or turn the channel heat. I'm actually shocked at how much heat he's getting. He was so lame as a babyface that I thought he just didn't have it. Glad to see that I was wrong, holy shit.
Not as proud as Finn clearly is right now.
It was so smart to turn them from “legit ooky spooky” to “Monty Python’s House of Black”, it allows their characters to shine so much more
I can see them moving Judgment Day to Smackdown in the draft so they can stay with Rhea.
What a complete turn around they've done when they first were started, everyone wanted them to break up, but now they're red hot. What a difference creative control and writing can do for people.
They should add another member to the group so they could make it even between with the LWO
I love them. Took a while to grow on me but each member seems formidable in their own way, Priest is the only one that I think could use a stronger storyline.
Nope. Dom is getting massive amounts of heat so they’re gonna break up judgment day and push Dom as a “I’m grateful I get to live my dream” babyface next week.
Funny that they’re in Seattle on Monday for Raw lmao
That Elias and Kevin Owens segment is still the loudest I’ve heard anyone be booed this decade. Like I genuinely couldn’t believe a “ur sport team suckz lol” insult could rile up a crowd this bad you couldn’t hear what Kevin was saying due to how abnormaly LOUD those boos were.
The last time I've seen someone hate a wrestler that much ass the night after Mania when Roman defeated Taker
We're really passionate about everything here in the northwest.
PNW is dedicated to wrestling. Portland and Seattle
I was at that show! It was amazing, and the clip on YouTube was cut way down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XigdA6kiLcE
And then they tried to steal my Kings. So fuck Seattle sports fans
Keep in mind they do pump in more cheers and boos into the sound post pandemic.
Well they have a Hockey team now, The Kraken
Sami bringing out Trae Young in MSG also got nuclear levels of heat.
The authority in Seattle got booed so long they seemed really annoyed it kept going. (same city as the one you're referencing too)
It's like Dom saw how much heat Vince's stache got and was like "hold my razor."
I just laughed out loud
Let Dom grow out the mustache similar to what Eddie used to rock back in the day, easy way to print money.
Don Dom.   Don, Don, Don, Don....Don, Don, Don, Don...Dommmm!
Nah Vince has a purely lip mustache, it's very weird looking lol
I don't think that there are many people in the same air as Dom at the moment.
It’s great that it’s legitimate heat. It’s not go away heat, it’s not cheap heat, its not “this guys sucks in real life” heat, it’s genuine “I would pay to see him get his ass beat” heat in a way we don’t see very often anymore
It's King Joffrey heat and it's basically gold right now. As long as Dominik keeps heaping more and more shitty weasel heel layers on top of it (like the prison stuff is almost played out but he can just keep adding more ridiculous stuff to his character, there are so many possibilities) it'll never end.  Put a title on Dominik in a year or so (or give him Money in the Bank) and it'll get even better.
Wall to wall boos he was almost drowned out!
Finn smiling like a proud papa
I was talking to my parents (60+) who don’t watch any wrestling last weekend, and they mentioned they came across a Rey/Dom commercial for mania, and just from that short minute, they knew they wanted Dom to lose so bad
Lol Finn looks so fucking proud of him.
You can actually see him smirk quickly. He loves it so much!
Finn loves it more.
The fact that Rey beat him at Wrestlemania and people still hate him this much is absolutely hilarious. This guy could lose 95% of his matches and he’d instantly get his heat back with one sentence.
It’s probably doing absolute wonders for his confidence, in fact you can really see how he’s so comfortable with the mic now that he knows he’s killing it, that’s a great head space for a young guy to be in to rapidly improve
It's not that deep down lol
He should, he’s doing his job as well as anyone in wrestling
I love it too
Compared to when he first joined judgement day you could see he didn’t really know how to react to it, but now he completely owns it
He’s trying so hard to mask the fact that he’s in fucking heaven in that ring
There’s no way any heel doesn’t absolutely love getting heat like this. Chasing a reaction like has gotta be like 99% why you go into the business (or an insane face pop)
I know I do!
For real. No other heel rn is getting close to this amount of heat. It's amazing
The natural whiny voice he has is just icing.
#Domink Heat
Just wait until the Smackdown episode in San Juan. I think the only male pop culture figure us Latino’s love more than Rey is Goku
You could almost say its......*Latino Heat*  &#x200B;  ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sunglasses)  &#x200B;  I'll see myself out.
I was in the crowd tonight and legit couldn't hear what he was saying most of the time lol  Unfortunately, the kid behind me was a Dom fan and kept yelling "LET'S GO DOM" at the top of his lungs throughout the whole match.
Many including myself thought he would fade into obscurity once him and Rey split up (this was before Judgment Day were even a thing). I genuinely think that would have happened if they didn't pair him up with Judgment Day, he struck gold with them
It hasn't even been a year yet. Wasn't until Clash at the Castle 2022 (only about 7 months ago) that he turned on Rey and joined JD. The complete turn around on him is nothing short of amazing, it completely and utter reinvigorated him, reinvented even.
100%. I stopped watching WWE shotly after he became part of the roster, and I just remember him as being a kinda tubby kid that seemed to have no chance of carrying on the Mysterio family legacy. Fast forward to now and even with just watching Mania weekend I'm fully bought in to this guy being the top heel in the world, he's just so hateable.
Camera had to stay off him he was corpsing
They're jealous cause he hasn't shared his recipe for prison wine!
We don’t talk about that bald fuck
Where is Ciampa?
God that was the best. Coming out to no music and just getting destroyed by crowds. What a time in NXT history.
that bald motherfucker
im actually scared of the latino crowd,  they neeed to hire extra security for dom, i swear of  god  haha
Roman the night after he defeated Taker in 2017
Let him beat Roman for the belts. I wouldn't even be mad.
Probably because dom has a greater crowd reaction than rey
And to think Rey had zero experience being a heel  This is all Dom and judgement day
Reminds me of The Rock. Started out as a nepotism bland babyface and didn't start to shine until he became a douchey heel.
Bro imagine if he wins a title. Every one will boo him because he sly dogged the way into a title. Please papa h give my man dom a title shot
Blasphemy. But imagine Cody about to beat roman at mitb. Bloodline neutralized by sami and ko. And mitb holder dominik runs in with judgment day and takes the belts off of roman by making it a triple threat. The heat for Dominik taking the titles off of roman. But really who else is left that roman hasn't beaten, and is as over as Dom?
And this doesn’t even do it justice for in the arena. I couldn’t hear Dom over the boos lol
Legit. I could barely hear him for most of the promo and I was really trying
He should be heel for most of his career
Smile if you love men's prostates.
He's had it since he got out of "lockup" lol
It even goes between both sides of his face. I love it so much
I disagree.   I think Rey winning and how they went about it was perfect and the right call. Especially how it was built up, you needed Rey to get instant revenge and teach his son a lesson.
Nah imagine he beats bad bunny in Puerto Rican, the heat might be even better
I knew Rey was winning when he said he wasn't retiring. He's going to go out on his back, putting his boy over.  And I hope we get some more time before that happens
Agreed. To me that was the biggest "wrong call" of the weekend.
How could the crowd reaction be any better lol
I think they realised there was still gonna be enough in that if they let it keep going until Backlash in PR
That would have ended the story essentially and there's a lot left to tell
No, save that for Rey's retirement match. The heat will be EPIC if he wins that.
Dom trying to win mami back has so much potential 😂
He has a STENTORIAN AF voice to go with it too
He's come a real long way. Idk if you remember that first nuclear heat promo of his, but I believe he had a minor panic attack.
14 staples. If you can find the photo of it circulating, it looks gnarly.  Also found out he had a grade 2 calf tear heading into mania too
At what point does he go The Miz' route? Miz had heat heat back then now he just has heat. You only boo him cus he wants you to. Dom is just a heel heel.
Why not?
Yeah look at all those ultra fake cgi people giving him the thumbs down too....that certainly added to the fake boos  >!/s!<
You can visually see the whole crowd booing and pointing their thumbs down, I think it's legit.
the Latino heat??
Eddie should’ve won that custody match knowing that Rey is a deadbeat dad
Will you **stop?!**
I’m here from the front page, and I always liked Rey Mysterio as a kid. (He looked cool.) What happened to make him a shitty father?
His character is awesome, he plays the part well
> Monty Python's House of Black  Damnit that is one of the best descriptions for what they've become.
Only in wrestling can the "monty python" version of something be more beneficial than the 'spooky/brooding' group.  like you know, they actually get to talk and have personalities lol
I mean they were 'legit ooky spooky' for like... a week. The fact Edge separated cause he didnt wanna be spooky and then... they didnt even stay spooky...  I still wonder what Vince had planned then, if only to know how it wouldve built Priest up.
I was one of those people that had zero faith in the Judgement Day and yet they ended up becoming my favourite act on Raw and being in that group allowed Dom and Rhea to flourish. They all gotta stick together after this draft.
Turning chicken shit into the finest chicken [fingers](https://youtu.be/ot4oFfE_R4A)
It’s like the New Day when they shifted away from the preacher gimmick
The four of them together are so compelling that losses barely matter. I was mildly irritated for Dom and Finn this weekend, and in one promo it all went away. They'll probably lose at Backlash and I'll be mad when it happens, but within one week they'll be just as hot as they were.
Same thing with LA Knight, if he stayed Max Dupri, he would not have gone over with the fans.
I don’t think they need to. I don’t see why this feud needs to continue past Backlash.   I’m sure they wanna do another Dominik vs Rey match. But that would be Summerslam or next year’s Mania is my guess. But this faction stuff I don’t see what more we need besides Rhea vs Zelina, and that should probably happen at Backlash too.
I'm wondering who they could add, if they so choose.  Maybe a NXT Superstar?
They've been kicking Legado's ass every week as it is
Oh man, if Dom says something about the Sonics, he may not make it out of the arena alive lol.
They're in Portland
I don't think you truly understand how screwed over Seattle fans were with the entire Supersonics situation.  I felt so bad for them when that went down.
Dude the Sonics are a sore spot for Seattle lol
Some say, on a quiet Seattle night, if you listen carefully to the wind, you can still hear a faint "booooo!"
Clearly KO and Elias were also surprised by how strong that hit landed.
I still think Rock roasting the Sacramento Kings was better than Elias and KO, but I will give the latter props for getting such a continuous reaction.   https://youtu.be/B-G1nnfyWmc?t=44  edit: Bonus points if you watched long enough to see Austin almost break character at the line.
I was at that RAW. It was incredible. The Key Arena was maaaaybe half full, but it was fucking loud like it was a packed house.
Got link?
The KO and Elias segment wasn't this decade.
10 fucking minutes straight of booing, “fuck you roman” chants, and more booing. That was the type of heat heels dream of.. except he was babyface.
And Vince said, “Okay, Chico”
Viva la Razor?
I watched a video yesterday where they joked about how Eddie (especially WCW Eddie with the mullet) looked like someone you'd see on a "Wanted" poster for stabbing an old ladies dog with scissors.
I can’t think of anyone at all. Roman and MJF are the cool heels people like to cheer for sometimes but Dom is just fucking HATED.
Vickie Guerrero...
Old school heat. The best kind.
For sure. He’s reached that point where even the fans who usually cheer the heels will boo him out of respect for the character.   Dom is currently one of my favorite parts of the show, but if I was live I would boo the fuck out of him.
Funny enough, Early Jim Cornette heat.  (The loaded tennis racket gimmick was all about how tennis was the posh gentleman's sport at the time and young Jim's mom was essentially buying his wrestling career.)
Ciampa heat
That's what I kept thinking. Finn looked stoked for him.
I guarantee you Rey is in the background with a huge smile on his face too.  Dom is killing it right now.
That's because he knows he's making his real father proud
I love how you can read their lips and Damien asks him "hey you good?"  And Dom responds "yeah I'm  got it" (or something like that)  Finn over there just composing and the camera has to stay off him
Yeah you can see him having to compose himself and hide a smile. eliciting a crowd response that intense must feel amazing, regardless if it’s boos or cheers.
So imagine what it's going to be like when he wins.   Oh shit...maybe he should win King of the Ring so he can call himself the TRUE REY MYSTERIO
*wrestler finds success and has the biggest undercard reaction in years*  “Yeah I bet they’re probably proud deep down”
and the new  fcking vince mustache also, i swear to god this man knows whats hes doing.
Finn said that heel turn and the gif of all of them pointing and laughing at Rey is when it all turned around for JD.  I tend to agree. They really embraced being Goth shit heads from then on which has worked wonders for them
The holiday vignettes and Prison Dom stuff def put him over. He plays the cowardly heel role very well. Even his Celtic Warrior Workout episode kept up the kayfabe which added to his character.
Feels like a lifetime ago
It’s easier to be a heel than a face
Wonder if when Rhea leaned over to say something to him it was "dude you have to stop looking so delighted"
Ia this a Fuck Ciampa party?
He's been injured. He got hip surgery back in October.
Injured
I just loved how the boos acted as his ring music. 😂😂😂
I don't know how anyone ever tops that.
Kenta attacking Tetsuya Naito at wrestle kingdom after Naito winning double gold dash.
Honestly the story is there. Dom talks about his dad's connection to Ecw and Finn convinces the Usos to jump ship plus Roman just being a dickhead to them. I dont see anyone beating Roman clean for a while might as well have his empire crumble because of his own faults
Subscribe
Man I would take a Dom run as US Champ right now over Theory
I'd love to see him and Priest wind up as tag team champs just so Dom can talk about how great it is having a REAL tag team partner.
I hope he does the Eddie thing where he's always a lying, cheating scumbag even in situations where he's technically face.
It's so silly I love him
Omg lol
Domink vs Rey 2 down the line will be amazing. Now that MITB people can use the briefcase on the US and IC title, wouldn't that be something for Dominik to cash-in on his father?
Not to mention the stakes weren't high enough. Wrestlemania just closed a chapter, the next one, where Dominik eventually gets his back, would have to be for more - a mask vs. Dom leaving Judgment Day match, for example - to truly make it mean something. If Dom wins such a match, imagine the heat he would get (just by having Rey's mask at RR and by wearing one at WM he didn't earn the negative response was insane).  I do think down the line Rey is retired by Dominik, but that's a ways away yet.
>imagine he beats bad bunny in Puerto Rican  Hopefully they'll have subtitles
Not as big as Finn losing. Demon Balor needed that win.
Yeah agreed. I would've thought Rey would want nothing more than for his son to beat him on the biggest stage. But clearly this fued is not over yet.
Yep, same.  Especially if you had him win with interference.
The second biggest mistake of night 1 after Theory beating Cena
I can’t see the cocky prick heel working as a face I mean having no remorse or caring about anything but yourself ( and mami ) doesn’t really show good guy vibes
Like I said, I don’t doubt whatsoever that he was getting crazy booed, but that is no question fake crowd noise. It’s WWE, they do this shit all the time lol. Not denying the heat, denying the dumb fake ass crowd noise.
Yeah but he got screwed over by Vickie who once again sided with the abuser
If Eddie was still alive this would definitely turn into a heel Eddie and Dom partnership just absolutely shitting on Rey.
One is a deadbeat and the other had a deadbeat.
He beats his kids
I disagree on him playing it well. I think he’s awful on the mic and in the ring, it’s a good character tho albeit a bit cringe.
With each of them them speaking multiple languages (english, spanish, gaelic, aussie), they're polyg(l)oths.
To be fair I can never take that spooky/brooding stuff seriously, like I always find it funny whenever HOB or Bray Wyatt are on screen. Undertaker only gets a pass because I was a kid when he was doing majority of his stuff.
JD McDonough he'd fit in perfectly
Dijak? If you are picking from NXT, he looks like the one
Grayson Waller or Someone like Mustafa Ali
Noam Dar
If he says anything about my beloved Sonics, I'm ~~swingin'~~ booing very loudly and making angry gestures!
What if he comes out wearing a Seattle  Jersey? 👀
"What do the Seattle Supersonics and my father have in common?  They are not around!"
The person you’re responding to said they’ll be in Seattle on Monday
I’m not familiar with US sports teams that much but yeah i believe you when you say they were screwed. Like Elias could’ve genuinely punted a newly born infant and he wouldn’t have gotten half that reaction.
Browns fans understand.
I felt bad for them too, until they tried to take the Kings from Sacramento, then I was like F that, you guys stay irrelevant
The look Elias gave Kevin before they just sat there and let it happen was hilarious.
https://youtu.be/4YyszLIHEQU Starts around the 3 minute mark and just goes on and on
https://youtu.be/XigdA6kiLcE
And he milked it *so* goddamn well. Every time it seemed like the noise was starting to die down, he would start to bring the mic back up to his mouth and reignite the fury in the crowd to even hotter levels. I suppose the upshot of them not turning him heel then was that we probably wouldn't have gotten the Bloodline storyline the way we did, but goddamn it was RIGHT THERE.
I agree. I had this discussion a few weeks ago on another thread. Roman is the top heel in the business but Dom is the *bigger* heel because he gets a bigger negative reaction than anyone else right now and it's not even close.
Totally agree. MJF and Roman are like Petyr Baelish. You're supposed to root against them because they're the "antagonists" but you actually think they're cool. Dominic is straight-up Joffrey Baratheon.
I can only think of Jeff Jarrett as someone else who gets actual heat but Dom is easily far more hated
I've used it before but the word "detestable" just fits Dom so damn good. The heat baby, the heat!
It's honestly hilarious seeing grown men and women smiling while booing him
I mean, it's hard to boo MJF with a singing voice like that, but I agree.  For me, Dom is easily the best heel in the company right now, and one of the best heels in the pro wrestling world period.
Booing Dom is legitimately part of the experience now! It’s so funny
The King-Dom.
Book it. This man’s a genius
Eh it kinda depends. There are guys who just don’t play the heel role well at all tbh.
I think it depends. It was clearly difficult for Edge this last round where the fans didn't want to boo him.
I’m this day and age it’s hard to get this reaction as a heel if you’re performing well. Fans enjoy great heel work so they will eventually start cheering the heel like KO or the Bloodline because they appreciate a good performance in either direction in my dumbass opinion
You still need to do it right to maintain the level of heat Dominik has.   His tutelage under Finn (probably one of the most accomplished promos especially as a heel) and Priest (who's got a bunch of years and experience under him) has borne fruit in so many ways.
25 years of cool heels has utterly ruined babyfaces.  Even Rock and Austin were just cool heels at their core who were booked like faces.
Dom is doing it right now.
Mr MITB
Like father, like son.
Oooh, wouldn't be my first avenue for a MITB winner this year as I really want a world title MITB winner but I wouldn't mind that either!  That is a great shout.
I'm willing to accept that may have been a spur of the moment call due to Balor being injured in the match.  If not, if that was the plan, then yeah. JD should have gone 3 0 that weekend
It was probably for the fans
Or by cheating
Cena beating Theory would've buried him in really bad taste
I agree, so he should just stick with this gimmick and evolve from there as a heel. He did awful as a face initially
I've brought up your same point in other threads where the real crowd noise is impossible to discern from whatever they're constantly piping in. To me it sounds awful. I guess we're the only ones.
Woof
DAMN.
Worked yourself into a shoot brother.
Vickie catching strays in here.
![gif](giphy|S462DTPLA2KVN0fIeF|downsized)  Broadside fired!      (Sorry about the GIF choice, it's the best I could find)
I agree so let's say he flounders it well
get the fuck out
Undertaker is like 6’10 and looks like a monster, also Paul Bearer helped with that.  Also a lot of the Undertaker stuff throughout the 90s was awful.
McDonough would be better given he was trained by Finn and his creepy personality
Grayson would be perfect
He's getting booed, sliding out of the ring and saying he feels safer close to the crowd because in Seattle they don't rush from a yard out.
Just have him come out with a Durant OKC jersey and not say anything about it.
Depending on Elias's form and hang time,he may have been cheered. Lol JK.  Seattle fans are awesome. I say this as a New Yorker but they are in the mix for best fans. They get hyped and loud for damn near everything.
We have proof of [this](https://youtu.be/IU_-MFNRSeA).
I'm sure it wasn't his fault.
there's an alternate timeline where Seattle never lost the sonics and Kevin Durant has all the legacy points added  > https://streamable.com/2tn4d
To be fair, I saw someone do that and get a huge pop.
It's my understanding that Seattle loves their sports teams and that those teams have a huge footprint (area that primarily roots for them) but that people don't often want to go play for them and road games are harder since even the close teams are in California. It's particularly bad for baseball because so many teams are so old and so far east.
I love how Elias waits for it to start to die off, then hits them with the "Oklahoma City"
“No respect for Detlaf Schrempf.”
Oh my god the Schrempf line. One of the first breakthrough Europeans!
Dom is someone you go to school with or is a co-worker who you want to punch but the consequences are too much  Roman is like Aaron Rodgers, famous, popular but hated by people for being so fucking annoying specifically to people like me who are lions fans. All I can do is talk shit about him online.
You’re straight up trippin! Dom is The Mountain! No wait… Domountain
I have yet to meet anybody who thought that slimy fuck Baelish was ever cool.
Didn't Joffrey have 'X Pac heat'?
I see a lot people here missed Christian Cage being a giant piece of shit to Jungle Boy for months  And the worst part was that damn turtleneck!
Stone Cold is the biggest and best example.
That's the thing. Everyone says it's Rhea doing it, but she's learning just as much as Dom is now.
It's great heat. But I don't know if I'd put it in the same category
I need that little shit to win MITB. He would be absolutely insufferable and I need it injected into my veins.
That doesn’t even make sense. They’re not gonna change the finish.
Man, imagine some good ol' early '98 Rock heel brass nucks to win.  The heat would have been enough to put L.A. back in a drought.
Now that I think of it your right
People believe what the want to believe, I guess that’s what WWE was hoping to achieve anyways. It’s so clearly fake, it’s hilarious people can’t see that flat out.
Just like she left her daughter a stray.
Almost all of it with very few exceptions up until the attitude era.
I mean... Yeah that's why I said he only gets a pass because I was a kid. If I was late 20s when i watched it he be in the same  category as Black and Bray.
This is amazing. As a 49er fan hate watching that Superbowl at a Superbowl party with all 9er fans, none of us could believe what we had just seen.
You trying to get him murdered?
Holy shit.
Man, I was at a corporate event where someone from Boston tweaked Russell Wilson about this in a Q&A session less than a year after the fact. I'm from the Boston area too, but in the moment it felt like the Platonic ideal of mitigating circumstances.
Someone needs to tweet this to Dom, I’d love to see that and the reaction lmao
[dawg](https://i.gifer.com/Pxyj.gif)
>They get hyped and loud for damn near everything.  It helps their NFL stadium was designed specifically to be loud by virtue of the upper levels and the partial roof. All of the sound goes up, bounces and comes back down to the field. Obviously the fans need to be making noise for this to work, but they get some help from the structure lol.
For a while there we were a 2 sport city, and the Mariners (until recently) barely counted as a team. We are rowdy whenever anything goes down or comes to town.
They got a playoff bound Kraken team now
You Are Awesome!  Perfect
The moment she lodged herself in my heart.
That's the line where I completely lost it.
This is such a good description. Not only because he has people behind him but also because he’s still so young it feels wrong. Wwe hasn’t really touched on a young untouchable heel like this before whose main thing is just being a stuck up kid
The funny thing is if Roman and Dom were in the ring together, it’s obvious who would get booed.
I think the better analogy would be Tywin Lannister.
I'd give X Pac heat to Theon's brother who I won't ever bother to look up his name.
Yeah I agree that heat was next level. The transition from “Undertaker” to “fuck you Roman” to initiate the 10 minute + heatwave was something else.  Then every time he even MOVES the microphone.  Hard to top that.
If a wrestler is too hurt to continue, they'd absolutely change on the fly. Happened before.
Yeah but to me Bray is just a bit silly, he’s not scary or intimidating. Undertaker was scary even with all the spooky stuff because he was a beast.
I'm not even a Seattle fan but I sometimes throw on Beastquake on youtube because it's so damn satisfying. It's a beautiful stadium and the fans fucking rock that place.
They get loud for MLS ! They have my respect.
Fellow Chiefs fan?
How are you enjoying the Kraken this year?
I'm a Rangers fan but I am thoroughly enjoying the Kraken.  It's the next hat I'm going to buy. Fucking love the design on a flex fit.
Her only good moment on commentary
Theon didn’t have a brother did he?
Except they did continue without issue after a short stoppage. At that point there’s no reason they would change the winner.
He wrestled another 8 minutes after that. If he was supposed to go over..he would have landed that coup de grace from the side of the cell
Oh yeah Undertaker actual presence and build gives him a huge benefit, You can find someone that looks like Bray down the street.
This is one of my favorite videos. Disclosure I'm a big fan of hearing noise outside of a stadium before you get to go inside. This is magic.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYwGDOlaPQ4
Fuck no. I'm a Broncos fan damnit!
Two that died when he was 10. I think they mean one of his uncles.
Fuck the Broncos
Ahhh fuck. Yes, the uncle from the last season.
While the sentiment for the cheifs is the same here, I will say this. Mahomes is a lot of fun to watch when he's not playing Denver. Enjoy the ride at the top. Because it ain't gonna last forever.   I want two things next season. A winning season (don't even care about the playoffs) and to beat KC for the first time in a long time.   And at the end of the day we could both say FUCK THE RAIDERS and share a beer. We are still in r/squaredcircle right? lmao.

Makes sense then why they've been holding back any debuts. Save those all for the draft where I suspect NXT will.be heavily involved this time around.   Everytime we were around draft season before, guys would randomly get pulled off of NXT or have programs end incredibly quickly without satisfying conclusions. Now, since him and HBK have that back and fourth, HBK can finish these stories the way he wants them to.
This is how Roman can break Sammartinos record. Split the belts!
Amazing he can still pop himself with a “game” pun 😂
Grayson Waller, Cameron Grimes, Pretty Deadly, & Bron Breakker   Having trouble picking a woman, so Stark?   Those are my predictions for the NXT callups. Although I’ll say I don’t think Grimes would necessarily need to be drafted.
I forgot there was a brand split, to be honest
i want some things from this draft, if this will be an actual BRAND-SPLIT, you know, smackdown and raw having their own thing.  1- be a real draft like the old days, i DONT want to see smackdown superstars on RAW and viceversa, maaaybe brand exclusive ppvs, just make both shows feel DIFFERENT and apart from each other, similar to how 2016 wwe was  2- make the rosters stronger, with little to no disparities, no more smackdowns womens divison from the 2022, where it clearly had a rougher time compared to raw's  3- if there will be an actual brand split, both brands needs their titles, the tag and world titles are still unified so i dont know how they will do this, maybe just create new titles, but if their plan is to unify all the titles that is other story (this would make having two brands pointless imo), also i guess both fox and usa would rather have their own thing going with their own championships
What does that mean?
Safe bet judgement day is moving to smackdown
The draft needed to happen the roster seemed pretty repetitive lately
NXT names I see being included:  * Bron Breakker * Cameron Grimes  * Roxanne Perez * Pretty Deadly  * Kayden & Katana * Zoey Stark
I'm guessing Gable Stevenson isn't going number 1 this year
Oh, the brand split again?? I can't care about this. WWE has never held up their end of the bargain on the brand split. There are always crossovers way too soon. "He's a Raw superstar, what's he doing on Smackdown!?" I don't care. The occasional draft just to shake things up is boring. It doesn't matter who is on which show because they all perform for the same company.
BAH GAWD JAY WHITE HAS BEEN DRAFTED TO NXT 2.0
I win if both champions of each brand will be eligible....oh.
I was glad to finally see a draft booked by Hunter because before they would just pull names out a hat after the first 5 picks.   But here we are.
I hope next weeks speech is word for word Ric Flair's "I am never gonna retire" speech and HHH throws in some elbow drops on his suit jacket.
Rename the titles to Universal and World instead of their brands
On the plus side, this is a perfect opportunity to split the titles, both world titles and tag.
Roman 2000 days
He put a weird emphasis on "... change...The Game", is he suggesting that he (Hunter Hearst Helmsley, The Game, The King of Kings) is eligible for the draft pool?
Brand split seems pointless when the titles are unified currently.
What a waste of announcement. The draft doesn't mean shit 3 months in.
I want a REAL legit draft. Vince drafts and runs Raw, HHH drafts and runs Smackdown 100% with no crossovers so we see just how shit Vince can make a show with his guys
The corporate speak of HHH has been disappointing
I mean I guess the bigger thing here is it seems like the NXT 2.0 stars are eligible on this because for the others it seems like they can be on both shows as of 2022 anyways so
###Meh
How come we don’t see HHH coming to the arena an hour late and getting out of a limo?
A draft could work with how Triple H operates, creating long term stories and characters. Just takes discipline and clearly he has it with how he’s working the Cody storyline
So much for the draft being all but dead.
Does some UFC guy get drafted to SD?
Pro: Draft occurring post WM is the best choice. Always have been.  Con: God, they gotta stop drafting the champions. Rhea and Bianca should not exchange belts like toys.
hopefully they bring my guy AJ Styles back to SD. He's probably been more time on Raw by now but he'll always feel more like a Smackdown guy to me.
Wouldn't you want to debut a few people people before the draft? To generate hype and such to see where they'll land?
Or just combine them which is a better idea since they're being treated as one belt and not two
That's horrible and makes Cody look like shit if the fucking brand split makes Roman lose a belt
I think Roman will only let Cody challenge for the WWE Title.
Terrible.
>Having trouble picking a woman, so Stark?  I could see Jacy and Gigi being split to different brands if the draft ends up happening after their blow off match.
Bron just turned heel and will probably challenge for the NXT title. Grimes and Pretty Deadly most likely.
Walker should stay in NXT longer he needs to become champion
I’m thinking KC2 could possibly get called up, to start giving depth to the tag division.
Surprised I didn’t see Roxanne on this list
Hopefully they actually keep to the brand split this times its so pointless and tireesome yo have iy and then I see wrestlers from X show on Y show almost on a weekly basis.
I just think having two world titles makes it not nearly as important. If they are gonna do that then they might as well just call them the Raw/Smackdown Championship. I would much rather have one world champion, one world tag team champion that are on both shows with a night off here and there. It should be part of being the world champion, everyone is gunning for you.   I guess just because it’s what I grew up with but I love the one world champion who feels like a big deal when they show up.
the tag division is not big enough for two titles lol
>3- if there will be an actual brand split, both brands needs their titles, the tag and world titles are still unified so i dont know how they will do this, maybe just create new titles, but if their plan is to unify all the titles that is other story (this would make having two brands pointless imo),  Not opinion objective fact I remember when they did this with the tag titles and the Divas title.  It was fucking stupid. Especially with every title being separate.
Ehhh. I could also see another title exchange between rhea and belair happening, as dumb as that is. Assuming belair gets drafted instead.
Bron just turned heel and is feuding with Melo
100% agree. It's never presented as 2 separate companies and two titles is fucking stupid
I know this is a joke. But i do not really get the hype around Jay White. Can you tell me?
You seem like a fun person.
They can't do that because Fox pays way to much money not to have big names on the show.
Synergistic unity towards the North Star of equity
No, I would not want to do that. You want the Draft to feel special. You want surprises. You don't just want to shift around guys to specific brands when they have all been working RAW and SD willy nilly regardless. You want to be able to say as a fan, "I don't know who this Grayson Waller guy is, but he was Drafted to RAW and he's debuting next week, so I can't wait to find out!"
Oh that is better. Maybe Roman stays uWu champ on smackdown and crown a new World champ on Raw to bring back the winged eagle.
yeah the dirtsheets like it was already plan in advance for roman to win if split the belts then what's the point of cody losing?
To be honest I always expected the belts would be split by Adam Pearce.  Roman and the bloodline do something that pisses him off enough to make him book two world title matches on a PLE or a triple threat where first fall is for one title and the second fall for the other so in theory Roman could still leave undisputed but would only leave with one or none
This. Cody needs his flowers. He’s ready. They also want Roman to break a record. Easy solution. Cody wins MITB and goes for the WWE title.  You can have both things then.
Neither of them is ready solo as much as I like them.
Some people don’t need to be a champion before they come up, and I think Waller fits that. I think he has all the tools to be a success on the main roster already. Although I’d be lying If I said a Waller/Hayes feud didn’t intrigue me. Plus the matches would FUCK!
I can see him winning the North American title from Wes Lee
By that logic the company isn’t big enough to split the brands 😗
Ok? I’m not going going to completely rule him out though due to how Kevin Owens was still NXT Champion when he was brought up for the John Cena feud and worked NXT still on the side to eventually drop the title to Finn while Sasha was the NXT Women’s Champion when she was brought up and worked NXT still on the side to eventually drop the title to Bayley in their feud. Bron could keep working NXT on the side and continue to help push Melo as the top babyface of the brand. I know it might be questionable to even bring Bron up while as a heel but you just never know though.
Top level heel in New Japan since Devitt in early 2010s. Great enough on the mic to garner a reaction out of a crowd that wasn’t allowed to cheer due to covid limitations. Sold out Madison Square Garden. Grand slam champ in a manner of like 4 years
A buffer Adam Cole. That's it. That's the hype
I could see doing that with a couple of folks.  But let's say, for instance, you have 5 folks getting called up. At least have two do run ins for the raw and smackdown after WrestleMania. Instead we got Riddle and Riddle.
That would be dumb as fuck to bring back a former WWE title design for something other than the WWE title. The Big Gold Belt or a new title design would be the only ones to make sense, and the Big Gold Belt would bring instant legitimacy to it.
>uWu champ  No
Cody winning MITB and ONLY ONE title would be so frickin cheap.   They don't know what they missed when the had Cody lose at Wrestlemania.
COdy NEeDs hIS fLOwErS
Gigi has been wrestling for like 8 years now, Is another year in NXT gonna change much?
Dolin is more than ready. Jacy needs another year of seasoning.
Ooooo. Alright, im a huge fan of heel wrestlers. I appreciate it, im gonna check his stuff.
Yeah I think you're onto something where you're continually giving the fans a little bit more and more new stuff
Cody has said he wants the winged eagle specifically
>No  UwU?
if that year involves being in the main event of the women’s division then yes
Check out his stuff with Ibushi Omega Okada Naito and Tanahashi
Yeah but I doubt he wants it brought back as a bullshit knockoff title that isn’t a part of the WWE Title lineage
Who do you think she hasn't worked with in NXT yet that will really push her to new limits?
i feel like the plan is for jacy to take the title from indi and then feud with gigi for it, i think a full on title feud between gigi/jacy would be great for them both

The chant out grew the person. People do what chants more than 20 years after stone cold.
Wait until you find out where too sweet originally came from and hear some of the stories from the group's leader. It'll blow your mind.
At this point I would wager most of the fans doing it have no idea who Marty Scurll even is, let alone why he isn't around anymore.  Its one of those things that just caught on and now its a thing, the original meaning is now irrelevant. Just like most people chanting "what" don't know it was a Stone Cold thing, they just know its a thing people chant. I'm sure some people yelling "WHOOOO" on chops don't know about Ric Flair too.
Nobody knows or cares that it has anything to do with Mary, it's just a Bullet Club thing now.
People do Yes chants in WWE and Bryan ain’t there. Happens
Same reason people do Seven Nation Army chants for The Acclaimed.
It’s simple. The chant transcended beyond Marty. Most people  don’t know it originated from him anyway/
The fans are just really big Juggalos
Man, I love Marty but it's rough watching him lately. Last show I saw him at had like 50 people and more event staff than fans.
Unsure if you've noticed, but we wrestling fans, as a whole, not the brightest folks.
I know people in this sub aren't gonna like this but it's the truth. Most Pro wrestling fans are annoying. They are the ones who will still chant "WHAT" during a segment 20 years removed from when it was popular.   All you can do is accept this and not engage with them.
We're gonna chant WHOO for chops for another hundred years.
It's AEW, of course they know who he is, Scurll was supposed to be one of their OG's.
New Day's "Who Who Who" has ingrained itself pretty effectively
Most fans do not. They just think of it as a general Bullet Club chant.
As much as the ratings threads pretend it is, the current AEW crowd is not the same crowd they had on Day 1. All you have to do is look at the audience then and now and the difference is night and day, there are visibly more women and kids, in particular, now than they ever had back then. Its a big part of how they're actually able to run these big shows now that they couldn't 3 years ago.  All of the Marty stuff was years ago at this point, AEW is closing in on its fourth year on tv and he has never appeared (or I presume even been mentioned) as part of their programming. Plenty of new fans have shown up during that time.
I never knew thats where it came from,  i just thought it was some fun thing the fans do for no reason. I only discovered the Elite with AEW  Im finding out through this post
He was also supposed to be a Paul Heyman guy. Bro had a golden ticket with BOTH companies
The “Yes” chant has been used in situations that haven’t involved Daniel Bryan for a very long time too

They’re sending Roman down to NXT so he can add one more to his collection
Hey an actual announcement!
Oh good, the shows need a serious shakeup.
Smart time for a draft. Hope we get a good reset
Wow. Can you imagine a Raw superstar like Rhea Ripley on Smackdown? A Smackdown star like Solo on Raw? Can’t even picture it.
cannot believe you’ve titled it like this
The draft. Where brand exclusivity lasts about 3 weeks.
Do bingo balls again, with a complaining Paul Heyman for maximum entertainment.
I hope we get the draft rooms with people going apeshit for picking Natalya!
Triple H on Monday: "Nothing will change"  Triple H on Friday: "It's gonna change the whole game"
maybe this is where the callups happen, and there will be actual storyline reason for them besides…”i’m tired of NXT, lemme go see what’s happening on Smackdown”
hi Pretty Deadly to Smackdown please
Oh good. I love the draft
When was the last time the draft was actually exciting? Steph vs Bischoff era?  But if he's calling it "game changing," then I guess maybe this one will be splitting up the world titles?
I know the brand split is mostly not a thing anymore but I still absolutely love The Draft 🤷‍♂️  I'm going to enjoy it.
Whats the point of a draft if the rosters and titles just appear on whatever show they want anyway?
“Let me tell you a personal story about Vince McMahon. You know we do this whole anti-bullying campaign-“
>Triple H Announcement Part II: ~~Electric~~ Rick Boogsaloo
Did he say my dad is totally not here tonight and there are two kegs in the garage if y’all want but we just have to clean EVERYTHING up before he gets home
The draft is how they’ll separate all undisputed titles again
This is the time HHH! Split the belts so each brand has a champion!
Hope they trade Vince to CZW
Oh they're still pretending there's a brand split huh
The draft is exciting news but I really hope they dont do it the way they did the last couple of times where they just put everyone in the pool and the rosters look almost the same as they did before except for like 1 or 2 people. I legit want to see these rosters completely shaken up.
Post Wrestlemania season has always been the best time to do a draft. Doing it in the fall never made sense.
A few seconds into the promo and people in the live thread were already freaking out that it was the same promo lol. Anyways, good to see the draft back. It was about time.
I guess the draft is cool
Ah yes a draft that in no way makes the wrestlers actually exclusive to their brand
smackdown needs women talent so this is great
If they're serious with this draft, they should add GMs like couple years ago. Adam Pearce and Regal would be my choices
absolutely no way I could tell you what brand a single wrestler is on right now
 But he said nothing was changing!
Actual substance this time around at least. Always hyped for the draft.
 With the 1st pick of the 2023 WWE Draft, Smackdown selects . . . Jon “Bones” Jones.
Triple H really be coming out every week like "TONIGHT-UH" again huh?
Christ... Back to the BS "Brand" thing again?  Just keep people unofficially on either or both shows and have them back and forth as needed by stories.    We end up with them trying to invent reasons like a wild card rule or something that they can't event keep consistent for two weeks in a row.   Things were going just fine without inventing rules that you aren't going to follow anyway.
Hospital Trips is running the show
Hope draft brings out brand split and we get new tag titles and a new world title
Lol Vince is really going full steam ahead to the way things were a few years ago
If Roman still refuses to work Mondays, I wouldn't mind if Walter/Gunther became The Final Boss of Monday Night
Wait but he said nothing would change.
Twist - They're drafting not for Smackdown and Raw, but WWE and UFC!
Vince to run Raw? Triple H to run SD?
What an ass of announcement. What’s the point of doing a draft when every wrestler can appear on either Raw or Smackdown whenever the fuck he wants?
Lol is this how they're going to let people go from the merger? If you aren't drafted...
You know who won't be in that draft? Jay White!
hmmm...will they be doing it the same time as the NFL draft?
Not too sure about a draft while Roman has both titles and shows up once or twice a month
give me Rhea and Finn draft to Smackdown and dom and priest to raw
"Every single superstar is eligible for the draft"     Like that wasn't the case with every draft they've done? Why such an emphasis on this?
If they make nxt in play to draft people also, this is a game changer.
*Tony Khan has another important announcement!*
Grayson Waller and Roxanne Perez are my picks for NXT draftees
I’m guessing the bloodline won’t be split up.
Any chance they use the draft as an excuse to strip one of the titles off Reigns?
Happy to hear about the draft
If it weren’t for the fact that Backlash is a few weeks after that I’d randomly choose May 1st
Very long overdue, the shows have needed a fresh shakeup since the summer imo, and especially the women. But please don’t tell me this is how they’ll split the titles from Roman. What an absolute waste it’d be.
Ive always loved the draft
sure Haitch "every superstar" but really its everyone except our tribal chief. Does it matter where Roman goes if he barely shows up weekly anyway?
I like the draft and I understand why some people don’t like it.  But if they want to do it right, they need to introduce a new gm opposite to Pearce
Who’s ready to get blueballed again?
I really really wish there was just one champion and they’re interchangeable on shows.
Trips, this could have been an email.
Why even bother keeping up the facade of a brand split anymore?
Neat
Give me strict draft like 2016.   That was good times.
Good move. Rosters have needed a shakeup for ages.
Draft?  People are on both shows now. Waste of time. But to each their own.
MST3K keeps on giving titles.
Boys, it's HHH vs. Vince at SS, winner gets creative control. HHH gets Smackdown, Vince gets RAW. It looks like RAW is about to win but then NXT comes out to help HHH. Trips wins, Vince is officially ousted in kayfabe.
I've always thought the draft should be in December. Right after Survivor Series (which was traditionally Raw vs Smackdown) plus right before the Royal Rumble where cross brand interaction is common.
I do not understand why so many comments are excited for this "draft".  None of this matters, they have done this multiple times in the past and it never sticks. They are terrified to keep superstars on one show. Remember when Vince tried to convince AJ Styles on how this separate show shit works and AJ just had confusion on his face and dollar signs in his eyes. Im just saying, they've done all this before and just forgot cause apparently many of us just marks who forget history.
Damn y'all I thought he was going to cut a shoot promo and say he's joining the NWA /s
Maybe we can get Pete Dunne back instead of Butch
Good to see the draft is finally back. Both rosters desperately need a change up.
At least in the duel of announcements, Tony has a good lead over Hunter.
The Tony Khan School of Anticlimactic Announcements
Please give us some call-ups!! Cameron Grimes, Pretty Deadly, KC2 are the ones I’m really hoping for, inject some new life into these shows.
Every superstar? Even NXT?
I do think post-Mania is the right time for a reset but the one thing that isn't great about is that it comes after like months of the brand split being totally ignored and people appearing on whatever shows they want for no apparent reason, so I'm not sure it really hits like it should.
The Rhea Ripley thing really got me lol. Great job OP
Roman needs some fresh bowling pins to knock down for the next year.
They should use the draft to split the tags and world belts.
Are we gonna see the return of the executive battle room and Cleatus the Fox Football Robot?
Looks like some folks from NXT are getting ready to help bolster the ranks and hopefully give us some new storylines and matches
This makes sense why there wasn’t any call ups on raw, I’m expecting bron breakker to be in the draft
Please put Becky and Seth on SD
I selfishly hope it’s the Raw after Backlash so Jacksonville gets the WWE Draft
Who doesn’t like a good wretcon?
I think the reason he announced it was because this is going to be an actual 2016 style hard brand split kinda draft.
I hope they really do stick with the draft concept tho and keep the shows as separate as possible. Like 2016 Smackdown live era. This could’ve all been better if a certain someone won and unified the titles along side Sami and ko. But now I don’t have such a good feeling about brand exclusivity
I don't have high hopes for them sticking to the brand split. Wouldn't be shocked a single bit if we see a Raw guy at SD and vice versa just 2 weeks later
Everyone’s doing actual big announcements this week
WWE Draft! The draft rules have been very loose last few years.
Vince is gonna do the draft so...
Draft just a way to call up more NXT ready star
Remember when The Fiend got drafted? Hopefully this one is written with more care
My theory: they want each show to have their own champion again, but Vince doesn't want Roman to get beaten yet. As a compromise they are going to force him to forfeit one of the belts in storyline to take it off of him once he get's drafted.  I really hope this isn't how they get the belt on Cody. That's such a cop out.
My favorite thing about an announcement like this with Vince back is that it may just mean nothing. They may change their mind, and never talk about this draft again. Nothing means anything with Old Man McMahon back in the chair.
I'm not a fan of the draft. Don't like having wrestlers restricted to a particular show. Really limits the potential feuds you can run with, as well.
That’s one way to split up the Bloodline.
This is all to split up the New Day again, isn't it.
Wow a draft. Do we still have a brand split? Or was the wildcard rule still in play?   I also hope the raw tag champs don’t go to smack down (and vise versus)
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyy another stupid, pointless, and boring draft. They've done this shit so many fucking times it's meaningless now. No one cares about brand superiority or whatever bullshit.  Their stupid PPV Bragging Rights was such hot garbage that it only lasted 1 year. Then they had the "brilliant" idea to shove that bullshit onto Survivor Series. Hopefully that shit's over with now that they brought WarGames in.  The idea of a draft and actual brand split could be good, but not the way they do it. If they're supposed to be separate brands they shouldn't be advertising for each other. They shouldn't be appearing on each other's shows except for invasion type things like when Nia punched Becky for example.  They should have completely separate rosters, refs, announcers, interviewers, stages, backstage areas, rings, aprons, tables, mats, guardrails, timekeepers, music, lights, pyro, special effects, etc.  You didn't see them advertising WCW or whatever during the Monday Night War. Why would Raw advertise Smackdown or vice versa?
Doesn’t it seemly oddly similar to those weird beginning Vinny Mac did before he retired
Welp, A draft means Vince has to be back because we haven't really had one in a bit and of course its a shake up!
They just want our attention on something other than Vince lol.
Glad they are doing a draft after Wrestlemania rather than 2 weeks before survivor series where the talent was supposed to have brand loyalty.
I have a feeling this will also lead to splitting the WWE titles.
I wonder which wrestler Vince will "draft" to his limo THIS time around.
Yup, Vince is back.....
I really hope we get new sets with this. I need RAW and SD to feel different. Also, unify the World titles and the Tag titles and introduce new ones.
I like to think he just legitimately forgot to mention the draft in his first announcement on Raw. Got back stage and just immediately said “Oh yeah…. Shit.”
PLEASE KEEP MICHAEL COLE AND FLOP DOLLA ON THE SAME SHOW
Who makes the picks?
I genuinely don’t even know who is on what show right now
Imagine Vince runs Raw, H runs Smackdown. Oh man that would be interesting.
Yay a draft, which means that when a superstar appears on another brand, I'd be totally surprised /s
I don't understand what the point is in doing a draft when wrestlers have been appearing on 2 different shows anyway. I can understand Roman appearing on both but even Dominik for example had been appearing on both.  A draft was a big deal back in like 2003.
Ah. Now judgement day will be on Smackdown.
not really down for a draft
Would it be insane not to have the brand split anymore? I have NEVER liked it. I know the ship sailed but fuck it annoys me you never see some wrestlers together.
Hahahaha, literally majority of all the major wrestlers have been showing up on RAW and Smackdown for months. What’s the point of the draft anymore?
How - and why - are people still watching this nonsense since Vince came back on Sunday?
No more Wild Card bullshit and I hope we know what ends up happening with the tag titles now
They should draft commentary teams too
“Capitol Wrestling Center…ACKNOWLEDGE ME!”
I'd be down for that assuming they renamed his title to the WWE Triple Crown.
One more move? Like a snap suplex?
No addressing of his enemies. 0/10 /s
I’m willing to bet that having the draft after Mania has been his plan all along
Can Vince be drafted to GCW?
Speaking on the show. How's this weeks Smackdown ?  'Cause I've been hearing mixed reactions, on one hand they say it's good while the other says it's the drizzling shits.
SummerSlam pay-per-view is listed as WWE vs WWE SummerSlam.   So unless that's a typo we're about to get yet another intercompany war going on where they pit the brand against itself because they are currently in a very expensive business merger with Endeavor and need filler for the fans while they build a new road map for the future of WWE.  Oh joy. I'm sure it will be much more entertaining than the last three WWE versus WWE wars they had. I'm sure in no way whatsoever will they have Roman reigns leading one side while Cody Rhodes leads the other. I'm almost positive that would never ever happen. That would be too predictable after all
I’ve always thought that the draft made the most sense a month or two after Wrestlemania. Immediately injects some more intrigue into the Summer
Lmao I was thinking the same thing.  The “roster split” is already an extremely loose term with how things operate.
I'm actually pretty happy how they've been doing it lately. Rhea got to be on Smackdown because she won the Rumble and challenged Charlotte. The Bloodline gets to be on both shows because they hold/held both shows' world and tag titles. People tend to cross over when they're involved with those unified titles.
Indeed. You barely ever see Raw wrestlers show up on Smackdown… unless you watch the shows every week. Who the fuck cares about a draft when everyone bounces back and forth between Raw and Smackdown already!?
They should honestly just hold 2 drafts a year lol, 1 major one and a small 2nd one after SS for a quick reset incase of injury/stale stories.
Tbf there was a lot of cross-brand rivalries during this WM season, that's why the brand split was loose during the past few months.  Rhea (Raw) vs Charlotte (SD)  Sami (SD) and KO (Raw) vs The Usos (SD)  Roman (SD) vs Cody (Raw)
Unless by draft pick he meant between main roster & NXT 2.0?
I get your point, but Rhea is currently the smackdown champ so your example is flawed.
...Its happening. They're here. Deal with it.
As someone that for a lot of times went " Dont blame Vince for Triple's mistakes". This very much feels like a classical Vince Mcmahon booking.
I did it for da rock
Hey now, it matters when you wear a blue shirt or a red shirt around Survivor Series time
Remember the wildcard rule lmao
Yeah the brand split right now feels pretty much like it did in 2010/2011 where it’s much more of vague guidelines than anything.
Brand split feels even more redundant than ever
i hope roman reigns is drafted to raw so aj styles can main event smackdown again.  if i were booking i'd have theory issue an open challenge then have aj styles return.  there's some great matches to be had and it could help aj shake the ring rust while giving theory much needed experience.
He is THE GAME after all who better to change it  ![gif](giphy|EOJ9WHhynM4Ygp9wGW|downsized)
nice catch
Drafting a Bronson Reed while he is also on the Road for Smackdown would be cool.
They aren't splitting the world titles as long as Roman has them.
2016 was exciting for me
Splitting the world titles at this point would be kinda lame. Especially if it's because of a draft or "management says I can't have two".
When the network execs were going mad that they drafted Nattie
Probably the tag team titles at least. Probably not Roman's.
I'm one of the few people who thinks the brand split has always sucked and it should be ended.
The world and tag titles are undisputed, of course they appear on both shows. The women’s tag titles go across both shows too, though Liv and Raquel are going to Raw to challenge Becky and Lita.  I get wanting the titles split again, but the people appearing on both shows make sense for the most part. Like you’d think Mustafa Ali and Elias have been showing up on Smackdown every week for the past 6 months with how some people are acting.
Seems like something new lol. Look at all the people stoked for it. Good timing as well considering everyone was starting to shit on wwe again.
Think the main thing is the built in story or reset a superstar can have. Drafted to other show, win a match and make them out to be a contender despite losing 3 times in a row in the previous weeks on the other show.
Remember during 2002-2007 they were actually really strict with the division and both brands legitimately hated each other? I miss those times.
Draft/shake up should always be after mania not late year like after summerslam.
I don’t think Regal can be a TV personality for a full year was part of the deal for him being released from AEW.
*ruin Raw
Maybe they change that as part of the draft?
Why does that matter?
this time it's all of them other times it was anyone
Yeah. A way to gather more views
I need Pretty Deadly and Cameron Grimes on the main roster too.
At this point, no chance they strip him of any titles. Best we can hope for is they merge the two titles official and we get a brand new (or returning WHC) title on Raw.
Tk- "we're gonna sell out a 90k arena for our first london show"  HHH- "we're doing the draft."  IWC- "These announcements are the same"
Plus you know the tag and singles world belts still being unified
Yeeeaaaahhhhhh... brand splits historically do not work out. Like, ever. None of it sticks.
Considering they botched the name of the actual triple crown, probably not
8:45 pm: "AND THAT BRINGS ME TO MY ENEMIES, WHO I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS."  9:57 pm: "AND DON'T GET ME STARTED ON SCOTT STEINER. LET ME TAKE YOU BACK A BIT.... IT ALL GOES BACK TO 2003....."
His enemies were the friends we made along the way
PHIL, “I SAW WHO YOU TRULY WERE THE MINUTE I MET YOU. NOW THE WORLD HAS SEEN THE TRUE COLORS OF CM PUNK!“
His enemies are stale brands, 10/10
The airing of grievances.
I think that’s what was said last year so this lines up right.
This increases the odds that he'll be seriously hurt by a questionable ladder spot or a pizza cutter gone awry, which...yeah that sounds great. Book it.
Smack that mustache off with a light tube!
Send his ass to Bar Wrestling.  He and Joey Ryan can go fuck off together
Nah. MLW
It was fine. Fueds are a bit stale but it was good compared to Raw and very clearly had little to no Vince fuckery.
It was a solid show.
It's been listed that way multiple times in the past and hasn't meant anything
Wrestlemania is the finale and Backlash is the epilogue. Great time for a draft
Exactly, leans into the de facto "new wrestling year" by being 4 weeks or so after Wrestlemania that both the company and the fans acknowledge as a thing even if there is nothing official about it
Into Survivor Series.
I honestly think WWE or the networks got unhappy with the brand split rosters and pushed to bend the rules by making superstars appear on foreign brands.   I don’t blame them cause SmackDown used to look like bones around 2021-2022. I couldn’t see any potential storylines that could’ve made fans be like “SmackDown is on! I have to go watch now.” aside from Roman.
Give me the WWE trade deadline!
I like the brand split but It should be lifted during WM season imo
THERE HERE
SHUT YOUR MOUTH YOU THONG WEARING FATTY
Found Rikishi's account
Thanks for this; it's a great title for it. The title gave me a good belly laugh and this response had me doing a spit take 😅
Unless you’re wearing the other color underneath and rip it off mid match
Wasn't the wild card rule around the time they were experimenting with a bunch of different changes to pop ratings? I don't know if this is from that same time but remember when they were told to stop matches after going into commercial lol
yeah not splitting, but merging and bringing a new (or old) one back is possible
Maybe they’ll do it one at a time and have him lose the WWE Championship so his long reign still stands. It could be them slowly building to his demise.
Man I really loved 2016 Smackdown
There’s a part of me that doesn’t hate the idea of “the titles are split because Triple H says so on the grounds that it isn’t fair to Raw that Roman never wants to show up there so their world title is being held hostage.”  But most of me doesn’t like a champion just being stripped of a title.
two world champions means creative has to work twice as hard.  i'm all for it.
I loved how Bischoff and Stephanie would one up each other it felt like a real rivalry it was interesting.
Nice!
It doesn't, timing just seemed interesting
Pretty Deadly would be awesome  Imagine them with MMM lol
Taking one of the 500 TK "announcements"
I’m not talking about as on screen characters I’m talking about as bookers.
“I piss clean, who says I don’t. Naitch, you’re my friend, test my piss.”
"Because you see-uh, in this business-uh, one makes a lot of enemies when they're at the top of the game-uh..."
At least he didn’t talk about Katie Vick.
And it ends at Sacrifice!
The pain is temporary the game is forever!
Nick FN Gage is frothing at the mouth for that match. Matter of fact let’s throw Mox into the mix.
Fuck that, send him the XPW so someone can cram a handful of skewers in his junk.
So it was watchable ?
I’m fine with that but let’s just be honest about it. What is the point of a draft really?
I get your point but the best year in the past decade for consistency was SD 2016 and that was peak brand split
Jesus that's smart, Post WM draft and post SS the Trade deadline.  Where's the guy who stole the bloodline concept when you need him?!
Fuck gimme the war room footage of Smackdown management losing their shit after landing Shanky for Natalya, Noam Dar, and a conditional pick whether Shanky goes Amish within six months.
I agree, especially with events like Royal Rumble, WarGames and Elimination Chamber around where loads of qualification matches take place.
World titles should just be floating between brands imo
needs more lower case rs.
But we don't know if he did it for da people
"Hey Big Show, why you puttin a red shirt on under your Smackdown shirt?"  "Tee hee, no reason." 😜
Wildcard Rule and random 2 out of 3 falls matches.
They booked themselves into a corner by wanting a firm brand split, but then Vince went out to announce the wild card rule which would allow superstars from different brands to sometimes go to the other show 😂
Yeah it seemed like a fragile compromise between the creative and business side where one was trying ot make sense of the stories and the other was being told by their new money-guy that Brock and Roman and Ronda need to be on this TV show even if it doesn't make sense.
bring back the big gold for smackdown and put roman on raw.
But which title so you deactivate if you merge them? When the WWEWHC became a thing the WHC was retired immediately and the physical belt was just carried around with the WWE title, but it was just the lineage of the WWE Championship. If you retire the Universal, then Roman’s days drop and he’s nowhere near 1,000. And it’d be really, really dumb to retire the WWE Championship. I suppose if you did retire the Universal then you could still say he’s been champ for x number of days, it would still be technically correct.
Oh god, cinema. Poetry. THEATAH.
No simpy
>“I piss clean  Cleanest piss in and out of the Game
Maki Otah and Nick Gage literally murder unidentified mustachioed 80 year old.
yes, definitely worth watching
Yeah, Doms heat alone was worth it.
The whole Sami and Jey story today is worth watching
Can I play devils advocate? First off, a draft is basically a "must-tune" event.  It really draws the 'average viewer'. Second, it may provide a way to possibly split the tag belts or make the US and Intercontinental titles more individually show based, like they used to be.  Idk, maybe they select a few 'can't miss' people for each show that you HAVE to tune into that show to see them.
It'll just be for the mid carders to keep the networks happy. Would be shocked if Roman officially moved from Smackdown as Fox are paying the big bucks. If say they'd move Cody to create false jeopardy but isn't he a Raw guy already?
New storylines or suddenly ending one without much effort (like splitting the Street Profits so Montez can get his push)
Survivor Series or Summerslam?
eh if its just 1 I would agree, I like having 2, 1 for each brand
Fuck, yourrrrrr right.
Or vice versa, but either way I'm all for bringing back the big gold belt. It's one of the best belt designs of all-time along with the winged eagle of course.
I get the concept but to me it has diminishing returns when the draft hasn’t been significant for years.  Obviously, it’s just my opinion, but I roll my eyes at it.
Which is fine but not a “game changing announcement”
Survivor Series
Well yeah obvs just 1, when I say titles I mean Tags and Women's.
Well it is an announcement that The Game will be making some changes.    I'll show myself out.

This guy has to get something more substantial soon. He works in his role, but he is just so over.   Honestly make him the KOTR. No goofy king gimmicks, but just pure arrogance.
Oh My God the crowd even did the YEAH after the LA Knight part
YEAH
I know LA Knight is the focus here but just want to praise Xavier. He's such a good babyface character that can challenge any heel and is a solid foil for anyone he faces.
YEAHHH I mean seriously like I’m about to start a wrestling company and make LA KNIGHT champion cause he better be some type of champion soon. His charisma is 10000000
YEAH
The dude has so much potential. it seems only TNA has really ever given him the ball. Hope WWE really pushes the guy.
The longer ppl are behind and they do nothing with him the more he will become the anti-hero
YEAH
Just curious, but anyone know how strong you gotta be to rip apart a ps5 controller?   Knight ripped that thing like a head of lettuce.  They feel solid enough, but I'm too afraid to find out myself :(
YEAH
YEAAHH is the wholesome “WHAT!?”
LA & Eddie Kingston are 2 guys I NEED to see titles on in the next year or so
YEAH
YEAHHHHH
I love Knight  YEaAH
Huge Pop!  YEAH
FUCK VIDEO GAMES  YEAH
I liked that one Making it Maximum sketch where Maxxine started channeling LA Knight when Mansoor disagreed with her. I feel they should do that on TV at some point, having her have a split personality  Anyways, he is so incredibly over, they have to do something cool with it
is it me or he sounded a bit like Macho Man?
It got a huge pop in my living room too.
Didn't we see this match a few weeks ago?
I really like his sunglasses. Anyone know what they are?
Everyone who was in the crowd at Wrestlemania was waiting for him to show up the entire night both nights and we were pretty pissed that it didn't happen
YEAAAAAAH
I agree, been saying that myself. Having Knight become King just makes sense.
Even just have something as simple as him after winning saying "I'm The King....(crowd emphatically shouts YEAHHH) I SAID THE KING (MORE) YEAHHHHHS) AND LEMME TELL YOU SOMETHIN" It would be damn good.
He will be at the next ppv to give Logan Paul a W
no KOTR, being KOTR and getting over as KOTR is a rare feat and can be do more damage than good.  he doesn't need a gimmick ontop of a gimmick.
Build a Xavier vs LA Knight feud, have Xavier want to “defend” his KOTR win and get the two of them to the finals of the tournament
![gif](giphy|lPozKgECkbBhQ1AMFI|downsized)  Fans can’t resist that undeniable kavorka
YEAH
King Woods didn’t get the love it should have gotten from creative
Tony, you already have 2 wrestling companies. Enough's enough.
A company already made him their champion.
Stop trying ec3
My kindred spirit. You touched my soul with the one.
Then he can be LA King  ...Wait
Not as much sense as having Dominik Mysterio become King - or, as they call kings in Spanish, 'Rey'.
Have him bring back his [Dummy button](https://youtu.be/rlIT99xm9M4) when he wins KOTR.
Person
And I quote “no goofy king gimmicks”.
Great name!  DBLOCK!!!  Jadakiss top 5 DOA, and that’s off one LP!
That’s what I’m thinking. You could get a great feud out of them while waiting for Kofi to recover. I’d hate to see Woods go MIA because his partner is out.
YEAH
I feel like a lot of pandemic era WWE is gonna be slept on for awhile, then folks will notice that there were genuinely good moments.
Great theme song though
Idk man, I just think we all want to see him win anything at this point haha.
W
Xavier beat Roman!
FYI there will be a separate live thread for BOTB  Edit: [Live thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/12f7qu4/live_aew_battle_of_the_belts_april_8_2023/)
Darby Allin wasn’t hit by a car.  A car was hit by Darby Allin.
RJ as mediator is perfect
Holy shit I LOVE Julia's entrance
You can see Julia Hart passing Anna Jay in real time.
 Julia rules.      The future of the division is bright with her, Skye Blue and Billie Starkz.
That row got their money's worth tonight.
Happy Friday Everybody. Hope you all had a great week. Looking forward to relaxing with two (hopefully) fun hours of wrestling this evening.  As always, I do hope you enjoy!  ![gif](giphy|eKcK4bJ9L8vBkQOWM2|downsized)
Just like the rest of HoB, Julia’s entrance rules
51% merger. I see what you did there Swerve
Does anyone else feel like Julia's looking further along than Anna at this point?
THIS MAN DOES NOT WORK HERE, TONY ELITE WHAT ARE YOU DOING ALLOWING TONY HONOR'S STRAYS SHOW UP HERE
House of Black is becoming one of the best things in wrestling.
HE LIKES THIS HAT.         But fuck that pink shoe tho.
Both these girls have tremendous presence, they just need to get better in the ring.
Malakai: We trust Julia to take care of her own business. Also she kind of brought us back to life so we’re scared of pissing her off
I don't want a Daddy Magic Mount Rushmore poster, I *need* it
Brian Cage is a much better heavy for Swerve.  Also, Cage killed poor Darby with that bump.
Damn Taya…Damn Jade
I hope House of Black is at All In. Their entrance would be awesome on a large scale.
I see the potential in Julia.  Young and gets the character work already.  Athletic background to build on.  Just needs time and confidence (you can really see it when she runs to the ropes or corner, she’s still unsure there).  Anna is getting to the point where she needs to elevate in my opinion.  Feel like we’ve been thinking “she’s got potential” for a 3 years.  But… still very young too so not saying there’s no hope by any means.
Looooove that transition to the next show and story bit thrown in as well.
"Break a leg? Who am I Dante Martin?"  Holy SHIT that was savage lol
RJ City is a sweet baby angel and needs to be protected at all costs.
Oh Julia singing along with her song is haunting.
Julie Hart's entrance is fucking awesome.
Hart has extremely high potential to become a top woman in the division.
Let us give thanks to the House for Julia Hart's first main event match.
Julia staring down Orange lends credence to Malakai being his next big challenger.
Julia 100% will be a champion one day. She's got endless potential it seems
Of course Darby is wrestling 24 hours after getting hit by a car!
If the next QTV segment doesn’t have Aaron Solo saying he was the one that hit Darby with the car then what’s the point
RJ stands for **R**eal **J**ournalism
RJ needs a segment each week. Come on Tony...you gotta give the people what they want!
Her intro is 🔥🔥🔥
Julia looking at me through the camera like its my fault Anna kicked out.
Julia Hart is absolutely going to remember that Orange Cassidy ruined her first TV win in forever
man fuck the haters, I love QTV
That Dante line just made me spit my water
Can't explain how happy I am that members of JAS are getting their own stories rather than just being in Jericho's personal feud
I feel like I've caught the end of fast 7 a dozen or so times from tuning in to watch something else, while never watching the movie
RJ on Rampage 💪💖
Ok I love Taya
That was actually good. Taya is gonna get over, I can see it.
Damn, Julia's theme song is a banger.
Looked like Julia was levitating there for a sec.
Julia got it factor!
Julia "Steve Nicks" Hart is getting so good. Hoping this match goes well.
Julia looks pretty badass with the black teeth.
Paul Walker and Vin Diesel going separate ways, as symbolized when their cars...went separate ways.
LEAVE THE MUSIC RUNNING
Ethan Page is great IDGAF what anyone says
These dudes lost the belts a few months ago and are still super over
JR calling a women's match scares me
RJ City. Dude is a treasure.
FINALLY RJ on tv!
RJ with TV time...this is NOT A DRILL!!!!
Yo this entrance is sick. House of Black goes too hard
Julia doing good work there working the camera.
Julia's in ring talent isn't there yet, but her character work sure as shit is, and she's got plenty of time to improve in the ring so I'm excited for her future
Julia is absolutely shining right now.
that character work from Julia Hart is 👌🏽   make her the international champion
Obligatory fuck Marjorie Taylor Greene
THIS DUDE JUST FUCKING HELICOPTERED DARBY. LMAOOOOO.
First time seeing Julia’s entrance. Holy crap!!!
Heel vs Heel ladies main event.  Doesn't happen often in any fed these days
I appreciate that house of black has 14 different entrance themes. Keeps us guessing
Oh come on play the song the entire match!
I THOUGHT WE WERE DOING A HOMAGE TO NEW JACK
Hook just gets this pro wrestling thing
Who takes the character-defining first loss first? Hook or Jade?
Damn, they really doing Dante like that lmao.
Solo is entertaining, I enjoy the dude.
The Daddy Magic Mount Rushmore sign is perfect.
Darby Allen got ran the fuck over skateboarding? Bruh. That sucks
If RJ City is a Professional Mediator, then I am a Professional Lawyer.
"How does it feel being a criminal" RJ is the fucking best
RJ City on TV! I'll pop for that.
They saw Parker do his Walmart 2002 Lesnar impersonation and said get this mf off TV
Anna has a habit of sounding like she's gonna cry when she tries to sound intense.
Julia Hart is fucking awesome
Dumb idea: Give Julia Hart the Codyvator
I say it every time and Ill say it again, Julia is amazing in this role
NO SHE KNOCKED OFF THE HAT AGAIN  BURN HER INTO CRISP JULIA
Spooky bitch! 😂😂
> *Make McDoubles $1 Again*  Mans just sayin' what we're all thinking.
Julia's a great example of what Dark and Elevation can do to help people gain confidence and find your character.
DAMN JULIA LETS GOOOOOO
Julia has it
LMAO IS SHE GONNA BEAT UP OC SHES REALLY GLARING AT THEM
Mad respect to Page for doing what's best for business. For someone called All Ego, his lack of it is an example for the entire locker room.
Bi panic time, RJ on TV
Ngl I'm so down for Cool Hand & Daddy Magic interacting with The Acclaimed. All 4 guys are just naturally charismatic and happy to lean into the absurd and cheesy. I'm expecting good things.
Music running during a match should be used more
I always like when somebody's theme plays a lil bit into the match
They have security just in case bit everyone around them just looks genuinely happy
Jesus QT! Too soon? lol
Hey my mom is on TV! Go Bobby!
2.0 simping for The Acclaimed even when they clearly don't give a shit  is hilarious  EDIT: And they turned. SAD
The joke is still on the JAS because they treated the Acclaimed to a big buffet at their expense.
I guess they decided that Tattoo face and Quasi-Brock wasn't working.
RIP Darby holy shit lol.
Those are much better affiliates lol.
"Professional Negotiator" RJ City loool!
“how do you feel about being a criminal” LOL
RJ CITY ON MY TELEVISION
I mean, you did get arrested for trying to kill John E. Bravo in Impact, Taya.
RJ IS ON MY TV
I know she has exactly 0% chance of winning but Billie having a televised match, for a title no less, is so great. Super happy for her
RJ every week please
Nana is the perfect lackey for a charismatic leader like Swerve. Plus, he's got monsters like Cage, Toa Liona and Kaun...
I need more RJ City on my AEW.
Give RJ the damn Graphic, Tony!
Spooky bitch >>>>>>> crazy one
I think it’s great these young ladies are getting the main event spot. Futures of the division here.
Spooky Julia is so damn cool
LETS GO SPOOKY
I like that Julia is incorporating some of the other HOB'S moves into her own moveset
I kinda like that Julia's been adopting some of Brody and Malakai's moves.
Julia Hart I think can be a huge player down the line.
Hartless is the name for her finisher? I like it.
eye daggers from Julia
Julia not an OC fan it seems.
Julia not an OC fan.
2.0 STORYLINE   THIS IS NOT A DRILL PEOPLE  STAY FOCUSED
I didn't hallucinate that shit did I? I fucking swear I heard Anna Jay say: **"I have a PHAT ASS AND A BAD ATTITUDE!"**
Damn savage Dante Martin rib
"Break a leg!"  "Who am I, Dante Martin?"  😂😂😂😭😭😭
Jade going face to face with the next *real* challenger does not bode well for homegirl challenging on BOTB does it
how many times must they show me the sad paul walker montage :(
Keep HOOK's theme playing New Jack style.
They’re still playing Hooks music?
Nights like this makes me feel like AEW could have two shows that are 2 hours long weekly
Who has better looking working punches than Hook does right now?
FTW Championship should become AEWs Equivalent of a Hardcore Championship. I think that would fit with its ECW/Taz roots plus being an unofficial title. It shouldn't be goofy like the Hardcore Title but it should have no rules matches in all defenses.
DDT? tf you watching JR
JR, buddy, c'mon
I need a daily update on daddy magics nipples
"8 minute time limit"
Please don’t be the firm
Swerve joining BC
Darby working AFTER getting hit by a car.
Darby is more likely to get injured outside of the ring than within.
Darby Allin was hit by a car, presumably while practicing a spot.
Swerve is too big of a personality for it to be Bullet Club, he needs to be the leader not a footsoldier.  I'm hoping it's some big heavies like Gates of Agony or Samoa Joe or hell, "swerve" us and go Wardlow.
the virgin Cody, wrestling after tearing his titty in the gym  vs  the chad Darby, wrestling after getting hit by a car in Manhattan
I know Billie isnt winning, but I do hope she at least gets a legit match with Jade tonight and not a squash…
Landed on his face. 🫣
Uh bro did Darby hit his face on the ramp?
Ok Cage as Swerve's muscle makes sense.
I mean Swerve paired up with Cage and Nana is definitely an upgrade over Parker and Trench
Darby catching strays in a feud he's not even in
Holy shit RJ City on TV
RJ City on TV is fucking awesome
The Prince Nana career revival keeps on rolling baby
“How do you feel about being a criminal?”
RJ GETS TV TIME!!
RJ on tv-10/10 episode
Good stuff here, more pre-tapes like this.
Actually I take back my incorrect statement, RJ was perfect as always to moderate that
We need more mergers in wrestling like the House of Wingmen or Spanish Appreciation Society
This Rampage hittin' like crack so far
Somebody tell RJ he can't just ask people how it feels being a criminal
Swerve/Darby gonna slap
Swerve/Darby? Uhh fuck yeah!
I'M GONNA CHOKE YOU OUT YOU SPOOKY BITCH
“heated words we heard moments ago”  \*words we heard moments ago*: SPOOKY BITCH
Julia's theme is fuego
Presentation goes to Julia
That was a cool entrance. Gave me goosebumps. Julia Rules.
KILL HER JULIA
Julia has been cooking on Dark and Elevation
JR's not gonna know who to call a jezebel in this match
Julia Hart is about to get over
Julia hart what anime studios think a chibi undertaker is
If JR says something creepy take a shot
"I got a flat ass and I'm just happy to be here" 😂
the songs from the BK commercials are turning my brain into room temperature mashed potatoes
If you're not on Fite you missed much discussion of Anna's ass by commentary, including her screaming FAT ASS!
GIF moment with that camera stare
Don’t look directly into Julia’s eyes, it’s a trap
who let JR commentate on another Anna Jay match is my question
Does JR only know the word Jezabel to describe a woman?
There’s potential in Julia Hart, I’m kinda indifferent on Anna rn
Growing up as the kid who was into Marilyn Manson I’m happy to see Rhea and Julia hart find their self through being goth
I love how House of Black and Best Friends can coexist in the same reality
They both have so much potential. Really need to work on their speed though.
great work Julia, nice job kid
Aaron Solo's breath freshener is over with me
QT: "Break a leg? Who am I...Dante Martin?"  Dannng. Honestly, that was pretty good.
She's obviously inexperienced but Julia has the tools to be a good wrestler in a few years. Decent strikes, got some character going, she's very committed and has a willing to really bump
I've heard that All Ego is changing gimmicks. That's right. He's changing to be a dedicated employee of Canada Post.  THIS IS STAMP PAGE.
Julia Hart has the character work down i’m curious about the wrasslin
Here live and they are filming ROH before. Matalik and cersero had a good match. Highlight so far was Shibata wrestling in a tag match, wasn't expecting him.
Aw man if I knew Fast 7 was on I would have watched that instead of Smackdown.   RIP Paul Walker
IT'S BEEN A LOOOONG DAAAYY WITHOUT YOU MY FRIEND  no better way to lead into Rampage than with some heartbreak
Nobody wants to get their ass beat to a soundtrack
Dasha looking smoking tonight.
Live rampages are always great
No surprise here, Hook is fucking over
Damn Riho left her pipe behind
Ethan, you give that back to Riho
I will never stop marveling about HOOK's hair
It's honestly nice seeing Hook gradually having to eat more offense and sell for his opponents.
Ddt jr?
I need to see Hook's slow transition into a Hardy Boy
The table's already paid for, might as well use it!
I wouldn't mind a few (short) segments like that every week. Skits, character stuff, whatever. Just a few short bits, that make it feel like AEW exists outside of arenas
Alright, the Daddy Magic Mount Rushmore made me cackle like a hyena. Well done!
I'm so happy Menard and Parker are doing something separate from the rest of the JAS.
Botchamania moment
That sign is magnificent.
Oh no. I wanted the awkward team work to go longer 😭
Hell yes. The Acclaimed are on tv a lot which means 2.0 will be on tv now. :)
Hager loves that hat
"Daddy just pounding away!" 👀
Those JASsholes….
I, for one, am SHOCKED by the actions of the Jericho Appreciation Society
Keith Lee just started a feud with Jericho so I expect him to link up with Acclaimed, which works great due to their history. In a way appropriating Lee's "ohh blask in his glory" chant went a long way to getting the Acclaimed white hot so they do owe him one.
This wouldn't have happened if the Acclaimed just scissored 2.0.
Swerve bought Darby from Mr. Stink?
RIP Bebop and Rocksteady
#justicefortrench
Wait, Darby was hit by a fucking car?!
I do like that the pillars are always watching each other wrestle now.
DAS BOOT!
I feel like I'd believe any outlandish story about Darby like he got mauled by a bear or fell off a cliff skating but shook it off.
Exactly how blind and deaf is this ref?
Darby's in a car crash every night he wrestles. You think getting hit by a car is gonna stop him?
Moriarty is so good
Great match, they both went hard af
They should’ve done this from the start lol
Jesus Darby. WTF.
Swerve was disatisfied with the size of his old posse so he went even bigger!
Cars can’t kill Darby but Brian Cage can
They just keep trying with Brian cage.
NGL I like that a lot
Cage ain’t leaving AEW confirmed
Okay, I can dig Swerve with the Embassy.
Remember when Brian Cage was TOTALLY going to WWE?
That's a better fit for Swerve than the other two jabronis.
They put RJ in charge of the Taya/Jade sit down?  Ohhhhh this is gonna be chaos
Mogul Embassy isn't a bad idea
RJ CITY
hit the move on City and have him decide what the name should be
Embassy as Swerve's henchmen will work so much better than Parker and tattoeed face guy. It's also a sign that Brian must have signed a new contract with AEW.
Cage definitely re signed
Yo...RJ City in the TV
That was a fun segment. Good job RJ.
main event julia and main event anna. i dig it :)
Anna touched Juila's hat?!? She deserves to lose.
SHE LIKES THAT HAT
“Rule 1: Don’t touch Julia Hart’s hat”  Jake Hager is somewhere backstage nodding in approval
did Anna Jay say what I thought she said?
Julia has one of the best themes rn
Julia, everything else aside, is fucking nailing the presentation
Julia's improved so much and has been KILLING IT on Dark lately. So happy she's getting this
Julia Hart this is badass
Holy shit this entrance
Presentation alone gives the edge to Julia Hart.
THE QUEEN OF THE BLACK THRONE
Julia’s theme goes hard
Thought she was actually singing for a sec. Also that’s a fantastic entrance.
Julia’s theme is perfection
Big Match Julia v Main Event Anna
My sister's gonna have a baby girl soon, I suggested she name her "Jezebel".. Yeah, she was right to be mad at me.
Scarlett could take a lesson from Julia when it comes to mouthing lyrics during an entrance because that was awesome
Julia has that deep cheerleader voice
I need to put Julia's theme into my "Wrestling themes to jam out to" playlist on YT music.
I like Anna Jay but that "Big ass, bad attitude" promo just sounded stupid.  Julia is finally finding her confidence in this character.
More experience in the ring and Bryan Danielson and these ladies are going places
THESE LADIES COOKING OUT HERE!
That moonsault was CRISP
JR wants to say something that will get him fired but is trying not to.
Oh please give me Dark Ana Jay returning to the Dark Order….
Beautiful camera work
JR walking a tightrope commenting on women wrestlers bodies
"I got a flat ass and am just happy to be here" lol!
Big ups to TK for giving these ladies this opportunity.
Crap, I forgot which Fast and Furious this was😢
Tony Khan watching the ending to Furious 7 with a tear in his eye.
![gif](giphy|9U4iHUQFj9fgs)
NICE good night for a person who loves both AEW and WWE
Someone forgot to turn off the music
Wouldn't be AEW without audio issues, at least it's a good song lol
Geez doesn't even wait for Dasha to get out of the ring.   Hey Dasha. How you doing? ❤️
Tony in gorilla: Turn the music off! Turn the music off!
Crowd is behaving remarkably well, I don't think I've seen anyone touch them
Honestly for a college arena on a Friday Night, the crowd looks remarkably composed
Egon is so damn good
I don't know how many wrestlers fight between the people in the rows. That shit is a struggle, just trying to get back to your seat. . 😂😂😂
Can everyone stop breaking the timekeepers table? That poor timekeeping lady is terrified every week
This match has a great ECW vibe in the best way
Ethan loves that chair to your own face spot
DDT IM SORRY JR
That was a fucking solid opener. Enjoyed that!
One of these days somebody will be able to put Hook through that table while the Redrum is hooked.
Why do P-P-P-P-Powerhouse and QT have a ROH Tag Title match?
One day I will see Ethan Page win a match and I will finally rejoice
I wish they did a Bumass Wardlow gimmick
QT with the zingers
Lucha Library sounds like a streaming service.
Leave it to QT to kick a man while he's down.
This is the best role QT's had since the Cody's Friend days.
So are they exorcising the pope or is this an exorcist that works for the pope
Lol Dasha
That mount rushmore makes MY nipples hard
YO LISTENNNNN
Ngl my buzzed ass  legit thought Daddy Magic was gonna try and pull off a Caster rap there.
ITS SCISSORING TIME
The Acclaimed should only tag themselves in by scissoring.
I live ot when the enhancement are a colorful bunch of randos instead of a bunch of plain trunks guys.
My heart is broken.
2.0 out here looking like the Basham Brothers with hair..
THOSE FUCKERS TRICKED US
Wow, an 8 minute time limit and they got the match done in 5. Pretty impressive
Bah gawd Billy Gunns sneaker fell off
This also happened with the Ass Boys.  The Acclaimed doesn't play well with losers.
This is my favorite version of Jake Hager.
I would have laughed so hard if Hager accidentally punched the shoe into Menard's head.
LARGE WILLIAM
hold up...  Darby got hit by a car yesterday?
I'm sorry he WHAT
I'm hoping its >!Shane Taylor Promotions!<
Oh man, Wembley is gonna be insane..
Darby secretly a technical wrestler.
I can tell I’m getting older because my thought wasn’t “oh wow his groin” but “Jesus dude you’re going to tear your hamstring”
Did Darby actually get hit by a car?  I wouldn’t put it passed him to wrestle  anyway, but dude. Darby, take better care of yourself.
Swerve joining AEW’s Bullet Club would give the faction more legitimacy.
I like that they can just say. Darby was hit by a car yesterday but is gonna wrestle anyways and all I can think is that makes sense.
Lee can really get pushed the same way Garcia and Yuta are. He's very good
My Name is Darby Allin and this is the; get hit by a car and wrestle 24 hrs later.  Welcome to Jackass.
Fuck this match has RULED
Great match
Damn, Darby/Lee was a great match
Lee Moriarty needs a push, IMO
Oh. Cage must have signed.
Cage is a much better hoss for Swerve !
GODDAMN SWERVE BROUGHT THE MAN MEAT
Holy crap!
This works better than Trench and Parker.
I guess Cage signed a new deal.
Oh hell yeah, i fuck with this
I like Swerve but I don't understand why he needs to be constantly in a faction.
I thought it would be The Embassy. They needed a charismatic leader in the ring and now they got one.
RJ!!
I'm happy that Brian reupped at least, been a fan for ages
RJ on live TV!
"How do you feel about being a criminal?"  RJ City is fantastic
Amen Taya!!!!!
Jade vs Mercedes at all in  Heard it here first
RJ was perfect for this segment
RJ City is as good of a mediator as Mark Sterling is a lawyer.
I'm only here for the Swerve and Prince Nana promos.
Wow, Cage and the embassy are much better goons than… what was before.
Oh lord, she touched her hat!!!
What did Anna just say?? lmao
Julia Hart has come so far in the last year.
Do Not Touch The Hat!
Julia 🤝 Hager when it comes to Hats
SPOOKY BITCH!
I can't say I'm dissapointed or anything that Anna has decided to remind us about her ass constantly, but more so confused by it.
They better not have Julia Hart lose her first TV match as a member of the House of Black. Then again, its the JAS.
Yo Swerve v Darby is awesome
Julia "Jake Hager" Hart: I like this hat!
All Rise for the Princess of the Black Throne
 Just listen to it, such a good theme.
A mysterious beautiful jezebel. God bless you jr
JEZEBEL
please please please don't have JR on BotB
Give every title to Julia.
That Anna Jay kick was pretty sweet
After the news of Skye Blue today, I hope Julia gets that #AllElite graphic here soon.
Glad to see these two ladies Main Eventing!
Julia with the sudden direct camera jump scare stare
Good stuff so far, both ladies have looked solid
Cheerleaders can be evil too.  There's been a few movies about it.
JULIA HAS THE MIST
I never want to hear JR say SLOTS like that again.
THE HOUSE ALWAYS WINS
Fuck I hope forbidden door gives us Los Ingobernables and LIJ together
“I have a fat ass and a bad attitude.”  First we get that tweet from Liv, and now Anna Jay saying that? Damn, this sub must be loving this!
I hope Michael Nakazawa kicks Jon Moxley's ass.
"She is a mysterious, beautiful jezebel"    Just SHUT UP, JR 🤣
JULIA FUCKING HART
Harley Cameron 👀
Oh no the Dante line 💀
I think Nyla rose would fit in with qtv. She’s so damn quick with her insults
Swerve to Bullet Club please
They're definitely grooming Hook for something major  No overexposure, steadily longer matches and feuds, wide variety of opponents
That Dante line, damn QT!  ![gif](giphy|r1HGFou3mUwMw|downsized)
ok im sold on QTV now
Yo that’s brutal QT poor Dante
Hook v Page was very good.
They've done the impossible. They've managed to make me excited for QT Marshall.
I never want the acclaimed and daddy ass to end. They're so fun every week/show
That theme sounded like Nightwish.  They’ve done such a good job with her presentation.
Hell yeah, happy to see Julia win this one. She's ready to get more regular tv matches.
It feels like so long ago that we last did this, my friends. But it was only two nights ago. I guess that’s what weed does to you.   Enjoy the cards tonight everyone ❤️
"Brian leaves the Fast & Furious franchise, which means it's time for AEW Rampage! Next on TNT!" - Tony Khan, probably
Hook: they don’t pay me by the hour, just gonna kill this man real quick
Randomly took tonight off, tune into Rampage and learn that there's also a Battle of the Belts. WIN!
Well, considering who his dad is that’s not shocking, Ex
Two hours Live  on the East Coast, JR gonna be sleepy soon
Prison rules.
They have an oyster bar in the arena!?
great vibes
So that's where the Riho pipe went
I would simply pass away if hook was that wet and that close to me. But fr what a kickass match to start this.
This should just be the new Vitamin Water ad: Ethan Page beating on Hook.
Already the best match of Hook’s career by a wide margin
I’d like to learn the origins of random household objects under the ring
Welcome to tables Hook!
Regretting not going to this live. Shibata and Hook’s coming out party would have been worth it
Matt Hardy showing Cassidy the proper way to watch TV backstage.
How the fuck did that look like a DDT?!
what was that first chair shot attempt? maybe Ego misses his old glasses
Funniest Chair Rope shot ever.
That wasn't a bad Twist of Fate
Poor JR lol
That was dope
These guys are great
You’ve got to give the people what they want
OH SHIT QTV BABY LETS GOOOO
Bryce looking up the ramp in disbelief
QT Marshall still looks like a random crossfit gym owner
Jesus Christ QT 😳
This is so dumb but I'm entertained.
![gif](giphy|YemPO3cVf6jKA3cd3c)
That like was hilarious
They should give Rampage orange, blue, orange rope colors and complete the theme.
I know the chances are low but billie winning would be cool
lol Dasha
Announcer botch
omg the Mount JAS sign
THAT SIGN LOL
MOUNT RUSHMORE MY HEART
JR wants you to know his nipples get hard when Oklahoma doesn't lose.
I hate that I actually looked at his nipples.
OH MY GOD ITS MY MOM!!!!
Why does Cool Hand Ang look like CM Punk & Chuck Taylor had a baby
I need Tired JR and Coke Out Booker on commentary someday
This crowd is hotter and more fun than the Long Island one
That’s not ennerdaining!
"Thanks for the free win boys, now here's your ass kicking."
Daddy Ass got his ass beat so bad that he lost a show LMAO
Who punches a shoe?! Honestly…
Well what do you know, Daddy Magic's nipples are indeed hard in that closeup shot
swerve looks crazy what is he wearing
Bullet Club?
Swerve whatchu up to
Man why don't they just do Keith vs Swerve. They have really cooled Swerve off he was on fire a few month ago.
what the fuck is SW3RVEX wearing on his head
Pls say Trustbusters. Lmao
Swerve as the new leader of the bullet club would be unreal!
Swerve is fuh-fuh-fuh for life
… yeah, that sounds like something that would happen to Darby.
That’s just a normal week for Darby.
Darby gets hit by a car in NYC, wrestles the next night. Not surprised.
Darby got hit by a car? Yeah that checks out
Proper creepshots of Jungle Boy lol
Swerves doin a whole lotta nothin
the mergers gotta be with the embassy, right?
Here for a Swerve Club shirt
Anna vs Julia is the main event!
Sting v Big Bill right?
Lee and Darby is a technical match I didn’t know I needed until right now
Shane Taylor Promotions would actually make a ton of sense, given the history with Keith Lee and all.
GODDAMN BILL ANNIHILATED HIM
If the car don't kill ya the boot will!
**BIG BILL BOOT**
That was the best big boot in a while
Jeez, Big Bill nailed Darby with that big boot.
Was that another car that just ran over Darby.?! Damn what a big boot.
Julia's whole arm is on fire.  Hopefully she puts that out before the match
HAHA THAT FUCKING SLAP OFF THE APRON
I like Lee
It's time to give Moriarty the Yuta/Garcia push
Darby looks like what someone would do to their action figures in the way he wrestles and falls
Getting hit by a car just gave Darby an extra power boost for this match honestly
Some nice counters here
I wanna see more of Lee
I know this is more of a fodder match for Darby but this is actually a great match
This match rules
This match is great
Feel like Darby Allin vs Kota Ibushi would be a great but terrifying match to watch.
Cage resigned
okay I can dig that
I want Swerve to use Hustlin by Rick Ross
JEEZUS
Looks like Darby's about to die another few times in the ring again.
This is so much better for Swerve
That gonna hurt more than the accident
Much better for Swerve than the two randos
RJ!
I like it, much more credible muscle for Swerve.
Part999 of get Brian Cage over
Taya going back to jail lol.
That was good.
RJ on TV and Julia in the main event. This Rampage has been made for me.
Everybody loves RJ City unless you're a cop.
Darby got some air on that F5
Im here for Julia and her hat. Lets get spooky.
Fat Ass & Bad Attitude
Julia cuts spooky promos pretty well.  Anna Jay is still bad.
SWERVE VS DARBY YESSSSS
there’s MJF, Swerve and Jay White vying for the top heel in AEW
So, hat vs ass?
This song gives me an Evanescence vibe and I love it.
Julia’s hat game > Jake Hager’s hat game
Damn, Swerve vs. Darby for Wednesday. Hope it helps boost ticket sales in Milwaukee.
Julia Heartertaker
i have no comment on this match but i must say that entrance is fucking amazing
![gif](giphy|V2AkNZZi9ygbm)
Its interesting that the JAS is kind of split into a bunch of different feuds.
She messed with the hat
I was expecting Julia to go more Within Temptation than Evanescence with the theme but it works
Give me Orange Cassidy.
Liked the ref yelling at JULIA to get the match back in the ring right after Anna knocked HER ass out of it. lol. Wrestling.
JR: Dang it, so we’re gonna have to deal with him again?
JR loved spending time with Don in 1998.
Anna Jay determined to avenge Griff 'The Great' Garrison here
Wait a sec, they’re both Nightmare Factory alums right?
This feud started because Julia Hart was with the HOB during the Trios triple threat and Anna Jay took it personally.
What happened to abadon?
Let’s go spooky lmao
That faceplant off the back looked rough.
I thought this match would be a lot worse honestly.
 Oh shit
Hey that’s a smooth transition from Rampage to BOTB.
Julia should take out Orange Cassidy, that music was not pleasing to her
How many brothers does Rush have??
I asked and received!  Buddy vs Orange!!!
"18 years old???"  Dammit, JR!
2 hook matches in a week. What have I done to deserve this blessing?
QT biggest heel of the week
I'm afraid to know what what makes Daddy Magic's nips hard. Ngl
I think swerve strickland just made fun of WWE with the merger talk
Bring back Trench you cowards
These two are both very slow moving but not bad whatsoever. Good match.
we get it JR, she's young
Julia has really improved in the ring in the short time she's been wrestling.
Great character work from Julia.
Ya'll mad when women's wrestling doesn't get any time on tv and doesn't main event and when it does you shit on it. This match ain't bad it's just average and they're both relatively inexperienced, just let them wrestle.
Lmao  " here for QTV" sign
"Break a leg? what am I Dante Martin?" is a crazy line lol
Damn, that Dante burn was brutal lol.
Give us Scissor Me Daddy Magic
Anna and Julia main eventing a Rampage? I'm kinda surprised about that one
yesss goth poison FTW
That blind moonsault was cool.
Julia's growth is great to see.  Her work with the HOB has elevated her so much
This segment just screams Brazzers lmao
Family
RIP Paul
WHY AM I CRYING AT THE END OF FAST 7? THIS IS NOT THE ENERGY I WANT BEFORE RAMPAGE. BUT ALSO I WANT TO SEE MJF vs DARBY vs JUNGLE BOY vs SAMMY IN A STREET RACE
got a little New Jack there
Page getting no entrance again ☹️
Musical accompaniment tonight
Bro chill lmaooo
That fan looks like Ripley's older sister lol
This match is up close and personal in the crowd.
Swerve making the announcements tonight
First PiP for HOOK?
How did Ethan get that from Riho?
I didn't understand why they were doing this Hook/Ethan rematch but this is a shot in the arm for Hook. His shine has been fading but he looks great here tonight and is over like hell.
Fun match!
This is a fun, well behaved crowd tonight!
Hook and Ethan have great chemistry I love it
smooth powerslam
Rampage just needs to be 2 hours and live weekly
This Hook and Ethan Page match has been a lot of fun.
Ethan protecting the shit outta Hook's head on that table slam. ❤
Why is Zay watching the screen like that
Give me that Tazz plex through the table  I wish Tazz was calling this one
Fun match
A DDT, wow. Wow.
Ethan Page didn't stand a chance.
Chekovs table
He stopped, collaborated and listened.
Hook: the table was just cause fuck you
HELL YEA THE CROWDPLEASER
Lol I was gonna say I respect them setting up the table and not using it but that works too
Rampage is perfect for QTV tbh
Wardlow didn't bother locking his credit card
Damnnnn
Jesus.
Oh damn Dante !
My Mom broke her leg like that once. Even worse looking in person.
Sports enertayners
This could be the most entertaining 4 man tag team in history.
JR is here for The Acclaimed and The Acclaimed only
the way daddy magic says hard kills me
Dasha's mic going into business for itself.  Blame Vince!
I’m new to AEW. Watched this weeks dynamite and now rampage. Just wondering is it normal for a lot of talent to not get a full entrance?
So who do y'all think is gonna win
Does Hager ever do anything?
Bobby!
But I wanted to see a scissoring four way
WHAT THE FUCK
Awww... There goes the most entertaining 4 man tag team in AEW...
I bet Daddy Ass didn’t like Jake’s hat
Hager didn't like Daddy Asses Hat.
Hager just spiking the shoe
Billys shoe flew off lmaooo
Absolutely sensational look from 5 Star Jake Hager
Is Swerve having a Draft as well?
Oh no…who would have ever seen that betrayal coming…
I love JR, always have, always will, but he sounds tired tonight.
Butcher and blade?
Need Swerve in Bullet Club
I swear if the ____ Family Office has a new owner AGAIN...
Swerve with Andrade? hmm?
wait julia and anna main eventing? bold but i dig it
Hyped for the reveal of SwervePentico
Tony Khan could learn from Swerve that there has to be a tease to big announcements.
shane taylor promotions
It's Large William!
You can never forget Big Bill. What a name
You know I feel a little bad for the firm. They were positioned to play a big part in a cm punk mjf fued and you know what happened
That's such a Darby thing to happen
Darby is insane and his theme song is goated
I'm guessing struck by a car means he technically hit it but not super hard or anything?
Jesus christ this kid
Swerve + Bullet CLub?
I’m glad Darby doesn’t come out looking like his makeup got smudged off in a match already anymore
Jungle Boy watching TV for the first time in his life
Darby Allin, Balls Mahoney, Dalton Castle...  All accomplished ametuer wrestlers.
Have a feeling it’s Nduka and I hope people don’t shit on it. Haven’t seen much of him but it’s an upgrade
Rick Knox getting distracted. In other news grass is green.
To paraphrase ZSJ, Darby and Lee are about to read Shakespeare to dogs.
I'd like to see Shane Taylor join Swerve.
Universal Orlando - it's more than magic, it's where AEW films Dark and ROH
That was a bitch slap!
KNOX USE YOUR EYES
Nice to see the PAC bump on shot gun dropkicks becoming more common
Hey guys I think Darby might have been hit by a car yesterday
JESUS DARBY
Darby did a really cool thing to escape there & the camera cut away smh
So yeah I went to the restroom and...  I'm sorry, *Darby got hit by a car yesterday?* Did I hear that correctly?  That's not a work, it really happened?
Darby 9/11-ing Big Bill!
HELL YEAHHHHH
Great Match. TK gotta get Lee on TV more often.
They need to push Lee on the same level as Garcia and Yuta, he’s so good!
Strong finish. Some pretty sweet counters in that match as well.
Their needs to be a random 5th pillar like the 5th Beatle
Swerve looking kinda ninja
MOGUL EMBASSY
My poor Trench
Bah Gawd Brian Cage murdered Darby
So Cage reupped?
FUCK YEAH WHY NOT
Darby’s head bounced there, hope he’s ok
In kayfabe, ya *of course* you get Brian Cage to be your new heavy.
So what happened to Tattooed Face Jones and Baby Brock?
Brian Cage is due a push... again..
RJ!
HA! I just said a few minutes ago that Gates of Agony would be perfect.  This is siiiiiiiick, I love it.
#YES RJ
I like Swerve, but Mogul Affiliates is a terrible name. I hope it just goes away.
Only Jerry McDevitt has the power to decide who owns what!
I like this new camera they’re using for promos lately.
Damn, really wanted Swerve in BC
All I know about Billie Starks is that Denise Salsado interviewed her at some point and clips of it plays constantly during commercial breaks on the Wrestling Observe Live Twitch stream. Haven't seen her work yet. She's apparently very young. Like 18 or 19.
Aew re signing/signing guys that were wwe bound according to the dirt sheets
Cage needs to have more of his LU persona going forward,that's how I took a liking to him.
i cannot watch another hour of wrestling i am just a sleepy lad 🫡
She likes that hat!
Lets go Julia!
Looks like Dynamite's audio problems are creeping over to Rampage lol
I miss the interviews with Mark! Bring it back!
JAKE HAGER gimmick infringement Julia
Anna tries so hard to get these shitty catch phrases over... just be natural.
Julia rules
I’m looking forward to dynamite already
Swerve vs Darby 👀
Zat-Anna J.A.S.
Anna needs a new theme, she shouldn’t be using the Dark Order theme’d one anymore
Yo Swerve vs Darby LFG
Jake Hager going to stamp on Hart's hat to show he runs the headwear game around here
Is this leading to a JAS HOB feud?
Mamas about to handle business.
i mean she was bumped hard during that street fight
That damn jezebel!!
Julia’s voice doesn’t match her size
Smooth Moonsault
Really hope Julia goes over. Have way more faith in her, which isn’t what I would have expected. I know she was hurt but Anna stagnated long before that
Julia never got an all elite gfx right?
you can heard in his voice, JR getting sleepy, he's about to ask "how much does this girl weigh?"
That was dope
I think they're making weekend plans in there with all the whispering
STORYLINE PROGRESSION!  And some weird audio.
Awesome main event, happy for them.
Why is Dralistico's entrance music so bad?
I like that they made the effort of changing the aprons
Has OC wrestled in Japan yet? Wondering whether he's made use of the CHAOS affiliation, would make sense considering he's the International Champion
This feels like the most classic Orange Cassidy match in a while
I like that both hours are wrestling heavy shows compared to Dynamite that had a bunch of promos.
Wait so is she still in high school?
Serious Cutler????  ....I..... I don't know what to do with this change, lol
What does she do for a living... Good work JR
Hobbs looking like a beast
I do not get what Anna is going for with her character at all.
Lucha library? Leva style?
Lucha Library.   When an older Mil Mascaras shushes you.
Dawg the dante shot lmaoooo
That QTV segment wasn't doing so good until they broke out the Dante Martin line
She looks smart.
"Break a leg? Who am I, Dante Martin?"     That was actually kinda funny.
I was gonna ask "why is this still a thing?" and then he dropped the Dante Martin line.. I understand now. lol.
Dante catching stray's and he not even here lmao
Hook continues to get better and better. Dude has a crazy high ceiling if they don't push him too fast and keep letting his skills grow naturally
CODY LOSES LOL
it would be cool if the car that hit Darby just coincidentally happened to be driven by Rikishi
RJ CITY ON NATIONAL TELEVISION  THIS IS NOT A DRILL LET'S GO
Julia popped me with the hat rule.
Flat ass Jones ever here Rofl
Were the crowd chanting “lets go or lets get spooky”? If so I love that
she's like a goth Brittany Spears
I just can't take Anna Jay serious. Movements aren't fluid at all. Her promos are so wooden. You can tell she's not comfortable out there for whatever reason. Some of these people in AEW really need to get a lot more seasoning on Dark or whatever.
Somebody missed the off button on Hooks theme
That Taz vs Sabu match is a banger if you haven't seen it
That might be among Hook's best matches in AEW if not the best so far
QTV SHOULD BE FOR 2HRS
‘You gotta keep the tan up, it's not a skin color, it's a lifestyle’ - QT Marshall, probably.
I like how protected Redrum is right now.
I feel like qtv could be something but I’m not sure if that something needs will Hobbs involved
Wow, Dante Martin is getting burned
Man I really couldn't see QT getting over again anytime soon and thought pairing him with Hobbs was a terrible idea. But I'm enjoying the QTV segments. Not sure how Hobbs fits in though
Anna Jay desperately needs an acting coach
Trained in a dungeon, but not the one you're thinking of
Jay A.ass
Julia Hart with the best standing moonsault in the division.
julia is based
I respect the character work by Anna Jay, its entertaining.
LETS GOOOOOO JULIA FUCK YES
Two prettiest women in AEW closing the night.
Mist works better for Julia than Malakai.
you think we will se Switchblade tonight at all?
FOUR PAUL
OC would have loved the lead-in
FOG
Seeing Shida in the intro makes me miss Shida..
HOOK
YESSSSSIR
Straight to HOOKING
Hook vs. Jade. Record vs. Record. Book It.
WHERE MY HOOKERS AT
Hookers stand up!
#HOOK
Feel like live Rampage always feels like a mini-Dynamite.
Security is stressed lol
how have there already been 6 battle of the belts
Great way to start a show lol.
Get that guy sitting behind HOOK to sit on Ethan.
Finally TSN has the international feed again.
If AEW ever does a ladies section like how Japanese promotions do, they better make sure Hook takes a brawl there.
OH SHIT
Live Rampages work better because when it is taped the crowd is exhausted by the time they get to the Rampage part. There is an hour of dark and then 2 hours of Dynamite. And then Rampage comes after we've seen the Dynamite main event . On Wednesday we had 2 hours of ROH after Dynamite. It was a lot.
Super fun SmackDown tonight straight into another two hours of live wrasslin  Gnarliest time to be a fan of our great sport!
Damn that hoist up into the powerslam (and the powerslam itself) good!
I like how almost all this match has been outside the ring
This match is slappin. Hook is him
Zay watching the TV like a sports entertainer
Hook needed something like this!
What a damn pretty powerslam. Just hit the right spot.
JR is so bad holy shit
So is Matt gonna  managing hook now
Twist of fate ddt huh? damn JR
Imagine if Stokely pops back up & screws Hoo—   Nvm. Red Rum.
Ethan Page is so underrated.
Table?
DO IT HOOK
Page is lucky it wasn't a Japanese table.
Hook said lets table this for now.
Huge sale lol
What is up with the crowd mics tonight? They're usually bad but the crowd noise sounds so muted so far.
Pops the hardcores
QTV BEST TV NA
that red bull commercial was spicy
Damn, American Dad is still goin?
Sign of the night lmao
This should be very ennerdaining
Love these guys.   And these guys too.
In what world?
I should get that clothing ensemble Hager has..
That's the most jobber sounding four man team ever
LSG!  Another ROH guy who lost his job and was never hired. Though Coast to Coast were pretty much off and on in ROH before the end.
More like the cannon fodder
Bobby Orlando, hope he brought Bobby Jr
JR MADE A FUNNY!
I enjoy a good non title tag team feud
Those dastardly JAS!
Shit, what I miss. Why The Acclaimed laid out? 😢
Jake Hager Loves hats but hates shoes
Lol...Jake punching the shoe
Those damn sports entertainers lol.
They could have kept this little group going for a few more weeks
Didn't LSG have a decent ROH run a few years back?
NJ NDUKA???
I can’t get enough Swerve
Dude in the bandana looks like Alan Shelby, the guy you book when you can't afford Alex Shelley.
Bring Swerve to Dynamite dammit
lol JR is so grumpy
God I love Swerve Strickland. Can he and Jay White have an evil heel off please??
What the hell did Swerve have on his head?
Wow… Swerve owns Endeavor
Kinda sad to get ghosted by a Trench.
Swerve merged with Hit Row
Swerve is about to join QTV?
WTF Darby
Never forget a name like Big Bill huh
Swerve would look pretty fucking great in the Bullet Club Black & Gold.
Swerve said he's getting 51% he ain't joining bullet club. My guess is he's taking over the embassy
Really? Car?
what the fuck Darby
Darby what the fuck
Darby got run over by a car? Why wasn’t this in the news?
Wait did that legit happen?   I mean I cant say I’m surprised..
Watch Darby wrestle & chill.
Swerve’s new goons are the embassy btw
I thought Bill was having a smoke at ringside for a sec.
Looks a nice greenroom TBF
That balaclava was scary, but not in the right way. At first, I thought he did a combover with his goattee.
Oh I bet that hurt…
Wait, when did Darby get hit by a car?
Damn these ads lmao
I think Knox gave himself whiplash trying not to see Bill hitting Darby. I know Wrestling is pre-planned but come on!
Knox looks like such a dope of a referee here
Oh no Christ Darby....
Love JR's old school references
One day JR is gonna be like "This promo reminds me of listening to the Colgate Comedy Hour."
Is it obvious that we’re getting a fatal 4-way main event at DON?
Lee with the gorgeous euro clutch
Fuck Darby is fun.
This pillars storyline is elevating everyone. I love it
Ladies ME? Nice! Im down
Awesome! Darby match was worth this rampage
I was joking about him buying Darby from Sting interesting
Oh Ho Ho Ho
Swerve & the Embassy?
Someone looming in the back over there.
FUCK
Darby
DA MACHINE
Brian Cage's roid belly man
Swerve/Darby feud yesssss let's go
what will their new name be?
Oh... Well.. can't say I saw that coming, I guess.
Some say Cage is too mobile for his size.
I thought Cage was done after ROH PPV
YESSSS RJ
I guess Cage resigned
that was fun
If I wrestled I’d use the BK song as my entrance
Anna loses so Tay comes and confronts Julia is my guess for the match
Been a fun night so far. Hopefully Battle of the Belts continues that trend
I remember the last BOTB when Pac had to defend the Trios championship on Rampage and then the All-Atlantic championship immediately after on BOTB.
Royal Crackers is basically Mr. Pickles/Mama Named Me Sheriff reskinned.
LETS GO JULIA HART
HOW MUCH IS MARK HENRY BEING PAID
So did Brian Cage re-sign?
Wait, what Anna Jay just say...?¿
Mark Henry is the best part of any Rampage. He's that good.
This match could be very bad, but im glad they get to main.
Darby vs Swerve YES please
As strange as it seems, Anna is probably the woman with more main events
The phenom from Death Valley
I love it.
I wanna watch Rampage, JR really doesn't want me to
Has Julia gotten an All Elite graphic?
oohhhh julia did the lift opponents chin with your foot thing
Nice to see she's keeping the gymnast elbow.
10000IQ move by Julia right there
Love it!
Lol a cradle
It's like these two are wrestling two completely different matches
Man I keep waiting for danhausen to do the tequila bit.
I really like OC's body of work defending this title, whatever the hell it's name is nowadays. As much as I love Pac, putting the belt on OC and giving him Ramages has made the belt more featured and made Rampages better.
This match has been more competitive than I anticipated.
Billie getting a lot of offense in. LETSGO
Think they definitely see Billie as a blue chipper with them giving her such a competitive match on her TV debut.  She's pretty damn great for her age.
Cutler is my hero
Dynamite is quietly shaping up to have a hell of a card to it:  \-Cassidy vs Matthews  \-Lee vs Jericho  \-Swerve vs Allin  \-BCC vs Cutler/Nakazawa (which should be just straight up hilarious fun mixed with BCC violence)  &#x200B;  Gonna be a killer show
God, QT is such a dick. LMAOOOOO.
Take that Dante
QT just KILLED ME with that
Kinda feels like we're getting Sammy vlog QT, and I'm definitely here for it.
Why does AEW constantly have bad arena audio on their broadcasts
What is Swerve wearing?
Broke: purple footwear   Woke: purple headwear
Swerve with LFI seems most likely to me.
Julia Hart hopefully wins
Anna should definitely be a face
See you on the other thread folks
Julia's best match by far.
Okay sweet. Now let’s transition Anna to being a manager until she gets some experience on the indies. Homegirl is flat out terrible
Guessing "the youngest rising star" will not dethrone Jade on Battle of the Belts. lol. Just a hunch.
That was better than I thought it would be, but still really shouldn't have main evented a major TV program at this point.
I was hoping they would let the music go a bit during the match like New Jack
They're really taking this "falls count anywhere" thing seriously.
I love it when they fight into the stands.
Still not into this QTV stuff
Ooooooh my, QT
Feels like a TMZ parody lol
hook is the f'ing man, hard to imagine that belt ever getting moved off of him... the dude is killing it! he took meme love and turned it into real heat. congrats to him!!! and god damn every time he gets a pop i imagine what taz must be feeling. that's the pinnacle of being the father of a son, i think
I like Hook but I also think All Ego is too good to just be used to get him over. I hope the point of the Hardy/Page story is that Matt gets wrecked by Ethan.
this dude oversells
That's an ugly balaclava.
So they dropped Brock Boudreaux and the scary tattoo guy?
I'm enjoying this more than Dynamite, there's a different setup to this I like too.
"I'll choke you out!!" Anna Jay is best Anna Jay
Though still not terrific, Anna is much more convincing as a heel.
You can hear a pin drop in portions of this match.
Ok while I am only whatever about the match, I think running to the ropes and falling out is a good way to get out of a chokehold.
Build Julia up and let her beat Jade! DO IT!
LFG Julia!!!!
Seriously though I want that Daddy Magic Mount Rushmore as my phone lockscreen.
So that wasn't just a random evil look Julia gave OC.
What’s her name?
All I can think of when I see the commercials for the pope's exorcist is about how real exorcism is just like, an excuse to hurt kids. "Based on real files", yeahhh
JR stfu about height and weight challenge (IMPOSSIBLE)
More swerve
Lol, they really pushing this movie
Did JR just drop an “oh god damn”?
I feel like I could take that ass to the face move
Anna really does stink. I think she’s gotten worse since debuting. Badly needs to be doing indy shows to improve
Can't wait for Nigel to take over for J.R.
Didn’t this shitty match already happen
Are we getting Hook Jack?  New Hook?  Nevermind!
Sabu is all elite when?
Hook. Lol. Anime character
HOOK BEATING HIS ASS
Alfred Kookiebara's favorite skit.
BOO QTV
Who’s this rando next to Solo?? Give us RJ!!
Who the hell decided to let RJ moderate this?
Don't hurt Julia please.
I forget, was WCW still a thing after Julia was born?
There can only one hot blonde in the midcard. Whoever wins absorbs the other.
Having someone being associated with JAS is a shortcut to making me not care. I also didn't really care about the Inner Circle either
Julia with the W! Really good showing from both her and Anna!
JULIA WINS
Excalibur, stfu. We get it. Dude got swiped by a car. Every goddamn 5 seconds? Jesus.
"aw, QTV" we all collectively groan
I just can't get behind people singing their own intro while walking out
Super green.
I think QTV is actually a cool idea but it’s just so poorly executed
Who is this interviewer who looked like Chris Hayes from MSNBC?
oh, this is going to suck
funny how people hate rousey for being a shitty wrestler but cant handle a word about Jade being the same if not worse of a wrestler?   sorry saying "bitch" and "shit" isn't gonna make it for the in ring matches
They're just not gonna give up on this QTV thing are they.
Hook vs Goldberg. Give the people what they want!
Thought FTW Rules was just 1v1 Anarchy in the Arena for a sec.
Hook :)
Max getting cancelled again.
What’s the point of them going up against jobbers
Feel like this happened alot quicker then expected, but thats just me. 🤷🏼‍♀️  I was expecting it though at some point
Bill Killing that lollipop
Not Shane Taylor but an equally painful option.
I'm not really feeling Swerve in The Embassy but I guess we'll see how it shakes out
This is some TNA Dixie Carter shit
That was a lot, felt like things popped off before it even got started. Sometimes AEW's pace is a detriment.
**BOO!**
That kick hurt the air a lot
The fuck even was that
You know what? This could be a good rivalry as they progress
The ref tryna figure out why Anna's face is covered in black lol
Kinky.
QT is still a low rent bottom-carder and always will be. He shouldn't be on TV.   If he's that great of a trainer, just let him train people and give him the Warrior award at the AEW HOF ceremony 10 years from now.
anyone having sound issues? this has been happening for months for me watching AEW
he think he Sheamus 💀💀💀
please clothesline her Orange
They are literally wrestling at 0.75 speed
worst moonsault ever
[removed]
this Anna ja vs Julia is the type of match you would see getting shit on Smackdown or Raw
Who is the chick with the terrible boob job?
Tony Khan literally said "sports entertainment" at AEW   so whats the point of JAS and BCC?
Worst aew match to date
Sorry but I just can’t suspend disbelief enough for these size differences.
[removed]
these lawyer Jade cargill feuds are some of the cringiest stuff in wrestling and she is horrible in ring too so they can't justify giving her that long of reign or even being hired in the first place.

![gif](giphy|2GjgvS5vA6y08)
YEAH YEAH YEAH
THIS IS RAMPAGE BABY
JR with a live mic.
Rampage is Live tonight.
oooo hook opening
thank you paul (Paul Heyman slipped on a banana peel and died)
Live as Live can be baby! This is Rampage!!
He has been sent🪝
HOOK has been SENT
Just realized I need to set my DVR to record BOTB since each one is a separate instance on my DVR and isn't one series.
We're on the Hook folks!
RoH would be better off shot before Rampage than after Dynamite.
Hook is the wrestling version of Sora from Kingdom Hearts
Yo yo yo here we go.
Ethan gonna die….
Cody loses LOL
show the full replay
That looked awesome.
JEEEESUS
"IT'S UNCENSORED" --The Brain
REDRUM
B-but the table
Table!!!!!!
HOOKplex
Ethan Page has been taking a lot of Ls recently
Good stuff
Holy shit. I just found Waldo.
Awesome lol
Lol
Listen!
So I looked up Harley Cameron.. for totally normal not weird reasons....and I stumbled onto a music video she did with Adam Cole and his twitch dudes. Adam Cole and Claudio rap...
YO
 Where is Bobby Jr??
Can't say I swear this coming
Hello Swerve!
Oh wow, Anna vs. Julia is going to be the main event?
This match if given time should be great Moriarty is so underrated imo
Darby got run over?
LFI?
If Swerve merged with LFI or Trustbusters I'm gonna die laughing, and then turn the TV off.
Thank god they got Swerve away from the stink of his former dudes.
This gonna be good
AEW has a too much talent problem. They only so many hours of programming but so much talent that should get more screen time
Darby's insane.
I'm predicting it's Bullet Club
Shane Taylor Promotions or The Embassy maybe?
Teflon Darby
I always wondered what the singlet Moriarty has looks like when the straps are up.
Swerve def joined rush team
Swerve also thought it was a DDT
OUCH
What move did Lee just have Darby in? Looked like an accordion rack variation.
Hey Topo Chico thats what Im drinking right now lol!
Has The Firm replaced Jeff Jarrett's Scooby Doo Villain Gang as the starter pack heel villain stable now?   Of course Jarrett's Gang replaced The Factory in that role.
omfg
Did swerve say we’d find out who he was merging with “at the end of the night”?  if so, does that mean rampage or BotB?
Tremendous german.
Did JR just reference the ski wipeout from the opening of Wide World of Sports?
Do you believe that heading into a title shot wrestlers need to stay on winning streaks?
On a crappier TV it looks like Darby is wearing black skinny jeans
Darby's favorite Dire Straits song is Skateaway.
Really surprised that Anna vs Julia is main eventing tonight
Darby is a great wrestler in between the crazy spots  I loved this match  Moriarty is almost ready for much bigger things
WOMEN MAIN EVENTING YESSSSS
Great stuff! Lees so damn good man.
I'm pretty sure Big Bill is worth 3 Darby's.  Lol.
Lee should be the future ace of the Firm (no offense Egon)
Oh shit
Embassy?
  LETS GOOO
Embassy Affiliates!
well, it's no corporate ministry
Swerve bought the Embassy?
Swerve's theme sounds like a chicken got stuck in the recording studio.
Has Taya been back on Dynamite since her debut?
Hi jade
I love Jade
RJ!
Fuck yeah! The Post Office!!
That cartoon looks straight out of Newgrounds
THIS ANNA AND JULIA MATCH ABOUT TO FUCK
Set this to “My Way”
So is Darby going to face Brian Cage on Dynamite?
my goats frfr
Swerve and Darby? HELL YES
QT marshal in main event and people wonder why rampage isnt sold out?
Swerve vs. Darby will be like Sammy vs. Takeshita. I know who needs to win, but I don't like the other guy being designated to lose.
OH HELL YES
I'm totally blanking on how this came about, all I recall is Anna throwing spooky Julia into the post during a match. Was it the trios three way?
Anna Jay has someone who can interfere and Julia doesn't. I expect that will decide the match.
Not bad at all so far
JR SHOOTS on the booking of the AEW women's division!!!
lol get misted
Julia via Blackwoods
I just noticed Anna Jay has that tape thing on her shoulder. Does that stuff actually help?
Can't believe she made the rookie error of not wearing goggles here
I like Billie, but if this match goes 5 minutes, I'll be shocked.
They must like Billie a lot.
I mean, Anna has kinda been effectively standing still for 3 years.
Willow is right there to
I see you in these threads, all of the time, spreading positivity.   Thank you, sincerely.
They move merch pretty good too
That's what I was expecting for a moment lol.
It’s gonna be jade.
always pops me when he sprays the breath freshener in the other dude's mouth lol
I mean, Anna Jay was not wrong, but she's our spooky bitch.
Spring break
This is what happens when you sign a contract without reading it and having the said contract prepared by someone who has been obviously working for months to take you down.  What I am saying is - Hire Mark Sterling before you make serious career decisions.
Things I never thought I would support
Yeah that line isn’t it, but her calling Julia “Spooky Bitch” got me 😂
Serve LEADING a faction is a good idea.  Paint face Jones and Trent weren't it - glad they fixed that
He's in Jezebel mode rn
It would be great if it was just one brother with like three different serious gimmicks.
Julia Hart was very good IMO
my feed actually showed his entrance before the Rampage intro LOL
Your mom took a canadian destroyer through two tables off a ladder and broke her leg? That's rad. Your mom rules.
Yeah, he likes his hat. That's full time work.
Things to know:  1) She's literally still in high school. She posted prom photos holding 4 belts.  2) She's approaching wrestling the way some kids do club soccer or whatever. She's wrestled like 350 matches since starting at like 14. She might actually have more experience than Jade at this point.  3) People love her, she's adorable, and she's gotten remarkably good at selling shots. She had some great spots during the GCW collective shows last weekend.
Probably old ROH music. He'll get a Rukus tune if he sticks around long term.
Definitely not with this gimmick and not since joining AEW. I think they'd love him though. Doing an International Title defense in NJPW would be great.
Arrogant hot girl? I really do not understand. Spooky binch, OTOH, is something I immediately get, especially with that ayahuasca girl hat.
You can tell she's smart because she wears glasses!
He did it for Maxwell
SHUT YOUR MOUTH YOU THONG WEARING FATTY
Butt I digress
Lol they don’t want a fan to jump in accidentally
JAS used betrayal. It was super effective.
Apparently when he was skateboarding yesterday. News to me as well. I'm just glad Darby is okay.
He was done because he wanted to go to WWE. WWE has a hiring freeze.
I was impressed. She's from my hometown & she got a write up on the local news recently. I've never seen her before, but she's got a future for sure.
Furry hoodie?
Fleece baclava
Painted Man Jones
I believe they both are injured or atleast one is
Hopefully, just didn’t fit/work
You just saw it  It's injury related I'm pretty sure trench got injured or Parker or both did so they pivoting
Harley Cameron
Hope he gets the upset win tonight tbh. Give that man a push.
I wouldn't say he's a jobber at all. He was off tv for awhile as happens sometimes in AEW but he was in a number of predominant feuds and he's a solid midcard heel.
I vote for the Bunny in that case.
Tay Conti must be feeling pretty nervous right now
The car is the hardest part of the ring
Psst, did you know Darby got hit by a car
Speak for yourself! I’m throughly sports entertained by them.
Yeah. It's just a weird look. She has a great entrence but she needs to just sorta Undertaker her way out there.
You mean more amazing.
careful buddy they will downvote you to hell
I know I’m in the minority (on this sub at least), but I like QTV. I think it’s funny 🤷🏻‍♂️
RJ City, he hosts Hey EW on YouTube and did the last PPV pre show with Renee  He's a treat, I highly recommend watching that YouTube show. Funniest wrestling content anywhere.
You’re missing the part where Jade is actually likable
Exceot Rousey has no presentation or mic skills.  When Jade walks out on the ramp she looks like a total badass. She looks like a superstar.
No one "can't handle" it   She's vastly improved from where she started no one is saying she's perfect but she continues to improve and she's improved at speaking compared to her beginnings as well  She's a star, green but a star.
Jade is good. I know she's had a really long title reign without truly being challenged. But she's a star in her presentation
And you’re still watching for some reason.
Lol not even close
Booo! Lol I like him
Bad troll
Whoa whoa whoa, I think you forgot a /s
You are hilariously salty. Just don’t watch, man
me
Bro go troll somewhere else lol jesus christ
HOOK is nothing but muscle, he'd fk up anyone
hey bud, you seemed to be going through some stuff in this thread.  like, you seem pretty miserable. I get it, we've all been there, but it really doesn't seem like the wrestling is the reason why
????? What lol
live tonight
Yes... we've all looked her up for.... not weird reasons....
They're rotating
It's pissing QTV isn't it
Lmaooo
Wow just learned my TV is crappy lol
There IS Battle of the Belts after this, so it's not really a main event
Keith is going to get ambush next Wednesday
He's not main eventing Rampage?  And Lucha Bros/Hobbs is decent for BOTB
It's Match 2 for Battle of the Belts
During the Brody vs Jake Hager match
It’s not medically conclusive, but a lot of athletes seem to think it works.
I've had it after multiple knee surgeries while in physical therapy. From my experience, no. No it does not
I think it helps in wrestling because wrestling is a visual medium.  So, now we know Anna Jay has a shoulder injury and it can be used as a story in the match.  They didn't really but they could have
Julia has improved in all areas. She has taken this character and is running wild with it.
Black fur making him look neckbeard-y
ok, I'll admit, that wasnt as bad as the first few runs of it
Absolutely. It would be perfect
She’s a heel she’s not supposed to be likable
?
He’s trying so hard though. Lolol
The idea that the son of the dude who was throwing around bam bam bigelow couldn’t handle Ethan Page is kind of humorous
I dont like current wrestling
Dude is hate watching,  he's commented a few times ragging on a lot of stuff
The match sucks, pal
JR said main event
watching media you don't like for the purpose of being negative about it in a public forum is definitely something someone happy with their life does.  hope u find peace
yes it's that deep, pal

Jey's character work, from facial expressions and body language to promos and emotion when he's wrestling is just at another level to everyone else right now.   He's fantastic.   Paul being the literal devil on the shoulder of Solo was a great touch. Jey knows what's up, it's Jimmy who he's worried about understandably. He doesn't want to leave his brother behind and unfortunately Roman already separated the two tonight.   Jimmy watching at home... If Roman doesn't like what he sees in the main event... Jimmy will have to see his brother be taken out.   Mfs.
Which parts of a wrestling TV show do the wrestlers actually watch?  Because in this promo, Heyman said Jimmy is watching at home followed immediately by essentially telling Solo to kill Jey if he loses.  I'm assuming Jimmy saw that and presumably would tell Jey?
https://preview.redd.it/9b6l1rdjplsa1.jpeg?width=796&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9a7790e889c58d12f010556c38d104211ee92680
Solo was really starting a hole through Jey. 👀
Once this story is all said and done, I feel we’ll look back at Paul Heyman’s role and think “Wow! He was really good during this time.” Heyman is the GOAT
The Bloodline is doing just fine right guys
One thing that bugs me in the Bloodline stuff, they act like Solo isn’t the Usos brother.  “Your brother is not here.”  Well, yea… he’s standing right there, one of them is.
I loved the segment after this where Sami still has not given up on Jey. I hope they reunite them in the end.
Jey is gonna be the next world champ fo sho
Solo staring daggers at his own brother. Mania didnt end how I wanted, but I still think The Bloodline (Roman/Solo) vs the Usos should be the feud after Cody wins. Then we go to Roman/Jey III.
Paul reminds me of babidi from DBZ
I wonder if there’s a greater story no one’s really talking about with Paul Heyman   In tribal court of Sami he was the devil on Roman shoulder, and like you said he was the same here with solo. Like he self destructing the bloodline himself.   Would be interesting but I don’t see why this would be the case.
No, because if you work there, you have to turn off your phone when you watch the show at home. It's in the contracts.
Lmao
See that's the part that's unrealistic to me  Jey as a much older brother would have told solo to sit his ass down for that look
I can't remember the last time Heyman ever did bad work. Sometimes he was given crap to deal with (Axel, Lesnar shill with Cesaro) but he still always did the most he could with the situation.
We are so used to it, we forget how incredible he is. Agreed with your statement. It won’t take long to look back and go….wow, Heyman was one of the best heel managers ever.
Oh god, Roman's gonna kill him isn't he?
That would be a twist definitely but I don't see that being the case at all honestly. Especially after the whole will he won't he during the Brock/Roman feud in 2021/22.  He said here that Roman ordered Jimmy to be home, and definitely thus is the one behind what Paul said to Solo.   Paul maybe brought the idea up to Roman in ostracizing Jey, but Roman definitely calls the shots.  Paul is the Wiseman, and a damn evil one. I don't think he has an ulterior motive away from Roman.
Yep, they make you put it in a bag like at exclusive concerts.
That shit would be hilarious if Roman just beats the fuck out if Paul.
I think you have it. As an Advocate of course he was scared of Lesnar and would do whatever he asked to keep him happy BUT he wasn't ever concerned about Brock. You can survive an ass kicking. As the Wiseman, Paul is in pure react mode, as he doesn't truly know what will set Roman off and how far Roman would go.
My Tribal Chief is gonna turn the Wiseman into candy, ahyessir! ☝️

Gunther/Drew/Sheamus is on the shortlist of the best IC title matches of all-time. He's had one of the longest single reigns ever, and THE longest in decades.  He's done as much to elevate the title in prestige and importance as anyone, save for maybe Bret in 91-92 and those Kliq boys in 93-95; I don't see a strong argument for anyone being a greater IC champion than him outside of that 91-95 golden era of the title.
Depending on how it ends, probably #1 imo.  I know it’s bold, but his reign single handily took the title from obscurity. It was a meaningless, thrown aside, no one gives two shits, title. Then he wins it, and it’s one of the best things on the show.
In my lifetime yes
If he passes Honky Tonk Man, which I believe he will, he’ll be in the conversation. Not only in terms of quantity (as in days as champ) but in terms of quality as well.
Yes imo. He's been fantastic.  They've done a great job with the IC Title, back to being the best "midcard" title in wrestling for me.   GUNTHER is the perfect champion.
If he beats Honky's record and continues to have awesome matches like the one at Mania, he'll be way up there with the greats.
I'd personally already put him in the top 15, maybe even top 10.  And he's the best single reign with the title since Randy Orton.  But I don't see anyway he breaks top 5 imo
#1
He’s the best in the last decade.
Are we defining this by greatest guys who were at one point or another IC champ? Or greatest run with the IC belt specifically?  If the former it means we're comparing him to guys like Savage. If the latter we're comparing him only to guys like Honky Tonk Man.
I feel like he's had 2 good rivals in Ricochet and Sheamus, both of which strung together a lot of wins and momentum before their rematches making them feel a bigger, so that's a plus.      If I had ONE hang up tho, it's that I feel like he's missing that definitive Promo about what this reign means to him, and in general to put him over the hedge. His Character is simplistic enough that I understand it, but I do feel like he's missing that ONE good Promo that'll push his Reign over. We all know he can work in that ring like NO other, that's not in question.
I'm hoping he breaks the honkey donkey mans record
Gunther has been more important and imperative to the legacy of the Intercontinental Championship than anybody in this century. Let me repeat: nobody since WCW closed has done more for the IC Title than Gunther. Maybe RVD, but I do know that Gunther belongs in the conversation as one of the best IC Champs ever because his one reign means something. His matches are must see. He’s portrayed in a serious manner. Nobody is laughing at him. Gunther ain’t gonna be getting knocked out by a celebrity at a PLE after his reign ends.
He will be much higher in a few years after another few reigns. If you take single reigns he's had one of the best, overall though Miz and Jericho are levels above considering how many times they've held it and what they did not just with the belt but for the belt.
Not too high. I do like Gunther tho
Plenty of time left to be the best one time intercontinental champion ever
Riiiiiiiight under Honky Tonk Man
Best in the last decade for sure overall tip 10 ish
You can't answer that yet. You could only answer where he stands right now.  But the whole thing should be to build for him next Wrestlemania with the IC title facing for the world title.
Besides maybe the NXT North American Championship, I can't think of any other midcard title in wrestling that has as many consistently great matches as Gunther's IC Title reign  In my opinion, he's the greatest champ of all time for that title, maybe a case can be made for Jericho
Bring up the Honk-A-Meter
currently he's #3 after Miz&Jericho....if he breaks HTM's record, I'll put him #1 without 2nd thought
Especially if Gunther breaks the Honky Tonk Man's record, which he should, he may end up being considered THE best of all time. Especially because unlike a lot of other long reigns in the modern era, it's not like he's had bad challengers. The dude's had a lot of real, credible challengers.
Savage, Steamboat, Hennig, Hart, Rock, Jericho, Angle, Guerrero, Dolph, Nakamura, Gunther.      Right off the top of my head, those names pop up. Gunther 1000% belongs on that list, which is mostly chronological, I think. Ranking them would be difficult and I would probably fluctuate on any given day on the positioning.
Hard not to put him above guys like Macho Man who are so synonymous with the Intercontinental championship. But GUNTHER helped elevate it back to where it once was in the eyes of the fans. He has been nothing but fantastic so far on the main roster and I look forward to everything he does
4th
The best IC Champ of the 21st century, which isn't a high bar to cross but still noteworthy all the same.
I'm very pleased to see it get rated so highly. I cringed so much but in a good way at every chop and every strike. That match was friggin awesome man by far the best thing on night 2. Thought it was the best Wrestlemania match the IC title has had since WM3
Doesn't hurt that the two top title belts and two tag belts are unified. Basically makes gunther the no. 2 champ in the company and means 2 fewer matches on ppvs when the ic and us were always getting bumped
Recency bias.  His run won't do what Shawn, Brett, and The Rock did for the title.  It sucks because it's a great run but just to throw him at #1 is nuts imo. It feels important but other wrestlers made it hell like the most important title in the company   I would say top 10 though.
Being back the Honka meter for Gunther lmao I really hope he does since Sheamus didnt win it at Mania. Was really pulling for him but I like Gunther too much to not love the match
He’s the dominant heel champion done right.
Fr the IC Title is always more cared about when there’s only 1 top belt, like when Daniel Bryan had it or when Cena was US Champ in 2015
When those people won it is was already meaningful, maybe they elevated it, but they did not take it from obscurity. Gunther’s reign single handily saved the IC title from its status as worthless, and horribly mistreated, to making it the true workhorse title.   He’s been really the only singles champ in the division on SD to actually show up, and that elevates him even higher.

I’m so proud of Billie.
![gif](giphy|fW5TlTDsa47aj4cXZN|downsized)  Baby Billy!!
This is new. They've been building this match through social media promos the day-of.
Go get her, Bill!
Is she not wrestling on BLP tonight? She’s scheduled
I hope it's a hell of a match. Jade has bangers in her and Billie does too
Is something unexpected going to happen at this match? It's pretty unusual for them to hype up a (supposedly unsigned) talent this much on socials
Was almost afraid I wouldn't see her tongue but she delivered at the end 🤪
Battle of the Belts would be way more of an event if it wasn’t all jobbers battling for belts
Funyuns for all!
[She got pulled from the BLP card on Tuesday.](https://twitter.com/BLabelPro/status/1643372724155301888)
Ah I missed that thank u

MOB SHIT
Solo is showing right now that he really is the man to just take orders.   I wonder when he is finally ordered to take Jey out, I wonder what he does.   "Jimmy's watching TV at home" hmmm, already separating Jimmy from Jey I see. Evil mfs.  Jey you know what's coming man fuck these man, main event Jey don't need these man. Get your brother and get out.  I love this dynamic and story so much.
The bloodline is fine guys
It’s finally fucking happening…..right?
I love that Jey can't just shoot Jimmy a WhatsApp in kayfabe. "Where you at, bro?"
Slow build towards a bloodline four-way match at wm for the title of head of table? Anything to not have roman wrestling for the title again at wm. Roman loses titles to cody at ss, then bloodline lose in a traditional survivor series match finally leading to the bloodline turning on each other on way to wm
There is still so much more to that Bloodline story line looking forward to where it leads  If Jey turns on Reign that would be wild
What do you mean by that Paul?
Dragging it out, see? That’s negative ROFLMAO
The bloodline is fine, the bloodline is mine -Cody R...err Paul Heyman
“Solo, I hear you paint houses.”
It’s Michael signaling Neri to take out Fredo
Username checks out
yep, when the time comes for solo to finally think for himself, it’s gonna get a huge pop.
If this ends with Jey as Undisputed Champion I will shave my head
So Jey is turning Face already, I wanted to see him betraying Roman in a surprising manner and cause him to lose his title.
Solo is gonna get ordered by the Elders to take Roman out.
Oh thank god, because everything I just read made me think otherwise
This is not the end.  This is not the beginning of the end.  This is the end of the beginning.
I wouldn’t mind being wrong but it seems WAY too early to do this right after wrestlemania. This is the kinda thing they should build and make uncomfortable for a couple months at least. If it happens tonight that 100% means jey is just gonna be the next loss for Roman
Its probably more the part where Jey tries to keep himself in Roman's good graces and failing because there's no pleasing Roman. Like even with him beating Sami, it still doesn't change that he lost the tag belts to him and that Sami is still a thorn in their sides.  Lets it simmer for a bit, probably until summer slam I'd guess at the earliest.
I wouldn’t mind being wrong but it seems WAY too early to do this right after wrestlemania. This is the kinda thing they should build and make uncomfortable for a couple months at least. If it happens tonight that 100% means jey is just gonna be the next loss for Roman and we’re gonna be left waiting for the rock to show up
oh fuck i never thought of a datal 4 way omg
"I got red. I got blue. I got beige."
Very much could build Solo up very Batista like. Wardlow as well, if only TK could have capitalized on that build more afterwards.
If Jey somehow becomes the Undisputed Champion I will also join you in shaving your head.
Big words coming from the bald guy
That would honestly be awesome even if he was just a transitional
SummerSlam.
Nah, you couldn't be more off.  I heard after WrestleMania that the Bloodline's meeting with Jey was “intense” and “at one point Paul Heyman was crying” but everyone grew closer and a big lesson was learned.
I heard they also had a big group hug afterwards too.

I don't really consider Brock as a heel or face, he is just him
Why does a shark do whatever it wants to? Because it fucking can.
Whatever the answer as to the why, I think Heyman is behind it. We all thought Heyman was talking to Roman on the phone during that RAW go home show. I think it will be revealed he was talking to Lesnar.
If history is any guide, no. Austin’s Mania X7 heel turn was basically justified by saying that the people didn’t deserve to know why he did it. That was the end of the Attitude Era and began the decline of wrestling because it was stupid and people released they were being condescended to.
They already spoke about why he beat up Cody because “he was pissed about being first on the card”  I’m not even joking, that’s the storyline they’re running with. So much for “let it play out” gang
Lesnar is a heel 24/7.
I thought he was supposed to be a heel in the feud with Bobby until the Saudi match. The booking for that whole feud was really bizarre.
That's how I feel about it, he's a wild card
Man this is the perfect answer
As long as there are no shark liver eating Orcas around😗
Austin turning heel at WM17 was so deflating.
That was a suggestion, not the definite reason.  That was why they tried to ask Paul Heyman about it.
Who in WWE is an Orca in this metaphor?
It’s even worse when you see what they did with it the next night … if it was “this is what I always was” and he was so desperate to be the champ he’d do the unthinkable, then you can make millions off it.  The “you don’t deserve it” just ended the attitude era in the worst possible way.
Probably Roman

Sheamus more than deserves to complete the Grand Slam. Sheamus v Gunther III is going to happen at some point, I kind of hope it happens at MITB in the UK and he finally beats him
Sheamus is RED HOT right now. If he ever beats Gunther for that title the pop will be absolutely glorious. He deserves it.
Did he yell "Fella" before the kick?
Sheamus might be my favorite wrestler right now, wouldn’t happen but I would love if he managed to get one more world title before he retired
Glad the Brutes did not break up
Love seeing Sheamus stay hot. Should beat Gunther at SS
Sheamus deserves that IC title win.   As good as the matches are I think the Sheamus/Gunther, Brutes/Imperium feud is dragging on a bit when you consider this as an extension of the one they had last year and I hope it isn't prolonged all the way to SummerSlam.
I love this version of Sheamus.
I fucking love Sheamus.
As much as I adore Gunther’s reign and would happily see it go on forever, I do think that when the time comes, Sheamus should be the one to take it. Man’s on the run of his life.
Sheamus has been a workhorse over the last year+  I would love to see Gunther vs Sheamus at the next ppv
Sheamus, Ridge, and Butch are my favorite good guy group right now.
Ive always been a fan of Sheamus. Especially his 2010 heel run where he destroyed John Cena and Triple H.
You can tell sheamus is enjoying this feud and this new gimmick with the brutes
It’s gonna happen at mitb London I can feel it fella.
Im so co flicted. I want Gunther to beat Honky Tonk man but i also want Sheamus to win the title and while i can watch these guys wrestle quite a few more times. If they have to drag it out untill after summerslam it could well go stale a bit. I'd rather Sheamus does something diffrent for a while and then comes back to Gunther after summerslam but lets see where this goes.
Sheamus Gunther cage match at Backlash PLEASE
Sheamus is so fucking great man
Sheamus vs Roman needs to happen at MitB.... I know he won't win but dammit it'd be a BANGER and the UK crowd would love every second of it
Hell of a match. Was Shemus ever this over? Man he is fucking fire right now
Need that old theme for Sheamus and the crowd will even be hotter.
Sheamus needs that grand slam! He deserves it!
If Gunther was to lose that would be the place.
Money in the Bank in London
Definitely needs to be the main event at MITB
White hot, very very white
Yes and it was awesome
I remember watching an interview where he clarifies he actually yells something in Gaelic but I can’t remember what it is
As long as by SS you mean Survivor Series!  On August 5th, the day of Summer Slam, Gunther will be at 421 days in his title reign, just about 34 days short of breaking Honky Tonk's record.  If he's still champion on September 8th, Gunther will overtake that record.
He’s been my favorite since I started watching in 2011. I’m so happy he’s getting the appreciation he deserves
They can't fake us out twice.
Austrians do have a poor record at winning in London
I think Gunther will lose it at MiTB
Yep, can't have every title record break one after the other

Starting to suspect that Butch has been Pete Dunne the whole time, will have to keep tabs on this
J O I N T   M A N I P U L A T I O N
I love Butch glad to see him fitting in and the crowd cheering for him
![gif](giphy|SMg21Gvvob1sI)
Never noticed how Kaiser looks like a taller Rockstar Spud
BRITISH WRESTLING.
Side note: Navy blue is a great look for Imperium, very clean.
To be honest the butch name has really grown on me and I love this version of him
Pete Dunne was lost at sea while attempting to make it to the states for SmackDown, washed ashore in Mexico, and is now being cared for at El Generico’s orphanage until his memory returns.
I never saw pete wear a hat. If we can find pete and put a hat on him we will know for sure.
I've long thought that "Butch Dunne" would be a great name for him.

Man. That new LWO shirt is a powerful and iconic design. The color change speaks volumes without denying the history of the original.  I love it! I hope they also do a double design at some point, where maybe, on the back, near the upper neck line, they add a smaller iteration of the original mexican flag design, to this one, or even put it on the shoulder. I love it!
Por fin un luchador Mexicano en la lucha libre de WWE. Hasta el 100 mi plebe y arriba el LWO
LWO LWO LWO!
Ahhh. Momento de brillar

The second longest reigning tag Champs in WWE history "Day"
NWO being WO
ANNNDDDDD [AWKWARD SILENCE] WWE CHAMPION!!!!!
New Japan Pro-Wrestling as an offshoot of the Japan Pro-Wrestling Alliance is a “new” version that worked out quite well.
Maybe I'm just too high, but this reads like someone who heard English once tried to invent their own language.
New Daniel Bryan was some of Danielson's best work
I get the joke, but adding "new" to an existing concept is different than having "new" in a name.
You know what's worse than adding New before a team's name?  Adding 2000 to the end of it. NWO 2000, LOD 2000, Tekno Team 2000 all have 2 things in common: they end in 2000 and they're all shit.
The exception that proves the rule
Any reboot is usually terrible. When they add “new” to it or back in the day, “2000” doesn’t make it more or less terrible.  Outside of the 4 horsemen reboots, it’s never worked. And even for them they still had atleast two of the core members
Day Rocks
New Japan fits both.
Glad we're 23 years past that.

[The actual clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osNA2bCciDY). It's probably the happiest Brock has been in 2004
they really fucked up not having a full program between these two
Brock and Steve fighting for the ownership of multiple different types of vehicles would be an awesome feud.   Austin has stolen Brock's tractor so now Brock has to get him back by taking his 4-wheeler.
![gif](giphy|Ym4RAKJYuWXY87gsRR|downsized)
He looks comically large on that thing.
That's definitely a farm boy. The control of that vehicle is impeccable.
The only SD taping I’ve ever attended (I’m a lapsed fan who only got back in in the last few years). The glass shattering later in the segment is burned into my brain forever
Cowboy brock was leaking here
Oh man, he's always been a cow boy.
We as fans were robbed. Brock vs Steve would have been incredible, even if Steve didnt/couldn't wrestle much.
Austin was right to not just lie down for Brock with no build.
It was never an option. Austin's neck was garbage
I don’t know considering Austin’s neck issues and Brock accidentally injuring Kurt in their wrestlemania match Austin probably dodged a bullet.
Steve would’ve been down to wrestle Brock but Vince originally booked it for a Raw match rather then build it up this what lead to him leaving
Steve knew losing to Brock for no reason would be dumb as fuck and they didn’t want to put any build to it. He did the right thing bowing out.
what would have made it classic would have been the non wrestling stuff.   Imagine Stone Cold showing up on Brock's farm to fight him like Booker T in the Grocery story only for Brock to kick his ass farmer style and drop a hay bail on him.  they were both larger than life dudes and had the creative brain.  it would have been amazing.
They had a chance in 2002 but wanted to do a random match throw away match on Raw.

Big match Bill!
They are building this match up way more than Jade's other defenses. I don't think Billie will win for a few different reasons. But good on AEW for at least casting a little bit of intrigue on what would have typically been a squash.  TK isn't above letting unsigned wrestlers hold belts. Mox was unsigned last summer and Brian Cage is currently holding ROH gold while not under contract. And it would be a HUGE news story, letting a high schooler take a championship belt to class.  I'll be rooting for it, as they've laid the groundwork for Jade to be looking past Billie tonight, with the sitdown scheduled with Taya. It would be cool to give the rub of breaking Jade's streak to such a young talent. And AEW could have a handshake deal with her to sign immediately after graduating. She could be right back on AEW weekly tv this summer.
That tongue out pose needs to go.
Ricky sister?   Too many starks, pal. God damnit.
I think Billie will get some near falls like Skye Blue did in her last challenge, I think a near upset but not a squash.
Nah. Suits her persona as a brash young punk just fine.  I have zero belief Billie is winning but still a big deal for her, I hope they let her get at least 2-3 moves of offense in.
Why? There’s wrestlers with significantly worse/more lame poses.
I agree. This should be reserved for Luther. Everyone else is just a pretender.

I honestly could have sworn she was already signed
Great on her! Now if she can finally win a match on TV please
Good for her, really. This is hard work paying off.
Congrats to her, she's absolutely put in the work over the past few years.  Cagematch says she worked 47 shows in 2022 (8th most in the company) and 17 already this year (4th most).
Good to see hard work get rewarded.  She's definitely improving every time out.  If she ever becomes AEW or ROH champion, I think it's fair to add her to Emi Sakura's impressive list of champions trained, as they worked together seemingly every week for a year
Congrats for finally graduating
Someone at AEW saw people talking about how "Billie Starks is gonna get an #AllElite graphic before Skye Blue, huh?" and got this out there pronto.
She has improved. Her offense used to look dreadfully weak but she's upped her game considerably.
![gif](giphy|OfJWITyP2i7LMVwwvF|downsized)
Well deserved. Big fan of Skye Blue.
Didn’t know she wasn’t!  Good for her.
Congrats to Her! Shes improved immensely and has no where to go but up.  Hoping an #AllElite graphic is on the horizon for Julia next.
Congrats to her! But damn this whole time she wasn't under contract?!
Dante is down so they need it
Jay White and Skye Blue in the same week? TK knows what I like. Bless him.
I thought she already was all elite??
nice one, she deserves it. she's definitely put in the work
Long time coming. She's really come far very similar to Anna Jay who started in AEW fresh out of starting wrestling school. I can't wait to see where she goes.
Wait, really?
Dave Meltzers mortal enemy finally did it!  It was long overdue.
Congrats to her. Genuinely one of the talents I can claim I never saw before AEW along with Hobbs.
Well that came out of the blue
FINALLY
Surprised it took this long
Really thought she already was
[removed]
reach for the skye, blue!
Good for her, she works her ass off for everybody she has been up against.
Insane it took this long lol. She basically committed to them years ago when she left NWA.
I thought this happened awhile ago.
A long time coming. Congrats to Skye Blue. Well deserved.
Now give her some wins damn it.
Now we need Redfoo
Wasn’t she already??
Nice!
It's pretty wholesome how many upvotes this has
Skye Blue is the Bonnie McMurray of AEW!!
Well deserved. I think she’s got a ton of potential.
I 100% thought she always has been. Either way well deserved!
Tony Khan’s an ass man for sure.
Congratulations! I have been waiting forever. She deserves it.
Hopefully this means big things for her (namely actually getting some wins on Dynamite & Rampage).
So does that mean she gets to win on Dynamite now? Lol happy for her regardless.
Awesome. She looks better everytime she has a match now. She has improved a lot.
Lord, she's got to change that name
You deserve it! *clap clap clapclapclap.*
Bout time, damn. She's great, big fan
I said it before and I'll say it again, have Jade pick on her then let Skye upset her for the title. Shock the world and make a star with one decision. Then strap a rocket to her and pat yourself on the back while you tell every podcast it was your plan all along
Wait, she wasn't already? Cool.
Well, finally!
She might be the first one on AEW I've truly seen rise up from the nameless squash jobber on Dark up to where she is now. Everyone else seemed to just land where they ended up.  Good for her.
Give Skye Blue the TBS Championship
Finally! Good for her.
She has improved leaps and bounds. Her matches on Dark are quite goodv (And obviously the ones on the TV) . Congrats!
Is that Blue Pants?
Bout time!
About time
![gif](giphy|dMsh6gRYJDymXSIatd|downsized)
Hell yeah.  Put the rocket on her back.
![gif](giphy|uLGs2Enp9RYze)
What does that mean anymore? They all do Indies
No more jobbing
Took them long enough. She’s really earned it as she’s really been putting in the work and improving each match.  I’m hoping that Julia gets her too soon as she’s finally getting an actual feud and TV match again. I know that she’s already on the roster page but it’s just weird that she never got the treatment of the graphic beforehand.
Very well deserved
WTH. She signed a while back. They made a big deal about it
For those of us who are collecting the AEW Upper Deck New Arrival cards, our wallets are going to kill us this week. Nigel, Jay, and Skye. Good God.
About. Damn. Time!
*You deserve it*
Not gonna lie I thought this was the guy from LMFAO before I clicked the link
Yeah now she’s officially #AllElite!
Hopefully she can afford some trunks that fit now, poor girl must been wearing 5 sizes too small?
Can she now lose the hat just as she does before every match starts? It adds nothing.
Again? Is this a rib like the dude from impact constantly resigning? The dude I'm referring to was once married to Charlotte I believe and he had a name that starts with letter B.
She looks 14
AEW has enough women. We don’t need another low level indie wrestler.
I guess Shida really aint getting back into the us vs them story
I thought she already was. Good for her. Kinda wish TK made this announcement on a tv taping. Would have been great to see her reaction to the pop from the crowd
Hell yeah congrats to her!!! She seems like a great personality to have.
How many wrestlers does AEW have under contract now?
good news for her, but honestly i thought she was signed after tony came out during that chicago ppv where he added her to a match. at this point, she's been beaten like a drum and positioned as a scrappy jobber at best. maybe they do something with her, maybe not. guess we'll see.
I was sure she was All Elite back in 2021 but good news! She has improved a lot since then. There is still room for improvement but she connects with fans easily and is a great midcard babyface
Cool to see so many people seeing her put in the work. I hope she can make a jump from where she is.
Glad to hear it
Well its about god damned time.
Took these slugs long enough. Best news this year so far!
That's awesome she's improved from when she first started. Her high knee is good
She's out of purgatory!
Took them long enough. Hopefully it means she starts to rack up some wins now.
Now get her on Hey! EW already!!
YES! FUCK YEAH! I LOVE HER!
Should’ve had her win a match on tv first, then announced it, in my opinion. Either way, happy for her!
Girl paid her dues and got the job.  GG
FINALLY. So happy for her.
The Outcasts tryna see if they get paid more for beating up people who get the AllElite tag
I use to pray for the day to come 🙏
I think TK once said that people get the AllElite banner for exposure, news and hype, or when a storyline needs it.  She may have been signed for a while.  Congratulations are in order just the same!
She wrestled red velvet in Chicago in a dark taping in 2021 and she got red booed out the building. It ruled. Happy for her she’s been constantly improving.
I am gonna say it but you already know it
I wonder if this means redfoo is headed to wwe... or maybe even impact
Should’ve signed her after the Jade match tbh
She's been an absolute workhorse, she deserves it.  (👏👏, 👏👏👏)
Same. Could have sworn they announced this after she made her debut during that women rumble event.
I believe she was tier 0
She was.  I'm guessing she has renewed her contract, or gotten an upgrade.  Let's be real: everyone you see on TV or Dark/Elevation is under some form of contract, even if it is only on a per-appearance basis.
Hopefully now she’ll be on Dynamite & Rampage more.
she's going up a tier.
Weirdly enough, I think she got into a Dolph Ziggler position of doing too well at getting beat up, and now she's become the go-to for it.
The Skye's the limit now.
Most people should be losing all the time at first, unless they’re a prodigy. ie, bate/dunne when NXT uk started
She's a workhorse who's on almost all the AEW and even ROH shows on a regular basis.
I don't think Julia Hart has gotten her graphic either.  But probably after the match with Anna
She spent months getting slapped around by Emi Sakura on Dark and it shows.
She actually looks like Cora Jade in that gif.
Same, I had no idea she wasnt under contract because it seemed like she was featured pretty regularly.
Wait.. Julia isn't signed?
I guess so?
One day, Chelsea Green can come to AEW. Then we can have Jay White, Malakai Black, Skye Blue, and Chelsea Green to create the faction Crayola. Any other color-named wrestlers I’m forgetting about?
*laughs in Gigi Dolin*
Ok but…where’s the lie?
Bonnie McMurray!
The Acclaimed would like to have a word.
Hobbs?
Hobbs, Stark and the Acclaimed all started out as jobbers in AEW.
Jungle Boy joins this chat  .. ok he didn’t start on dark but the jurassic express had that serpentico-grade score for a bit
![gif](giphy|jQiCBiTmVM36MgGSI6|downsized)
No, Blue Pants is Leva Bates, a.k.a. "The Librarian."
It means she has a contract now.
Nah man, Red Foo is already a wrestler, his ring name is Carlito
Bram
*cries in Ashley D'Amboise
Hey if it gets her a contract
Eh, people on this sub are just way too (over)reactive.  Yoshi-Hashi legit went about decade in New Japan without ever winning a belt. In the last year or so, he had 3 title reigns (1 ongoing), beat FTR at Wrestle Kingdom, is the most over he's been in his entire career, and everyone now agrees he's good. People haaaaated Taichi for years and thought he sucked, now everyone agrees he's awesome.  True underdog stories require time and a lot of losing, Skye Blue is still only 23, she could keep losing for years and still be fine whenever she got a chance.
Difference is Ziggler was that role from the beginning, became World Champion in that role, and is still in that role at 40.  Skye is in her early 20's.
I think she is there almost every week and at PPV's, her and Emi are the Dark MVP's
She has also continued to to indy stuff at the same time.
Julia is on the roster page
I believe she has a PPA/lower tier deal if Im not mistaken (someone feel free to correct me on that).
Orange Cassidy, Red Velvet, macaroni and cheese for the tag titles
The Baddies were mostly colour themed for a while; Jade, Red and Grey. Ruby Soho would count too. Nyla Rose. John Silver. Stu Gray...son.  ...Paul Wight?
Man, I think they're pretty equal in that regard. But as I've said before, GiGi has that "I'll ruin your fucking life" look and energy to her that my dumbass finds irresistible lol
We are all blessed with the current generation of wrestling
*laughs in Rikishi*
Stark? You're tripping. He debut as a open challenger for the TnT championship against Cody and got a pop.
we do need Kris Stat
Its TBStatlander or nothing, as far as I'm concerned.
Skye Blue breezed right past Tay Melo as a worker about three months ago and hasn't looked back.  Unfortunately Tay has stalled a lot in the past year.  Wouldn't mind an Emi Sakura run personally, she'd put the hurt on challengers.
Ahh, thanks.
According to one of my sources it did.
The old Flintstone "ehhh it's a living"
Yeah, and she's still early in a learning process. Letting her job to the bigger stars and learn in the ring from them is just fine.
Cody wins the title in 10 years you say
Also she's not ready to be a regular. People confuse "she's a standout rookie" with "she's a good wrestler that's ready to carry a 15 minute match"
i hate that they changed Emi's theme.
AEW's roster page is trash.  I'm almost certain I have not seen a "Julia Hart is All Elite" graphic
Julia is listed on the roster page now as of like a month ago so it would seem that she's been upgraded.
![gif](giphy|KEYEpIngcmXlHetDqz)
I love this
But what happens when you add Liv Morgan to the mix?!
Yes, yes we are.
Yeah same I just asked my sources who work for AEW they all said that too
For those of us who like watching Dark, I have a feeling she's going to be like The Gunns where she ends up in title contention and surprises people who haven't seen the months she spent getting slapped around by Emi Sakura.
Hey, Steve Lombardi had a very long career doing this.
Weird thing to get upset about
My dad works for AEW and Nintendo and he said this is true as well.
I'm not upset.  Well, I'm a little upset about AEW's roster page because it is embarrassing for a major promotion.
Went binge drinking with Kermit last night, as we're both puking our guts out on some random storm drain, Kermit said so as well mid puke.
I appreciate your attention to detail. That annoys me too.
Just their website management in general is bad. Last year they announced when tickets would go on sale for their Indianapolis show, but they didn’t include the Ticketmaster link until 3-4 days AFTER the tickets went live

$20 million from Sponsorships for one two day event is actually insane.   I can understand why they do it and why they'll continue to do it honestly.
As someone at both nights, the sponsorships were fine aside from when they were built up after a video package  Turbotax and the dumbass poltergeist movie both passed off the crowd  The cereal and lemonade were perfectly fine
Can't wait for Cody to beat Roman in the McDonald's "I'm Lovin' It" main event of SummerSlam.  Or maybe in the Burger King "Have It Your Way" main event of WrestleMania 40.
I mean how could they not be making so much money the amount of ads they pushed on you was unreal. I expect more ads but I'm hoping they're less forced like they were at Mania and more like other sports. I expect Barricades, Aprons, and Ring Posts to be covered in Ads by the end of the decade.
I'll never begrudge a corporation doing its fiduciary duty to "get that money." They're maximizing profit like its their job, because arguably, it is.   But I also will choose not to consume products where the advertising is ridiculously over the top. From what I've seen, WWE and UFC are long past that point for me and I hope AEW doesn't get to that point in the future. I'll watch a show with commercials, I don't want to watch one long commercial with separate commercials.
WWE is sponsored by Howler Head
This will be a new Superbowl thing  Companies paying top dollar for the sponsorship for an event like this which has a captive audience
"WWE Wrestlemania 41 is brought to you by Tony Khan and AEW DYNAMITE! Every Wednesday, don't forget to tune in to TBS! "
Maybe pick a better match for the kids cereal. The father/som blood feud just doesn't quiet make me want Cinnamon Toast Crunch
Everyone in here will still tell you "meh, hardly noticed it"
I’m picturing the WM16 4-way but instead of the McMahons, it’s the top four burger brands in each corner.
CHICKEN CHICKEN CODY CHICKEN
that was the major one I had an issue with. The Turbo Tax one wasnt that bad and the Mikes Hard Lemonade was perfect for the Triple Threat but I have no idea what Cinnamon Toast Crunch has to do with Dominik and Rey. Not to mention they had this weird red lighting for the match as well and the nauseating colors of the ad all around the barricades and apron.
A McMuffin in every corner
Some guy has a sign at the show saying Die Vince Die lol

Imagine paying $1000 for like 2nd row tickets and you cant see cause these 2 people won't sit down.
Those tag belts are so dull. Look like souvenir coins.
Finn laughing when Dom is getting booed is so amazing
If this was the 80s people would be jumping the railing to get their hands on Dom, lol.
I can’t believe that Judgment Day are over as they are right now. I did not have much hope for them in the beginning but they have been nothing short of unbelievable the whole year…  LOOK AT THIS INSANE LEVEL OF HEAT THAT DOM IS GETTING THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE
I feel like I’m watching a different company tonight compared to Monday. Holy hell PLEASE keep Vince at home like this.
Succession this past week had a line and it just described McMahon to a tee.  "He's walking around with the slight sense that he may kill somebody. It's like Jaws, but if everyone in Jaws worked for Jaws."  https://preview.redd.it/jxpd529i6lsa1.jpeg?width=739&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5682068df564616e24cf9e34c46914e891c8fc10
Please don't show up. Please don't show up. Please don't show up. 🤞  HHH please turn your phone off.
It was deafening in here when Sheamus was doing his Thang, he's white hot right now. Because he's pale. And well liked.
Ricochet is on TV. Vince is definitely not there lmao
That pop for LA Knight, dude is OVER
HHH peels his face off… “it was me all along”
Rey jacked up on Cinnamon toast crunch ready for some good ol fashioned son beating
It's awesome to have a multilingual faction. Dom and Priest speak Spanish, Finn speaks Gaelic and Rhea speaks Australian.  >!I'm a New Zealander; Aussies and us always give each other shit.!<
Michael Cole's unabated hatred for Dom has really done a ton to help get Dom over as much as he is.   Also, seeing Rey Mysterio and Hijo del Fantasma tag teaming together is so cool for just about everyone involved.  Judgement Day has come so far
Dom got that nuclear heat.
Dom is a heat magnet lol
Today I went to get a mclfurry but the ice cream machine was broken  Thanks Vince
IVAR?! That's a weird way of spelling "LA Knight". He even spells out the first part of his name to you, graphics guy.
Valhala is the WORST ringsider ever, she don’t interfere, she doesn’t scream, she just stays there
Sara looking at Ivar like **I’M STANDING BAREFOOT OUT HERE FOR NOTHING!**
Dom’s growth is so incredible. This heel turn was amazing.
I saw a Chinese dude selling hot dogs from a street meat cart downtown in an LWO shirt today  WWE better not fuck this up
The difference between Triple H’s SD and Vince’s RAW is JARRING. If Endeavor is trying to make a decision on who gets the book, it should not be a difficult choice.
Man I love these progressive commercials about being like your parents, they always get a chuckle out of me
Zelina would be a good first program for Rhea. She can go, she can talk on the mic, and she wouldn’t lose much credibility by being beat by Rhea
If Jey breaks my heart 34 or 35 more times man I'm gonna flip
Sami is back with Kevin but can't get over his ex (Jey)
The Bloodline feud has been good storytelling don’t get me wrong.  But I’m sick of them taking screen time away from the S-tier storytelling going on in Chad Gable’s feud with Maxxine Dupri over Otìsè’s heart.   That’s the storyline that keeps me up at night
"Now running this place."  Ok, so def not running this place
Triple H announcement --> TK announcement --> Triple H announcement --> TK announcement, we are stuck in an endless loop now
Wrestling fans take note: this is how you act at a live show
What a disgusting victim blaming crowd. Booing a man who’s been abused by his father for years. Truly shameful
I'm here live and the booing for Dom is huge. Don't think anybody here could hear him once
I truly wonder why I, as a fan, should give a shit about how much WWE made from wrestlemania?
Man Dom is such a caring son
Your winners  https://preview.redd.it/kxv5p5cdulsa1.jpeg?width=1557&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1f73ee2c698bd25543378b9c092ba405b3799a6f
Brock beating down Civil Rights leader Cody Rhodes set the movement back.
He's talking to us like we're shareholders. None of this means a damn thing.
With their first selection, NXT chooses Roman Reigns
This episode is hitting. We needed this.
Triple H on Monday: Nothing will change  Triple H on Friday: It's gonna change the whole game
These Fire Vince chants are SO loud rn , arena might get a noise complaint
Announcing HHH as "hall of famer" has me worried 😂
Title split, factions splitting. Draft could be very refreshing.
Dom is the top heel in the WWE
The mullet, the stache, the heel maneuvers, everything Dom does is a tribute to Eddie. You can tell that kid definitely had two heroes growing up.
sami is the type of dude to wear both titles on his waist
Shorts Jey. Oh shit. Roman sat up in his seat at home who does this Uce think he is
Triple H "Ladies and Gentlemen I just want to announce this. Vince is Dead. Thats right Tuesday morning I pedigreed the fuck outta him onto thumbs tacks laced with poison and then threw him into a burning dumpster"
Kaiser is a brilliant wrestler.
“Hey I know you two beat the shit out of eachother a Sunday, but how about you two do it again” ~ Triple H to Sheamus and GUNTHER probably.

We need a face who's actually upset at Roman. None of this backhanded "you cheated, but hey you still got the job done". Nah give me someone who's like "You cheated. You fucking suck. You wouldn't have beaten me without cheating"
I really like the character development for raquel.  She now takes off a jacket prior to showing you her back and smiling.
Cole I'm begging you.. namedrop PWG or somethin so that I know for sure Vince is not running the show 😩😂
That crowd pop for La Knight 🥲
“Now running this place” does he know?
Guys nothing changed! End of promo
Does the draft even matter?  Half the roster appears on both shows. I don't even understand the point of it in the current WWE landscape.
Dom has SERIOUS heat
![gif](giphy|CaTW2QdtN3c0U)  Rey in the back right now
They booing more than when Elias dissed the SuperSonics
Cole just corpsed the boos lmao
Lol Dom is the biggest heel in the business
Dom's heat is NUCLEAR!!
Amazing reaction for Dominik.
DOM is officially my favourite heel right now. He is the best heel right now, overtaken Roman for me for now.
Main Event Jey looking good. I like the shorts a lot. Dude has the body to not wear a T-shirt in all of his matches.  I hope this leads into a big push.
Wow they're finally talking about Roman cheating lol
its 100% a-okay for riddle to run this interference.   solo needs a proper feud and riddle has the perfect reason to start one with him
The entire thread looking at every small detail tonight like  ![gif](giphy|l0IylOPCNkiqOgMyA|downsized)
Sheamus is the most over he's ever been in his career
Not gonna lie, I know Brock is one of the best, but that damn step on the throat looked so damn real.
Oh my god.....Did Solo kill Jimmy? Look at that look he just gave
The look on Jey's face. He knows Roman is just looking for an excuse to be mad at him
ricochet just gonna flip around the ring until the match starts i guess lol
When do y’all think Ko is gonna turn on Sami, I give it till summerslam
Sami knows something is about to happen to Jey.
KO is so untrustworthy. He just oozes backstabbery.
Sami acting like Ted Mosby trying to save his friendship with Robin
For real LA Knight should’ve been at Mania.
![gif](giphy|RGqwKLs11po0iCp4dN|downsized)  Let me talk to ya
LA should have came out instead of Shane
LMAAOOOOO IS THE SAME SPEECH
Dom is the best heel they've had in years. Haven't heard boos like that in a while.
Finn: Getting slightly cheered  *Dominik appears in the shot*  Crowd: **BOOOOO**
This is fucking amazing
THIS is amazing!!!!  Exactly what you want, a young heel with this kind of heat??????  They won't let him talk  LOVE IT
Smackdown has been exponentially better than RAW
Zelina getting her nerdy shit in is awesome
It's going to be so juicy when Jey finally turns on Roman
Jey looks so naked without the titles lol
If there was ever an attire and look to call "Main Event Jey," it's this one tonight.
Why is Solo Sikoa just allowed to interfere in main events and jump people backstage? Is Adam Pearce stupid?
I appreciate how many times Jey curses on live tv lol
Riddle joining the alliance to end Romanmania!  And it's not just a random addition, the Bloodline's made a *lot* of enemies. Hell, half the BCC has a grudge against Roman.
It does make sense. Since that’s how riddle was taken out
Do none of you fucks remember Solo crushing Matt’s windpipe in a steel chair with the big juicy booty he inherited from his daddy?
![gif](giphy|6ILjOfJ1oL7NAc9SQ7)  Here we go again
All that recap and literally none, ZERO sound clips from Play By Play. My god Kevin Patrick just isn't it man.
Solo only been here for a few months and already the biggest Roman dick rider 😭
Just give me LA Knight YEAH
KO already plotting lol
Why does everyone keep insisting that someone has to turn in this. Why not just leave them on good terms this time
The pop of a champion!
Those controllers are like $70!!!
Lmfao at the PS5 controller but the Xbox Pause Screen
Vince and Haitch, I've got three words for y'all  L A Knight
Michael Cole just squeezed in a line there about Triple H:   “The all-time great running this place”
Still crazy to me how skinny Triple H is now.   I really hope he's looking after himself health-wise, dude's a legend.
"Triple H is running this place" - Cole. Interesting.
HHH announced Roman and Rhea.    That's a major compliment for Rhea.
The draft only works if they have strict brands again and people don't show up every week on the other brand.
Too sweet between HHH and Balor
HHH embracing the heels as they come out on both shows is funny as hell
LOUDEST BOOS IVE EVER HEARD
The boos against Dom lmao.
Dom still mega over you love to see it
Dom is the biggest heel on the roster lmao
Damian Priest got that fit out of 1998 Undertakers closet.
NOW THATS HEAT
Nah they really hate his ass 😭😭😭😭
God that heel turn of dom was genius
Fucking hell how loud are those boos?!
dom is legit on another level  this dude is a fucking star
THIS Crowd!!! I love it!
Dom is the goat. I remember being there live for a raw back in Brooklyn. The heat he got was unreal, he’s living it up as an heel
FUCKING NUCLEAR
Damnnnnm Dom getting so much heat. I love it lol
Never seen this much heat on anyone in the last decade
Nuclear
Dom getting the Roman beat taker reaction
I love Dom haha. God what a great heel.
If you told me a year ago this fuckin goober would draw as much heat as he does I would’ve thought you were lying to me
Who would ever think the son of the babiest baby face in modern wrestling would be the chickenist of heels.
I never dreamed I'd end up loving Judgement Day this much
Triple H’s go to move whenever people flip shit about him not being in charge is to just book a ton of tag matches and it’s hilarious
Damn, did Dom pee in Cole's cereal?
Cole needs to call Dom a no-good son-of-a-bitch.
So for PR they could totally do: Priest/Dom vs Rey/Bunny, Finn vs Santos and Rhea vs Zelina
Dom is going to a 99 in WWE 2k24
That piece of shit poor sport Rey Mysterious just attacked Priests after the bell
I dig this new side tattoo
I don’t think I’ve seen a face and heel have a conversation before their match like this before.
DAMNIT SAMI! YOUR LUST FOR JEY HAS COST US KEVIN'S LEG!!!!
I feel like this week’s RAW was a case of “Pop came over for a visit & was playing around on my desktop for a few hours” vs Smackdown where it’s clearly “Hey no don’t worry it’s me, Trips & I am very obviously running the show and writing this show can’t you tell?”
IDK why this is a regular match and not a Waffle House Brawl.
That's how Matt Riddle was written out so I'm not sure why people are confused by this. Glad he didn't forget
I see them running a six man with ko/sami/riddle and usos/solo at Backlash to ease riddle back into the fold.
NO HUNTER DON’T LEAVE GORILLA
So many saying Riddle is random; Solo is the kayfabe reason he was off TV for months.  Makes full sense really.  Though it SHOULD have been saved for tonight and not wasting the return on Monday (in what WAS the random way)
Do people in this thread REALLY believe the WWE wasn't going to air the recap of their biggest event of the year on their most watched show, just because they also showed it on Monday on a smaller network?
If HHH comes out and repeats what he said I'm gonna assume we just went back in time to Monday again
Well that match had more action than the entirety of Raw. So that’s a start.
cody really though he had a friend 💀 poor baby never saw it coming
Brock was mad he went first? Suspension of disbelief broken.
they are gonna tease Sami and Kevin turning on each other for their entire tag team run and honestly that sounds hilarious
I'm liking this so far. MUCH better than Raw so far. Actually have some decent story and matches lol
THE TANK IS STILL ALIVE AND WELL
That LA Knight pop
LA KNIGHT YEAHHH
HEY! Those are expensive!!
L 👈🏻 A 👆🏻 KNIGHT 👉🏻 YEAH
I cannot believe they just pissed away an opportunity for 70k people to yell "YEAH!". This man is over.
man LA Knight would’ve lit SoFi up. so sad
Bruh ps5 controllers are like 75 bucks. Thats some REAL heel shit
He should've rolled out in his chair from gorilla
Haitch reaches under the ring to get his boots and laces them back on.  "I WILL DETHRONE THE TRIBAL CHIEF"
"Running the place"....okay.
Meet the new speech, same as the old speech
THE BOOS 💀
“Rise for mami” is going to send the chat into a frenzy.
That Dom heat is monstrous
Dom with nuclear heat. Beautiful.
Bully Ray hearing that crowd reaction.  ![gif](giphy|l0HUmmv6hk4cToPkI|downsized)
Dom out here getting the biggest heel reaction every week
Holy fk that heat is absolutely scorching for dom!
i can barely hear him oh my god i love it
I swear if you have Dom cheat on Rhea, the night she slaps him and breaks up with him she's the most over woman in wrestling.
I’m cracking up, Dom might have the most heat in all of professional wrestling right now.
This heel turn for dom was the greatest decision of his young career
"I pulled my punches" is such a damn good heel line there hahaha
what a disgrace, these disgusting people booing a traumatised and abused child
This is why Portland is a loser city for booing a poor traumatized child like Dom.  He didn’t get a Mercedes, only a stupid BMW …  #that wasn’t even a M series!  🤦
Why are they booing Dom? He's a victim of child abuse. Do better Portland
I absolutely love how much Michael Cole hates Dominik
Cole: FUCK DOM AND I SAID THAT SHIT
That camera angle made it seem like Santos was about to anime betrayal Rey
This crowd cannot do to dom what prison already did to him
Santos is incredible. Getting to work so closely with Rey is, I imagine, a dream scenario for him
 So far this has been better then raw
My family thoroughly enjoys getting together every week to discuss this no good son of a bitch Dom Mysterio
In 6 months Dom went from “I wish he would learn at NXT” to one of the highlights of any show.
ZELINA RUNNING FOR HER FUCKING LIFE
Not heelish, Zelina sacrificed herself to take care of the Rhea problem.  Y'know, like Mia Yim couldn't
It's odd to say it, but Rey and Dom have some really great synergy in the ring.  Rey makes Dom look great, Dom makes Rey look great.  I actually like this matchup a lot.
I'm good with Judgement Day winning here. If only because there's no chance WWE has the team with Bad Bunny lose at the Puerto Rico show.
I enjoy Riddle quite a bit. He's fun to watch in the ring, and his character is amusing.  That being said, if he doesn't find the rest of his shorts, I'm gonna have a difficult time watching
WTF its already main event time? This show has flown by.
I'd be terrified to let tattoo needles that close to my nipples
The beatings will continue until morale improves
Better draft Shinsuke to Raw so Graves can yell KIIIIINNNNNSHAAAAAASAAAAA
Man, Solo is booked to fucking perfection
Man it feels so weird seeing the Usos not dragging the belts with them
That's some real interesting gear Jay Uso has on. Seems like a singles push is coming?
Jey in shorts and without the sleeveless crop top. What is happening?
I just had a thought. What if Jey won the MITB…
I had a Samoan upbringing. Getting beaten until you accept that you're wrong is what our parents did.  It's partly funny and also partly the reason a lot of us grow to resent them.
The gulf in quality between Smackdown and Raw at times is just...
The sexual tension is so high
Cole has really got the art of telling the story being played out in the ring down, like JR did/does.
Kinda feels like Adam Pearce should maybe ban Solo from ringside?  Maybe just once? As a treat?
Blue Thunderbomb always looks sick af
Main Event Jey wasn't losing in his fancy new fighting shorts
Riddle got sidelined by Solo. The continuity!
Riddle remembered that the Bloodline, and not The Miz, took him out months ago.
RIDDLE ISN'T BAKED ANYMORE  BLOODLINE FUCKED
Long term storytelling.    Riddle vs Sikoa belongs on PPV
Monday: Nothing is changing!  Friday: Everything is going to change!
Am I ready for a good time?
Starting with Gunther’s god like wrestling to start the night is a good way to get me back. Damn you Vince
Drew McIntrye’s not here tonight due to health reasons. Hope the big man is alright!
Be funny if Vince takes over Raw and HHH get SD and SD got better ratings
Sheamus is white hot. Crowd fkn loves him.
Vince and HHH have completely different run sheets besides "then the European guys beat the shit out of each other"  exactly the same
That match was better than the entirety of raw
The classic recapping of raw on smackdown towaste time
The opening segment and the Brock turn were good on RAW. It’s the other 2 hours and 20 minutes that were all-time bad.
Jimmy missing huh  I see what’s happening  ![gif](giphy|xUPGcjRPA7lkprZJcY)
Someone tell Jay what Heyman just said!!!
Already a better show than anything from Raw
ricochet vs. ivar? according to Universe Mode this will be a 5 star classic
Jey when Solo turns on him: **YOU WERE MY UCE, SOLO!**
You’ve heard of Michael Jordan’s new movie Air  Get ready for George Foreman’s movie Grill!
Hulk Hogan missed a call from his agent about a marketing opportunity for a grill and when he called his agent back all they had left were blenders. The grill ended up going to George Foreman
I can’t be the only one who finds the Viking raiders extremely stupid as hell
Viking Raiders look like cosplayers instead of wrestlers
Sarah Logan is the most pointless re-hire I can think of. Hasn't even wrestled a match. Heck B-Fab even popped up for 2 minutes in the Rumble.
Vince is home.  No way Rico wins a match with Vince in the building.
Sami is Lawful Sweetheart Good as a face. He goes above Cena in *he actively tries to find the good in people* which is why he's still friends with known dick Kevin Owens.
“look at my back yall!”-Raquel at all times
I feel like the script of that last promo was directly from Glee.
Dude he’s actually over as hell
YEAH
Shinsuke Nakamura appearance!!! (.....on 2k)
Dude those controllers are like 50 bucks man
He destroyed the Controller?? Ultimate heel move
Cockamamie Moss and the Up Up Down Dummy are no match for LA Knight
Shit I just grabbed my dualsense like that YEAHH
gaslight me papa H 😔
That’s like an $80 controller wtf
HHH is here to announce himself for the 2024 Royal Rumble. Better get in quickly before 30 others beat you to it
I miss “The Game” theme song
Am I reading too much into this, but on RAW HHH had his job title on the graphic, today it’s just “Hall of Famer”
WWE needs more coherent metal entrances.
Triple H: "I am here to announce uhhhhhhh that this episode of Smackdown uhhhhhhh is brought to you by NordVPN uhhhhh"
Very pointed “Now running this place” reference to HHH
I wanna see C-Level executives have similar poses when they come out to address an audience lol
HHH one of the best entrances/theme songs
Is he going to welcome rhea out to the ring?
An actual announcement
A draft!  Vince will be drafted to RAW while HHH will be drafted to Smackdown.
You just know HHH wants to be in Judgement Day so bad
Oh damn, Finn's here. I thought he'd be taking some time off. What a badass.
I love that HHH too sweets Finn every time
IM RISING FOR MAMI BUT I AINT STANDING ON MY FEET BROTHER
Dom had a hilarious interview this week where he talked about the spot at Mania throwing water in his sisters face wasn't planned. He said he came out, noticed that she had a drink and thought "what a dumbass she's got a cup, I'm gonna use that to get heat". The kid is being taught well.
Everybody that's in catering wishes they could get the heat Dom gets
Nuclear heat
they will not let him talk 😭
God the heat is unreal
Dominik is 50% of the way to looking like Eddie
Holy shit they’re booing him to oblivion lmao
HBK in Montreal not getting this heat
Holy fuck Dom’s gotta feel so fucking good getting this response. No one in this company gets that heat. He’s earned it
Bro you can't even hear Dom lmao all that heat
You know how many wrestlers wish they got half that heat? Jesus.
I guess Doms finally got……Latino Heat
MJF WISHES HE HAD DOM'S HEAT
Lmaooo I don't know when the last time I heard nuclear heat like this was, incredible.
You know you're one of the best heels in the industry when modern day audiences boo you out of the building for existing.
Modern heels wish they have Dom heat right now.
I dunno if the mics are extra loud or not, but those boos are ***deafening***.
Holy shit, they are so loud you can't even hear Dom on the mic
Goddamn this is amazing 🤣🤣 Dom is UP BIG
Fucking Nuclear
Dom is fantastic
I appreciate the boos and the lack of what chants. The way it should be
God that little creepstauche suits him so well
I'm at the arena and could barely hear dom over the boos
The dirt stache is really just the icing on top of the wimp cake known as Dominik Mysterio
Never have so many been so wrong about a wrestler as we were about Dom
Oh shit, they got officially announced as the LWO. Whew I thought it was a one off but I suppose they gotta stay together thru Backlash at least.
Bad Bunny being a honorary member of the LwO in 2023 was not on my bingo card guys.
Cole is GOATED LMAAOOO
COLE LMFAO??  “GET IN THE RING AND FIGHT YOUR DAD TONIGHT”
On God that Dom vs Bad Bunny stare down at Backlash is going to reach Rock vs Hogan levels....
cole is so great when hes roasting dom
Cole’s hatred for Dom reminds me of J.R’s hatred for hhh back in the day
Finally Rey Mysterio has a squad around him  The years of him getting beat up with no help are over
This is getting Santos mad over, love it
I'm digging the LWO revival so far. Santos Escobar has always been excellent.
Does every single superstar being in the draft include NXT?
Everyone saying "this has been better than Raw" like SmackDown hasn't been the A show for a few years now 🤣
I’m just so happy to see Zelina out there
They need to add Rhea vs Zelina for the title at Backlash. She deserves it since its in PR and its a throwaway title match for Rhea. Win win.
Rhea about to pull Zelina's arms off.
Prayers up for Zelina.
Ah yes. My favorite tag team  The
Mysterio attacking Priest after the bell. What a heel move!
Zelina goes from hardly wrestling, to facing Rhea😬 good luck girl
finally... my guy Nakamura is back
![gif](giphy|kz6OI69h7D8kuBEqwz)
Jey's tattoos are really well done
Ok HHH is in charge tonight lol
Love Heyman just standing there recording it lol
Sami is torn between two lovers.
God they're doing such a good job of making Solo so hateable
Jey in shorts? face turn!
KOs leg vs solo sikoa is gonna slap
my god this entrance dont feel right. no roman, no solo, no jimmy, no titles, just jey
I picture KO following a trail of Snickers until they pushed it over onto him
Man I actually wanna see Sami and KO as a legit team for a lil while but now I’m so pessimistic one of them is gonna turn on each other
Jey uso is one of the best actors in wrestling
Oh no,somebody kicked Owen's leg out of his leg!!!
weeeeeehooooooooo!  USOs theme still a banger.
Because of the injury to KO’s leg, Jey’s going to help Sami retain the titles on Monday the same way Sami helped the USOs retain back in January.
Sami with the stacked belts on the waist
The coherency and flow of the show is just night and day compared to that steaming pile of shit 4 nights ago
Cole mentioning the help of the usos again for Roman.
That's pretty huge for Wade Barrett to call the Bloodline the GOAT faction when he himself was part of the Corre and League of Nations.
Vince saw this comercial and grew his mustache out
The Uso’s are pretty good at not including the thigh slap for superkicks when needed
Lmao there's a child behind me yelling "GET UP JEY DO IT FOR ME JEY"
Sami gonna pin someone with the Blue Thunder Bomb one day and I'm gonna be so hyped
Solo interference again I’m convinced the refs are being paid at this point
Someone take the ref distracted samoan spike finish away from Triple H, my god
Long term booking.
I guess people forgot about riddle history with solo lol
If Roman is the tribal chief  Riddle is the high chief
Riddle my guy, I like you. But find some pants.
So with this group promo you have Rhea who got cheered, Finn who got half and half, and Dom is just drowned out by deafening boos  Judgement Day is a blessing
Rick boogs hereing Shinsuke is back  ![gif](giphy|Dps6uX4XPOKeA)
Jey faking you mfs out every time lmao
RIP Butch  My business partner is from Oklahoma and said he used to see Butch and Luke riding around Tulsa in the dead of winter, wearing tank tops in a convertible with the hard top ripped off
I will still say that Mania 39 is one of the best Manias  Night 1>>>Night 2
OKAY I am fine with this opening
Ok, the fact we've had multiple matches announced in the first 10 minutes by commentary confirms there shouldn't be any tearing up of scripts.
already more wrestling than the first hour of raw
Tossing someone off the top rope to *caught into a brainbuster*
Until LA Knight is on the show I’m not believing Vince isn’t involved
"gimme your fingers  - Butch all day everyday
When fighting Butch, don't use fingers. In fact, just don't use your hands. Kick him or something.
Already better than Raw
When in doubt, book Imperium vs. Brawling Brutes. Never disappoints.
This rivalry with Sheamus and Gunther is just the best thing going today
Man day n night difference with raw and SD. This Match has been better than raw
A wrestling show that starts with a banger wrestling match, you love to see it
Sheamus really is on the best run of his career right now.
And he beat him. And he beat him. And he beat him and he beat him and he beat him
Roman emotes like a mutha when things go sideways.
“He was upset that his match went on first.”  Somehow....I really doubt that.
I like how Brock beat the shit out of Cody for 11 minutes straight, hit him with a steel chair, smashed him into the barricade, suplexed him on the outside, and then dropped his ass on the steel steps and people were complaining that Cody was overselling lmao
Solo fucking killed Jimmy
Main Event Jey is Canon!!!
I have a bad feeling about this for Main Event Jey
Jimmy eating seafood at the plane
Jey reminding me of exactly when The Bloodline started
uh? Isn’t Sami Zayn a champion now? Would beating him tonight really solve the Sami Zayn Problem?
Jimmy: Gets to stay home.   Solo: has to work when he probably hasn’t gone on his honey moon yet   🙁
Roman bout to take out Jey vs Remote Controlled Solo
Oh no Solo is going to murder Jey.
If they make Brock's justification for being pissed at Cody is that he went on first at Mania instead of last like Cody, I will be just as pissed as Brock looked on Monday
Ivar looked great in that match, i hope they do more with the raiders
Oh no they’re gonna have Kevin turn him down the line aren’t they🥲🥲🥲
Oh No.....Sami.......Kevin....
Team weird hats vs team no hats
:D - Raquel Rodriguez
Setting up the Sami/KO/ Jay love triangle.
Fingers crossed Ezekiel makes his SD debut tonight to take the tag titles with his brother as revenge for that beatdown last year.
i dont want to be mean but i kinda dont want to see lita wrestle anymore 😶
YEAH!! Where the hell has he been
YEAH
LA KNIGHT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH!
YEAH!
LA lives!  YEAH!!
Thank God LA Knight survived the Vince snap.
LA Knight on my tv has already made up Mania night 2 and Raw.
SOMEONE WATCH HHH CHAIR PLZZZZZZZZ
Cool to see Xavier Woods playing games on SmackDown as well lol
JUST IN:Old Man w moustache breaks into gorilla whilst H is gone
Whoever said Triple H was gonna be on the 8:59 - 9 for a ratings boost was dead accurate
Emma wore floral patterns to better play her part of 'plant in the room'
I hate no water HHH. So corporate 😞
LA Knight an Xbox Game Pass subscriber confirmed
"Now running this place." --- Cole  hmmmm
oh god another wrestlemania promo
This Triple H guy is over
Is he starting this speech the EXACT SAME WAY? Lmao
Where is my FIRE VINCE chant Portland???
This is starting to sound like the annual shareholders meeting
Can't wait to hear the "21.6M Gross!" chants ring through the building
DRAFT DAY JOHNNY MANZIEL
THE DRAFT WILL BE HELD AT WEMBLY UH
"The Game"  *Peter Griffin he said the word*
“Every superstar is eligible” we’re getting a new world title.
The Too Sweet to Finn 😂
Damn so what happened to all them fire Vince chants that were supposed to happen?
**Announces the Draft**  Please welcome 3 Raw superstars on Smackdown
Please end the Finn and Edge feud....
Lmfao Balor is gonna fighting Edge till he dies or retires
Dom is nuclear
You know, at Wrest--  *Entire arena boos*  Man, i love Dom.
I love that Dom gets such heel heat that we can’t hear him over the crowd.
The absolute nuclear heat for Dom as soon as he opens his mouth is glorious
Dom gets abused by his dad for years and the crowd still hates him? Unfair and cruel
That may be the biggest nuclear heat since Elias made fun of Seattle
Dom has double nuclear heat
Lmfaoooooo this is crazy heat
DOM HOLY SHIT THE BOOS
It’s amazing that in the post-kayfabe world someone can still get this kind of heel heat.
Boy you don't see boos like this no more holy fuck he has HEAT heat.
The heat at Backlash will be unbelievable
Dom with that nuclear heat.  That’s gotta feel fucking great as a performer
Dom unironically has the most heat in the whole company
Wow this is crazy heat lol.
You can't tell me Dom isn't the top Heel in all wrestling.
Dom: “I’ll stand here all night!” Cole: “Oh please stop booing.”
That convicted felon heat
HOLY FUCK   THESE BOOS ARE BEAUTIFUL
I think Dom might be working as a heel
dom is generational
Dom is the goat
Hahaha this is next level heat
This heat is wild lmao
Still flummoxed why Edge needed the win.
Dom is gonna get shanked in Puerto Rico.
N U C L E A R     H E A T
The greatest heel in wrestling today.
Don’t ever make Dom a babyface ever again WWE lmao
I am cheering so hard for Dom having this crowd eating out of his hand
Judgement Day are so supportive of each other. I love it.
Dom's too fucking good man, never accept defeat
DOM IS NUCLEAR. GO
‘ I couldn’t hurt him’ after months of punching him and saying HIT ME. This guy is gold
I love how Dom gets legit HEAT
I cannot believe Rey Mysterios son is getting a reaction like this lmao. I know Big Con Dom is loving this shit
I haven’t seen someone get this much heat since babyface Roman Reigns.
 Dom is getting so much better on the mic.
They gotta start letting Dom rack some wins up and capitalize on this shit. This is nuclear heat you see every few years
If Dom cam out to "Many Men" by 50 cent, he would be Goated
Looks like we're gonna be short one Bunny this Easter
 i REALLY hope bad bunny is selling the injury at whatever concert he’s doing next
Priest has such a good voice.
This smack down is so much better than Raw this week
THEY'RE STILL CALLED THE LWO! REJOICE!
zelina with that mask looks like she's about to weld up some metal for me
Michael Cole threatening to expand his Spanish vocabulary on national television
Judgement day are too good to be broken up
They’re shifting so much merch with the LWO in Puerto Rico being endorsed by bunny
WWE going all out with the Spanish influence and LWO to capitalize on Puerto Rico. I like it but hope they don't drop it as soon as backlash is over.
Can we appreciate how awesome tonight has been? Fuck sake comparing it to Monday is like going from eating dirt to ice cream.
Puerto Rico + Bad Bunny + LWO = $$$$$
we’re learning that as long as Vince isn’t in the building to completely wreck the flow of the show, the shows will most likely be a good time.
Vince is NOT in his ear lmao
2005 Cole: Poor kid getting dragged through this fight.   2023 Cole: **I HATE THIS KID!**
Nice pop for Escobar
Evil dead rise is gonna be so fucked up and I can't wait
Escobar is so damn good!
Santos is going to be a MEEEEEEEEEEEEEGA star
I want a LWO vs Judgment Day war games.
Man as a Latino I’m so fucking beyond happy to Have LWO and santos getting some shine. But I do hope in the long run that dom leaves judgment day takes over LWO as they beat down Rey.
Is Rey in the LWO?
Rey went from not wanting to fight Dom to beating his ass daily
Really good match. Crowd has been so into the show for practically the whole night.
Wrestling and segments have been just peachy tonight, so here's hoping Monday was some malformed fluke.
All the matches tonight have been quite good. Smackdown is such an easy watch. At least that hasn't changed.
God Rey is SUCH A HEEL!
shinsuke LETSGOOOOOOOO
SHINSUKE AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Nakamura returns next week, nice.  "Former winner of the Royal Rumble."  And now I'm sad again
Smackdown has been good which is making happy
It just won’t be right to have Shinsuke without Pat.
Good to see Nakaumara back.
Sheesh this show feels so much more natural than Raw rn. It’s already the main event and I haven’t felt any sort of mild annoyance.
You're not going to win me over by telling me you could just keep beating my ass if you wanted to...
Michael Cole out here throwing baseless accusations smh
Bruh Jey looks like a real main eventer by himself. World champion even!
The pop main event Jey will get when he superkicks Roman infront of the bloodline will be crazy
Main event Jey Uso is always a different beast ☝️
Sami: Join me or ima beat your ass  Jey: ....
Time to build up MITB Jey Uso!!!
One segment and I'm already hooked on the bloodline saga again  God damnit haha
Jey not wearing Bloodline merch tonight...
Matches announced next week set up by backstage segments  The game is being played
God i love that theme
Sami keeping his shirt on means he ain't taking Jey serious tonight
Jey looks great with that gear.
I'm surprised they're putting this match on smackdown and not a PPV
I acknowledge our main event chief, Jey Uso
"I'll tell you what an old friend said to me, Jey. Yo soy El Generico, No sé dónde está el aeropuerto."  "I don't speak Spanish."  "I don't either."
I take it tonight has been a good show?
Jey falls for the exploder every time
I don’t understand this story telling with Jey, he made his decision many times why are we still teasing it
I’m glad Micheal Cole explained that because I did not get the correlation
We literally did this exact same storyline like 2 months ago. "Is Jey gonna turn on the bloodline for Zayn? Lol, nope"
I had forgotten that the Bloodline put Riddle out in kayfabe
This would have been a much better and kayfabe appropriate return for Riddle than the shit we got on Monday
He needs his shorts back so badly
Riddle makes sense y’all are just short term minded lol
I know 2 hours is less than 3, but I'm always surprised when Smackdown is suddenly just over.
NXT, Dynamite and Smackdown really beat Raw’s Ass
Dory has better memory than most of the people on this sub.
Solo v. Riddle I'm here for it. Looks like it's going to be by committee  to take us to Summerslam or even Survivor Series to handle some of the Bloodline
I completely forgot how they wrote out Riddle so I’m glad Cole explained it.
2 Hour Smackdowns > 3 Hour Raw and it isn’t particularly close
KO is such a jealous girlfriend now 😔
I literally told you guys. Check my comment history. Triple H would come out at 8:59-9pm turn to boost the ratings. TV ratings are calculated in the first 5 minutes of the top of the hour. He’s gonna give the same BS that nothing is going to change but this time for the broadcast viewer on fox
Love how everyone is just saying, yeah, Vince had no involvement since Smackdown wasn't terrible.  The new theme of things from fans on here:  If it's good, it must be Trips. If it's bad, let's just blame it on Vince being back.
Just give me Pat Mcafee (even if it’s a one time thing), Rick Boogs and Shinsuke, all on the same brand again.  ![gif](giphy|7SF5scGB2AFrgsXP63|downsized)
Big night tonight guys, let's pray everything goes well.
Once thing i’ll give WWE credit for is reinforcement of something they’re promoting. These motherfuckers won’t let you forget lmao.
Wait where’s Triple H???
Lmao even Triple H got cut
Triple H scared to leave gorilla
Opening with a 6 man tag? Vince did not book this show
Triple H looking a lot more white and ginger than I remember
Samantha Irvin naming Imperium members = Chef's Kiss
I could listen to Samantha announce the phone book
I have a feeling the Trips announcement is going to be about a superstar shakeup / draft.
You can feel the nerves through the thread lol. Everyone really trying to see any sign to see who’s in charge
We all really overreacted to changing Walter’s name to Gunther.
that was the safest Alabama Slam I've ever seen
NGL, this match is sports entertaining.
Gunther and Sheamus would have been a match that went on every night for like 5 years in the 70s
Show is already better than raw
Banger after banger after banger
Sheamus is so fucking over right now
I don’t think Sheamus has been more over than right now. Career renaissance
Fabian Aichner was like a german Brian Cage  Giovanni is a jobber Karl Anderson
5-minute recap package, followed by a 15-minute 6-man tag banger featuring the IC Champion.  Okay, I feel a little less worried about tonight.
Sheamus is so incredibly over. Such an amazing talent to have on the WWE roster :’)
Fantastic match. Hope Sheamus getting the pin here means they'll revisit the Sheamus/Gunther singles feud. These two guys were made to fight each other.
Exactly how it needed to start.
Put any of these six in the ring and you getting a banger
Ignoring all of the backstage circumstances, this was a strong opening match. Hope the rest of the show keeps up.
Is Sheamus the #2 babyface behind Rhodes lol
Good ass match.
So I guess the crowd isn't going to HiJack the show? LOL
Looking forward to the pop Sheamus gets, when he FINALLY gets the IC belt from Gunther!
I know there’s people who haven’t seen it so I’m totally cool with the recaps but OH MY GOD SO MANY MANIA RECAPS AAAAHHH
Imagine if that Tag Match actually happened? WOuldn't even have to be different just have Cody go for a tag, Brock dips out leaving cody to get SPEARED and Roman gets the pin 123.  Then Brock beats the shit out of Cody post match.
Roman’s facial expression when Brock’s music hit was on another level. Legitimately felt like he was perplexed at what he was hearing.
Triple H would rather book 10 minutes of recaps than a women's match.
Brock picking up a pro wrestler like it's a small child will never not be impressive
Don't let this distract you from the fact that Vickie is a massive bitch
And he beat him And he beat him And he beat him And he beat him And he beat him And he beat him
Lmaaoo Kayla's face when Paul said no booing hahaha
Oh Christ. Vince is definitely booking this. Brock's kayfabe reason for attacking Cody is because his match went on first at Mania? LMAO
Ayo solo don’t look at my boy jey like that
Main event Jey, let's go!
Hmm. What if Solo turns on Jey? Reigns is champ but his family falls into pieces…   By the time we get to SummerSlam, there won’t be a bloodline to interfere in a Rhodes/Reigns rematch.
Jey is the problem Paul is referring to. Uh oh.
Ohh no. Solo is gonna turn on Jey.
Interesting that Paul says that while Jimmy is at home, and last month he was the one to say “you get a different perspective and catch things while watching on tv”
Viking Raiders are just not clicking for me in the least. If anything I like them LESS since Valhalla was added, too.
In MyGM Giant vs High Flyer is a certified banger
What does Valhalla get paid because I'm willing to walk around doing nothing for a pretty low rate.
What has Valhalla's purpose been with this group. She does literally nothing. She hasn't helped. She hasn't harmed. She doesn't talk. Nothing
I’m convinced  ricochet would have had a much higher ceiling in wwe if he was prince Puma
the childhood Kidman fan in me will always be excited for a shooting star press.
I was not expecting Ricochet to get this win
I don’t know when this Sami and KO thing is gonna go south but it is no doubt headed for disaster
Something seems off.... camera pans to the right after they leave the locker room revealing Vince creeping in the corner.
Oh thank God the women’s match didn’t get cut
I like Raquel tbh but man everytime I see her I just think she'd be much better as a heel.
I'm here live, I can confirm that there was no floating "LIV" anywhere in the arena
Did you know that Cody Rhodes is Dusty Rhodes’ son?
Raquel has the build to be a badass heel but they make her a face who only smiles and shows her back lol
LA Knight is on my TV and everything? I could cry.
am i insane that i see more value in Shotzi than like half of the womens roster?
LA Knight  YEAHHHHHHHHHHHH
YEAH!!!
YEAH
Let me talk to ya
LA KNIGHT !!!!!
YEAH
**YEAH**
YEAAAAAAH  ![gif](giphy|lPozKgECkbBhQ1AMFI|downsized)
YEAH
Fuck LA is OVER
Hey now. Those controllers are very expensive.
Those controllers ain’t cheap bro
LA Knight is  a megaheel for me now. Do you know how expensive PS5 controllers are!?
Baby, this man has IT. He couldn’t sell it if he wanted too
Breaking a controller is declaration of WAR.  I wish someone would lol
LA Knight I like you BUT DON'T YOU EVER DARE TO BREAK XAVIER'S CONTROLLER
Damn that hurt seeing LA Knight break the controller
PS5 controllers are like $70, I'd be heated too after that
GUNTHER GO PROTECT HHH’s CHAIR
Damn, was that controller rigged or he just str8 up tore it up like paper? From what i saw, those controllers  are pretty well made
If HHH doesn’t say the same thing he did on Raw, think he might announce the draft. It’s time to change up the rosters.
Man who did all the Mo Cap for 2K, hates video games
Jesus christ please let LA Knight start the new wrestling year with a W
i love that HHH comes out to King of Kings
the “King of Kings” is a good song but it will never hit like “The Game”
HHH comes to the ring as the audiences sings his song. Cut to commercial. Return from break, HHH is conducting the crowd in a sing-along to his theme. He sheepishly walks to the back without saying a word
“I’m here-uhh to announce that LA Knight-uhh is the #1 contender for the Intercontinental Championship-uhh.”
Cole: "now running this place"  Thou dost protest too much
Didn't bring the chair. The rest of the show is in danger now.
Please say "Fire Vince" Chants
Does he not feel ridiculous doing all of it in the suit?
"It is a place where hearts are *broken*..."  Yes, Hunter, we know. Very well. Like, recently re-learned
Is this a bit?? It's the same speech
HE SAID THIS ON MONDAY
HHH talking about record profits as Endeavor bout to do a bunch of layoofs
This could’ve been a great LA Knight interrupt segment
He's doing the corporate speak again
Yup so we got the same fucking announcement like Monday
Bruh we already saw the recap at the beginning
Damn fightful, having a rough night. Thank god for the Draft
Love it or hate it, HHH knows how to work a crowd.
Split the Titles please?!?
Just shut up and give me the Pretty Deadly call up.
I love draft episodes, I just hope they actually stick to it
Pls no split judgement day
Really? That’s the speech?
Genuine question: is there even an enforced brand split anymore?
Monday he says nothing will change, then today he announces the draft, which is technically all change.
LMAO DOM
Damn those boos are loud
Dom is getting all time Heat right now
Heat 🔥🔥🔥
Wow Dom got some major boos
Holy fuck the boos he's gonna get in Puerto Rico hahah
Rey gotta be watching like a proud father, his boy got over &  damn does he have nuclear heat!
Holy hell Dom is a heat magnet. It’s amazing how far he’s come.
omg that heat for Dom
When Rhea goes into a flow she sounds so much better, I don't like the way she starts promos.   I know that's how they want her to talk but please let her talk how she was at the end there, let her talk like that all the time.   So much more natural.
LMFAOOOOOOO
Nuclear heat
Dominick is white hot
Dom might be (definitely is) the best heel in the business
The heat dom has is incredible
Goddamn Dom, whatever yer doin, keep doin it
HOLY HEAT
This is sooooo gooooood!!!
I'm guilty of having hated Dom in the past but this is legit awesome heat. Congrats Dom!
Dude those boos!
Had anyone ever brought up how cool the ring lighting is for the judgement day?
Fuck, this heat is molten.
Damn most heels would kill to get heat like that
I hate him so much he’s incredible
Dominik might be the hottest heel in the industry right now. Which is a wild sentence to write out.
Never thought Dom would be such a heat magnet lol
Dom is SUCH a fucking draw
Oh man, I’m so excited to see Dom getting booed like that, haven’t seen someone get that loud of a reaction in a long time.
Imagine the cheers and boos between a Cody vs Dom angle
Dom lost because bad bunny interfered !
Dom should win Money in the Bank this year.
Holy shit Dom, that massive heat
the only thing with more bass than Dom's boos is Priest's voice
The entire Judgment Day are trying so hard not to smile. Incredible heel heat. Most wrestlers can only dream of that kind of reaction.
Bad Bunny gets so much respect from me because he loves wrestling so much
Man imagine the heat dom is gonna get in Puerto Rico at backlash
Fuck the bloodline, I only acknowledge The Judgment Day
Priest should do all his promos in Spanish. He sounds more intimidating
This is definitely a HHH CARD
Thank fuck LWO stays
&#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/xhj37mwnrlsa1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=34d18befea4dd9dcc38439fa44584d79faa1d413

Between the mullet and shitty 'stache, Dom's transformation into 1997 Eddy Guerrero is almost complete.
It’s crazy how much better Smackdown has been compared to Raw
I haven’t watched in a while and one thing I’ve noticed is that it feels like stables are back in a big way.   And I love that
Do you or do you not feel boricua?
I swear people on Monday said they re-named it back to WrestleMania Backlash?! 🤨
So.  LWO vs Judgment Day 8 man tag when?
Rey shouldve inducted the Cinnamon Toast Crunch mascot into the LWO
First time Rey Misterio is a willing member of the LWO.    In WCW, Eddie Guerrero was the leader of the LWO and forced Rey to join the LWO after a loss.
Is Michael Cole Lorde? I haven’t seen them in the same room together
Dom lowkey might be on his way to a midcard title run if he keeps this up
Find me someone who hates someone as much as Michael Cole hates Dom lmao
I think women should be able to wrestle the men if they're within 100 lbs. Rhea vs Rey would be pretty good!
Why do I want a bowl of cinnamon toast crunch right now?
Curious question based on the draft:  Say that Judgement Day MUST have someone split off from the group; who would you have leave?  \-Dominik is a nuclear heat magnet now but Rhea helps  \-Rhea has been the glue of the group  \-Finn is the elder statesman though doesn't truly fit it, but same time it's given him something on a roster he's routinely gotten lost in the shuffle  \-Priest is probably the easy choice but he fits in so well and just has little to do recently  &#x200B;  (EDIT: Initial response being very much Finn is about what I figured lol, hopefully if it does happen they remember they have him around this time lol)
Lwo 2.0 baby
we should've gotten to see the REAL draft.   the fight between USA/FOX every year to see who gets who.
Chad Nightlight Gable is going to be the one to put Roman's reign to bed
Wow, Rey almost landed knees first on Dom's stupid mustache
That driver by Dom was clean Af
Vega/Ripley with massive Vega support in Puerto Rico would be money. Lets do it.
Why isn't Rhea wearing the belt? You would think she'd wear it on the show she's the champ for
Damn it, I'm sick of seeing Santos take Ls
"fuck you"   Rey to Priest at the end 😂
Dang I think LWO probably should’ve won that one, but I know they’re building to the bad bunny match
Zelina should be Rhea's first title defense
As a son, it’s gotta be nice being in the ring with your dad. You know you can go a little snug or mess up a little and it’s fine. Your dad will forgive you.   As a dad it’s got to be a little more weird because even though you know shit happens, you don’t want to fuck up and accidentally hurt your son.
Lots of good wrestling tonight
Crey Mysterio ATTACKS after contest. Suspend this menace!
Get Dragunov on the main roster. I want Dragunov/GUNTHER to get 30 minutes at SummerSlam.
Hell yea Shensuke is coming back!!!
Nak back?!
Why was Shinsuke out again
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOO WE’RE GETTING SHINSUKE BACK
Nice that Nakamura is getting a video package like this.
Shinsuke my beloved
Now put a title on Nakamura you cowards!
Oh shit Trips remembered he still had Shinsuke on a pay roll. Please gimme the Shinsuke vs Reign feud that was robbed from us last year! 😩
SHINSUKE IS BACK!!!
So LA Knight is next week?
I did not forget Shin was screwed out of the world title TWICE.
GIMME THE JEY FACE TURN
Jey looking ripped, uce
Solo striking like the damn predator out here
Ok, we know Jey didn't do it.  At least physically lol
We really getting Main Event Jey tonight, how did we get so blessed
You can't tell me that the same person was in charge of both Raw and Smackdown. It's the little things like that.
No sign of Pearce at Mania and there was no backstage incidents to report. Wake up Hunter/Vince whoever: PEARCE IS THE PROBLEM
#MAIN EVENT JEY ☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾
I really smell some sort of Jey swerve coming soon.
They’re not gonna turn this story into Kevin and Sami having to give up the tag titles I’d hope lol
The pop main event Jey will get when he superkicks Roman infront of the bloodline will be crazy
MAIN EVENT JEY!
Jey without the title in the entrance just feels strange now 😭 new gear is rockin tho
Jimmy at home doing cardio right now as we speak seeing Jey come out without a shirt on.
LA Knight next week YEAH.
Knight vs Woods next week will be a blood feud level match. You don’t break a man’s controller without paying a price.
this subreddit bouta be like "'MEDICAL ROOM' THATS A TOTAL VINCE-ISM "
"They're more dangerous now than before. That's why I'm gonna go out there alone potentially 1v5. I'm the face"
I miss having Pat on weekly shows, but it’s really nice to have such a great heel color guy. Barrett and Cole have been a great pair
They really need to ban solo from ringside in every single match, dude is a menace
Has any call up ever been as impactful as Solo Sikoa?
The jumping nothing is truly one of the greatest moves in wwe history
Jey is so fucking good man
Jey with the Golden Ratio, wow. Axiom wants some royalties
I want to see Sami pin someone with the blue thunder bomb
WHY DO THEY KEEP LETTING SOLO AT RINGSIDE
Solo you SON OF A BITCH DAMN YOU SOLO YOULL ROT IN HELL FOR WHAT YOUVE DONE HERE TONIGHT
ADAM PIERCE HAS LOST CONTROL OF THIS SHOW
Solo eventually flooring Roman with a thumb is going to be pretty cool
Ah, dammit, I was thinking "Sami's in superkick distance."
Every time man. Jey stay hurting my feelings💀
Ngl Jey Uso had me in the first  half
I mean, the Uso’s did beat RK-Bro for the titles...
Who do you get for when you need to even the odds against The Enforcer?  That’s right you need a stoner
Let’s just pretend this was riddles return
Riddle came out because The Bloodline put him out of action. Dont worry I forgot as well.
You know, unlike RAW, there were no obvious Vince-isms tonight.
We’re all watching this episode with a microscope looking for vince red flags and I’m here for it 😂
I love all the Spanish we're getting from Dom, Damian and Rey, but they're in Portland tonight where I'm pretty sure there's a white person manufacturing factory.
Looks like a fun show tonight  Here for Mami Rhea
Those two dudes in the front row need to sit the fuck down. No one behind you can see, dickheads.
This crowd really sounds upset about Wrestlemania and Raw 😐
Dominik Mysterio is the biggest, purest heel in the business. What a crazy thought in 2023. Screw it, push this man to the moon.
Man the all-around vibes between tonight and Raw are like night and day
It’s crazy how much better than Raw this show has been so far.   It’s almost like people want to watch wrestling on a wrestling show.
yall want long term storylines then complain about riddle showing up lol
Those Fire Vince chants were like when Bart said everyone should turn their desk backwards. One person is out there doing it but missed the memo nobody else was going to go through with it.
Fantastic start, that 20 minutes was better than the entirety of Raw
"Fans are mad, what do we do?"     Everyone in that match: "Want us to just beat the shit out of each other like we always do?" lol
“Set your DVRs”   Yeah Vince is in Cole’s ear
That PS5 controller had 4 more days til retirement
LA Knight the only man to come out of a Bray Wyatt feud more over than he went in lol
"These guys just injured my brother, my best friend..... I'm gonna start with...with.....with.... A TRADITIONAL LOCK UP!"  Wrestling tropes never get old lol  (EDIT:  OK, apparently needed a disclaimer lol ... I legit love goofy wrestling tropes like this.  Not in a mean way, it actually makes me smile because only in wrestling does it happen haha)
Can’t wait for “NO CHANCE” to hit a minute into HHH’s intro
RIP BUTCH MILLER
Go in with low expectations and my heart can't be broken
Did you guys know WM was four days ago?
I heard this song like 50 times at sofi and I cant get it out of my head, get out of my head maaan
I understand running a recap for wrestlemania...but..an entire recap. HHH is coming out and saying the same shit as he did for RAW isn't he?
Am I crazy or WrestleMania seems like it happened a month ago?
What sucks the most about the main event of night 2 was that Cody and Roman were having a legitimately good match until all the interference shit ruined it
Remember when we'd get Wrestlemania network TV specials and they'd clip matches to Top 40's music
Starting with Brutes vs Imperium? Okay, pretty Haitch so far...
Triple H making sure his seat is safe before coming out lol.
not starting with HHH, smart move
God Samantha the damn goat
HHH is making sure his chair will not be stolen again before going to the ring
starting with a real match. already better than monday
Jey looks naked without the titles
Samantha don’t miss
Already better than Raw lmao
Say the line Samantha!     *Introduces Imperium*    Yay!!!
Smackdown opened with a wrestling match, that's not Vince booking.
they gonna milk this down on us, didnt these teams feud in the summer
LWO vs. Judgment Day. WAR GAMES.  Book it
welcome to World Wide Endeavors
Butch always going for the fingers is always hilarious to me
That was a cool suplex transition.
Butch goes for joint manipulation?   Riddle vs Butch feud incoming.
Triple H not opening the show talking this time around gives me hope that he’ll be saying something different than what he did last week
Ha that was a great spot with kaiser and vinci
I think Triple H heard the complaints about the first hour having 1 match on Raw.
I wanna see the Honky Tonk Man come out and challenge Gunther to a match when the IC record is about to be broken.
That finger stuff is so gross
Let’s say there was a brand split and H got to book SD and Vince RAW. SD by all rationale assumptions would be the better show and get better reviews.  How long would Vince suffer that?
Gunther is so fun to say with a fake accent
Gunther is the fucking man
That was quite the pop for Sheamus.
This crowd is HOT
Stomping up the stairs was an awesome touch
I don’t if childhood me would’ve been as big a fan of Gunther as adult me is, but dude is legit
I really hope Sheamus is the one to eventually beat Gunther.
Sheamus over as hell
Now, this is a HHH type of match!
Where was this on Monday?
I hope Sheamus is the one to dethrone Gunther, whenever the time comes
Awesome match man, that was loads of fun.
These two teams couldn’t miss if they tried
Well that slapped
Great match
they gonna make us watch cody get jumped again 😭
Great start to the night.
It really is something when SmackDown became the A-show…
Cole just made it sound like they’ve been teaming up for months.
Sheamus is on fire these last 7 months or so. I’d love to see him challenge Roman. Did Roman ever topple Sheamus on this current run with the belt?
The custom Rey belt was pretty cool.
Everyday I'm hustle'n
That match was as long as all of the last RAWs wrestling combined
Great start to the show, but that is to be expected with those 6.   Unfortunately, we're moving on a recap of the ending to a god awful Raw.
What's the last PPV that needs to happen before GUNTHER breaks the IC title record? I want to know when Sheamus can finally beat him for it.
Anyone else realize that Roman absolutely no sold the two cross rhodes he took at the end? Lol
Cody's punishment for planting that AEW seed.
I'll miss happy cowboy Brock
No more happy Cowboy Brock :(
F5 onto the steps was brutal
I speak on behalf of the black community to say we hate Brock Lesnar
That was the reason? lol
Bringing back the best feud ever? Let's go Paul and Kayla.
What? Brock has previously chosen to go on first if he's not last
Lmao at “Brock was mad he went first” as the reason Brock turned on Cody
Holy shit they are actually doing storyline about card placement
Heyman looks naked without his championships.
WM35: "If my client doesn't main event, then he goes on first"     WM39: "Brock Lesnar was mad he opened the show" lol
Now its JIMMY thats missing???
Brock was just mad that he had to work two nights in a row.
What a weird family dynamic these guys have
> Brock told WWE officials that he attacked Cody because he had to go first  Hahaha  And y’all think they are competent to keep Cody hot until the rematch?
Brock doesn’t really need a reason. Plus it was entertaining as hell lol.
That’s Sami beating Jey tonight settled then
Oh shit, now we're doing the Jimmy's missing angle lol.
"Problems?" Plural?
Wait, they’re not planning on turning on Jey already are they?
Why does Solo look like he's contemplating murdering Jey Uso?
SOLVE JEY???
That's 5 stars main event Jey Uso to you Mr. Heyman
theres no chance solo chooses roman over his own brothers right lol
hope jimmy didnt see that and have his cellphone to call and warn jey
Lol it’s supposed to be secretive but if Jimmy is watching at home he heard that shit
Solo is the harbinger of doom for the Bloodline.
Ricochet looks like he was trying to save money and instead of switching to Geico he repurposed one of Dustin Rhode's old Goldust body suits
Man Solo and his general attitude just gets on my nerves lol. Anyone else get what I mean? I mean this is as a good thing when it comes to how he's being written
I hope LA Knight’s new gimmick is that he lost his voice. I just wanna see the sub implode lol
I just don't care about the Viking Raiders
So according to Wade Barrett, Brock Lesnar attacked Cody Rhodes because he was livid his match with Omos went first.   I'm certain that's not the real explanation for why he attacked Cody.  Right!?
Viking raider are such badasses that the crowd goes silent in respect of them
Can they get rid of that Valhalla is here shit from their theme? It wouldn’t be half bad if they did
I’m glad Cole gave an explanation as to why the partners weren’t out there.
Usos interfered without Roman's go ahead and brought their problems with them, almost costing Roman the fight  Usos don't have titles anymore  They will be berated  Roman will gaslight them with "All the things I've done for you and you are still a failure"  Jey will pull the "you would've lost the titles long ago without us. It's the other way around. You would be nothing without us." card at some point  Roman will set out to prove them wrong and lose at Summerslam  Roman will hit rock bottom and get unhinged on the bloodline  Ending the bloodline at Wrestlemania
My back hurts watching that
👏 **RICK**  👏 **O**  👏 **SHEA**
Idgaf what anybody says, I had a good feeling about this match and Ricochet and Ivar are putting on an amazing fucking match on smackdown rn
Ricochet’s shoot-star always gets a pop from me.
Sorry KO and Sami, but it’s time to………   SPLIT THOSE FUCKING TITLES!
sarah logan got some powerful feet
Trips is booking the show 2nite lads.
Sami is such a nice guy
KO in a Bruno shirt, taunting Roman.   "You've gone through hell just for almost 1000 days, ain't no way you and the Bloodline will survive 2000."
raquels back pose is so important to me
Sami's chemistry with the bloodline was off the chart. his chemistry with Owen's' ironically makes this seem like a middle school play
The Sami / Kevin dynamic is always great to watch
Is the Jey and Sami (forbidden) bromance still somehow possible?
Is there a focus group or something that told them this chick flexing her back dimples is appealing?
https://preview.redd.it/ntt36m6smlsa1.jpeg?width=812&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=55215cb5104b737670d4529cef1e7790fb1b8e85  Raquel every time she makes an entrance
I really wish they would just ditch Rachel's back pose basically back gimmick
Before people start wondering why Raquel and Liv are the Number 1 Contenders, Shayna got hurt at Mania, sooooooo change of plans, pal.
Whole gimmick is having a back. Nice
Help me suspend my disbelief that Jimmy hasn't called Jey yet, especially after that last segment
Such a shame that the Tank didn’t make a Mania appearance.
Shotzi needs to give hornswoggle his tank back.
So Sami wins, Solo comes out and murders Jey. Sami makes the save and we set the final act of The Bloodline in motion?
HHH will announce that LA Knight will be shouting YEAH into the faces of each individual fan throughout the course of evening
I hate that, ballsy baddies?
Bruh is Natalya face or heel? Does she herself even know?
Putting Liv, who has buckets of charisma and personality, next to Raquel really exposes how she has nothing going on character wise
What are we doing with this extended Lita title reign in 2023, I love her as much as anybody but it just seems so strange
Imagine working your entire life to get to the WWE, only for you to be known as just "Erik."
Shotzi has a lot of charisma, but bless her heart she can't wrestle
HE'S ALIVE  YEAH
YEAHH
L A KNIGHT!
HES HERE. PAPA H GOT US
THERE HE IS BOYS  #YEAH
Lol I just let out a YEAHHHH
Damn. Snapped a good PS5 controller.  YEAH!
yeah
The people champion, YEA!
YEAH
Yo he snapped the fuck out of that controller
Bad advertising for the PlayStation controller huh
HHH got that post coffee where's the bathroom walk pace going. He's ready.
Xavier with the ol “if he wasn’t holding me back” move there
Triple H is a fucking unit.
HEY THOSE CONTROLLERS ARE EXPENSIVE
Naw LA Knight would have to see me during the commercial break. That's a 70 dollar controller bro.
Damn LA those things are expensive
GODDAMITT HUNTER DON'T LEAVE YOUR CHAIR!!!!!1!
LA Rage Quit
L.A. Knight, the Gamer Hunter.
those ps5 controllers aren't cheap! I'd be mad too
HEY!  ONLY AJ STYLES IN FITS OF MADDEN CREATED ANGER CAN BREAK CONTROLLERS AND GET AWAY WITH IT!!!
You already know Xavier got back on that game, made himself a 99 overall, then beat LA Knight to a pulp in a Extreme Rules match
Halfway through the night and just seeing LA Knight gets the biggest pop by a lot
Please let HHH's announcement be a draft
HHH ready to tell the world that the WWE ain’t going anywhere again.
I hope he's announcing the return of Tout
Everytime they announce a Triple H promo I'm afraid he's gonna say he's leaving
I mean, HHH is about to say the same shit but on a different channel, not getting my hope up
Expect a very MID announcement coming from Triple H during the middle of Tonight’s Smackdown
"I sent the old man packing"  ![gif](giphy|l0NwNrl4BtDD7JCx2)
Chant “fire Vince” lmao
Let’s get this over with H, I’ve got LA Knight to see.
Triple H will announce that he's starting his own line of air fryers called Helmsley's Fryers. He'll demonstrate one in the ring and show how it melts all of the fat off chicken and helps get athletes into tip top shape. Then Ryback will return and vouch for the fryer and its benefits as the crowd chants *"Feed Me More".*
Business Triple H doesn’t use “The Game” theme I guess
#MAINEVENTKNIGHT
Gotta milk this entrance for all its worth.
Hunter: Honey, WHERE IS MY ~~WRESTLING GEAR~~ WATER BOTTLE?
He looks… emotional?
YALL A BUNCH A PUPPETS
Now for the last time! Nothing has changed!
I know he isn’t about to do this again
It’s really gonna be the same shit
Yep same speech😭😭😭
It's the same promo
Wow this WrestleMania thing seems legit
He called it Wrestlemania THIRTY NINE  No way Vince is there
Cool I’m glad you guys made money
YES BOY THE DRAFT IS BACK
I thought he was going to promote backlash LOL
DRAFT = Cuts
Are the brands even split?
im signing up for the draft bois 🫡🪖
Off topic, but I really hope LA Knight gets more time on the mic tonight     And also win
Why would I care about a draft when it's never enforced or means anything? I hope there's more to this announcement.
Why a draft when they is no brand exclusivity?
Classic Roman  "Draft Dodger" Reigns
Trips being the hype man for the heel factions
Rhea “Should have gotten 5 stars” Ripley
Draft after Mania makes way more sense than right before Survivor Series
Melo getting Drafted to Raw baby 🎯
So NXT is getting picks as well then
Judgement Day is definitely gonna be on Smackdown now with the draft
Crying in the ring, Charlotte giving her props, and HHH bringing her out.    You can only keep her heel for so much longer
This promo could have been an email.
So does Raw still get first pick like previous drafts? Because surely there's no way they don't pick Roman in kayfabe?
Finn being one of the few Triple H will always Too Sweet to is one of my favorite things.
Draft Vince to aew
Drafting Connor from UFC to SmackDown so he can be fed to the Tribal Chief
I absolutely love that Dom and Priest got handshakes and he two sweeted Finn. That’s one of his favorite kids for sure 🥹
Trips hit Finn with a nice lil Too Sweet
Finn was in the cell with a torn calf and a split up head
I love it when Finn and Triple H too sweet each other
Rhea and the Wrestlemania losers
He gave Finna a 🤘
Lol Finns back after getting killed 5 days ago
I feel like the draft here is going to signify a strong brand split again, like 2016 style.
Finn rocking the Simple Jack cut
Judgement Day is such an interesting faction because I don’t know whether at any moment Dom, Finn or Rhea is the leader of it lol   I think it’s Rhea
You show some respect for an ex-con!
Fucking heat. Lol
Rhea is gonna have to fight a bag of dogs to get the crowd to boo her
Booing Dominik will NEVER get old
Dom being the most hated heel in the company is hilarious
Doms heat is special man 😂
Fucking hell Dom has got nuclear heat
NUCLEAR HEAT
Holy fuck. I can’t even hear him. This kid has HEAT.
YOOOOO, you can’t hear Dom! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Damn, Dom heat is actually insane!
LOL goddamn Dom
The heat dom has is delicious
Good lord that is deafening
This is Roman after Mania 33 Heat
This is epic heat. Dom is amazing.
They just kept getting louder. That was amazing
Alright Damian now you talk about your WM match
Junker Queen really owes her whole style to Rhea
Dom hitting puberty
Lmao Dom. Kids done a great job
this is beautiful
🤣🤣🤣🤣 fuck I love dom now
Dom's getting more heat than Roman did at Mania.
The heat this guy gets is incredible
That’s a heels dream reaction wow
he wants to smile so badly being booed
Man, when's the last time someone had heat like Dom does?
The Sun is jealous of this heat
COLE CORPSING???
LOL at Rhea Ripley feeding Dominik his lines.
This motherfucker's over.
The reactions Dom gets is amazing
It’s amazing how Dom became the hottest heel in the company.
Holy shit NUCLER IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT
Balor is trying so hard not to laugh at the crowd booing.
Nuclear Heat
🔥Dom🔥
Even his mustache is annoying!
The audible laugh by Cole makes it so much better
Dominic is so over insane
Only way he could get more heat if he makes fun of Seattle not having a basketball team
Lmao this is great he’s getting drowned out
This is some great heat. Dom has really turned it around in the last year
1 year ago I never would have imagined Dom being as over as he is. He’s growing for sure. And he’s grown on me. Judgement day is the best thing to happen to Dom
Fuck that, this is Thermonuclear heat!
If I were a heel hearing boos like that I’d be grinning ear to hear. Better that then getting silence.
This is like Owens in Seattle boos or Roman the night after beating Undertaker at Mania boos
Dom is such a snivelling little fucker, like his biological dad Eddie
The Fire Dom chants are crazy!!!!!
Oh this is great.  Rey gotta be proud. Dom getting that nuclear heat
Someone please translate I cheated my way through highschool Spainish all I know is "donde esta la biblioteca"
Dom > MJF
Rey has some serious problems for trying to seriously harm his own son. Man has no shame
I don’t even think Dom was ready for that level of heat that he has
Dom's heat is next level
If I was a heel who loved being booed, I'd be jealous of Ex-Con Dom's heat. That's just some beautiful boos.
Dom became public enemy number one, prison changes a man.
what kind of father puts his hands on his own child??  Do not withhold discipline from a child; if you punish them with the rod, they will not die.  Proverbs 23:13
The teardrop tattoo moves a little each week
The heat for Dom lmaooo. He’s so good.
Dominik looks like Hector Bellerin on trt
I love celebrities that want to be on the show. Bunny probably had the time of his life being slammed into the table.
dom has unreal levels of heel heat holy shit
That bad bunny segment was actually awesome
Oh my goodness Zelina
"Y'know, there's a Spanish word that I'm thinking of right now..."  Does it start with a P?
Damien Priest is so fucking cool bro
They better not split up Dom and Rhea in the draft
The LWO lives!!
Zelina's gear 👀👀
We gonna need that LWO theme, fam.
lWo being featured is a good sign
Zelina looks fire!
Once Damian Priest’s wrestling career is done, he can find easy work in Voice Acting, if he wanted.
I want Damien Priest to be pushed to the moon!
Dom stay this great please
Smack down has been the main good show for awhile, though NXT has some really killer matches lately.
Fuck cancer!
Something tells me that if Jey doesnt solve the Sami problem tonight, Jey becomes the problem for Solo to solve. Im ready Tribal Chief
Michael Cole was like yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 💀
Dom probably still has flashbacks every time he sees a bowl of Cinnamon Toast Crunch
Find somebody who loves you as much as Michael Cole hates Dominik challenge  (Impossible)
Barrett > McAfee imo
Priest and Dom are gonna main event Backlash. That makes me happy.
“Having his way with his dad”.
Santos can go btw
Is Santos Escobar Phantasma's kid?
New Evil Dead? I am so there.
This episode has a real house show energy to it so far, and I’m loving it.
Cool to see the LWO, it’s gonna be a shame when Santos turns heel on Rey.
Santos Escobar with a nice tribute to legendary mexican wrestler Canek. Fun fact Canek had a match with Andre in the 80s way before WrestleMania 3 where he slammed Andre.
Ready for a Santos Escobar title run
Chad never calls his mother?! Mr. T’s not gonna like that.
I feel so conflicted about AA.   On the one hand, they’re on every show, get a promo and match most shows, got a match at Wrestlemania which Gable was a highlight of, and even got put on a commercial. HHH obviously knows what he has and they’re treated very well. If you pay attention you can see how HEAVILY featured they are as non main eventers.  But on the other hand I just wish they would win sometimes 😭
Priest reminds me of Ministry Taker
Chad Gable needing a nightlight is the manifestation of his guilt for not calling his mother
Man I hope they give the LWO a little more backstage segment time in the future
Rey is playing WWE 2K23 in real life by beating his kid!
"The LWO started by the legendary Eddie Guerrero back in the WCW days"  \*Somewhere in Connecticut, Vince McMahon starts to twitch\*
I still can’t believe how improved Dom is.
I love they keep on taking about Rey being anti-LWO in 1998.
Someone get a side by side comparison of Rey’s hurricarana there and litas 😂
Rey is still moving like a young man. Still amazed by it.
Ripley/Zelina would be a decent title match for Backlash.
Honestly wouldn’t mind seeing the judgement day get one of the tag titles in a couple of months
I thought I heard a fire Vince chant but it was just a guy selling hot dogs
I love Zelina and would love to see her vs Rhea at Backlash
“You all can get it” it’s not that kind of show Damien 😲
Can we stop pinning Santos please? Fuck, build the future. Rey doesn't need protecting.
lol they're gonna have Miz lose again. Gg Riddle
Make The Miz Raw GM
SHINSUKE
That SummerSlam logo is fire.
Oh shit Nakamura is back
Shinsuke back?
YES! THE KING HATH RETURNED!
Finally Shinsuke is back
And they're making his return a big deal...push ahead?
yessssss i hope this is the start of a revival of Shin's WWE run
Nakamura is back Baby
Where is LA Knight Vs Xavier Woods?
Give me tweener Nak Vs Tweener LA Knight fued
LETS GOO THE KINGS COMING HOME
WOW, this main event is getting a bunch of time. Love it
BELIEVE IN HIM JEY, BELIEVE HIM
OH MY GOD KEVIN
KO ded
What in the Nancy Kerrigan hell 😂
damn caught KO lacking
Vince's correction to this show: say "crumbling" no less than 15 times.
KO gonna get sent to the glue factory.
Triple H is back in the seat.
Awwww Sonuvabitch, did you see the way Jey was looking on lmao he knew what time it was
You can't save someone who doesn't want to be saved Sami.  E-40 taught us that
In kayfabe, why isn’t Solo arrested?
KO deserved that for murdering Ezekiel tbh
Jey Uso is not 242.  Lol.
Jey about to get pushed again.
Sami - states facts  Jey - thinks about it  Sami - I'll just beat you again  Jey - Fuck this dude
MAIN EVENT JEY!!!
Main event Jey is back
New gear for Main Event Jey Uso.
excuse me? 242lbs??? but Solo is 215??
Notice how Jey doesn't seem to care that Jimmy isn't there? I wonder why that is.
Jey looks like such a damn star
Why did you tease my loins with promise of LA Knight, only to not deliver the goods?
Anyone gamble on the USFL?   SEEK HELP.
Sami should approach this as if he was seated at HBK's favorite table. And then have a glorious 11 month love affair, man on man, that Jey shall never forget. Their bodies intertwined as one, and from the beauty of Morocco, to the French Riviera, to the snorkeling in the Galopagos, Sami and Jey shall make glorious gay love to each other on six of the seven continents. Then out of nowhere stab Jey in the back and refuse to give the Uso a rematch
Damn NFL, USFL, and XFL. I thought wrestling was oversaturated lol
LA Knight better pick up that dub next week  I say that, but watch Big E return and give Xavier the boost to pull through lol
Mike's Harder? Good for him.
If anyone has LA Knight then I know Wade Barrett has him 💯❤️
Main event jey looks legit
Kevin's being flown to a local medical facility.
For a second I thought he forgot his belts lol
I was about to ask why he wasn’t wearing the titles… nevermind lol
LA KNIGHT NEXT WEEK!!! YEEEAAH!
Praying LA KNIGHT escapes the most dangerous move in all of sports entertainment next week.
Why am I getting Bret vs owen vibes right now for Sami zayn vs jey uso
I swear Solo may kill the whole bloodline. Heyman can easily be in his ear too.
I’m thinking jey isn’t gonna want any cheating and solo won’t listen/or attack jey
I like the insinuation. "Sami's outnumbered and his partner is injured, how badly he's going to get beat up? Find out after the break!"
Cole calling him Main Event Jey. Nice.
Is Jey saying naughty words?
Wonder if the new outfit and no Jimmy by his side is preparing for the eventual Jey singles run.
Idc if everyone kicks out of it the Blue Thunder Bomb gets me every time
Solo does a really good job at just standing there....menacingly.
Maybe don't swear multiple times on camera, Jey?
Sami's Blue Thunder pin covers are getting better. A little while back he only put a hand on the tum-tum
Love blue thunder bomb
can we get one pinfall victory with the Blue Thunder Bomb please?
sami setting up for the helluva kick looks so similar to hbk with sweet chin music
Jey called Sami a silly doodooface.
This makes me wish we got a Sami vs Jey solo PPV match so badly
Jey's winning this imo.
I bet Solo has watched hours of tape on Taz and Lance Storm to get his arm fold correct
Boooooo
I’m still really happy that the Samoan Spike by Solo has been sold as 100% of effective as of now
Solo Sikoa has been The Bloodline's ace in the hole since his arrival. They'd be kind of screwed if it weren't for him.
BE THE HERO YOU WERE DESTINED TO BE, JEY!!!
Samoan style = interfering in the same way for months on end
Bro they keep playing with us
Ok. That was a good swerve.
GOT DAMMIT JEY STOP TEASING ME THAT YOU'RE GOING TO TURN FACE!!!!
Riddle saving Sami? I’m all for it!
not on my bingo card but I'll take it
Did Matt Riddle lose his first name again?
Jey just exists to break my heart on weekly basis
Riddle and my youngest son have the same underoos
This would’ve worked a lot better if Riddle had come back today.
This show has genuinely been really good. Feels like the greatest thing ever after that raw
Jey’s first singles win since July 2021 over Rey Mysterio
Trips:"you're just doing a run in at the end, you'd didn't need to put your gear on"  Riddle:"Gear?"
The Riddle/Sami comedy is gonna be amazing
Beautiful way to incorporate Riddle
I can't do short trunks with no knee pads OR boots. Riddle looks ridiculous lmao
Can’t wait for Roman & Solo vs. The Usos.
This is like when you play Universe in WWE 2k and keep rivalries on random
Riddle can fuckin go in the ring man, better believe
This should have been Riddle's return, not the half baked one we got Monday (pun fully intended)
I was not expecting Riddle to make the save but I honestly fuck with it
I think the dynamic between Riddle/Sami/Kevin is going to be a lot of fun!
If HHH leaves Gorilla, Vince will sneak up and steal his seat so he’s leaving his promo as late as possible
While the Sheamus vs Gunther stuff is very good, it feels like the Feud between these two groups has been going on for years.
I’d be up for another Brawling Brutes vs Imperium extreme rules match down the line.
Valhalla approached the table and whispers into Wade's ear. He nods, quietly. She leaves. "What did she say?" Michael asks.  "She said vaccines killed Jesus and burped and apologized."
THIS IS HOW HE’S GONNA SPLIT THE BELTS
Dom is fucking nuclear lmao
Dom has so much heat, this is great!
Zelina’s husband may be a satanist, but she is proof that God is good
Yo this is another level on this story now. Haha damn. They really are cooking filet mignon
Please lord don’t let the bad man hurt me anymore 😭
Yet another BANGER in a series of BANGER after BANGER after BANGER
There is no need to "switch gears to Monday night RAW"
We were given a good match, now we must pay by being reminded of Raw
#LOOK AT MY BACK  LOOK AT IT!!!
Wtf was the point of all that?
Other than a few little things here and there tonight I am becoming more convinced that Vince is running RAW and Triple H has Smackdown.
Going to be crazy when it's revealed KO has been the wise man by wearing a Paul Heyman mask all along
Prayer circle for Smackdown yall, see if it RAW like
C’mon we don’t need another Mania recap
If I hear this song again I will pass out
Mania feels like months ago because of all the drama lol
It has been a long 4 days. Forgot WM was last weekend. Hahahaha
Awesome to hear Hollywood Swinging again. (probably for the last time)
It doesn't feel like this is the first Smackdown after Wrestlemania
mania feels so long ago already for me
I just want a good show tonight to prove Monday was a one off. NXT was great, so I’m hopeful.
This show can't possibly be as bad as Raw was, right? ...right???? *huffs copium*
What’s wrestlemania? I’ve never heard of it before? I sure hope they recap everything from me because I was born yesterday
FIRE VINCE CHANTS HERE WE GO!
It was a great wrestlemania over all
Triple H hopefully coming out to Pedigree Vince through the announce table and announce that he's been kicked out of the company by Endeavor.
After watching that TikTok about how these are made so quick... Massive respect for the video package team 👏👏
I've got 5 bucks on hhh saying we ain't going anywhere again
I was happy I wasn't the four people that had to follow Charlotte/Rhea Saturday night.
Please show the rubber chicken
Kicking it off with a match?? Notch that to Triple H guys. We need a counter
aw i was hoping they would just hurry up and get the triple h speech over with
Ok Cole, blink twice if Vince is in your earpiece.
As a major pyro fan, I've noticed they haven't had opening pyro in over a month...I hope we're not going back to the dark times of limited pyro of the mid 2010s
I WAS TOLD THERE WOULD BE THE MAN OF THREE H'S STARTING THE SHOW BY THANKING ME AND BRINGING OUT MAX DUPRI.
![gif](giphy|tIR1jC7GYCXgnMNilj|downsized)
Oh man I wanted to see what HHH said then go to bed, the bastards got me
That photoshop job on Sami lmao
I feel like they’re trolling now with “change of plans” and us nerds are eating it up
Samantha 🔥
When all else fails, send out the brawling brutes imperium six man tag!
LWO on the show. Yup HHH is back. Lmao
My champ, all hail Gunther
Imperiums entrance is so good
Ludwig Kaiser is my favorite underrated wrestler in the company
Not the where’s bayley sign 🙈
So Triple H must know tonight will be a good show so he’ll get cheered when he comes out later
I wonder who challenges Gunther next
Those people can’t see behind the two dudes in the front row lmao they’re like leaning to the right to see
I’d be good with a Sheamus/Gunther IC title match at Backlash.
Im so curious if this Trips thing is gonna be a “card subject to change” thing or if he’s actually got something real to say
Anything with Gunther is a good way to start the night
Ridges neck is huge
That *chop*, goodness
Looks like Gunther has put on some more muscle.
Great match so far
They should just wrestle every week
i love the Brawling Brutes. each guy fulfills their role to perfection.
This crowd is red hot
Banger status: after
That was an awesome Brouge Kick spot.
BANGER AFTER BANGER
Gunther wasn't taking more than 10 beats tonight
These 6 are always beating the shit out of each other. I don't think they have ever had a bad match.
Really great opener.
they better pull the fucking trigger on Sheamus at MITB
Noooo I don’t want to remember raw
I love these six together
Undertaker plushie? Let’s go?
the angry villagers have put away the pitchforks and torches until after Triple H speaks
They may as well just pencil Sheamus in for the Roman match at MITB.
They definitely know how to do a recap
Every time I get over this, they decide to show it again, and I get re-pissed off.
Too many recaps but at least they could make a dog pissing on the side of the road look like a serious event.
We want answers Brock
it still makes no fucking sense for brock to attack cody like that
Ooh yes! Kayla and Heyman!
Cody Rhodes pinning Brock Lesnar clean would do wonders for him right?
That's a stupid reason for Brock to beat up Cody lol
Brock you ungrateful man. You got the privilege of beating that pesky LA traffic.
Brock upset he went on first? Come on at least give us a believable reason!
Heyman is a natural treasure
This is already better than Raw last week. By a lot.
Heyman definitely made a deal with Brock
Vince may not be backstage but he's in their ears I bet lol
oh roman is setting up jey to fail by not letting jimmy be out there with him
Solo is giving me flashbacks to my Dad when I struck out 3 times in little league
Yup jey is losing, I think.
Jimmy not there? This ain't Canada.
I'm not liking that look is Solo's eyes
Apprehensive yeet
Solo backstabbing jey tonight ?
Solo staring daggers jesus christ lol
.... no strowman?  They were a great tag team.  Are we just pretending it's gone?
Basically, Jimmy got that ass beat.
Ivar main event push incoming?
Damn Solo staring a hole right through Ucey
Hyped as FUCK for Sami vs Jey after that segment
Damn Braun doesn't have his back? Fake ass friends I tell you
This is like when Voldemort tasked Draco Malfoy to kill Dumbledore expecting him to fail to punish Lucius
The air Jordan and Foreman Grill both got movies made.
Vince would be on tv every week if the average fan hated him as much as we do. He would think it was good heat
this match is the only change Vince made, by the way. (Was supposed to be Braun/Ricochet vs. Viking Raiders originally)
Everyone can relax, valhalla is here
Seems like a lot of guys are getting the night off. Roman, Drew, Erik, Braun, Jimmy, maybe KO?
Have these guys won a single match ever
Ricochet just died
that was very violent holy hell lmao
Friday commentary desk is far superior
*Ricochet begins to lift*  "Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me?"  *Ricochet's back fucks off*  "Yep."
God I fucking hate the tease of a slo mo replay then the normal speed on impact. Just show it one speed or the other.
Man these wrestlers are crazy a man the size of Richocet lifting the man the size of Ivar. My lower back hurts just watching
I actually really like Ivar's work tbh
I love how Ivar will catch you off-guard with how quick and agile he is.
Ivar not going down after jumping into the dropkick was cool.
Huh, Vince isn't directing this.
Rick O Shea!
Ricochet is just awesome wish they do more with him
I feel like ricochet winning gives me hope vince isn’t having too much sway into tonight
KO like "...which one do we vacate?"
Man if ricochet could just polish up his mic skills he’d be one of the absolute best in the game rn
Damn Ivar can't be losing to Ricochet, he's my Super Heavyweight champ in 2k23.
Here's my prediction: Solo gonna start a beatdown on Jey and Sami is gonna help save him
Wonder if there’s plans to split the tag titles
Why would it be over if Sami beats Jey? We're just forgetting about Roman?
KO is worse than Roman, we’ll talk about it another time.
RomiZayn and Jeyliet
It’s interesting how Sami’s hair looks a lot less disheveled now that he’s a face.
Of course as soon as I tune in to check out if it’s worth my time it’s Sami and KO on.  Just when I thought I was out…
BACK TIME!
This probably would work much better as a in-ring promo
Jey still needs you, Sami.
My Sami sense is tingling
Just want NXT Raquel back man.
Nah that was pretty good, tho the crowd doesn't care for the Raiders, it's also nice to see to see Ricochet get a win.  Meanwhile, Sami doesn't thinks the job is done because Jey is still in the gang.
Call me crazy but give me Raquel vs Rhea
Turns out I need an advice giving Kevin Owens in my life
Raquel goddamn 😯
Love me the weekly Liv match. They're using her in a very smart manner. She's become a mainstay in the mid-card and it's great because they've built her up really well and a lot of people want to watch her.
 Are they not the ballsy baddies
Unless trips goes on dead last after main event, I can't imagine him having anything new to say other than a re-write of Mondays reassurance promo.
Cole: you should’ve been there
My thoughts are: Solo is def gonna takeout Sami & Jey, with KO coming for the save… which will lead to Sami convincing KO that Jey & Jimmy need saving like KO did for Sami
Ballsy baddies…that's not their team name is it?
Nothing makes for great TV like telling people they missed a moment in commercial break, Cole
Cringe
Such cringe 🥲
Shotzi 💚🖤
so I guess the WrestleMania match had literally ZERO stakes if they're still trying to win a title shot
Due to budget cuts, WWE is going to have Tank Ledger from NXT Level Up carry Natalya and Shotzi to the ring.
That inset promo.... yikes
I have never seen this ref in my life? Is he one of the debuts we were waiting for?
Huh… I guess green shirt guy needed a break
UpUpDownDown: SmackDown Edition.
Why’d Liv and Raquel ditch the matching gear?
LA Knight POP!!
Yeahhhhh
YEAH!
YEAH
Look at the pythons on La Knight
Y E A H
YES! OUR PRAYERS HAVE BEEN ANSWERED! THE MEGASTAR!!!
Oh damn LA! those are $60s controllers!!
THE GAME UH
I'm so confused. Didn't Shayna and Rousey win the tag showcase? Why are Liv and Raquel the contenders?
Don't mess with Austin Creed's video games
I like xavier when he is serious
Not cool, Knight.  Do you have any idea how much it costs to get a new PS5 controller?
In kayfabe there was nothing stopping la knight  from coming out at Wrestlemania lol
Heel move. Those are the price of a new game. 😡
H not in gorilla. Vince confirmed!
L.A. KNIGHT THOSE CONTROLLERS ARE EXPENSIVE!!!
Not the Ps5 controller!
Give the people LA Knight.
HHH announcement: Somehow, Vince returned
Don't get in the way Woods  Yeah!
LA Knight is SO OVER   PUSH THIS MAN
…Nevermind let’s go Xavier!
Is he an 80s bully now?  I guess LA Knight stands for Johnny Lawrence Knight.
If LA Knight keeps this up I don't think Hugh Jessel is gonna be invited back to Up Up Down Down
LA Knight is going to get attacked like that teacher over a Switch
give emma a chance
Hunter: *heads out for the ring*  Vinnie Mac: **I’M BACK, PAL!**  Cole: 😧
Something something, Not Going anywhere, something something
LA Knight is the most over guy in smackdown and instead of having him cut 15 mins promo, they put him in a feud with Xavier woods!
my college roommate Jonny destroyed a few 360 controllers when Halo 3 came out our freshman year, but don't think he ever turned one into a pretzel
ON YOUR KNEES DOUG
HHH 🔥
Triple H is part of damage control  Get it??
Imagine he just calls Roman out and wins the titles.
Madcap Moss's new gimmick is "guy who plays 2K backstage".  On TEW, would that be a comedy gimmick?
ON YOUR KNEES DOG  King of kings is such a hype song
![gif](giphy|Ar4p9QqSHP1ZVESeNo|downsized)
If he literslly says the same thing as Monday I’m gonna be pisses
Just crotch chopped my tv
did they always refer to HHH as Hall of famer? or CCO?
Papa Haitch addresses his enem....father in law
Sell us the dog and pony, Paul, but I ain't buying. :/
“Where’s Bayley?” sign in the front row. Asking the right questions
I can’t hear this song anymore without hearing Jim Johnston singing it in the demo version lol
God I love HHH
Cole pointing out he runs this place now.
Running this place
There you go cole confirmed it! Trips is running this place!
SaveUsHHH
gotta say haven't seen Trip in a bit, he looks good.
Is it my tv or is he really red?!
![gif](giphy|S9crjCfQXC78ST61iv|downsized)
Exact same promo as Monday. Im out
He called us Gross, im booing him.
Uhhhhh let’s get readyyyyyy to suck itttt
I feel like we’re in an investors call.
Lmao the draft
DRAFT IS COMING
HE DID IT LMAO. HE DID IT. HAHAHAHAHA.
Please return to the old style draft 🙏🏻
"As great as WrestleMania was we all know how dogshit Monday was"
The draft! Think he was supposed to announce this Monday?
Oh that’s a change from Monday…
They still do drafts? Or maybe I don’t remember last years
If they’re going to do a draft, does that mean we don’t have to have so much crossover between the brands?
Vince McMahon is about to attack him from Behind, and set up a WWE on a Pole match
People hoping he's gonna come down here and borderline drag Vince behind him to cap him in the ring on live tv. He is not going to address Monday or Vince folks.
Hes getting red by the minute...I hope he's okay
Vince is going to return via draft
I don't mind a draft but it becomes irrelevant after 2 weeks lol.
A draft with no GMs for the different brands? What's the fun in that?
As long as GUNTHER doesn't leave Smackdown....
Man I'd love if this year's Draft people can get drafted to NXT
Isn't every superstar available in every draft? As far as I recall the only exception was 2002 when Taker was Undisputed Champion.
Draft is so stupid since they never pay attention to the brands as being separate anyways
This should have been the announcement on Monday
Isn't every superstar available for every single draft? Sounds like a normal draft to me.
HHH putting over Rhea like a proud papa
TOO SWEET
A problem with the drafts is like in a month or so they always show up on either show. Hopefully this time they actually stick to it
Considering his head exploded only 5 days ago, Finn's looking pretty good.
I bet they split Jimmy and Jey
welllll  atleast hes still here i guess  and more wrestling in smackdown than raw.. nice
Rhea Ripley the de facto leader of Judgement Day
I love cenobite Priest
he did the handshake!
Damian Priest is cool af
Triple H 2-sweeting Finn >>>
TOO SWEET
It’s funny that Rhea seems pretty over with the fans, at the same time as she is paired with a classic shitbag heel with some of the most nuclear heat in the company
I popped for HHH and Finn hitting the “Too Sweet”
Hopefully the draft means they actually are exclusive to their show and it’s not pointless but man am I Hype!
I'm getting tired of seeing HHH announce and shake the hands of heels. It really annoys me lol
The Cerebral ~~Assassin~~ Australian
Handshake to everyone but too sweet for Finn
Rhea must be one of the many superstars who’s praying Vince stays the fuck away
Rhea Ripley, leader of the Judgement Day. As she should be.
Rhea and Finn with the J’s
Somehow Kenny Omega gets drafted to raw
DOM HAS A MIC
I love Rhea
Rhea vs Roman book it
GreatEST?
Still can't believe Finn lost. That Coup de Table should've been it
Watch them play fast and loose with the rules and draft The Bloodline or Judgment Day with one pick.   She put some emphasis on greatEST.
Booooooo get out of here dom
Would've liked if the newly crowned Women's Champion got her own promo
Dom looking like his real Papi
The difference between Rhea when they're trying to get Charlotte cheered and Rhea when she's allowed to just be herself is night-and-day.
Dom still gets nuclear heat
Dom getting that uber heat
Sheeeeeeesh Dom
Dom is indeed getting the Eddie stache
Damn Finn. At least even that shit out. That looks terrible
Yep, Dom still has nuclear heat lmao
Finn's hairline is all fucked lmao
Lmao. Can't even hear him over the boos.
WWE: Everyone rises for Mami  AEW: Members of the House of Black, rise.  Wonder if there's a link.... hmmmmmmm lol (not actually upset or anything, I think it's cute if that was intentional for Rhea and Buddy)
That's some real heat, brother
Dom is getting that KO/Elias segment heat!
Dom is getting "Elias and KO in Seattle" heat by *saying words*
Damn that Dom heat
Dom with the epic heel reaction
Dom getting white noised
MANNNNN DOMMMMMM HAS HEATTTTTTTT
Dom getting so much heat holy fuck
I love this crowd
HOLY BOOS
I've literally never heard heat like this
Cole PLEADING with us to stop booing
Love this heat man, this is awesome
Holy shit, is Dom the most over guy in the company right now? He’s killing it!
Wow, that’s some heat
Dom is a heat machine holy
Dom is the biggest heel in WWE.
Oh they hate him and I love it
I CANNOT HEAR HIM 😭
Now that is some serious heat.
“Oh please stop booing” lmao
Cole or Barrett fucking laughed lmaoo this is great
Finn is enjoying this
Omg these guys are having so much fun I love it. It’s so rare to see people getting boo’s for the right reasons these days
Oh my god they hate his fucking ass
The heat!
This crowd is hot I love it
DOM RULES
Bro Don’s promos about Rey being a bad father always make me laugh too much.
The last time someone had this kind of heat in WWE Elias and KO were burying the Sonics in Seattle. Dom is RED HOT right now
Wow Dom is getting mad heat
Wade’s laughing his ass off in the background 🤣
Lol went from cheering for Rhea to straight boos for Dom
Not gonna happen but omg give myboi Dom the MITB, he would be perfect for a big briefcase run
Dom is SO fucking good
Dom's facial hair makes him a better heel.
Dom is the best thing in WWE right now lol
Feels like dom is more hated now than ever
I can't wait for this man to win a money in the bank.
The heat for Dom is overheating my projector lmao
Dominic is about a 0.8 on the Vickie heat scale.  What an absolutely wonderful, chicken shit heel.
I don’t think Cena could even get reactions like this rn. Zayn and Reigns are mad over but I think Dom might be surpassing their heat
Shit Dom switched to Spanish lmao.
Dom is as hated as Rey is loved
Bad bunny sold that chokeslam like a professional
Nuclear Heat Dom.
Dom is legit the most hated heel in wrestling lmao
That was amazing. Great crowd! Never heard that much heat before!
This guy is the definition of a true heel. He might not have the same ring technician as the GOAT, but i see shades of heel Eddie in Dom
Bunny ate the HELL out of that table bump
Dom has to be the biggest heel in pro wrestling right now, even MJF and Roman don't get the heat he does.
I didn't want to hit my father!!! LOL   Dominik is gold
Again, shoutout to Bad Bunny for taking a bump like that.
Ok guys, please help me out hear, is the crowd reaction 100% genuine or did they play sounds trough the speakers? Because if its genuine i dont remember the last time I heard such an insane reaction, wow! Not even roman gets booed this much i feel like, god I love Dom!
I love how Rey is still so fluid at the 619. The man looks right at home amidst the ropes.
Everyone in judgement day is a piece of shit 👍
Has there ever been a stable of both heel and faces like Judgement Day?
I'm still reeling after how much the crowd was booing Dominic
Lol Zelina WTF you got on your head girl
Badly Beaten Bunny
I'm really gonna miss this group dynamic if the draft breaks them up
The fuck has zelina got on?
Never thought Priest would be the weakest link in JD.
Flashbacks to my white ass asking my parents to get me an LWO shirt back in the WCW days and being turned down lol. We compromised and I got a Kidman shirt instead.
Hope Judgement Day is still a stable after the draft
**PUT LdF/LWO OVER FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!**
I guess they’re still allowed to say LWO lol
Cool LWO wasn't a one time thing
Zelina Vega woah :0
Fucking awesome seeing a LWO stable
Guess they just told them to go out there, that promo wasn't setting it up for a match at all.
So we’re learning that as long as Vince isn’t in the building, the shows will most likely be a good time.
They should build up a LWO vs bloodline feud.
I get it, broadcast network, big contract, etc... Just wish they'd put half the effort into Raw as they do SmackDown.
Given Rey's resistance to join the original LWO, shouldn't they be turning on him and having Dom as their leader? Maybe the draft will yield something that leads there.
I love Michael Cole’s hate for Dom.
Cole actively hating Dom is so entertaining
I don’t know what people mean when they say “gorilla” and at this point I’m too afraid to ask
Cole is roasting Dom. Hahahaha
Dom needs to get a restraining order for Michael Cole
Wonder if Bunny is going to get Priest one on one.  Cause this match would make Rey and Bad Buffy vs Dominik and Damien less special
MICHAEL COLE SAYING ENOUGH TO WADE HAHAHAHA
Dom has the crowd  eating out his hand
Cole is going full-blown “put that ancient sex pest back screaming in my one good ear I fucking dare you”
Cole wishing he could get back in the ring and fight Dom
LWO isn't complete until they lure El Generico out of retirement
Santos Escobar belly shirt era
The lucha libre community
I hate commercials
I can’t buy Zelina as a babyface imo
this lwo revival is incredible
Evil Dead Rise looks to have the same horror mixed with comedy I love
Santos Escobar to win King of the Ring
Love the alpha academy snickers commercial
Why shouldn’t Escobar be a face? All he wanted to do was smoke cigars and wrestle with his amigos.
Rey always getting his gang to beat up Dom and his friends. 🥺
Are they LWO or are they Legado Del Fantasma? Or both?
Which is more intense:   Coles hatred for Daniel Bryan in NXT season 1?   Or   Coles hatred for Dom?
Me: Oh, the USFL. Who's my local team? NJ Generals. Neat, do they play in Met-Life Stadium? Nope, they play in Ohio.
Man I was hoping for LA Knight to beat up Creed
Disgusted that this amount of people are supporting Rey’s violence against his own son
How... did Rhea pull Dom's arm *through* the rope to get him *away* from the ropes?
Rhea vs Zelina? Hell yeah!
Good shit
Let's goo Priest
The Zelina hurricanrana always pops me. It's great
I want a Rhea vs Zelina feud so much (if they let Zelina actually wrestle like she can)
Santos has been paired with Rey for a bit now and he's taken nothing but L's.
There Sami goes talking to his ex again
Sami “Ted Mosby”” Zayn
What does Sami think Jey is gonna do? Leave the Bloodline and join him and Ko and be there 3rd wheel? Lol.
House of Black going to be awkward after that
Rey is the real heel cutting off Samantha
Interesting how they cut Shane out of that video.
I know they won’t do it at Backlash because of Bad Bunny but Dom has to beat Rey at some point.
Oooh, Sami's going to talk to Jey before their match?   👀  Love his love for Jey still
Great watch for smackdown
Is Riddles gimmick just weed
I’m loving the LWO being a thing again but I hope they start picking up some wins soon. They look weak af losing to judgement day every week rn
NAKAMURA
YEA-OH
I wish for a Gunther vs Nakamura II
Shinsuke coming back is great news.
Now THATS a return
Was Shinsuke hurt or just taking a break?
"It is time for our... main event!"  Don't gank Mark Henry's line, Cole!
If they book Rhea vs Zelina for Backlash the crowd will go nuts for the headstand DDT or ‘Rana bump that leads to a near fall. Zelina will get murdered right after that, but she deserves that moment.
Had no clue nakamura was still in WWE
Wait main event?   I thought LA Knight was facing Xavier tonight? I gotta wait a week to see the Mega Star wrestle. Damn.
Friday flew by super quick
Solo is ruthless
KEVIN OH NOOOO
“Who crumbling now Uce?”
Sami talking out the side of his neck lol   Main Event Jey Uso is a different breed.
ADAM PIERCE HAS LOST CONTROL OF THIS SHOW
Solo Assassin
First they go at his face with a pie, now they're taking out his leg. KO can't catch a break
I am Sports Entertained
Solo will be the biggest heel in the industry I can already see it coming lol
Ok, HHH is in charge with saying KO went to hospital
Main Event Jey Uso claiming his spot
They just left them there lol
I need a pair of Usos' shorts. They're pretty Ucey.
Jay without the belly shirt, looking like a prize fighter.
So no LA Knight?
Usos in shorts look good
Jey with the new tatts on display
OH NO KO!!!! He needed you Sami!
oh shit Jey back with the OG shorts?
Heyman had his phone out to watch!
I love a good backstage segment!
Sami is way too nice for his own good…
the shorts are taking me back to 2012
Main Event Jey baby
Apparently Heyman was on the phone, behind Jey, when Jey was staring at Sami & KO 👀
Tonights theme is missing tag partners
Worlds apart always makes me happy
Kevin out for a few weeks due to "injury". Sami saves Jey from an attacking Solo, new team
It don’t feel right seeing Jey without the titles
Kinda surprised they didn't clean Sami up a bit lol. At least a beard trim for my boy
Enemies to friends to Uce to enemies.
I’d fuck with Jey winning the MITB but I just can’t see the wwe pulling the trigger on him ending Roman’s reign
Bloodline lurking in nearby shadows rn, no doubt
What’s the story behind Jey uso chest tattoos? That’s a LOT of ink
Boooooo solo
Solo is an absolute menace but dom still gets booed more which kinda makes me giggle
I don’t care for NASCAR but that dirt derby looks cool.
Not the flying nothing
Jey is a Tama Tonga level shit talker ...always cussing
When Jey dye his hair blue, it’s over
He called Sami Uce!!!
Jey be acting like he's got a conscience but don't hesitate to grab that pinfall no matter where it came from
Solo gonna get his ass kicked one day and it’s gonna be great
Does anyone question why Solo Sikoa and Jey Uso are brothers but have different last names
HELP YOUR UCE , JEY
Save your brother Jey. What the fuck??
JEY OH SHIT
Jey stops Solo for a second time!
OH SHIT
God fucking dammit I let them swerve me again
Jey Usos stopped Solo Sikoa so he can kick Sami Zayn in the face
Solo's offense was not very convincing
oh god i forgot he has trunks now
Riddle showing so much uncomfortable thigh it's reminiscent of Lesnar's debut shorts
Jey fucking boomed us again.
Seriously get him some shorts.
Man, that Seth feud kinda ruined Riddle.  (Well, more of his real life leaking into people's knowledge probably didn't help either.)
thank you cole for reminding me why tf riddle was running out with his lil chicken legs
Riddle out here looking like hes Winnie the Poohing it
Riddle looks like he’s at a swim meet
How in the hell is this going to sustain for a whole year of television without getting more stretched out than the NWO 2000?  I don't think Chris Kreski and Vince in his creative  prime could pull this off together in this state.
so all that character development for Jey is just out the window huh?
Hahahaha Riddle OMG 😆
Riddle as a new dangerous threat? as if the bloodline didn't beat him up enough lmao
Thanks to Cole.  I almost forgot how was he wrote off.
Solo vs Riddle > Miz vs Solo
you can kinda tell HHH is back in charge.  this would've been riddle's big return but i'm guessing vince said no lets bring him back on monday
Bro I promise you we saw fucking Mania enough recaps
Where is LA Knight? Is he safe? Is he alright?
Smart HHH, Vince can't takeover gorilla if he leaves the desk for the last segment on the show  ![gif](giphy|d3mlE7uhX8KFgEmY)
I don't know what it is about Ricochet. How someone can be so cool and yet so uncool simultaneously lol
Sami when he realizes he can milk the bloodline storyline for a few more months 💀
I just realised shotzi is teamed up with natalya because her nipples are heart shaped
Rhea is the hottest woman on the roster and it’s not even close
Biggest heel in the business. Sorry MJF and Roman. Dom is speaking
Dom had the best entrance at Wrestlemania lol
It's the mustache, they think he's Vince.
Yo Dom has the most heat right now lol
Ok this feels much more like a triple h booked show. There’s still some hope
Priest has so much potential to be a main eventer, he needs a push.
I’d go all out on LWO at Backlash. Rey+Bunny vs JD. Zelina vs Rhea. Legado vs Imperium. Get them all on the card and sell a bunch of T-Shirts.
I wish Cole had anywhere close to as much contempt for Roman cheating every match and having a bullshit title run as he does Dom Mysterio for existing.
Evil Dead Rise and Pope's Exorcist are going to be the Armageddon and Deep Impact of our time: those two movies that people Mandela effect into believing they're the same films.
Why is Zelina Vega so attractive?
Trips has put together a really good show so far at a time it was really needed for a lot of people
As much as I can’t stand the sex pest if he just does what he has reportedly done tonight and only put minor tweaks to the shows. I can live with it. This show has blown RAW away.
Those that are looking for LA Knight, maybe he appeared when you weren't actively watching the screen?
Donald Trump back in the news. Vince McMahon somehow still around. USFL a thing again. What year is it again?
Sami went on to defend the tag titles solo for 879 days, culminating in a final moment at WrestleMania 42 where Kevin returns to kick Sami in the balls and sarcastically wave MMM to pin Sami, beginning a 1,462 day reign of tag team titillation
amazon wants you to get bullied
So how many Omos matches are we getting tonight?
So much for the Fire Vince chants and the Hijack Smackdown movement
A draft announcement and a Rhea intro. How fucking boring.
A draft with no brand split. It’s GENIUS
This promo feels like a highschool play
I’m officially on team “Triple H vs Vince” worked shoot storyline
#FireVince
These recaps started are getting ridiculous man
Damn, HHH is looking more pale than usual
All day, I see Prayer Circle this, Prayer Circle that.  Nah, prayer circle for Sheamus to win the IC title at Backlash.
vince would never start a show with a match LOL especially one with the IC champion
15 minutes into the show and there's already been more wrestling than the first 2 hours of Raw.
Friendship ended with Raw after Mania. Now Smackdown after Mania is my best friend.
I only watch the ppvs and never watch the weekly show. Can someone explain to me why Pete Dunne is so underutilized? Like I get he’s small but he’s so fucking good.
Can't believe they would bury Cody like this having him be the top babyface in the company   He's gotta be livid
Cody getting screwed then being "let's do something! a tag match!" is the lamest shit
OKAY HE SAID “our problems” AND NOT THE SAMI ZAYN PROBLEM LIKE HE SAID TO JEY??? HMMMMM????????????????
I still don't understand what she is supposed to be showing off with her back flex.
Everytime Raquel flexes her lats, I think of Dee in It's Always Sunny dancing to Baby Got Back
So when is Raquel gonna get an actual gimmick
Where’s our boy LA Knight
Unpopular opinion: I hate the tank and shotzi does nothing for me
THAT'S A PS5 CONTROLLER, LA! YOU GOTTA BE JOSHING, SNAPPING THAT!
Xbox pause menu PS5 controller
Welp, guess Papa H wanted to get his stuff in within the 1st hour. Now that he’s out of Gorilla, Vinnie Mac might’ve just snuck into the chair.
SOMEONE KEEP AN EYE ON THE CHAIR IN GORILLA
LA knights new gimmick is just being a boomer. Disliked Rey because of Spanish and he doesn't like videogames
Is he really tho Michael? Is he?
That announcement could've been an email.
Triple H has really grown into a GREAT representative for the company. I never would’ve predicted back in the day that he would be so giving and selfless in helping the careers of others.
Dom might actually get more heat than Roman
"Let's talk about Edge"  No Finn, let's not - just end this feud already, we're sick of it.
Finn lost a hair vs hair match with his barber
Bringing back the LwO was one of the best moves in the Triple H era and it's only been two weeks in.
This show has been awesome.  So happy we got this after that shit pile that was raw.
What they’ve done (or lack thereof) with Shinsuke is criminal.
The shorts are a different/good look
>!**RECYCLE YOUR ELECTRICALS**!<
>the greatest superstar in sports entertainment  Eyyy Vince
DAMN IT I WASTED A “YES” ON JEY STOPPING SOLO  Anyways listen to this crowd not give a fucking fuck about Riddle lol
Are people forgetting that in kayfabe the bloodline hospitalised riddle.
I'm still salty Liv, Raquel, and Chelsea Green carried that Mania tag match only for Ronda Rousey to vulture a win after 10 seconds of being in the ring
Well, we shall consign the Raw after WM 39 as a non-entity. WWE had only two shows after WM 39. NXT & SmackDown.
The five minutes before a raw or Smackdown always takes like an hour to go by
I can’t wait for these fire Vince chants, I’ve gone full mark, this nonsense needs to stop with him
All storylines will end  All titles vacated  The roster will be divided  It will be Hunter's Indie Blood vs McMahon's Club
Praying tonight is better than Monday!
Waiting for the Raw repeat promo from HHH
Can't believe Wrestlemania wasn't even a week ago what the heck
Is the Acknowledge Me in the intro new?
Let’s hope that Smackdown is better than Raw was.
Hoping HHH tells me that I am once again the Authority
Can’t believe they just cut out Shane like that
HHH should walk out carrying his seat so that old man with the mustache can't steal it
It was totally just Miz vs Snoop Dog. Nothing else happened, why do you ask?
"remember that speech from Monday? It was all true...when I said it"
I’m surprised they’re not showing stills for this.
Vince news makes me give a shit less about mania tbh
We gonna get the same intro, same speech, and then go "ooops, no time for a match from the women's division!" aren't we?
Man. Balor/Edge is gonna be the biggest what-ifs ever. What if Balor never got busted, what spots were meant to happen
I’d love if Triple H doesn’t even walk to the ring but just comes out and says “I’m in charge” and dips
That match really was fantastic until they did the absolute laziest finish imaginable.
The roman vs cody recap is gonna take 10 mins
That was a really good recap. Don’t know why it was 5 minutes, but it was still a really good recap.
Banger incoming Banger incoming
Okay everyone the test begins
I still say Cody should've landed the 3rd and final Cross Rhodes as he was coming down from being spiked by Solo. That would've been a good finish.
IT'S......FIIIIGHT NIIIIGHT
Is it possible that they cut out all the Mania highlight packages and just give that time to Imperium vs Brawling Brutes? I wanna see a 5 star match tonight.
Wait what?!
this aint Triple H fam
5 star banger otw
Oh shit Triple H closing? It might not be a generic promo
Show is already better just based off the fact that we’re starting the show with actual wrestling
I guess that makes it less likely HHH is gonna repeat what he said...but then what else would he have to say?
For anyone asking where HHH is the tweet WWE sent out didn’t say he was opening the show.
You guys are acting like HHH is legally required to come out first or else we won't see him lol  edit: there we go
vince definitely in gorilla raging that there’s no 20 minute promo to start the show🤣
No Triple H to tell us everything is fine to start the show?? Maybe we are having a draft announcement??
Vince rewrote the script, HHH not giving a speech
Gunther the 5 star ring general!!!!
This feels more HHH-ish
This could actually be fun. What’s going on here ?!?
This match card is already looking better than raw which is good
Looking sharp in the navy blue.
Wouldn’t mine a set up for Gunther vs Butch for the IC title at Backlash.
HHH will say nothing will be changing again like Monday
Imperium needs to stay around forever just for that intro alone.
My dude Gunther looking slim.
I like him, but man, those euro uppercuts by Ridge were the worst I've ever seen
Feels like every time I watch Smackdown, its some variation of Imperium vs Brawling Brutes.  Its New Day / The Bar all over again.
I think Wade needs to watch a New Jack match.
Barrett ever gonna wrestle again or is he retired?
I missed the first 10 minutes? What did HHH say or has he not come out yet?
I want Konnan to manage LWO so bad
Anyone else annoyed by the two guys that are standing up in the front row while everyone else is sitting down. I would hate to be behind them and I feel sorry for those that are
Gunther let go to avoid the jawbreaker, and just *kicked* Butch.  And of course, there's the finger fucking, love it.
They FINALLY sat down in the front row holy shit
That 40 Year Old Parody has started to make me a fan of Holland.
Ridge Holland is underrated
Damn I thought that was it!
Sheamus is a beast
Gunther kept his eye on the ref to see if Ridge made the tag, so he could avoid getting hit from behind
It's easy to miss because Gunther is well Gunther but all of Imperium is really, really good as a unit
Sheamus and Gunther were made to fight each other
The weird audio mixing must be a Fox problem because it started last week on SD but was fine at Mania and Raw. Hope they get it sorted out.
that clothesline sounded brutal holy shit
Awesome first match tonight
Sheamus red hot rn
Am I hearing things or did Cole call that a powerslam?
Imperium and The Brawling Brutus can wrestle each other every week, and it will always be a banger.
I know with their hard-on for record breaking Gunther is going to hold it until he surpasses Honky Tonk Man but Sheamus seriously needs to win the title soon. The crowds want it.
The fucking knee strike!
id be ok with this feud for another year
Banger.
I don't think I'll ever get tired of watching GUNTHER and Sheamus wrestle each other
Jfc is Smackdown in Ireland tonight?
Vinci is always eating the pin lmao
Sheamus on fire
Putting Sheamus back in his old gimmick n ditching the mohawk SAVED him
Sheamus is on the best run of his career. Love to see it.
That's how you open a show
Time to eat boot
Nice
FELLLLAAAAAAAA
Now that’s how you start the night, Fella.
FELLAAAAA
Good opener
I hope Gunther is at backlash
Banger after banger after banger after banger after...
Lmfao was half expecting "And now, the RAW recap of HHH addressing the WWE Universe!"
O cool are we going to get more UFC ads now that they own wwe
These recaps are wild.
Triple H's announcement will be that they're doing a WCW-style reboot where all titles will be vacated. Yes, this is how Reigns', Gunther's and Belair's respective title runs end.
What's the best reason Brock can give for attacking Cody? Lol
That Samoan spike looked more like a short arm clothesline. Meh.
i can't believe this goober settled for a tag match instead
Man I want Cody to win at wrestlemania but I don’t think I can go another year of this reign. Please just have bro win at summerslam at this point
These recaps are too much
Don’t get me wrong, wwe recaps are very good made, but my GOD I’m so tired of it
As soon as Brock got in the ring and had that impatient look on his face, yup. F5.
R.I.P cowboy Brock
A Raw main event triggering a collective eye roll so great that the Earth's rotation was slowed for an entire second
Well if anything if Brock gives a shit and likes Cody, I do think he will give the match his all.
Brock didn’t even do Cena that bad back in 2012
Do you think they will do the match for backlash between Brock and Cody ?
Anybody else getting 2009-2014 WWE vibes from this?
Kayla x Paul
Kayla + Heyman = PB&J
This night is different because of FEAR
I love how cody sells the f5. Tbh I'm super down for a brock vs cody match. Prob backlash main event since there are rumors that roman won't be there right?
Looks like Roman couldn’t make it tonight
The recaps. Im back pal!
Kayla is such a snack. Serious news and charaKter
Paul Heyman... legend
Intrusive Interrogatory is my next album title
So e of y’all didn’t get that Passover reference
LOLat the reason for Brock getting mad at Cody
Lmaoooo, Solo with no words
That’s just unrealistic. Brock was ecstatic to get his 5-minute match out of the way and on the plane home before the sun was down.
God Paul Heyman is such a slimy piece of shit lmao
Now Jimmy's missing lmfao
Bad news for Jey, no Jimmy 👀
The Usos like to play this disappear game a lot, huh? Not very ucey, Jimmy!
Solo looks like he wants to hurt Jey
Heyman's so good at laying out these tests from Roman as motivational speeches.
Is that Rikishi’s face on Solo’s shirt?  Lol
Jey Uso getting punished for losing at Wrestlemania huh?
You are all treating match placement as the true reason, when Wade just said he heard hearsay.
Well….. Jey is getting his ass kicked tonight
Now that WrestleMania is over my new thing is wondering when Solo will become more than a killing machine.
solo was lookin at jey weird bro... what problem is he solving if jey loses
No way solo betrays jey, there’s no way.
Solo cares more about Roman than he does Jey imo.
miles ahead of Raw already lol. banger 6-man tag. now we nervous about solo turning on Jey???
showing a SummerSlam in Detroit promo less than a week after Mania, we need more MANIA XL ads
So, since i was curious, I wanted to see how many 1v1 matches Ivar's had on the main roster. This is his 4th, and none have gone over 5 minutes. So expect a short one.
I would be very happy if they put ricochet over in this match, love the guy! The mid air "stop" when he did the shooting star outside the ring was a thing of beauty to see.
"Vince BANNED Tag teams!!!"
i say it every week:  Change the voice over or change Logan's name, so stupid
sorry but what does valhalla add to this tag team
But have you ever tried gay meat
Tag team partners banned from ringside is definitely a Triple H thing
At least they explained why Braun and Erik aren't at ringside. Banned from ringside.
The Vikings' have a pretty cool entrance imo
I've said this before, but it is so obvious! The way to save the Viking Raiders gimmick is to introduce a third member who is a modern Swedish man.
Ricochet just got squished!
Cody not winning has made everything feel like a continuation. No title unification, no new challengers for the titles, no new meaningful storylines. Just the same as it’s always been
They should just go full Scooby and Scrappy doo and have Ricochet wear gear like Brauns.  Ricochet already looks like a 1/8 scale Strowman
Thats like when I failed my last PR attempt at deadlifting.
Can’t help but wonder Sarah Logan’s opinions on Portland
![gif](giphy|tIR1jC7GYCXgnMNilj|downsized)
Ivan jobbed to richochet?
Seeing Ricochet win always makes me smile
I hate it when wrestlers release the pin before the bell.
No more 630? What happened to that as a finisher?
Great match, already feels like we've seen more good wrestling than Raw lol
Logan is displeased
Even that match was better than the entire raw show
Really solid little match. Was not expecting Richocet to win there.
![gif](giphy|3o752a4k3F2yd19QeA|downsized)
I like how Ricochet has three finishers. Shooting Star, 540, and a swanton off of Brauns shoulders
Cole was so great without someone in his ear. I forgot who it was, but someone in commentary got fed up with being directed and turned off McMahon's input.
The heel turn of K.O on Sami will HURT
KO is already plotting back stabbery lol
Crowd won’t be chanting will they
Sami zayn shoukd be the one to turn on Kevin Owens this time. He’s more interesting as a heel
What was Kevin's hand tat that he covered up?
Sami, you said that you could let it go and I wouldn’t catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know
Where is Triple H?
Sami can't leave his second brother hanging like that!
Why wouldn't Jimmy call Jey and tell him what Paul said?
I'm worried Kevin is gonna turn on Sami. Maybe I am looking into this too much.
What happened to no women's matches?
wait, I was told there were no women's matches tonight...
Rachel's picture in the tron looks like she should be on a TV shopping channel selling "the Simon system" supplments
Jim corny is somewhere yelling misogynistic things at his TV rn
What the fuck am i supposed to do with all this wrestling?!
TAAAAANK
Just got off work…did HHH speak yet? If so did he say anything new or same raw message?
Nice to see a good chunk of wrestling in the first hour tonight after that baffling first hour of Raw.
Boozer right again about the new nickname for shotzi and Nattie. Posted before pwi
Thats a stupid ass name
Take the belt off of Lita ASAP.
"Ballsy Baddies" is better than "Farty Females" i guess
So she just waited there for her to do a suicide dive for like 15 seconds
I still prefer Nattie's name idea of BlackHarts
Not even 30 secs in & Shotzi nearly broke her neck lmao
Say what you want about it, but that farting gimmick is the only thing I ever remember Natalya ever doing.
Shotzi should be teaming with Liv
Oh fuck, Shotzi spiked her fucking head. She good?
The match hasn’t started off bad the crowd just doesn’t care
Liv is just hilarious with her noises in the ring.
Liv Morgan with the Lex Luger selling
Gotta make Liv and Raquel look good before RAW I guess
So much for the Ballsy Baddies.
Natalya coulda taken that pin
YEAH!
Even video game Madcap is gonna do the job.
It upsets me they didn't give Bushwacker a ten bell salute.
yep Hunter is writing this show   YEAH
LA KNIGHT YEAH
Is anyone else sick of tag team matches just forgetting the rules of tag team? I thought you couldn’t have an illegal man in the ring for over 5 seconds?
Liv is gonna be QOTR & Raquel is gonna be feuding with Rhea so they probably not winning on Raw
that was great!!
YEEEEEAHH!!!!!
Imagine the scenes if Knight was Pat or Shane, and beat up Miz for host-ship.
LA Knight’s here ? Maybe Vince is actually at home
Knight should have have grabbed the brass ring and attacked Lashley at WM when he had the chance
YEAHHHH
LA knight was the model for most of those guys on that game they playing lol
NOT THE PS5 CONTROLLER
LA Knight vs Austin Creed in WWE 2k23 Match
LA KNIGHT LIVES!!
Emma looking good
YEAH
Watch Triple H come out just the say the exact same thing he said on RAW
Woods inadvertently turning himself heel here
**TIME TO PLAY THE GAAAAAME!**
BIG STUFF TO TALK ABOUT
Way too pessimistic for this triple h speech after the bs from Monday ngl
Is Papa Haitch gonna repeat RAW or is he maybe announcing the Draft? It was supposed to be post Mania at some point I think
LA KNIGHT YEAH
HUNTER DONT LEAVE YOUR SEAT
I feel like Shotzi and Liv would pair better. Both are kinda crazy and have a history of diving thru furniture.
so how is that fire vince movement going so far?
Oh show us LA to get us hyped first? Lmao. This feels like not Vince booking
I’ve done the same thing to a PS5 controller while playing FIFA
Wonder what this HHH segment is about 🤔
Ok everyone, place your bets on this big announcement.
I cannot abide cruelty to game consoles. LA Knight, *YOU'RE ON NOTICE!*
“I know what’s in the news but it’s still THEN, NOW and FOREVER” *introduces Happy Corbin*
why are ppl hyping up an announcement? isnt he just "addressing the wwe universe"
![gif](giphy|3ohBVCkWlZuz2RFAEU|downsized)
![gif](giphy|3orieTfp1MeFLiBQR2)  Please HHH
Oh god here we go
Triple H: “WWE Universe, we will get through these precedented times …. Then, Now, Forever.”
RIP Dualsense Controller
**BEHOLD THE KING OF KINGS**  Jesus: Well it is Good Friday…
Am I supposed to be impressed by Racquel's back or something?
So is Triple H coming out to say that the second hour of Smackdown is going to be booked by Vince ?
Haitch with the too sweet
*Unfunny, unoriginal comment about Vince*
Please stop with the bowing
FIRE VINCE CHANTS PLEASE
Ugh.  Introduced as HOFer and not CCO
He should pull a Seth and just walk back out.
Betting its the same promo raw got but because the audiences are different they're just making sure everybody hears it lol
HHHs best theme.
Daddys home guys
Look at this sad boi
“Now Forever Together”
LMAO
okay that hearts are broken line 🖕🏽
It's just a gloating session.
Is he just saying Wrestlemania is in Philly next year?
We fuckin get it
I’m going to say the same thing-uh.
Vince:”DON’T CALL IT 39!”
WWE making it's e3 presentation
HHH, self suck Saturday is tomorrow
(Crowd is hot for HHH)  "There is nothing like Wrestlemania"  (Crowd immediately cools realizing it's a recap...erm...promo from Monday)
Congrats, Mania was a huge success, and a massive booking failure.
Trips gonna come out every week until wm40 and laud this mania weekend
HHH came out here to give a promo towards WWE shareholders
Just noticed next week's Smackdown will be Smackdown #1234
The rich got richer, now cheer for us!
The wrinkles on his head look like marker from some angles..
O-V-A-L-T-I-N-E
Corporate Shill Triple H
WWE Draft
Trying to boost the new company stock
Oh cool, it's the draft announcement
A fuckin brand split?
Gave one to USA gotta give one to Fox too. Gotta be fair to both siblings.
Is Adam Pierce doing it on both sides?
DRAFT!!!!
Andy Richter comes out “ the future HHH”
Well, finally some announcement
Oh shit there’s an actual announcement Lmao
Oh damn
Lmaoooo Vince Gets Raw Triple H Gets Smackdown
WILL IT. WILL IT REALLY
A draft is long overdue
Oh damn??? DRAFT with everyone?
Whoever called it being the draft was right
Draft doesn't mean shit
Wow, Hunter getting all buddy-buddy with the new heel champs
is he OK?  his eyes are bloodshot AF
Omg it's Mami
Is he cleared to wrestle or something? Why would he say the game like that
why are sports drafts so sick to my little rodent brain
Proud Papa Haitch
Glad to see Finn is still alive about being destroyed with a ladder.
Good to see Finn moving.
Man..tk and trips both love their announcements
Too sweet with Finn
Judgment Day in full force on Smackdown, can you say “drafted”?
lol and fancy announcing Rhea
Finn and Trips hitting each other with a Too Sweet
I’m actually excited for this draft.
Interesting bit of foreshadowing there, Cole. That would honestly be the "best" choice if WWE is forced to lean into Rhea's babyface reactions. The people loveeee her.
did we already know there was a draft? why is everyone acting like thats nothing i feel like thats pretty big. idk how i feel about it i really like everyone being on every show but im sure it makes it easier
HHH WITH THE 2 SWEET HAHAHA
I wonder if Tribal Chief moves to Raw or Cody moves to Smackdown. Also how is Raw gonna feel like anything more than filler without having a #1 title.
Why isn't Dommy standing next to Mami?
Rhea walked up too early. They missed the too sweet with Finn!
This draft is actually gonna be interesting, hope they enforce the brand split
finn's head injury at WM was terrifying
Too Sweet!
Judgement Day to Smackdown so we can finally get Finn vs. Gunther, three years in the making!
Anticlimactic HHH
Awww did my eyes see a too sweet with Finn instead of a handshake there?
Can we get a surprise challenger for Rhea?
That was a dud announcement.
Triple H is doing the same thing Vince did before he moved away last year.
Finn pants though
Michale Cole just called Rhea and Charlotte the greatest championship match at mania ever. Not the greatest women’s, the greatest ever.
Mami
Raw drafts the WWE title. SD drafts the Universal title.
Dom saw Vincent mustache
He didn't say when exactly the draft will be did he?
Dom is growing an Eddie stache
I like how initially Judgement Day was introduced, but I also enjoy what Judgement Day has become. They’re fun and entertaining.
"I think it's time that everyone *rises* for Mami!"  Um, phrasing?
The Leader and only babyface of the Judgement Day, Rhea Ripley
anything for mommy🫡
Guessing this segment was supposed to be on Monday until Vince dropped a nuke on the script. This makes way more sense.
let's talk about edge!  _crowd murmurs_
Rhea you don't need to tell me. I'm already raised
Hell yea I like that vibe
There's nobody worth a damn to feud with Rhea on Smackdown.....
Let’s not?
Watchinf wrestling as a adult makes me appreciate non us wrestlers on the mic even more
BOOOOOOOOOO
Lmaoooo
Ha dom this shit is cracking me up
Holy shit hahahha
I was hoping the blow to the head would give Finn amnesia and forget who Edge was.
That heat is great.
You can barely hear him oh my god
They hate Dom more than Roman.
Dom makes me laugh so damn hard
It's fucking crazy how over Dom is
Crying.
Great crowd tonight
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA DOM
Dom is a star lol, that reaction.
LMAOOOOOOOOO Dom couldn't even say 2 words before getting booed lol  This man is the GOAT.
THE **HEAT**
Dom is a HEAT MAGNET!
Judgment Day is so supportive of Dom <3
Dom is getting crazy heat
Dom is heat
Finally a heel that actually gets booed
You cant even hear him!
Does anyone get this heat anymore?! Not MJF or Roman anyway.
that's some huge heat for dom good gawd lol
All of JD looking like proud parents of Dom right now
Dominik getting ~~go away~~ some how Vince returned heat
lol @ them showing the hob sign in the crowd in the middle of a judgement day segment.
Dom is the worst 😂
ABSOLUTELY NUCLEAR
Lmfao Dom you asked him to do that
Dom can never fuckign get a word in. LMAO
Dom may go down as the greatest heel of all time.
Yoooo Dom has legit heat, this is great
Dom is a man of integrity.   That feeble old man has one selfish joy and Dom was the bigger man and let him off the hook.
I think they’re disgusted with that mustache
I love my dad  Also  Go to hell, dad.
That's a heel
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
What father hits his son with a belt infront of millions - Dom
Wow that’s quite loud nuclear heat for Dom
The heat on Dominik is always insane everytime he shows up but Portland tonight is booing him heavy!  Best heel in professional wrestling industry rn, no one is close to getting the amount of heat this guy is getting.
Dom is just killin it
Orton perks up somewhere
Dom is AJ Soprano
Puerto Rico is going to bring the house down
Who is...Hermano
Rhea cuts a promo. Finn cuts a promo. Dominic cuts a promo. Damien looks at his phone to see if Dunkin Donuts is open and then if Ben Affleck REALLY worked for them.
Did priest get his teeth fixed
Is it me or does Priest look like a discount Roman
LWO still lives!
Bunny sold that chokeslam sooo well
Is Zelina Vega wearing a power rangers mask?
acting like Bunny hasn't been in the ring before
Is Damien Priest hair made of leather too?
Kudos to Bunny for eating a chokeslam on a table.
Damn legado del fantasma’s intro is good
God bless performers who aren't afraid to go out there and get heat, that's what makes wrestling fun.
LDF look great in those shirts.
You can’t just say that Cole
Zelina with a bunny mask. Laura Allie's gonna sue.
Judgement Day is Finn, Rhea, Dom and the other guy.    No really Priest just doesn't get as much chance to shine.
I’d kill to hear the old LWO theme
LWO IN TACT WE GOOD BABY
“The LWO” 🥹❤️
LWO LWO LWO LETS GO
Even with it being a homecoming for Priest, even that’s not gonna be able to save Dom in San Juan.
So are LDF just always referred to as the LWO going forward?
Hope El Dandy returns
Damn so they're actually the LwO now
So is Rey Mysterio leading the lwo?
Stupid question..do you feel that having Logan Paul, snoop and bad bunny on wwe products creates more fans? I know trips ran off the stats but I think the ratings for smackdown and raw have been consistent??
I'm hoping that at least HHH books SmackDown and Vince can do whatever tf he wants with RAW
Lmao, Cole cooking Dom
I'm assuming Damage Control gets split up in the draft. Maybe Judgement Day too unless they draft the whole faction in one go?
Cole still going nuts on Dom I love it
Lol @ Cole
I can believe Haitch is running the show again tonight, feels like what RAW should’ve been
Half this thread giving the most complex reasonings possible to explain RAW sucking is honestly pretty funny.
Idk guys, Cole sounds pretty free and he seems like he’s enjoying himself!!
Finn is loving all the heat the Dom generates
Cole is lucky dom is busy with his deadbeat dad   cause he saying fighting words
It wouldn't be the best match, but I wouldn't be against Rhea vs Zelina in Puerto Rico
Hey Lady Ref Jess
That good Lucha shit
Cole shouting down his partner to go on a rant: Gold. Very entertaining.  Graves shouting down his partner to go on a rant: a purgatory none of us ever truly escape from.
Latino wwe fans gotta be loving this
So Gable Steveson Raw superstar is up for draft right?   Whatever happened to that guy?
Man. What a stark change from raw.  This show fucks so far.
Cole just makes anything relating to Rey and Dominik better
Rey Mysterio still agile as shit
Cole calling a Michinoku Driver? Vince aint in charge.
Lol that just mad Rhea angry asf
Ohhh Zelina gonna 💀
Damn, Rey moves like he is in the prime of his career, amazing stuff!
Rip Zelina
For a moment, I thought that one chair was going to stop Rhea.
damn, haven't heard a crowd this hot since Montreal. good shit.
Rey loses because he cares more about beating his kid than paying attention to who the legal man is.
Some say Zelina's still running to this day.
Santos Escobar doesn’t not deserve this :(
SAMI AINT DONE WITH JEY
Good match and laying the groundwork for story development.
Before the next match I want a shot in the crowd showing Rhea still chasing Zelina around
So, since the Usos lost the unified titles does this mean that they'll mostly stick to one of the brands?
Been to the States a few times. I miss how cheap and accessible junk food is.
going for a maxed out JD VS LWO fued for Backlash, Santos Rey and probably Bad Bunny vs Dom Damien and Finn?also Rhea vs Zelina for womens championship. this is gonna be good
Shows been hot, crowd been hot
NAKA!!!!
NGL I had totally forgotten about Nakamura
Shinsuke!
Finally Shinsuke is back
Wait what about LA and Xavier
Wow this main event segment is getting time!
Main Event Jay coming up next
My boi NAK!!! I've waited since his match vs Muta 🙌🏽
OH SHIT
Long term storytelling. I knew there was unfinished business between these two.
Where LA knight tho
Heyman you piece of 💩
Jey knows, Sami.  But he won't abandon Jimmy to Roman.
Jay defeats Roman, Cody loses to Jay
I thought LA Knight was going to fight Woods after breaking that controller
oh shittt
Hahaha I am playing WWE 2K23 MyRise and this reminded me of the segment I just finished.
We never saw Solo attack him......
Dangerously close to pre day 1 outfit by Jey
Main event jey
Oh wow Jey not attacking KO and kinda looking on conflicted again, there’s potential for them still
Main event jey indeed
Gotta love the wide crowd shots. So good
All those Snickers bars have weakened KO's ability to dip 😂😂
New gear Jey
Shout out to the babe that threw in a hammer behind commentary
Cant watch tonight but how’s Smackdown been? Saw the Dom clip and crowd seems HOT
How is WWE2K23?
Jey and Solo are just the closing nightshift crew for the Bloodline.
Wait hold up....  No Xavier vs LA Knight match tonight on SD?
Jey gets removed from the bloodline and La Knight replaces him.
YEAH
"See a doctor if your asthma goes not improve, or if you develop severe lycanthropy, Frank Sinatra syndrome, Xavier: Renegade Angelitis, or your penis falls off."
Ohhh there’s the LA KNIGHT match
Gosh I hope LA Knight wins next week
Sami needs to listen to KO more
15 minutes for the main? Bet
This should be a banger match.
Jey wears those titles much better.
Ngl Usos had more swag when wearing the belts
Jey has to lose. It is the only way to fulfill the prophecy
Jey got rid of the joggers 😢
Can’t remember the last time I’ve been to a wwe show with fans in the 300 section. Great to see!
Is Solo trying to grow a beard to emulate Sami or Roman????
Solo = The Wolf
Commentary has been excellent tonight.  Atta baby cole.
as much as we'd love solo to take care of the Jey problem he's gonna take care of the sami problem.   they're gonna allude to turning on the uso's for a while yet
THE POPE'S EXORCIST: PEE PEE DOO DOO.  RATED R.
In kayfabe Solo must have some kind of blackmail on Adam Pearce.   After what he did at mania, I bet he could straight up break the ref's kneecaps and he won't call for the DQ.
I like Solos Raman noodle hair
Lol, all I can think about is Ric taking that superplex off a ladder
Hope the draft don't break up MMM
Wade Barrett is so damn funny when babyfaces eat shit in a match
Solo regretting those taquitos he had at catering
BLUE THUNDERBOMB
Blue thunderbomb is such a cool name
BTB!!!!!
I want Jey to get a clean win
DAMN YOU SOLO
I honestly thought they were setting up for a top rope Canadian Destroyer.
TOO MUCH TIME LEFT SAMIS GETTING KILLED :(
Sami selling like HBK tonight.
Really tired of that finish.
Damn that kick was beautiful
Bro literally suspend solo. He does this every match
Where did I see that finish to a match before with Solo?
SOLO! UMAGA THE FUCK OUT OF SAMI!
Get used to seeing that Samoan Spike
SAVE HIM JEY
This mf'er pissing me off
I ask again. They ban Eric and Braun from ringside but just let notorious interferer Solo be at ringside all the time?
HE STOPPED HIM
SAVE HIM JEY
JEY?????
YOOOOO
JEY JEY JEY JEY JEY
YEA THATS RIGHT JEY
In kayfabe, does Solo have a stronger thumb than Umaga, or does today's roster have weaker throats
Damn it Jey.
OHHHHH JEY FACE TURN TEASE AGAIN
JEY YOU FUCKER
COME ON JEY
That’s the second time Jey did that
hey, WWE officials, you're cool with your tag champs getting injured
well fucking alright i guess he wanted to kill sami himself :((
FUCK YOU JEY
Jey just wanted a piece of Sami too
Jey planting the seeds as the next head of the table
Yes riddle!!!
huh
I forgot they took out riddle
BROOOOOO
Matt Riddle addresses his enemies
Riddle me this, Bloodline!
Riddle to replace KO?
BROOOO
Riddle going with trunks instead of shorts now? Looks weird
Not the trunks!! Bring back the shorts
Riddle getting cooked next week, the end
Put some god damn shorts on Riddle.
Ok. I guess Riddle is back in the story.
The crowd did not care about Riddle
Fun episode tonight of smackdown
risk is definite based HHH continuity
Solo riddle will be excellent
Brooo oooo OOOO ooooo ooooooh  Broo oh oh oooooh
Well Solo did kinda put him out of action for months
Solo vs Riddle at backlash?
Hell yeah, was waiting on when he'll get his revenge. Now I'm praying on Randy to make his return. 😴🙄
Far too early to have the split progress that much, so this was fine. Can't say I care about Riddle though.
Braun not there. Obviously Vince said no more tag teams on my watch pal.    I don't know I'm just trying to keep up with the thread declaring everything is Vince at work.
Every time Gunther and Sheamus are in the ring  https://preview.redd.it/mt8ahp37ilsa1.jpeg?width=637&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=86e24e9951625d0245b167c09bcec2c234f58e05
Valhala invaded here.  -Capitol.
Why is her character a woman that smiles and lat spreads
Why is this crackhead out here?
What the fuck Riddle lmfao Hunter why  I mean NOOOOOO VINCE TOOK OVER GORILLA LAST SECOND NOOOOOO
Riddle actually remembering he should hate Solo is good stuff
Should have saved riddles refund for tonite instead of wasting it on raw
It will be one of the smackdowns ever.
Wrestlemania night 1 was only 6 days ago but after everything that’s happened since then it feels like it’s been weeks
WhyyyyyYYYYYYYYYYY YOU'VE ALREADY DEDICATED A WHOLE THREE HOUR SHOW TO THIS MONDAY
HHH gunna repeat verbatim what he said on Raw LOL
That ending is gonna sting for awhile. Wasted opportunity.
Lmfao where's triple h
If Triple H comes out wearing a giant turban we’ll know that Vince has possessed Triple H and is now on the back of his head
That’s the reason?? Lmao
I just thought of Ricochet going down to NXT again for a spell and going against Frazer, Axiom, Wes, and Dragon, and I *need* those right now
Ricochet looking strong? That’s how you know it’s an HHH booked show.
"better set your DVRs"  Yeah Vince is back in Coles ear
No tag team name will ever top Banger Bros.
Shotzis nipples are shaped like hearts btw
Shotzi sucks good lord. She took that oblivion like a limp piece of shit.
LA KNIGHT BABY  LOOKS LIKE TRIPS IS RUNNIN SMACKDOWN
damn, LA Knight broke that Dualsense pad like it was a twig
The fans have truly taken over this Smackdown…with joy and adulation lol
D…Did Triple H just deflect the elephant in the room to build up this year’s Draft? Bruh 4D chess play lol
Changing the GAME. I see what he did there.
Why do they keep doing this? The brand split is meaningless.
H putting himself over with this record breaking Wrestlemania. Did the same thing at the night 2 press conference when he busted out a list of impressive accomplishments and stats. Wonder if it's a subtle "don't even think of getting rid of me"
That doesn’t mean anything considering everyone goes back and forth Willy nilly
The Draft is one of the stupidest things in WWE. It would be extremely cool if they actually kept the brands separate but they go out of their way to make sure they aren't which means it's just totally pointless.
Better than the raw promo
To me Rhea is the leader of Judgement Day.
Aside from maybe Logan,Dom is the most over heel on the roster.
Dom has improved like 100x in the past year
Maxwell wishes
The amount of heat Dom has is amazing. I love it.
This Eddie Guererro impersonating shithead is getting heat like he's Joe Biden in Arkansas, what the fuck.
who’s bad bunny? I only know real stars like bow wow on aew
Joaquin Wilde is the 1st Filipino LWO member in its history, yeah?
I think we might have overreacted over RAW (it was dog shit) but I still think it has to do with phoning it in bc of the National College Basketball in the states that it was competing with. The show they had when they had the college football game was also bad. That or Endeavor put Vince in his place and said we are gonna back out this deal if you make Our product trash
Vince was in LA at Raw and decided to mess with the show like a Gorilla trying to assert dominance.  Let’s just hope he goes back to the office and doesn’t meddle too much and make the show bad.  He will never retire I’m just hoping he is content staying away from creative.
I'm all in on that evil dead movie
Can we get to Mr. Knight's match?
.75 Smackdowns after mania and LA Knight and Nakamura’s “post-Mania pushes” seemingly on schedule    PATRIOTS BACK IN CONTROL, TRIPLE H HAS THE BOOK
Main event Jey back with the shorts too
That looks like some singles gear hmmmm...
It's blowing my mind how like I'm getting consistent backstage segments that make sense and are brilliant   &#x200B;  As well as brilliant in ring promos that are great and the crowd is booing red hot heels like Ex Con Don     The storytelling is off the charts for Smackdown and the story flows perfectly segment to segment. Sure something happens in the rings between but it doesn't matter even.
There it is, sheesh. Really felt like that LA/Woods match was being made for tonight. 🤷🏼‍♂️
I'm getting really sick of Solo interfering in matches at the last minute.  I get it's a heel thing to do, but it's like every week and it doesn't even make sense in kayfabe.
So the Bloodline will deal with all of their past enemies until Mania where they'll deal with Cody
Doesn’t Riddle have old beef with Bloodline? Who did people think would come out.
Oh god. I don’t like Riddle being a part of this.
More like Matt *Mid*-dle  ...  Wait that's just middle
We are truly changing  https://preview.redd.it/b921t2x2qlsa1.png?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b2533290ee23511840fa2e8777aaba8b6063a332
I'm here live and the fire Vince chants are defeaning. They must be muting them on TV.    Just kidding. No one gives a shit.
#Man, what a great week of wrestling it's been!  * Wrestlmania On Saturday * ~~Wrestlemania on Sunday~~   * ~~RAW~~ * Dynamite * NXT * Smackdown * Rampage
This place will go nuclear if Triple H announces he's relinquishing creative
Trips. Please fight for your life to protect what you've built these past few months.
We'll know Vince is back when there's a segment of LA Knight on his knees crying and begging for Maxine Dupri to take him back into MMM
The "Fire Vince" chants are deafening.
LMAO same old shit
This plot does not need Riddle
- Self fellation  - WrestleMania bigger than ever, ever. Ever!  - WWE Draft Announcement  - borrow Rhea Ripley clout  - leave
BACKSTAGE, CURRENTLY:  Triple H slouches in a chair in an office, looking Vince in the eye. Vince puts on a vinyl of Doris Day's "Que Sera Sera", and wipes off some hair dye from his forehead. The two glare for several moments, unflinching, until the song ends.  An absolutely terrified Jimmy Uso looks between the two, having been there the whole time. He attempts to leave. Triple H grabs him by the wrist, and motions for him to sit, before returning to glare at Vince.  Vince glares back.
Hunter just saved a bunch of money on his car insurance by switching to Geico
i’m well aware WM was last week…. i watched it….
Already stalling 💀
Watch Haitch give his promo from Gorilla, just to make sure Vince doesn't *apparate* and steal his chair.
Wonder who they choose as Gunther’s next challenger
A lot of “revisiting” tonight
Alright, already passed the first half of Raw in terms of wrestling content...
The next match might be a last man standing match between shawn michaels and aj styles   I know it's not likely it's just the probability is never 0%
USFL be damned! XFL is my jam 😌
They really do not want us to forget about what happened on Raw,. huh.
still cant believe they had cody lose like its still so fucking funny
It'd be great if Roman actually showed up once in a while as the Bloodline breaks up.
Brock is like everyone else, he thought him vs Omos was main event worthy, I get it
Did Solo eat Jimmy Uso?
So tired of the Viking Raiders
Man why did they keep "Vallaha is here"
She says "Valhalla is here" like she's at Walmart 😂😂
Viking raiders should lose every singles match they have
did ivar just yell viking raiders lmfao
Raquel needs a better character than "I smile and flex my back"
i really don't see what people who think Raquel is a future main-eventer see.
"Number 1 contenders"  That confirms it, Vince aint there.
Third match in the first hour, we cooking tonight.
Shotzi needs to hit me with the shattered dreams so hard that I start convulsing and have to get airlifted to a hospital
LA Knight is here that's how you know Triple H is running the show and not Vince
THE DUALSENSE! YOU MONSTER!!!!
Triple H wasn't in gorilla, Vince is booking
HHH gonna get that 9 PM quarter hour rating boost after that eh 8:45 segment.
At least they’re boring us on both channels now
Why does a draft even matter when whoever shows up whenever they want? We just had Liv and Raquel on both Raw and Smackdown
bragging about record profits is gonna look real sad when the layoffs that are supposedly coming start happening
Looks like that WWE vs WWE SummerSlam thing was… something. Is it going to be McMahon vs Helmsley again??? Fuck I hope not. I don’t want to see that trout faced moustached rapist on tv.
they gonna draft vince to creative again
MASSIVE FUCKING W
this show has definitely lifted my spirits after that disaster on Monday. I’m more at ease now.
Rhea's so cool.  The embodiment of "If evil, why hot?"
That’s heat
Ain’t no one getting heat like Dom lmao.
NUCLEAR
Biggest heel of all time.
this is Young Bucks in Chicago, HBK in Montreal type heat
Judgement Day so awesome, it's given Dom superstar heat and Rhea gets too shine
Have Dom get arrested every week. When he's announced he needs to be '6 time felon, Dominik!' And brought to the ring in cuffs and jumpsuit.
Bro, they did not announce Triple H as the chief content officer💀
Do they have a gaslighting seminar in WWE? Roman, Dom, Priest and Kiana James keep hitting people with variations of it.
At least this episode is better than RAW.
No kayfabe, do you think Rey is proud of Dominic?
Rey is a sore loser. Couldn’t even let Samantha announce the winning team.
Judgement Day's entire existence being to just fight with Rey and Edge for years and years is kinda weird
I’m never seen wrestle Matt riddle before. Why does he look so like naked? Idk how to explain it lmao
Riddle needs to get out of those panties. The fit is way off
Build Shinsuke up to beat Roman. Fuck it.
Nak will be world champ under H, assuming they introduce a new world title
If Roman was on the show more often, I don’t think I’d be as upset about him winning at mania
Solid story telling. Jey and Sami were about to makeup but Jimi got involved
One of my favorite triple h things is that he gives us proper lengthy main events
Even Michael Cole just lost all excitement when having to bring up Monday Night Raw
Sami's theme goes so hard its perfect for a main event
Can’t believe we’re getting this on free TV.
So Vince is running Raw and HHH is running Smackdown.
If Kevin turns on Sami tonight, it's gonna be like, lightning turnaround.  "WHY, KEVIN?"  "I DON'T KNOW!"
I look to all the threads claiming HHH was in control of Smackdown since it was a good Smackdown lol. Also, I'm sure Fightful will post a report about his "sources" claiming that Vince will get fired or some random shit while actively ignoring the fact that Vince has been back for MONTHS
The same finish over and over is getting really lame
Outside of the usual finish, that was a really good match.
https://preview.redd.it/m0iakio7zlsa1.jpeg?width=680&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9cc0793ca415c786b4c908de8504078353b82bc8
I honestly couldn't care less about Matt Riddle. It's hard to get interested in a guy who's entire gimmick is "lol weed"
People pissed about Riddle… but storyline wise it makes the most sense
Yall it's fucking weird some of you are just ignoring there was a 6 man tag match that was basically half the show so far "recaps and promos!!!"  Lmao gaslighters
Raquel's incessant smiling and back flexing is such a weird combo. Very creepy.
Ngl, this is the make it or break it episode for me.
Her back isn’t even that big i don’t understand her character at all
LWO gonna be around until Puerto Rico before being sent back to being a jobber faction.
Imagine a WWE show without recaps, the time they'd have available...
Moxley murdered Don Callis right before Kenny Omega's match on Dynamite last week  Solo murders Owens right before Sami's match on SmackDown tonight  Moral of the story: tell your allies to leave the arena before your main event match lol
Does anyone even give a shit about riddle anymore lmfao?
am i the only one that is insanely pumped for imperium and brutes? slobberknocker stuff
Watching NBA have it DVRed tell me if the shows good and I’ll decide if I should watch
Gonna be a good show tonight.
i'm so excited to see what happens
Im giving you one last chance to redeem yourself triple h…
The gorilla experiment? Is fox shooting on Vince
sports entertain me Hunter
Poor Michael Cole.
Here's hoping Hunter at least has majority control on Smackdown
I have a feeling Pat McAfee will be back
Still haven't added "No Chance" or "You're Fired" to opening tag
I guess Shane wasn't at Mania lol
Give Snoop a 2nd HoF ring for the mania improv
Can’t believe this is the Smackdown after mania. Wrestlemania feels like it was a month ago already with all the discourse lol.
I’m betting on a repeat of Mondays speech from triple h.
Roman can't beat Cody fair and square
I miss WrestleMania Weekend, it was cool to see pictures of wrestlers from different companies meetup.
Here we wait with baited breath to see if this will indeed be a mostly-Trips show
It's fight nite
Where’s Triple H???
Lmaaoooo shit already changed
I hope they canceled the "we're fine" speech...
This doesn't look like Triple H
I thought Triple H was coming out i guess not
I love Butch
Props to Sheamus for still working with a bad back and that Banger of a match in WM
Well, at least they are opening with a match, instead of half an hour promo and a squash match.
WWE: oh you thought we were gonna let you decide if you wanted to continue watching this right off the bat. Get comfy pal.
A match to start the show? This isn’t sports entertainment, pal
The hijacking’s seems to be going well ! Fucking smarks
He let us start off with a match to calm our nerves 🥹
Sami v Jey should be saved for a PPV
I love imperium
So the Brock v Cody thing got me thinking, what if Cody’s road to the title is that he basically has to beat everyone else who has failed against Roman to prove that the spot was truly meant for him.  I doubt that it’s the real rationale, but I think it would add a neat layer to the story
Wow. Aitch turned into three European men.
Vince is not running the show you know how Butch is being booked
Did they say HHH was opening Smackdown or did we just assume it?
So uhhhh where's Hunter?
Banger before Banger after Banger as a consequnce of Banger therefore Banger
Kaisers coat twirl is so damn fluid.
LWO!
sweet LWO is staying around(until it gets Vinced)
I been under the weather and forgot to turn smackdown on. Did Trips open the show and say the same exact thing?
Loving Ludwig's bounce.
WWE is coming out swinging, I see.
God I love Gunther, hope Ilja gets out in the main roster soon
Kaiser is freaking chiseled yo
Would like for Kaiser and Vinci used for more tag team matches instead of just managing Gunther
Would lowkey like to see judgement day vs the brawling brutes if they all move to smackdown
Butch vs Vinci sounds like a 2.0 work-rate match. An NA No. 1 Contender match any era
LFG Wade!
Gio got that main roster fluff going on
I feel like such a conspiracy theorist thinking to myself "DOES MAGGLE SOUND DEFEATED? DOES HE SOUND CRUSHED? IS HE HIDING HIS PAIN?!"
That double team was beast
Ok that was sick
Is that same ref from Cody vs Roman?  Man he needs more ring awareness if so lol
Man I am so happy that SS is gonna be in Detroit this year
Holland has really improved. He was not ready for this spot a year ago.
Holland use to be a rugby player? Makes since
The finder manipulation always makes my skin crawl.
Oh shit that was cool
Alabama Slam is such a funny move
Love sheamus
Was it just me or was there a snap sound when he did the finger breaking move?
Let's go fella
one of Triple H’s greatest feats was making Sheamus someone people care about. He was treading water FOR YEARS under Vince
GUNTHER is an animal. He’s the best in the world at making his offense look real without actually hurting his opponents.
These two work so well together.
I love Gunther man, he’s so much fun to watch
Smack down is always a fun time
that was quite good
The Brawling Brutes win the match
Ridge with the POOOOUUUNCE!!!
wasn't Sheamus a heel going into WM
Good shit
BANGER!
That was great.
Is Butch kinda yellow in complexion?
imperium rocks but i kinda miss nxt vinci and the pairing of ludwig/gunther (minus the random chopping)
Great opening with a long match. We love it.
The layout of the rest of the show is gonna be solid. No women’s wrestling tonight though.
Why isn’t Gunther dancing!? Damn you Vince!!!!
I'm really torn on when to do the rematch. I'd love it at Summerslam because it's very telegraphed to do it at Mania 40 on Philly.   Although Cody doing the rocky thing at Mania 40 is insane as well
Imagine throwing Solo out of the match only for him to come back and interfere. DAMN DUMB
I just got in. What did HHH say?
fucking recaps
Brock is a rat
That look on Romans face when Brock came out. Gold.
There's already more wrestling on this show than there was RAW
Poor Cody
Paul set it all up.
God Cody really did take that first F5 with all of his face
Cody will have to be out a bit to sell the beat down, but they'll need someone to continue the feud for him in his stead and face Lesnar on a mic, perhaps... at open mic night
Cody vs Brock is going to be so awesome
Just tuned in, what have I missed??
They’ve done it again! Masters of the recap! Let’s go Cody!!!!
....so now, everyone, if any one ever asks you the meaning of "getting your candy ass whooped from pillar to post" refer to the footage you've just seen.
Hey Kaylaaaa
Yeah Brock’s mad cause his match went on first **LOL**
Hey, man
C'mon call him an idiot
Whose side is Paul Heyman on?
Happy Passover, Paul
Now Jimmy is the missing one?
Paul Heyman becomes the Manager for Solo Sikoa, when or if he decides to split from Roman.
Hmm, asking Paul to explain Lesnar’s actions, interesting
So are both Cody and Roman gonna be gone until after Backlash? Brock's attack could be a way of writing Cody off for a few weeks and then they'll have their match in Saudi Arabia.
Cheap ass smoke machine 😭
Roman about to be all alone next Wrestlemania.
Problems??
Solo attacking Jey tonight
I LIKE WHAT THWYRE COOKING HERE
Don’t you disrespect Sami like that, Heyman. Sami’s the reason the Uso’s were in the main event😤
*Viking experience you mean
Is Solo psycho enough to attack his brother?
Wtf
I’d like something like J getting whooped and solo coming to help and J stopping it. Wanting a fair fight. Shinnanagins ensue
Foreman rules. Deserves a movie. I just with bio films didn’t make everyone look like ai cartoon people. I don’t get it?
Well in MY house Ricochet is the most over wrestler on the roster!
Yo fr tho where's Braun
I miss WrestleMania
they already recapped mania at the start now they do it again but will still images
So, if this was the Weekend’s 4th time performing the Mania theme, does that now make them the “WWE’s Favorite Band?”
That's not your husband Valhalla
In ring ricochet is the coolest wrestler they have but outside of the ring he’s the least cool
Fart theme song
Damn, pray for Rick O’Shea
To all the people losing their shit over Braun not being there, hope you can calm down now.
I saw a video of Andrew Tate on twitter, thought it was Ricochet for a second.
Would Ricochet's chain add to his flipping, if he would to lose it would it throw him off
So they can ban these tag partners but can’t ban the bloodline?
Vallhalla put some damn shoes on ya nasty
That was the most Sarah Logan has done since she returned
That looked painful.
Splat!
Banning people from ringside. I feel like we'll see a bit more of that in the wake of the terrible officiating of the Night 2 main event.
Did these two ever have a match in PWG?
I bet Ivar hasn’t even had 5 singles matches on the main roster
Viking Raiders are mid but Ivar got a mean spinning heel kick lol
Ricochet can definitely get him up, I've seen him done similar stuff before
Ivar could actually be a good singles star. Hes so much more interesting than erik
always love a Ricochet win
Let’s go
What a surprise!
What if this ends up with Solo attacking Jey but Sami actually saves him? Even after everything Jey has done?   That would honestly make me tear up.
Imagine if Ricochet and Roderick Strong had a feud. Awful promos but amazing matches.
Months of making Valhalla look strong and be unbeatable just for Richocet to beat one of them pretty easily
Good shit
Cool quick match between the two
Here is your winner  ~~BAE~~ **RICOCHET**
Ricochet almost got absorbed Majin Bu style
Sami’s not feeling very ucey.
Sami such good boi
Wise words from ko
Smile!
KO jealousy gonna take over...
I’m joking — I think — but I’m wondering what would be more likely to happen tonight: Brock interrupts the main event and destroys Sami… or Kevin does.
Okay, Smackdown is still good.
Sami and Jey will be a tag team very soon I think. 😁
Countdown to KO begins
I wonder what's next for LA Knight.
Oh bay bay Liv and Raquel
now for tonight's main event:  those precious moments when Liv is on my television
I like in ring Sami with the mic not the prerecorded segments that feel flat
That was a great segment. Feeling conflicted on the tag team titles, and the sense of obligation.
i love moments like that with ko and sami where people have a normal disagreement as actual friends do instead of the wwe classic one small argument means beat the fuck out of the other person
Shotzi’s taking another loss for sure.
Whatever happened to dark Liv sitting in the back being creepy?
Was the tank broken for Mania?
Shotzi and Natalya almost had a high five / fist pound mix up but luckily they corrected it.
one quarter jobber entranced
 Lmao Liv looks like the champion on that graphic
"Ballsy Baddies" Miz in shambles.
Ballsy baddies….ehh
If anyone should be #1 contenders, It's Ronda & Shayna
wait, what's the explanation in kayfabe for Ronda/Shayna not getting the tag team title match?
Didn't Ronda & Shayna win the women's showcase tag match? If so why aren't they the number 1 contenders? I can't stand Ronda but that doesn't make sense to me.
Shotzi and nearly murdering herself on a suicide dive.
That could’ve gone very badly.
Bushwacker Butch getting some love from Cole 💜
Okay, sigh of relief. Shotzi's neck is intact. Fucking hell
that's a crazy move by Liv and Raquel  Shotzi and  Natty ought to use that knee lift as a double team with a Russian Legsweep
The name was a compromise for getting women on the show
Everyone women suddenly has that tornado DDT in their arsenal when they face Raquel so that she can counter it.
2-woman Sliced Bread Number 2. So... Number 4?
Booioo
Missing the show. How’s the first hour been? Does it feel like Vince’s hands have been on it?
Well that was fast.
Shotzi Jesus Christ
Playing video games, Moss? Woods? What are you, *losers*? ***Nerds***!?
5 minutes till the Game according to my rundown
Shotzi likes to do a lot of moves that she is only about 80% sure she can do.
YEAH
that was like 2 minutes lol
YEAH
"I know" lol
4th time in seven days we’ve had to watch Raquel Rodriguez btw
KNIGHT IS HERE TO SPIT FACTS
LA KNIGHT LETS GO
3 matches within the hour. I don't think that's Vince, y'all.
He’s not wrong
Is he over?  YEAH!!
It's about damn time. YEAH
Shotzi looks like someone who’s never gonna win a singles match again. Her stock plummeted after that match with Ronda.
Of course Xavier would be playing 2K.
Why do the women’s matches not including the upper card tier women always seem so dysfunctional?
Kevin has looked so unhappy since they won the tag titles, like almost sad.
Woah La!
YEAHHH!!!!! YEAH YEAH YEAAHHHHH!!!
KNIGHT BOIS
Bro, that controller expensive
LA Knight time, YEAH
Hey I remember this segment from a month ago!
Yeahhhhh
La knight and Emma's boyfriend!!!! LFGGGGGG
Yeahhhhh!
bad form Knight, bad form
ITS HAITCH TIME
Ps5 controler
conspiracy theory commercial break time
I can't wait for Ballsy Baddies vs Submission Sorority.
He's a monster.
YAY Madcap and L. A. Knight!! 😊
here comes the nothing's changing speech again
YEAH!
I hope Brock F-5’s his ass
What are the odds Big E returns somehow tonight?
YYYYEEEAAAHHH
Xavier was chilling when AJ was throwing controllers across the room.. then again this is a Dualsense lol
All weekend...the opportunity's....and they use LA to put over WWE2K23 on Smackdown
I really think Men On A Mission deserve to be in the HOF.
On the last match WWE if you want to push Raquel, have her pin the opponents lol, unless we are going to do a double push here
I hope they have a draft soon
King of Kings theme W
Hhh still gets a pop
NOTHING WILL CHANGE YALL!!!!
Triple h seems like he would be a good uncle
Not Chief Content Officer?
His best theme idgaf
Listen to that Vince, they love his vision
I’ve never prayed so much in my life
Wasn’t he labeled as Chief Content Officer on Raw? Now he’s just Hall of Famer
Can’t help but feel King of Kings is sending a message a little bit.
I swear if he touches on anything you just said Michael
In this business…
Deep breaths, deep breaths
Now how much of the game does HHH have to play
Really wonder what hhh is gonna talk about! I’m soooo intrigued
uhhhh why are his eyes so misty
Triple H foreshadows potential death? Subscribe to my Patreon for more.
Your saying the same shit you said Monday
Now he will say everything will stay the same, while Vince is writing up Monday's Raw.
Alright that was enough haitch let’s move on
Is triple h bald these days or just chooses to shave his head?
DONT CHEER FOR THIS
Don't you talk to us about fulfilling dreams, Trips. Not after what you did
Double counting the attendance again
Hopefully Triple H called spot check
hes just posturing for his new boss
Lol who will stop making announcements first khan or HHH
Calm down everyone
HES SAYINF RHE EXACT SAME THING
live earnings call
Draft
Compensating much?
Casual Portland fans
Lmao a draft
Did you also break the record for fans who shit their pants?
Ayyyy we’re getting the draft. Good shit to hear.
I swear I've heard this before....?
I’m not sure if I’m ready
Finally another draft
Is he bragging about how much money we gave them?
“Suck it” - Triple H in regards to the future
Good, desperately needed draft!!
thats it? the draft?
I knew it was the draft
lmao
The Draft?!????
Yessssss draft !
Yes a draft!!!!!
yes tell me the future without your garbage DX catchphrases please
the totally set in stone and strongly enforced WWE Draft
Bigger draft than ever? Every single Superstar eligible?  Oh shit, we getting some call-ups!
Gee golly I sure can't wait for the draft
“In just a few short weeks it is once again time to get ready to SUCK IT”
Ayy an actual announcement!
That smirk after "change the game". I see you, Trips.
oh shit
Well he didn't mention the draft Monday
does this include NXT
Man we know the record is broken i hate when they keep boasting about this shit
For a SECOND I thought he was actually gonna introduce Vince.
So is Adam Pierce drafting against himself?
Rhea 🔥
So this is where the nxt call-ups will happen
Oh nice, new judgement day shirt I'll have to get.
 LETS GOOOOO
Finn losing a piece of his haircut because of that cut
![gif](giphy|69QKM6Epv09HnSYZtg|downsized)
Ain't judgment day on RAW? Fuck u mean they might break up
Can Adam Pierce get relegated to RAW, someone to Smackdown so we can get some brand competition again.
Surprised Finn didn’t clock him for having him lose as the Demon again
Too sweet!
Figured I’d listen to what Triple H had to say before asking, so why did that Sean Ross Sapp guy tweet an “Oh brother” when it was announced Triple H was gonna be on Smackdown?
Bron, Indi(if she drops the title) to RAW. Ilja to Smackdown to feud with GUNTHER
Triple H is spending his sale money on a new host body and will be back to compete in the WWE
Would love it for them to do a month long draft again, like what they did in 05.
Finns shirt design is like the top of his staples head
Trips or any C-level suits will announce anything on TV show. Press releases or dirtsheet leaks are the routes info will be released.
Good glad, so they unify Roman's titles into a single title and Raw gets a new champ, feels like Cody and Roman will be on different brands, Cody wins the Rumble again and chooses Roman immediately, sounds good to me
Right who called it earlier?? I seen someone say HHH will come out, say some bullshit and then introduce Rhea lmao
Rhea's theme is so much better than her old one
Let's go Mami!!!
So there's gonna be an actual brand split again? Cool
If Rhea's smackdown champ how not intact can a draft make them?
The only thing I'm excited for is a new announce team on RAW
It's a lottery unless they have people to pick for each show.
Is Rhea a Babyface or heel?
Triple H could have just told us all of that from his chair.💁‍♂️
Oh hey, it's Finn. He seems okay after his Demon transformation
Wish it was like smackdown vs raw times where each brand had its own wrestlers instead of the hodge podge it's been.
Ya know, I’m sure happy that the SmackDown Women’s Championship is now just treated like small asset to The Judgement Day.
Interesting how the first member of Judgment Day, Damian Priest, was the only person from the group to not have a match at Mania.
Is she making her voice deeper?
That son of a bitch Dominick. I just noticed him that garbage!
Trips with the swerve
well technically it's not "impossible" because Charlotte had to be dethroned 13 times before this to be 14 time champ
The Judgment Day getting drafted to SmackDown, SmackDown getting ready to feel like 1997 with all these stables.  Judgment Day, Imperium, LWO, The Bloodline, Brawling Brutus.
She's not lying
Rhea is too cool to be a true heel.
no please no more edge
ACKNOWLEDGE HER
So what happened to the fire Vince chants?
Judgment Day are now just valets for Rhea lmao kind of sad to see
Draft would mean something if we didn’t see the brand exclusives showing up on both shows anyways. Like Judgment Day was on RAW, now they are on SmackDown just like that
The way he said "sicko" is so funny
Ah god why talk about Edge. Move on.
Again, it’s not impossible, because Charlotte is literally 14 times champion. You’re the 14th woman to beat her for the championship
Did Priest not get the memo they were transitioning from vaguely supernatural to football hooligan?
Staples in your head sounds horrific.
Roxanne debut leggo
Damn I just realised it was April 1st that Night 1 was on. All championship wins should be invalidated now.
The draft would be fun is the shows actually felt different. If RAW was a "wrestling" show and SD an "entertainment" show or vice-versa, then yeah yeah it would be fun to occasionally mix up 3 or 4 of those people every couple years.  But these since 2007 have just always been the same style of shows with different wrestlers.
Edge beating the demon makes no sense
we rise👆🏻
Smackdown will draft first and take Roman, Raw will draft second and take Rollins.  Third, I'm thinking Cody goes to Smackdown. Fourth, maybe Gunther to Raw? Then Theory to Smackdown to trade IC and US title cuz why not.
Phrasing Rhea lol
Good call if NXT callups are included but aint pretty much RAW and SMACKDOWN stars are pretty much showing up on both shows if need be right
Isn’t that the point of a hell in a cell?
I can’t lie, I would still be wrapped up in bandages if I was Finn. Mfer looks fresh.
HEAT
Lmao haha haha 😂
"Destroyed"  Charlotte was laughing and applauding like 30 seconds after the pin but sure, destroyed
The demon should have won
You suck!!!!!
>let's talk about edge!  Finn, please, let him go, it's not good to obsess with him
THEY ARE SO FUCKING LOUD LMAOOOOOFJFJFBDJDHDJD
lmaooooooooo
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Ex-con Dom doesn't deserve this treatment!
Damn they’re really drowning him out 😂😂😂
Lmao Cole
THEY'RE BIG CASSING DOM SKJSFKSJ
Dom with the nuclear heat😭
Yoooo dom got that good heat
Dom trying so hard not to smile hahaha.
Rhea whispering sweet nothings in his ear
Wow that is some heat
Omg she's doing "Ladies Who Lunch" from Company
WILL THE JUDGEMENT DAY CALL ME THE F WORD?  Finn - No, known ally   Damien - No, maybe if I asked and said it was okay  Dominic - No, he's a good Catholic boy  Rhea - I mean probably
Love a good crowd
Dom is such a great heel.  This is amazing
Dom is so good in this chicken shit heel role just listen to that heat
Bobby fish meme?
Fucking hell, this is damn near elias in seattle heat
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 feel that heat
A draft with split titles would be better, but a draft is a win regardless imo.  After the Main Event trial run matches, I'm curious who gets the callup.  Need more Cameron Grimes in my life
Woah...damn dom
Dicelo Dom
Dom has improved some much on the mic
Someone ask him about Vickie
Con-Dom! Con-Dom!
This is fantastic!
Notice that the title card announcing Triple H just said 'Hall of Famer'. On Monday, it said, 'Chief Content Officer'. Both times he was announced as, 'Hall of Famer' but interesting change nonetheless for the conspiracies to go wild.
<Laughs in Bully Ray>  Duh heat!
Incredibly awesome...go Dom.
Dom is so Iverson its not even funny.
That was incredible! Dom is TEFLON
Infrequent wwe watcher is that crowd noise legit cause that was loud
Crazy heat for Dom
Dumb question, yall think BB and Rey vs Dom and Damian is headlining or Cody vs Lesnar?
I know we shouldn’t treat the titles as props, but I want to see Dom win the US title now just to elevate the stakes of this feud.
The tassels on Dom’s pants remind me of Diesel. I think it’s time for Dom to launch Rey into a production truck.
The heat for Dom is absolutely ***insane,*** my god
The real heel move dom is doig is growing that awful mustache
Bunny was invited to be on commentary at Mania, he shouldn't have gotten involved in the match
Bunny, you're my friend, but Dom is my brother.  Paraphrased
It’s funny because they don’t have all night
Bad Bunny is gonna wreck Priest.
Priest looks like he hasn't slept in days, you can tell he's conflicted about dropping Bad Bunny
I can't remember the last time someone got this much good heat.
Damien Priest and The Revolution
I hope you can find him in my heart to forgive me, this guy bruh.
why did they use canned heat for Damien lol
The LWO
LATINO WORLD ORDER!
The LWO still lives!
Cole is on a goddamn war path tonight
Does Kevin Nash know you raid his Super Shredder costume closet, Priest?
So who is rheas next feud with?
Okay the lwo is an actual thing again fair enough
I'm guessing Zelina has a match tonight?
I got bricked up when Sam said “accompanied by the LWO”
#LWO
Now that I know that Joaquin Wilde is Asian, I can’t  get over him being in the LWO.
Lol they cut to an ad about bad bunny
I loved these shirts as a kid but getting a few of them (shirts tanktops) incl shipping now its $240AUD  No way :(  Wweshop need other shipping options for Australia
This seems like an easy 2+ million rating for SD.
I haven’t played a wrestling game since the GameCube games. Is 2K23 really that good or is the commercial they play just typical fake WWE hype?
LwO what's this
Nice tease.
Cole you made no sense lol. "Here's the guy that said he didn't want to hurt his father, get in the ring and fight your dad!" What?
Did Michael Cole just become a SoundCloud rapper?
Im convinced  Dom.has been watching Gringos Locos tapes, the only thing missing is him doing some mid match aerobic exercises
Michael Cole really said ENOUGH
dom is like everyone playing a wrestling game and emoting all the time
Anyone buy the chalkline trucker hats? I'm getting the Cody one. Wonder how they fit
Need a Dom and Cole altercation at some point. Imagine the heat for Dom.
Dom wearing tassels is a choice.
Several years ago:”He’s just a teenager!”  Cole tonight:”He’s not even a child!”
Cole and Bad Bunny Vs. Dominik and Damien Priest at Backlash
They should give Dom Roman’s old vest.
Wade had a point
good guy Wade coming to Dom's defense
EXCELLENT catch by Dom there. He really does care about his Dad.
Santos is like an inch taller than rey? Wow.
Bro why do they have to show that creepy af woman every time they cut to commercials
Counter Michinoku!
I choose to believe that "Punishment time" line was Wade referencing Priest's past.
Zelina ded
VINTAGE CHRIS JERICHO
Just realised Dom's pants have the WCW Rey design. Classic!
Dial it up
Priest always hard carrying in these tag matches lol
"Come on champ" "Oh shit, she's coming....feets don't fail me now"
Santos' finisher is so cool. Priest is a real heel for depriving us of it.
Love Zelina but damn that’s a mix match for her
Woohoooo. Another great match
And there's your Alter Bridge for tonight
rick moranis backstage for some reason
If they’re defending against liv and raquel the fuck was the point of the four way tag at mania lol
So glad Riddle is back. He’s so goofy 🙃
I fully expect some shenanigans. No way they give this match away for free.
Shew Nakakura back
Damn Boozer came out and said Shin is back next week. Before the video played
Woooowwww NEXT WEEK!?!!
Ooooh, 25mins for the main event segment / match
How’s the show at work?
i love sami sm
JUST BELIEVE HIM JEY
Damn
Lmao Paul In the back😭
NOOOOOOO
Fuck bro
I’m sure hell be fine for Monday lol
Interesting!
This gear is fire
Jey’s beard is juicy
IMMA  GET  EM
Trainer?! NO it's the cold spray you need!!!
Jey not in the pantaloons doesn't look right
Weird to see Jey coming out here with no belts. Hasn’t made an entrance without a belt since Thunderdome I believe
Welp...Gametime, Sami.
Les go main event jay baby!
Main event Jey let's go
I like the new Jey outfit
Jey will lose again and the clock will start ticking.
I thought the Woods/Knight match would be tonight
YEAH
There's a great irony seeing the USFL being promoted
Uh oh...Kevin is gonna get attacked in the medical room isn’t he?
Jey in his singles Top Guy gear
Over 3 more commercial breaks still to come I bet...
Becky and Lita feel like a forced team. But so do Liv and Raquel. Not sure what I'd like to see happen. They need to form some women's tag teams and make them stick
Fun fact: Despite going by his middle name Michael for 25 years, Michael Cole's real first name is actually Sean.
cody sami roman triple threat at summerslam?
That’s a pretty cool looking tron. Like how half of it is red and the other half is blue; like the titles.
Main Event Jey ☝🏽
Fuck you Wade! The ODDITIES 4 LIFE!
he got some new ink?? looks like it
Speak of the Devil...
Another bloodline interference
Gonna get interesting
Public Enemy No. 2 Solo Sikoa
Cody coming out to stop Solo
I know they try to make it feel like he’s always here by having him involved in the story, but Roman not being on the second show after mania really sucks. I hope this draft gives us a champ that’s actually present.
Maybe Solo will unleash a savage attack on Sami post match and Jey makes him stop?
"The problem" shirt? Might be a foreshadow for a turn?
Eww wtf was that shit?
Gonna wait for the sequel, "The exorcist pope"
in the trainer's room, he'll be at ringside shortly
Partly thanks to Shelty B, I can't tell the difference between an Exploder and a T-Bone
avalanche exploder goddamn!
Exploder!
Jey about to drop the people's elbow.
Solo Sikoa & The lone wolf would be a great tag team....
That exploder suplex while Jey was trash talking Sami was beautiful, also Blue Thunder Bomb appearance!
Solo needs to have mean mug face 24/7 cuz as of lately he always looks scared
Damn solo
Solo on a mission
SOLO YOU WILL PAY
Solo Auditore da Sikoa
Umaga (and for some reason, his manager Estrada) used to swear in Samoan and it'd go right passed the censors. I *think* the Kabuki Warriors used to cuss in Japanese, but I wouldn't know.
I'm tired of these bloodline cheats
there's still a couple minutes left
PTSD
☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽
I really thought solo was going to turn on his brother right there
Ref just bailed.
Solo has a bloodlust
5 minutes left, what all's gonna happen? Jey looks like he wants Solo to stop
Solo is the only person winning Bloodline matches
IS JEY GONNA STOP SOLO???
Match over. 5 minutes left. I smell post-match shenanigans.
Yup triple h is still in charge
Bro they gotta stop letting Solo at ringside in kayfabe
So jey is a shithead
Yeah Jey! Stop him boy!
 Yoooo
Fuck You Solo till the end of time    I'll say that behind a keyboard, becaust there's no fucking chance in hell I'm saying it to your face.
OH! THE DRAMA!!!
GOD DAMN YOU JEY WTF
COME ON JEY
Jey is just gonna do it himself
Lets go jey
Oh shit riddle
BROOOOOO
:( we really thought
BRRROOOOOOO!!!
Here comes Matt Riddle to make the save
WHAT THE FUCK
Looool damn
Bruh
FINISH HIM, JEY
They really are cooking filetmignon
Man I just can’t with riddle in trunks
So Riddle is allying with KOZayn?
still with the speedos i see
Riddle looks weird in trunks
Really good episode.
So riddle is the one to take the belt ? Woah
riddle needs his shorts back
A wild riddle appears
All the meh
Much better use of Riddle, jesus. The Miz segment made 0 sense
riddle look naked
A Solo/Riddle feud could be pretty fun.
Vikings are my cue for a piss break.
Rey is now 1-2 since becoming being a Hall of Famer.  Maybe he's not that great...  (/s)
Can we get one NXT callup tonight?
Of all the reasons they could have gone with, this is up there with the worst.
Vince probably has a sniper in the rafters threatening HHH
That's it, just to advertise the draft? meh
Dom's gonna beat Roman.  He has his own group to stop the Bloodline interference.  Would help elevate new star to the next level.
Damien Priest is a rat bastard
Why didn't they wait for this to be Riddles return?
Probably a pipe dream but what if they turned this all into an angle of a power struggle for control of WWE.  End it with a survivor series style match like invasion for control of the company.  I’d they did it, it would be interesting to see who is own Vince’s team.  Triple H would no doubt be former NXT guys.  Rollins, Ciampa, Kross, Owens, Bálor
I don't want to see Kevin Hart on the television screen!
We still doing this?
These goddamn recaps and kevin hart man fuck you we saw it 8 times already
Some of you have weird time perception
The SloMo of Snoop’s people elbow is a beautiful sight though lmao
If HHH says the same shit ….
If HHH says the same shit, expect mayhem from the crowd lol
This feels like twisting the knife.
Giovanniii Vinciii
WHERE IS GREEN SHIRT GUY???
They’re putting Triple H at 8:59-9:00 turn so they artificially generate a boom in ratings with his generic speech about nothing changing
Brawling Brutes need to take an L, Butch returns as pete dunne
That was a great team work
I love the ~~Raw~~ Smackdown After Mania
Great match. Seems HHH is at the helms tonight at least. No way Vince lets that match go as long.
Already better than Raw.
I wanna forget Monday..
Papa Haitch or Vince McDonald, whoever’s airing this video, please stop. I haven’t gotten over it yet
At least the editing crew tries their best to make the recaps watchable
Hard to imagine over 2 million watch this weekly.
Cody Rhodes will go back to being Dashing and will feature in dance-offs against Naomi. Calling it now.
Problems?  EXCUSE YOU Paul???
Damn this Ricochet theme sucks
Trying to explain the Brock angle by addressing in a weird way like "Brock told his sister's hair dresser's cousin and that Cody dude is one wild cat!" and saying nothing.
Roman reigns vs jey uso seems inevitable. But I think Cody Rhodes vs Roman  is the summerslam match. Maybe they slow burn the jey uso match to Wrestlemania?
What did I miss this first half hour??  Somebody plzzzzzz respond!
Well, at least we now have confirmation that Brock beating up Cody for 10 minutes wasn't something that was planned.
two fun ass matches and very little dumb shit so far. is it safe?
Vince wouldn’t have booked Ricochet to win that clean.
Ricochet: "Baby can u say my name like u do Imperium?" Samantha::...umm..ba.. baby,I'll try."
You can tell Vince isn’t in the building actual good wrestling is taking place.
She’s not even jacked enough to show her back off like that
Take a drink everytime Vince is mentioned in the live thread.
Lol at everyone who bitched earlier about no women’s match
Women in the first hour, this is a Trips vibe to me
Actually storyline development? Two great matches? What is happening?
I’ll always be here for a Liv vs Shotzi match tbh
remember when Liv and Rhea had an ongoing storyline together, it's weird to think of now
No WoMeNs MaTcHeS tOnIgHt
No matter how crappy the rest of the product gets, this Bloodline stuff will always be must-see TV
Remember the beginning of this year when these two were seen as potential main eventers this year? They could both be doing so much better the tag titles really drag some of the competitors in the singles division down.
Sami is slipping back into his conspiracy angle
I really feel that in a gesture of good faith, Kermit should update us on the Vince McMahon/HHH situation.
RAW being inseparable from Monday nights is killing the after Mania show vibes as long as SmackDown remains on FOX. RAW is only the flagship show in kayfabe now, SD is the real flagship now.
First time I am watching this live. Is the show-to-commercial break ratio normal? This is insane.
This is a lot better than Raw
I need more Liv
For being a Hart, Natalya is ass in the ring.
oh god somebody please guard the door to gorilla
That was such an awkward segment before Knight came
Time for a repeat.
It's a press release   Everyone resume your normal bitching
To be honest, I didn't understand his graphic saying Chief Content Officer last time because that's like putting "Creative Writer" or "Booker" or any of the alternate terms on it. It's basically saying "this is a written TV show" on a show that, while we all know is entertainment, you don't usually slap people in face with that fact on purpose, ya know?
“Hey me again! Nothings changing, I promise guys!”
It feels kind of gross hearing a guy come out and talk about how much money they made off fans.
DRAFT! DRAFT! DRAFT! DRAFT! DRAFT!
wwe draft means nothing ahahah
Yes, the draft is back!
Roman to raw with the universal title and the wwe title stays in smack down?   Lmao thank god I don’t work for WWE right guys
Rhea’s cool and all but I thought this was leading to a call up
That changing the game statement seemed to have significance
Thank god this announcement wasnt about V Mcmahon and his paedo stash
The draft has generally meant nothing so I don't have high hopes.
Triple H seems to be taking notes from the competition. Special announcement = ratings, no matter if it's actually something important or not.
Did not think about the draft coming back. Disappointing
I CANT RISE IM TUCKED VERY NICELY UNDER A BLANKET CURRENTLY IM SORRY MAMI
ACKNOWLEDGE HER
Dom the goat hahahaha
Dom sees the amount of heat Vince's mustache got and just goes for it.
“Guys, the draft will change WWE forever… and now, here’s some bozos from Raw!”
WWE logic.  Have Finn take a chair shot to the skull and have him appear on tv when that’s usually a write off.  But Edge is on another hiatus.  You know you could’ve just uhhh, gave him the win
Dom gonna be pick #1 in the draft
Lordy the absolute heat....
Vince is gone, YES!!!
The child abuse gang loses and throws a tantrum. Shocking
I hope this is the beginning of the much deserved Damien Priest push. Dude's way too good to be forever the stooge that he currently is.
Happy they’re treating Nakamura returning as a good deal  Until Vince has him lose against Madcap
wtf they cut out LA Knight match??
No god please don’t be actually injured
“We the Ones” Without Belts
ADRENALINE IN MY SOUL  THE REPLACEMENT HAS GOTTA BE CODY RHODES  E: never mind. My dumbass thought it's a tag match, my head is still at Wrestlemania Night 1
I know the endgame is Jey v Roman but Jey v Solo would be a killer build up if they wanna hold on off on Roman
That wasn't Solo, that was just one of *eight* Phantom of the Arena gimmick characters that have been a part of WWE over the last twenty years. Could it have been Goldust? The Slamhtom? Phantasio? Who knows?
Triple H booking next weeks shows hoping Vince doesn’t change them
i really am glad sami has this theme back
Sami Zayn better win tonight.
Sami looks so legit with the belts
What the hell was that amazon commercial lol
Exploder superplex!
I find it really funny Cole is straight up like "Yeah it was Solo who took KO out"  Cole we didn't see who did it, it could have been anybody!
Well... I guess now the narrative has to change from vince is in control. We are going back to people taking pictures an hour to 45 minutes before raw next week saying no one came. Love the toxcity of people telling me to enjoy wrestling... but not to enjoy it 🤣
YES JEYYYY
Noooo
Who knew the bloodlines death would come wearing a speedo
That was definitely a hhh smackdown
😂😂😂  Don’t let HHH cook you bozos
I'll be honest, I preferred the ending to Raw than that tonight.
Cole emphasized the Matt in Matt Riddle pretty hard almost like to remind us he still has both names lmao
According to the internet all week, Vince was firmly back in creative as the top guy. Now they're saying he's not in Portland and made 1 minor change. So which is it? Is he the top guy, or is he just advising? This entire week was such as overreaction
Sami sounds very scripted
Everyone here dissecting every tiny thing on the show to decide which old man made the decision is hilarious. I'm not even mad
So far feels like a HHH show. Is there light at the end of the tunnel fellas?
I mean, is the Bloodline crumbling? Their goal was to destroy the Bloodline and Roman survived. Surely they can’t feel done until the Bloodline has fully disbanded.
Already teasing breaking up Sami & Owens. Wow
Alright boys, pack it up. Vince is running the show. #BallsyBaddies
Vince: "Why does Max Dupri look like he's in a biker gang?"
Yeah it's a repeat of Monday, but worth repeating if they did that well. Celebrate the victories, every company does it
UFC is part of the draft isnt it?
Finn Balor is a dork.
So literally no LA Knight again...? The match with Xavier?
Did LA knight get cut :( or was it promised for another show?
Ugh. This just gets worse.
ENDEAVOR USING ITS UFC GUYS AGAIN!
Riddle as the only surprise on both shows after Mania? Zzz
what does anyone see in riddle man
The same person who wrote Mondays show did not write tonight's show.
Sorry I need to vent somewhere, to cut a long story short my friend was in a physical and emotionally abusive relationship for over a year. They broke up a few months ago, tonight while out for drinks she saw him and they chatted, after a few more bars, he called her and has been roped back into him. It hurts to see, hes an actual sociopath and knows how to control her. My friends and I tried to get her to see sense, but we couldnt. It feels like a dagger through me. I dont know what to do.
ADRENALINE   IN MY SOUL  IT’S ALMOST TIME  FOR THE WRESTLING SHOW
I don't know about y'all but the way the ref counted the 3 seemed very Vince like to me
Whoever is really in charge - Roman over Cody was a horrible booking decision.   Stories end, the bloodline has run its course.
How to tell is Vince is in the building: Listen to Cole.
Lol at people weeks ago saying that this Bloodline stuff should be considered for Emmys
Oof Sami went from the Bloodline to Riddle. It's a far fall from the island of relevancy I guess.
Everyone should watch the show without making assumptions regarding Vince or HHH's involvement (which I know is a MASSIVE undertaking for redditors).  Without knowing either man's impact on creative for tonight's show, it should be watched from a neutral POV and let yourself decide if it's good or bad.
This whole Bloodline crumbling thing would hit harder if Roman had lost?
I'm aboard the 'hope Vince was just there at Raw and will stay the f away going forward' train and hoping that proves right tonight. This looks like a STACKED night par for the course with Smackdown let's just hope it stays that way all night.
This is a solid card. Let's go!
Crossing my fingers this show is good.
Freaking sucks man, I have no juice/no interest going into SD for the first time in months.  At least NXT was good 🤷🏾‍♂️  I never watch Dynamite but I’m in there tonight
Apparently, according to the rundown that SRS posted, there are no womens matches
I don't get the Kevin Hart thing still
☝🏼
Gunther is so fucking cool and such a better name than Walter. I can't believe anyone thought different lmao
HHH gonna announce his leaving the company huh, I would not watch WWE weekly show again.
All this coping about Vince chants… it ain’t gonna happen pal
So far it seems like monday was just a one time thing and Triple H is still running things
Well, off to a good start. Wonder what HHH’s announcement is
Cena is a spokesperson for Honda?
Triple H was a notable IC Champ too. His announcement will be that he's calling out Gunther to end the reign.
Gunther is just so *cool*. I really hope he gets a top tier title run.
Don't tell us about Raw.
why did cody call roman the viktor? the ascension haven't been around for years??
2 hours of recaps
You think we can have another wrestling match?
Solo looking bored lol
"Hey Paul can we uh, finish our interview? No? Okay"
I think I like the Vikings less than Mondays Raw.
Viking raiders getting a lot of hate but they performed so well at mania, hoping they let them do more of their high flying shit from this point on
Having a viking gimmick and calling yourself Valhalla is like an Irish man portraying an Irish character called Sheamus.
no Erik, Jimmy Uso or Braun. I feel like WWE are feeling cheap this week😂
Why is Sami suddenly acting badly?
Confirms my faith that Vince decides some of the major stories while its Triple H who will book and decide how we get there, I can work with that. Looks like H is still working the midcard while Vince still decides the direction of the main event
Boozer had the womens tag on the sheet, then everyone else posted after without it on it…
People were saying the original script didn’t have any women’s matches on it, guess Vince can do some good
They saw the backlash to no womens match on the show In the Reddit thread
Raquel has a great physique, but they gotta find a character for her. She’s just so… bland.
Liv + Shotzi / Natalya + Raquel would feel so much more natural as tag teams
Raquel seems like a total sweetheart of a human being,which makes so much worse that she is stuck with "the back" gimmick.
So far, this is night and day between RAW and SmackDown. Nothing egregious yet. Hope it stays that way
Raquel isn't bowering from Liv's closet anymore. Kinda hate it since Liv always borrowed from her other tag partners, Ruby and Rhea.
Raquel would be better off going heel and joining Dom. She'd be over the moon if she and Dom turned on Rhea.
Why was the tank not at WrestleMania? I know they were always gonna take the fall, but going down that ramp on the tank would've looked so badass.
The "Bland Botchers".
BROADCAST A UUDD TOURNAMENT ON FOX YOU COWARDS!!
Please don’t disappoint me Papa Haitch
the MILLIONS??
Ever see a man fellate a company before? Well now you have.
He’s gunna pull a CM Punk and walk out to stroke himself every week before attempting to crowd surf
This is why WWE doesn’t care how mad the IWC gets. Because they know that’s the small minority
Ok bet this is good news
Triple H is just saying the exact same thing he said on RAW
Oh God I really thought changing the Game was leading into Vince taking over the role
Rofl whoever predicted Rhea called it
Give me LA Knight vs Austin Theory
Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Whats the point on saying how well Mania did? And so he adressed nothing about Vince and the company or the merge. Nice waste of time
Finn getting booted
Subtle little too sweet to Finn. For better or worse, the dude will always be a made man and have an ally in someone about as close to the top as you can get.  Someday it should bear dividends
God the Judgment day is so fucking cool.
Finn is so hilarious man
Oh right forgot they made Finn lose
This is amazing
Good point Finn. We don't know why Edge won either.
Lmao not even marks like this guy
His upper lip looks like the ant hairs you’d get stapled to your head during a 90s hair transplant
I stand with dom!! How they the cheer that deadbeat rey and boo dom ???
Good so far, let’s just hope Vince doesn’t some how teleport his way into gorilla before the end of the show
80% of the returns/Callups under the HHH era have been shitly booked
Ya know, I like the idea of a draft because it means a potential new world champion for Raw.....but its gonna feel like a consolation prize for whoever gets it given how much focus is on Roman.
Would it be wise for the judgement day to lose at backlash too? I have a feeling they won’t let bad bunny’s team lose since he’s hosting
Oh…Shinsuke.
 #thankyouvince
Feel like it’s all a swerve and Sami is gonna be the one to turn.
Jey's in shorts! Spring is here!
I Had my raw tickets I bought up for sale.  Cancelled that due to how good tonight’s show was.  Great job papa Haitch.
Lol, nice way to wear it
Looking forward to a nice interference win in this long anticipated matchup
Oh no, is Sami gonna be all alone? or is the guy that’s all over the marketing for Smackdown gonna save the day since he hasn’t shown up yet. . .
I’m trying to believe that Raw was the scenario of Vince wanting to have one last night as the booker more-and-more as tonight goes on… this show has been a complete 180.
What a shocking conclusion.
Lmao same shit every week
Random but ok
Problem. Solved. Stay out of the Bloodline’s business.
-_-
HAHAHAHAHA GET TROLLED GUYS
Riddle? Nah this ain't it.
Man what the fuck…
RIDDLE???
Great episode goodnight all
Dammit why him
He’s back to just Riddle!
Matt Riddle is the 4th man for Team Cody? I can see it.
Where's KO?
Night and day shows with Raw and Smackdown this week.
That felt like it was the original place for Riddle to return.
Hmm, perhaps they're leading to a war of some sort? Sami, Cody, Owens, Riddle, maybe even Brock one day against the Bloodline?
The Riddle save is… something
This stupid man, I thought Jey was finally gonna turn face.
Am I dumb or does Riddle saving Sami make no sense? Like yeah Riddle had that title match on Smackdown like 8 months ago but what other reason does he have?  At least for once the baby faces are trying to save other baby faces from a beat down.
What a massive step up from Raw. Might just tune into smackdown going forward. The show was an hour shorter but had so much more good shit
Is Triple H the new Titus O'Neal now?
Triple H comes out to address the WWE Universe, just before he starts to talk Reigns come out, he's wearing his golden glove again. He gives a promo about how he's the Tribal Chief and controls the WWE Universe. Talks about all his power. He then raises his right hand *SNAPS* and the last 9 months get retconned. Vince is back in charge.... 😐😫
I don't know how much input Vince has, but it's very WWE to be having a pointless 6-man tag match, prolonging a feud that should be over.
Other than Gunther, Imperium are just geeks.
“Switching over to Monday Night Raw” Id rather not, thank you very much…
This show feels weird.  5 minutes of clips from Mania to open the show, and now another clip montage from RAW? Why???
I still can’t tell the Usos apart I’m so sorry guys I still remember when they came out slapping their thighs and screaming/dancing
Dumb fan theory but... what if vince is booking raw and HHH is booking sd and mby endeavor wants to see how the numbers in terms of viewership look? (I have no ideea what i am talking about and i also have no ideea how the bts look for this type of stuff)
Is it just me, or does this episode so far just feel like filler?
If Cole starts using more buzzwords, we’ll know why...
where are the fire vince chants buddy?
If they're doing a firm brand split once more, I actually believe Vince will be booking one of the shows and Hunter the other
I love it when my favourite brand posts record-breaking profits.
We are to tony khan / Dixie Carter territory with these announcements
Why is everyone so negative? Legit nothing has been horrible this show. Sorry that HHH isn’t announcing a show at Wembley Stadium.
Hope Vince gets drafted to the unemployment line
LWO is like the canary in the mineshaft for Vince
Anyone else EXTREMELY CONCERNED "FoxNation", probably Fox News streaming service, has religious programming?
I really didn't miss Riddle.
Nakamura still works there?
Same shit different week. Super Solo interferes for the win. Zzzzzzzz
Booooring
Vince probably called for Riddle's segment on Raw instead of it being a surprise in Smackdown, haha.
It’s almost like this is how Riddle should’ve returned, instead of that Miz Riddle stuff on RAW.  Triple H booking vs Vince booking
I want "Fire Vince" Chants tonight!!!
The fact that wwe doesn’t have Trios championships is insane
Ridge Holland just looks so shit by comparison to all of the others.  Kaiser is amazing, i think he is better than gunther tbh.
They literally did this whole angle like 3 weeks ago on RAW
People saying Dom>MJF are insane. Dom is great, but MJF is leagues ahead of him. MJF does and gets things over that Dom could never.  The whole swing band opening to his segment? Who else could get that over like MJF?
ffs Riddle always here to ruin the program
Ridge and Butch just disappeared for a month while Sheamus tagged with Drew and then came back like nothing happened when he needs backup again.
Just opening the show with a banger
Did I watch this same promo on Monday? Cause Cody is making a lot more sense in this replay.
I was gooo-GUNSHOT
![gif](giphy|LEtVuX6pmpwcw)
A rematch of Cody Rhodes and Roman Reigns?
These Fire Vince chants are deafening.
Can't wait for Jon Jones to be drafted to SmackDown
Beating Charlotte Flair for the title isn't impossible. Especially if she's been beaten 13 times before.
Good to see Joaquin back to wearing tights. Those trunks at Mania were very off-putting
Amateur?
People seem to be forgetting that Triple H has come out and broken the fourth wall before to remind everyone that he doesn’t care what the crybabies think about booking. He books creative pretty damn well, and the changes have been welcomed but he’s not anyone’s friend here. Hijacking this show won’t lead to a better angle for the IWC.
If it's good "Omg hell yeah you can tell Tri ran that show!!!!!!!!!!!!"  Bad? "Why the FUCK did the mustache steal  Tri's  seat in gorilla?  Vince fasho ran this mf show.  Won't watch until HHH is back under helm."
Maybe hot take  Shotzi is a prime candidate for post Mania releases and frankly ... wouldn't be that sad. She's awful and boring. Her only gimmick is she's hot and likes horror.
Solo is a poor man's Samoa Joe, without the mic skills.
No surprise Vince apparently approved this show, it's 90% recaps.
A 40 year old woman riding to the ring on a fake tank…awesome
What a waste of my time of to bed I guess.
Wait, so Triple H's announcement was simply to introduce Rhea and the Judgement Day?
Man this shit don’t make Any sense anymore
What is the love affair with this coke addict?
Wonder if Vince is in the building
God damn it I just wanted to see the announcement I don't care about this
maybe they're doing it like a few years ago where Vince books Raw while someone who isn't senile books SmackDown
Anyone else wonder why solo looked so scared to help Roman cheat on Sunday
Per PWInsider, Papa Haitch is scheduled around 9
Just tuned in how bad was Triple H's opening promo?
I can tell by the way the ref is counting that Vince is in charge.
God damn Walter is a beast, but those spaghetti arms.
How has it been so far guys? Is it better than raw?
For the week, quality wise..  It’s dynamite v SD - dynamite blew the doors off raw, let’s see what the rest of SD has. That was a good start.
Jey and Sami is a ppv main event caliber match. Why hotshot it by having it on SD?
An ad for aew wrestlers at some comic com during smackdown is pretty funny 😂
Who’s this god of war Valkyrie looking chick does she wrestle or is she just there to walk next to the raiders?
So this wasn't listed in that Fightful match spoiler thingy.
HHH is definitely booking like this to keep his position on top of creative
The tank means Vince isn’t in control for now
Yikes
Not seeing much of the rumoured fan takeover yet
Xbox controllers are better anyway
 wwe draft means nothing ahahah, THERE IS NO BRAND SPLIT!
I wish they would get rid of the draft and the brand split altogether.
This is one of the Vince edits lmao
You know I wouldn’t mind so much if Vince booked raw and hhh books smackdown lol. Save me 3 hours on Monday to do something else
Rhea with all due repect but Marty Jannetty's run as IC champ was the greatest of all time
btw vince is in control
Is this iteration of the L.W.O. The Latino World Order or The Lucha World Order?
Damien Priest is the guy that got the most from his heel turn, he went from teaming with Bad Bunny to missing tow Manias !
Dominik needs to take little bit of steroids like his dad
So LWO just starts, and they’re losing??? Damn
I have not seen LA Knight yet. I was promised KAVORKA
what are the odds solo beats down on sami at the end of the match and jey super kicks solo
Riddle??? Ugh fuck that
what is riddle wearing lmao
that damn numbers game...is starting to even out. the squad is being assembled
I knew a guy like Solo once, who was strong as shit, crazy, and had to always be held back by the homies.  He eventually got shot between the eyes.
I’ll take my downvote blast on this, but it seems like sometimes WWE takes a page from AEW.  Jade and her baddies = Ballsy Baddies. Tony Khan and his announcements = HHH and his. Dark Order = Judgment Day Mox eye for eye = Seth/Rey eye for eye AEW with the pyro = WWE picked it up after years of no pyro Managers only became a thing in WWE again after they started having relevancy in AEW Inaugural TNT championship tourney = NXT cruiserweight tourney (timing was apparently intentional)
So is Vince there yet
Trips is gonna announce IcoPro as the news Sponsor of UFC and WWE?
Remember to listen out for the term "Local Medical Facility" tonight. If they say it, Vince is in charge pal
i hope shanky comes back
It’s the SmackDown after WrestleMania, which is watched by more people than Raw. Of course they’d recap the biggest show of the year.
No trips
I think hhh needs to reign in the 20 plus minute matches on TV. Every now and then sure but Gargano and Corbin don't need 25 minutes or some shit.
They really didn't need to change Gunter's music. It's not bad but the original cam with it's own gravitas.
I've never been about heel factions dominating all the titles for a long time,especially since it just happened with the Bloodline,but ,I would be ALL FOR  Imperium holding all the titles for awhile. They are that good.
WUWFCE
Nice cheap shot
Boy these Fire Vince chants are deafening.
Gunther is ridiculous
and now we get stuck with a half hour replay. Yup Vince is in charge show started so good......
No, I don't wanna watch this shit again
Just so we're clear, it's more of a YEEE, not YEET 😂
Solo is gonna be the guy to finally dethrone Roman at Mania 42. Cody loses again at 40, Jey loses at 41. /s
Where was this logic (allies banned from ringside) for the freakin main event of Mania?
awesome matches tonight. i feel super satisfied already
"And yes, now it's all crumbling."  Crumbl*ing*. Sami and KO know the dominoes are falling, Cody uWu or no. But Sami still wants to save them
Raquell needs better ring gear. It looks like jobber gear.
any word on LA Knight??
👁️👁️   “This is gonna be good”
So far, so good.
Then they should've won at Mania, idjits
Shotzi got pinned lol
Natalya is awful
Life. Love. Liv.
Shotzi couldn't sell pizza to a fat kid, so bad in the ring
Wait a minute didn’t they do this segment weeks ago😂😂😂
Xavier “The Creator” Woods
istg i heard some beeping like a storm warning, was I the  only one? No other tabs on my browser would do it lol
thats the same promo from Raw what are you doing man
THE DRAFT!
this why Vince came back. He wants to draft ppl
Damn draft, you guys called it. Interesting
Ummmmmmm what about creative?
Thrilling.
Fine speech
A draft? Huh…
Vince runs RAW, HHH runs SD?
Was that it?
Charlotte's not even been on the main roster for 10 years. I don't think legendary is the right word.
So thats how they get Rhea away from Judgement Day to turn face.
Guys that was chilling. Did not expect that bombshell of a speech by Triple H..
well that was mondays speech in a different font, bed for me it is
I’ve come to like Rhea, I’m happy for her win.
Rhea Ripley did the impossible thing that has happened 13 other times.
“Will gorr dorwn in histowrry”
  I’m rising!
LOLLLLLLLL
I’m sorry, but I don’t think Rhea will be holding the belt for too long.
So what do they do with Reigns and the 2 straps? Does he remain duel champ? I think he should.
Rey Mysterio is the only male ever to make a eyebrow piercing look cool
Dominik should've started the LWO. Not Rey
I can’t believe Vince is writing this
SMH, just let LWO get one clean win!
when we gonna get a man hitting a woman that hit him first? I thought you wanted equality
WWE doesn’t see the irony of that speech?
Write KO off with and injury, vacate the belts, boom they are now separate.
PERIOD SAMI
Michael Cole definitely had some Mike's at Mania
Kick his ass Sami
What happened to LA Knight VS Xavier Woods?
Absolutely dominant and clean win from Jey Uso. Most dominant Uso in sports entertainment history
NOOOOOOOOOOO JEY GOD DAMN IT
Birthday suit
Matt Riddle??????
Why
LOL MATT RIDDLE???
What in tarnation?!
Matt Riddle........the fuck
Bro needs to stop doing this
Not feeling the Riddle run in
Who wears short shorts?
The fuck?
uhh wtf
That was Cringe, Cole
JEY NO
Ugh I cannot stand Riddle
Jey knew Riddle was going to run and and saves Sami from a spike right???
Riddle being here makes sense unlike the shit with Miz on Monday.
I didn’t like any of that ending lol
Riddle needs new gear. He could be so much cooler.
So who is Elias jobbing to tonight? Seriously, did he sleep with someone’s wife or something? He should be a top mid-carder right now but he’s getting the Corbin special.
Her back isn’t even that nice
sami knows the bloodline is the only thing keeping him relevant😭☝️☝️🩸🩸
I’m so lucky I don’t have a gun rn
Riddle is such a disappointment every time I see him I can't lie
Is it too much to hope for fire Vince chants? 🥺
I'm guessing they're giving us this (great) 6-man tag team match to avoid the "fuck you Vince" chants right from the start?
Met Ricochet at a comic convention once. Was not a very friendly guy.
Viking Raiders need to go back to their old gear and ditch Sarah Logan
“Ballsy Baddies” - Vince booking confirmed
So it’s WWE s’ing its own D yet again. Everyone change the channel simultaneously.
They build to Rock vs Roman at SUMMERLSAM, Rock loses but bloodline cracks with Usos breaking away while Solo remains, Roman beats Jey at Survivor Series, Cody wins Rumble and beats Roman at mania 40, Solo turns on Roman
Let’s all hope Vince’s old ass isn’t on raw on Monday and there still might be some hope
Here comes Riddle 🙄
Riddle. Bro. Boring.
i feel like they lost the plot with the story?
Are the Cody fans still malding ?
Good evening champs, let’s get this party started
Man Gunther is shit if he couldn’t finish that choke smh
Happy to keep watching these 2 groups going at it. Just as long as Gunther gets to keep his title.
Sarah logan looks cool.....idc
No Jimmy no Braun no Erik. Lol very creative
Smackdown’s been pretty awesome. And I don’t really foresee it getting Omos vs Elias bad.
well time for a bathroom break
This crowd doesn't care about anything.
Yup expected.. and no draft :(
[hehe, called it, same shit, different channel](https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/12f2tyr/live_wwe_smackdown_on_fox_discussion_thread_april/jfe2izp?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3)
Why do they think fans care about how much WWE made during WM?
No concentration camp footage this time.
HHH wasn’t really necessary for the draft announcement.
Announces the draft  Introduces a RAW stable  No idea why people care about the draft when they don't
Did rhea talk?
Springtime football isn’t gonna happen, I wish they’d stop. NFL is king.  Go Cowboys.
Did I hear Sammy Zayn versus LA Knight next week
I love Jey but I've never liked his haircut lol.
Riddle.......really
Riddle??? That's a choice
We got Kevin in the back, but Riddle does the save???
[removed]
Cole legitimately sounds more relaxed and happier than he did on Monday.
Are Popeye’s Chicken still taste bland af?
Summerslam logo looks like shit
does this feel like a Triple H or a Vince episode?
Just got home, is Vince in charge still? Is the show ok?
This is random
They have no idea with this storyline. Pretty much turned Jey full heel and missed the boat. They're still teasing his turn and at this point as it continues on the pay off keeps decreasing
They cynic in me is thinking they're starting with these matches so they have cheering crowd noises they can dub in when HHH eventually speaks.
I'm not really feeling the LWO thing tbh
Jimmy on the FireVince wagon? (I hope so)
Shotzi, Natalya and Raquel = Piss break time.
Wow how innovative a draft!
TK quality announcement. Isn’t every superstar always eligible? How does he know it will change the game?
i'm just going to leave this here [https://www.sling.com/whatson/sports/combat-sports/stream-wrestling-live-aew-wwe](https://www.sling.com/whatson/sports/combat-sports/stream-wrestling-live-aew-wwe)
Vince must be in gorilla tho, I remember one time reading somewhere if you're not ripped he makes you wear a shirt. Unless Sami is trying to sell merch, does he usually wrestle with his shirt on?
Did Riddle lose his first name again?  Cole only referred to him by his last name about 40 times.
Dynamite was better, but this was still a really good show.
Wonder how many people in here are hate watching…Just hoping for things to go bad?? I’m still very optimistic
Hey I saw this event before
HHH give his "announcement " yet?
I’ll be honest idk why the mysterios storyline is still going  THATS JUST ME THO
Fella
Do you think Drew is gonna come out to cost the Brutes their match?
Sheamus gets a win what the
Lmaooooo insert SpongeBob meme
I would like to remind everyone that due to the match never starting, Brock is not banned from challenging Roman.
the fuck does that mean heyman
Squash match time boys and girls!
That reason is actually believable. A megastar like Brock could 100% have a problem opening the show.
I’m at work so I can’t watch. Did Haitch show up yet?
Ouch
Ouch
Bare feet
Haven’t been able to watch . How’s the show been?
I love Liv with the big meaty women ladies and also like Raquel with her shorties so I been a fan of this pairing.
Jey gets kicked out of the bloodline tonight - or soon.
I'm guessing this is one of the changes Vince made.
Great match between Ricochet vs IVAR. If Vince was booking, Ivar would've squashed him in 2 minutes.
When I star rate matches, I think to myself if this was a movie what would I rate it out of ten. Then I half it
Shotzi has a great evil laugh haha
Shotzi takes the suicide part of suicide dive literal
Did Vince screw up the show yet?
You can hear a pin drop
Emma was one of the best women in wwe around 2014, how is she nowadays?
![gif](giphy|vRf4Z1OZ21j9e)
Draft time baybay
All HHH speech so far is sucking off his own company
Oh no, a draft.
Sami and Kevin getting split up in the draft anyway
Oh?
A lot of reports have been wrong lol no women’s matches & Trips not gonna talk about the draft
That sounded kinda ominous.
The way he emphasized "change the game" makes me have a feeling that Monday being bad and the "they got the reaction they wanted" stuff .... are they possibly gonna split it with Vince in charge and HHH in charge of different brands (at least creatively)?
 I much rather prefer wrestlers walking to every show, having a draft just limits you
I legit forgot how cynical the live thread can be
TALK TO EM FINN
Lmao this finn is a joke
The booing sounds weird
Finn may be standing there but Edge won the match. If Adam Pearce wanted Edge there, he'd be there.
How long does LWO last?
Underwhelming announcement
Wade Barrett got one of the least annoying British accents I actually understand him
Ooooooo ooooooo ooooooooooooo
I believe you meant the "Local medical room" Sami... get it right.
Sami said Medical room and not hospital room! Vince is there!
I’m tearing up
What?
DAMMIT MAN WTF
Riddle, put on some pants  I'm begging you
Wait wtf??!?
t's funny that some people deny that Vince was on RAW, ignore the patterns of how he does the show, but not, "It's all made up by dirt sheets, Vince was never on RAW, it's HHH's fault", it's not like we've been watching over a decade of how Vince does the Show, and HHH too with NXT...to them, it was all an illusion and people change how they produce the product overnight.
I love Walter/Gunter...  But I think he looked more intimidating on the indipendents.  His arms look gaunt...
Thank you Vince
Hunter is still lame
This is so cringe
I’d lick her butthole
Vince is back with a vengeance!
Half hour of promos with a half hour of triple h shortly. Yup Vince is running the show tonight
Disband this group already
Cripple HGH Cripple HGH Cripple HGH !!
Are people still mad at Cody losing?  I get it, bro should have faced all the mini bosses til the rumble then won that. But dude got the pass because of a broken tittie but he got to redo all that shit til Summer Slam.
They’re putting Triple H at 8:59-9:00 turn so they artificially generate a boom in ratings with his generic speech about nothing changing
Rhea first feud as champion will be getting her ass whooped by LWO and zelina 💀
What happened to the working punches from back in the day? What's with this forearm crap?
Do we know if Vince showed up to smack down?
Compared to raw, how is it? I’m not watching
2 minute match = Vince Confirmed
Weak crowd
they already saying Charlotte is legend?
Not watching how is it so far?
Jey and Sami as tag champs. LFG
Pat McAfee sucks
Meh. Boring and predictable. And fuck Riddle
This show sucks
Wasnt Triple H kicking off? shows changing already lmao
Pointless 6 man tag cool!
I just don’t know about the brawling brutes though. For me, it just feels so cartoonish. That’s not me taking away from sheamus - he’s great or anything but just over all the gimmick..
Good smackdown? Should i tune in or nah
Hey, it’s Reddit’s boyfriend!
Why are these fuckin bozos cheering this.
Get Rhea away from these losers
Balor is fucking boring
How's the piped in crowd audio
Not expecting much if Vince still got a say
This episode has zero soul so far
That felt like a Vince segment
Mid match incoming
Kinda funny the weekly shows still selling out despite the fan backlash
LWO is dead gimmick from 35 years ago why revive such bullshit?
One thing I hope we get out of tonight’s show is some direction towards establishing a number one contender to Roman’s titles now that he’s vanquished Cody & sent him to the back of the line.  Who are you guys thinking? Omos? Lashley? Mad Max Dupris? Otisse?
Not getting my hopes up for this one.
We don’t like you George.
This show has so much potential going in and could be great. But in reality WWE won't use some of the gifted material and mess it up and it'll be the last Smackdown some of us watch till Summerslam.
Maybe we'll get another hour commercial-free tonight  unrelated, does anyone else smell gas?
Oh shit a bushwhacker died
Let's get to it all
If they are real they would push LA Knight as the top wrestler on smackdown with Roman
RIP
There better be a debut tonight dammit
Vince: I have a great idea for a story how about if Sami tries to join the Bloodline
Rey muta
Let’s see how this goes…
Where is the Best In The World?
Will we see Nakamura tonight?
can we get Rey and Aalyah vs Dom and Rhea(with one arm tied behind her back)
Vince is not there maybe monday was just a one time thing
No faith whatsoever
Doesn’t get better no matter how many times I see it
Smackdown looks so packed
I don't know how to feel about WWE and UFC thing are we gonna see Conor Mcgregor vs Roman Reigns? no thank you
We getting new title belts tonight?
Jesus Christ.
What you guys think the crowds gonna be like tonight
Butch has his hair down. This is already a great show.
I just left my friends from playing to watch wrestling. I’m not sure this addiction is healthy anymore
Man they're really owning it, the disappointed reactions in the promo
Triple H looking real pale
Card SuBjEt To ChAnGe
Where you at H Man?
> *Give them a tag match so they shut up god damnit*   Vince, probably.
Fighful said triple h comes later in the show
Funny enough I put the tag titles on Butch and Ridge Holland in my Universe mode today.
Wooooooooo
Where's Trips at?
Ridge and Butch aren't wearing their peaky blinders suspenders so I guess Vince isn't in charge /s
Vince is like "you can't open back to back shows pal cmon"
Oh he is there but not right away
Sheamus' entrance is so good
so we're not starting with Hunter
Is it time for Pete to turn tonight?
Sounds like he's just gonna say the same thing he said on Raw more or less
Triple H vs Vince main event match
##GOONTER
Starting with MORE Gunther and Sheamus??? I’ll take that ten times out of ten over another HHH speech
They didn't start the show WITH THE CHAMPION? What?
IMPERRRRRRIIIUUUMM
*Me listening to Imperium/Gunther enter with the New World intro, thinking they changed the theme back each time:*  "He can't keep getting away with it!"
Lmfao… if I weren’t a Sheamus and Butch mark, I’d change the fucking channel
Ludwig struts becomes more struttier every time he's on camera.
This guy looking like a million bucks
your syntax was bad there Cole, that sounds like Dominik is Damien Priest's son
Whenever Sheamus and Gunther are in that ring together it’s just magic
I’m late but I’m guessing I missed nothing. Didn’t look at the comments yet
i feel a butch turn coming
Where is aj styles?
Man, Butch is great
gunthers got some chompers
friends reminder that ludwig kaiser is one of the best wrestlers in the world
Fucking hate watching that finger stuff
Never a bad time when you’re watching Gunther
Sheamus vs Gunther in a Puerto Rican chancala match. Book it for Backlash
Has hunter made the announcement?
Lmaaooo kaiser got yeeted
More *pounce* to the ounce!
What’d Cole call the 10 chops?
i could watch gunther and sheamus fuck it up for 100 years
My goodness
Great first match!
Gotta say I haven't noticed the usual crowd piping this show. More of that please! Unless I'm going deaf then do whatever you want production people.
Literally just cut Smackdown on. Anybody mind summing up what I’ve missed?
I know a lot of people won't care about the distinction, but Holland was a former rugby *league* player. It'd be like if Lesnar was introduced as a former CFL player.
Ayo wasn’t Gunther undefeated?
BANGER
Super solid opener. We back on that good shit guys
I didn’t know Gunther tagged out
Banga
Banger
Banger opening match
fun match!
I don’t think the world wants to revisit it, Michael
Shocked, shocked! Well, not that shocked.
Oh no!!! A recap. I'm traumatized
Til Cody comes out to Am/Pm then I don't accept him as American Nightmare
Bounty Hunter Brock
“Title MATCH against Roman reigns”
Did Paul Heyman set Cody Rhodes up??
Why Brock why
and he beat em
Brock: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d11DS15AA7M
boo-urns
He's so good
What's Solos problem
If Solo Sickoa isn't in Main Event Jey Uso's corner to prevent Kevin Owens from inteferring, then they're basically setting Jey up to fail
By the way we’re still recording
No Braunochet?
That was some pretty terrible interview etiquette
Where’s Braun? They not partners anymore?
Oh snap
Rick O'Shea needs to join the Brawling Brutes
So who’s a good tag team to feud with KO and Sami for the titles?
Better Call Berkun!
I guess now with Vince being back there's no hope of these two losing this early 90s WWF gimmick.
Interesting how they didn’t call it Wrestlemania 40...
Why has that viking got a pepsi logo on his strap
Has Sarah Logan/Valhalla wrestled a match since her return?
Oof that cross body
why did he just brodus clay him like that
“ribcage transplant” is some real nasty imagery
God dayum.
Braun must be hurt after that Chad Gable suplex.
Does Valhalla wrestle? Or is she just a valet
No tag team partners allowed tonight then? Seems like Vince entered the building during the 6 man tag.
Ivar surprises me
Ivar  twists he don't flip
Oof, that spin kick
No HHH announcement yet?
damn was hoping for a viking tsunami
C'mon Ivar flashback to the 2014 ROH Top Prospect Tournament! You might have been more slim then but you can win singles matches!
Did Haitch make his big announcement? or will it close the night.
Oh wow
GG Rick getting them wins
And he wins?!
Did they open with Triple H? Did he say anything of value if so
Does ricochet not do the 630 anymore?
When’s the last time ivar did his cartwheel
Crowd is loud, both matches have been bangers. Good show so far
So who’s the first team Sami and KO are gonna feud with?
Pick up your cloth Raquel!!
Raquel solo plz
No one know how to do the backstage segments like TNA in 2011, they were awesome
Lol Ronda and Shayna won the showcase and liv and Raquel still get the #1 contender shot?
Sami a student of the art of peace
Fun fact: for you to be standing that close to the Statue of Liberty, you’d have to be in the middle of the Harbor.
Jimmy/Jey & Kevin/Sammi watching out for Roman's attack dog Solo
Raquel is taking the lead in that team, at least until she gets fed to Rhea at Backlash/MITB
raquel looked jealous
The Ballsy Baddies™
Natalya and Shotzi are already heels again lol
That’s a fun name
Ohno get Smart Mark on the phone!
The what?
remember when they did the riott squad vs iiconics in a "losers split up" match
Nobody on earth likes that Michael
Nattie channeling Lanny Poffo in that pre-tape.
Seems like the brand split is pretty much gone now as aw whole
someone better to the Bushwhacker walk tonight
I like Rodriguez
We know Raquel/Liv to win this one, possibly squash -like???
Raquel somehow caught Shotzi by... turning Shotzi into a cushion for her to land on.
Have they explained where the fuck is Ronda/Shayna, the team who won the showcase match??
The most extreme 🤪
Pretty nice float over DDT lol
Over/under on actual legal tags in this match: 2
Nice German
WOAH
Missed some of the first hour. Has H been out yet?
What was the announcement
Oblivion bay bay
So....why did Ronda and Shanya won at WM then....
Legit forgot Emma was in wwe
Oh hi Cap and Emma
LA KNIGHT TIME YEAH
Yeah!
#YEAH
LA KNIGHT???? HES HERE
Bro where has Emma n Moss Been?
What is Shotzis nationality?
YEAAAHH
That pop
Bout damn time knight!!!
YEAH
What’s at the top of the hour?
YEAH
*YEEEEAAAAAAH*
That’s it?
4 mins for a pointless singles match between 2 Tag guys 3 mins for a women's tag match  .....  I don't know Man....
...is that a custom Backlash arena they were playing there? I swear the only Backlash arena in WWE 2K23 is WrestleMania Backlash
YEAHHHHHHH
Very ballsy. Very bad.
YEAH!
YEAH
YEAH!
Talking about Bad Bunny and Backlash, maybe?
HHH is the new member of Damage CTRL
Fucking Xavier woods again, what the fuck is wrong with Hunter?
I am not able to watch right now did HHH reiterate what he said on Monday regarding things  staying the same?
Its time to play the game.
lets go HHH
Hollywooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood
Where’s the pyro
Former champion hhh
beep
Trips has job face on
Mmmmm HHH just went out to the ring and Michael haze is on a FaceTime …. Oh why is he going over to the desk 😅😅
The chyron doesn’t say “chief content officer”  welp…
Everything’s fine, nothing to see here, don’t look behind the curtain
 Well you see ahh… the fact of the matter is ahh….
“This is my last event.”
On your knees, perro!
Papa is home.
Return of The Authority to take down Vince pls
Fire Vince?
Cole just put him over hard lol
My captain my King!
Yeah you broke ours
Is there a teleprompter for Trips?
Oh yeah is he gonna announce NXT Europe?
all that and yet no KURRGAN.
He's going to promote Backlash lmaoo
Wait y’all
But wait...Doesn't Dallas's Stadium hold 100,000??? How is that a record?
Same speech woo
Woh draft time!
The future?   A UK show to compete with All In?
will we be going BACK to the future
There was literally a post saying he would say the same shit lmao don't know why yall so surprised
Yoo no one wants to hear this shit lmao
Nice
Trips looks like he is lacking some sleep
Oh I just remembered wrestlmania ! What was that? 4 years ago?
THE DRAFT LETS GOOO
And the future is Iiconic
Oh shit
LETS GOOOOOOO
Hell yeah! It's been too long since a draft.
Oh shit
I'm not ready for Vince, triple H
Wait is 1 billion more then 173k?
Yeah!
X Doubt
Every single superstar? No stables?!?!?
I KNEW IT WOULD BE RHEA
It’s time to shake things up again!
Oh word?
Fuck yeah
Sweet
RHEA
I love a draft
wooo Rhea
Daaaaaaamn
MAMI
But who’s drafting?
Conor McGregor getting drafted!
Judgment Day baybay!
Mami
HAH HAH GET IT?
About time for a draft
Rhea!
RHEA!!!
I sure hope they don't split JD
Why doesn't Rhea have the "brutality" intro anymore? same thing happened on RAW
Wow did Fin already heal?
Whoa whoa the man who runs the place(Cole's words) getting chummy with the heels
Oh yes. This is perfect. Champion Rhea heading her own faction.
Why wouldn't the Judgment Day stay in tact Cole? They're Raw superstars on Smackdown right now.
Cue “The Game Has Changed” from Tron Legacy
have Sheamus & Kevin owens ever been on the same brand????  because its been like 8 years and they've never faced each other
The upcoming tag match will have Benito run interference.
"It's time to shake things up again!"
Finn drop kicks her for the title
something something BREAKING NEWS: \[UFC\] Jon Jones has been drafted to WWE \[SMACKDOWN\] announces Commissioner Adam Pearce -- Challenges Roman Reigns for Undisputed Championship
I thought we were going to get "This draft will truly change The Game, I quit."
oh no sports entertainment
Bronn debut to challenge Rhea
Who’s the smackdown gm?
Rhea trying to be a heel but everyone loves her 😂
I know its because of Finn Balors laceration, but his hair 1/5 of a Bowl Cut.
Ngl, I wish I had the same durability as that of Finn. Man won’t stay down despite his injuries.
RISE BITCHES
JUDGEMENT DAY IS OVER
Is she losing her voice
You don't have to tell me twice, Rhea.
put your 1s in the air for Rhea !!!!!!
If you want to have a draft and therefore have a brand split then the judgment day shouldn't be on smackdown.
finns bangs are killing me
finn is a TROOPER
Dom growing out the stache
Big Pop
They really need to stop playing with crowd volume. The boos were already loud enough.
Remind me again, why Dom needs Vickie?
Dom looks like the waiter from the british sitcom Fawlty Towers
Y'all begged Dom to grow some facial hair and he is trying his best
isnt this piped in crowd noise or am i just going crazy
 Smackdown has been good tonight. Excited for the Draft and love The Judgment Day. Dom has nuclear heat
Dom the best heel in the business
They do not like him.
I love the heat
🤣🤣🤣
raw drafts jon jones from the ufc brand to job to omos
HOLY FUCK THAT HEAT
Gonna pretend Vickie never existed and watch this next time I need my fix on nuclear heat
Was there a draft last year? I feel like we have had the same rosters for at least 2 years.
Jeez
Booo
I think the A Town Down on Rey was the first time that move looked good ever
Do you remember seth and buddy essentially blooding Dom into the business in the performance center with the kendo sticks...  This kid has come fucking LIGHTYEARS
Weren't priest & bad bunny a tag team?
"DOM(Ian) Priest."   - Michael Cole
Has Damian been pinned at all lately?
I wonder if B.B is hurt, how will he perform at Backlash?
Say the words Priest  "YOU'RE DONE. YOU'RE WASHED. ITS OVER"
LWO 🔥
There's no way Finn is older than Damian
LWO is here!
that santos mask is interesting
Wait this is a match?
lWo
They keep putting Reigns in the ads for Puerto Rico but he’s not gonna be there. What gives?
you sure theodore long is not here lmao. another tag team match.
Is you ready for s’mores my brother?
Fox Nation,fuck off ya dipshits!!!
Boo
That sounded dirty
Cole has the biggest gate boner for Dom and its amazing
someone needs to edit that Michael Cole "ya ya ya ya ya" into The Offspring's All I Want intro
Has any child getting whipped gotten as much universal acclaim as Rey getting the belt out for Dominik?
Is Dom 23 in kayfabe?
Despicable Dom mysteryo
Dominik has really studied Eddie Guerrero’s wrestling style.
Kind of surprised AA didn’t break up at Mania.
Who would've thought that Sami Zayn and Jey Uso would have the incredible months' long story that they've had. Within a much wider, much longer story.
Will NXT have picks in the draft?
Do you think LWO will be will continue to grow in members?
Driver!
he should do that moonsault more
Rey landed on Dom’s face there.
Dom is so good
You’ve stoked the ire!
Rheas first challenger for the title?
Push preist
PAIN
Zelina about to get hit with a fatality
Did Rhea pull a muscle or something as she ran? she seemed to be struggling just before the cam cut away
Did they tease Rhea's next challenger?
What did triple H say
Do you think the miz will ever get another championship run? Asking  this cause of the riddle coming back promo
Weird spoil but ok
Same vs Jey uso 🔥
Alright that boozer guy is legit
I wanna go to Summerslam soooo bad.  I hope tickets next week wont cost me an arm and a leg,at least half way decent ones.
Ermmmm, are they screwing the Megastar out of a match again?
The irony that Sami is saying this when Owens said that to Sami months ago lol
DRAMA!
Watch it be him faking it
That Muray camera training
☝️ ☝️ ☝️
Main Event Jay
Man, I bought tickets for SD in Calgary today, I'll be mega bummed if LA Knight gets drafted to Raw. I have hope he will get to stay on SD and launch himself further up the card as a new face to carry the show.
Did football ever goes on break at US?
Let’s go Sami!!!!!
Let’s Go!
Is there any real reason why Jimmy is not here tonight?
Ok Kayla 👀
Sami where da belts
Vince being at a concert just seems weird to me. I would’ve never guessed he liked any music let alone something like the Eagles.
Ole ole OLE
☝️
There's one commercial break...
Keep eyes in the back of your head, Sami
I’m sure it’s been said, but I was just thinking the draft would be the perfect way to finally separate the titles
Damn Solo commanding respect from   The top of the ramp.
I like the look of this wildling fella
Santos Escobar is gonna turn on Rey at Backlash
What's gonna happen
Nooooo!
Damn ref hit skates
Solo gets results.
DAMN YOU SOLO
If this were a Vince show the New Day vs Sami and KO would’ve already suddenly interfered with the bloodline story tonight
OMFG SOLO SPOKE!!!
Jay and jimmy need actual finishers. The splash isn’t good enough
You’d think they’d ban Solo from ringside at this point lol.
Solo doing his best to make sure Roman doesn't put a hit on Jey
Has Sami in his earlier days ever won a match with a blue Thunder bomb?
Cody?
OH???????????? OHHHH!!!!???????
Idk how the bloodline can be seen as intimidating when all they do is cheat
Awe shit
HOLY SHIT
SPICY
OH MY GOD
YOOOOO
heartbreaker
OH?!
Oh god why
bruh
RIDDLE HERE FOR REVENGE
BRO!
BRRROOO
BROO?!
Blood
Back to back stiff knees
RIDDLE???????????
Matt riddle wtf
yoooo riddle
BRO?!
Oh?
Bayleys on raw dude
So KO was right that sneaky home wrecker Jey trying to steal Sami just to break his heart again lol
Riddle vs Solo Program?
???
Matt Riddle is going to wrestle Roman Reigns again.
Riddle looks like HHH lmao
let em know bro
Why did cole say bro like that
 That’s your Snack down main event next week
Riddle Out Of Nowhere!
That's German for The Vince The.
Something tells me it's not going to last much longer.
Someone ask him how much he paid for his seats.
he went from nxt to being the cause of the ending to the wrestlemania main event
“He’s just standing there….. menacingly!”
One of the many reasons why I will never sit on ground level. ALWAYS  sit in the 200 level.
And then he gets interrupted as Vince's music plays and he saunters out completely fine.
It’s been better than raw after the first match lmao
I don't think I'll ever get tired of Gunther matches
Yeah we’ve been eating good tonight😭
Both all Legados are LWO but not all LWO are Legados
Apparently he's got >!a promo with New Day!< tonight.
If this were 10 years ago that no holds bared match at mania for control of the wwe would’ve been great
That she’s a beautiful muscle mommy, as the kids say?
Most definitely
he keeps saying he has one more bull hammer in him so i assume he'll have one eventually
He hasn’t been out yet.
He hasn't come out yet.
Hasn’t came out
Later tonight. Show opened with a 6 man tag
he'll be on around 9 i think
Mania recap package, and first 5 or so minutes of Imperium vs Brutes.  Yeah, starting with a match
hasn't come out yet mate.  WM recaps and this match so far
Hasn't come yet
He hasn’t come out yet, but the Brawling Brutes and Imperium have been brawling
Hasn't come out yet. Did some recapping of WM and now it's the 6 man tag.
It got changed to later.
Hasn’t come out yet. Was a five minute Mania recap followed by the start of a 6 man tag.  HHH will make his announcement later on tonight.
If KO is breathing he's plotting
Probably next week. That's been a thing for awhile backstage segments setting up future matches for tv
Great so far
Can you imagine Roman’s face when L.A. Knight never shuts up? 😂
So long as he comes out to 'Jive Soul Bro' I'm cool with Slick 2.0 lol.
Honestly, (in LA Knight's voice) YEAH!
Hard to hate Night 2 when you had the IC triple threat.
But why? Vince didn’t like him in MMM? Remember he thought his mic work was terrible in that group.
First minute really
MVP's promo turned him into an Omosapian
Damn I'm not quite sure a *bonk* can help this one
lol  His mania entrance was badass.
HHH never gets announced as CCO….  Paul Levesque does
No boots and No Kneepads.
Idk, Its awakened something in me though.
He’s later, they were just playing the same long ass WrestleMania highlights package from Monday
Cole announced him as the man that runs this place
Coke will do that to ya
It’s legit the most fun I’ve had with a wrestling game in years
The last two 2K games have been really good. They’re starting to perfect the formula
I think the games recently have been worth checking out
He’s not on tv right nkw. I think he’s getting a solo feud with gunther when he’s back tbh
...why would he help?
drew?
I hope he gets drafted to raw and goes after the us championship at least. Plenty of different talent to face as well
Now that's a franchise idea!
He won on Saturday?
He won at Mania.
I’m 100% sure this won’t happen but I’m 100% sure this should happen
I feel like they run that type of storyline about every four years, so yeah it's probably due by now
Need to kill time, brother!
He was the first to get cut this round
even he gave up
What’s that?
It’s because they’re trying to account for Vince’s nonsensical booking
Missed imperium vs Brawling brutes
Brawling Brutes victorious over Imperium. Paul Heyman informed Main Event Jey Uso his brother isn’t there and he’ll be 1-on-1 against Sami. Paul hinted to Solo that if Jey doesn’t take care of the “Sami Zayn Problem,” then Solo is going to take care of “their problems.”
Did I miss something for why you feel this way
Just WWE things uce
That, Cody and Seth, Edge, Rey and Judgement Day is the only thing that draws me in.
yep :(
Yes.
Sadly yes, its normal.
Lmao it’s clearly a work
Endgame is Jey v Solo, not Roman for god sakes. Roman’s endgame is Cody. I wish you’d people would understand that. It’s gonna be a drip feed of solo turning for awhile.
Three out of ten backstage accidents have been caused by some form of vengeful phantom.
It was actually Rikishi.
I only opened Reddit tonight to find out what the hell that was. Chick with a mustache in high school.
We did see Solo, didn't we? Adam Pierce was telling him to get away?
Cole: "If I keep saying it, they'll forget they axed his first name!" lol
It's not how the show starts. It's how the show finishes.
Don't give them ideas.
Wasn't he in a backstage segment before?
Probably next week.
He was on the show in a backstage segment.
He did break a controller tho
He had a segment with Xavier Woods.
He broke a controller.... that's all he did tonight
You missed his segment
Xavier needed time to get a new controller for the rest of the road trip first
It sucks to watch it all when you know how it's going to end...Badly.  Just be there for her like the good friend you are.
???  That's all she's done the entire time she's been on SmackDown. No matter who's in charge.
Huh? She's been doing that for ages
The fuck you talking about? She did that all the time in NXT.....
She's been doing it since NXT
He’s going to lose the belts after they split. It’ll be the reason he loses.
Disagree.   It gives Roman a way to stand over them and basically say that he held up his end of the deL, and the Usos didn't so they should eat the shit he gives them. Until they finally break and turn.
I guess you need the Bloodline to crumble for Roman to lose
feel like it would sorta be over once Roman loses
It’s literally 7 minutes into the show. How could ANYONE judge?
Maybe a draft. Probably the same load of nothing he said on Raw.
He’s just reminiscing about the Cosmic Wasteland.
*Shayna Baszler tapes fist menacingly*
We're just comin off mania im sure their guys need a break after two nights of fan interactions and wrasslin
Cause we was begging him to turn face for ages in the bloodline but he’s always been better as a heel
Fightful didn't have it.
He announced that we are having a draft,that's actually an announcement compared to RAW
“KO turns on Sami before the Jey match. Book it pal!”
Yeah, but sale announcement biffed new hires since January. Just like Ciampa being hurt killed Gargano basically, and AJ injury despite not being able to pivot killed Mia Yim.
Miz hosted Mania and lost twice!
Would be dumb. We've had heel Sami for 3 years, let him have his babyface run
“Hospital”
He was attacked by Solo pre match and in the trainers room
Wasn't Solo the kayfabe reason Riddle was out for so long?
The Bloodline was literally the reason he was sidelined smh
UR-uhh UR-uhh UR-uhh
Roman is not at Smackdown. He doesn't want to work Fridays.
I mean it's the first smackdown after the most successful mania ever. Makes sense they'd recap it because they probably have a lot of new people tuning in and they're trying to expose them to as much as possible.
"you know what they tell me? Which one are you?" Hello they!!
they used to be the exact same but now they have very different hairstyles and its really obvious who is who
Vince couldn’t be bothered to fly to Portland lmao. I think SRS reported that he still oversaw the script remotely.
So they're playing GM mode in real life?
I doubt it, I feel like what happened was Vince was already in LA (from Wrestlemania) and so he obviously stayed and he couldn't help himself but book stuff.     Meanwhile today he's probably not there and can only revise from a distance so is making much smaller changes
Smackdown always gets more viewers. If this was the case, Vince is gone by tomorrow lol
i’ll take actual matches over whatever monday was 10 times out of 10
I don’t watch FoxNation, so why would I care?
Why do they ban Braun and Eric but never this motherfucker?
Yessss
Lowkey at this point it might work better than the tag team titles, at least for the men
please no more Titles
Well they barely had a tag division before Triple H arrived lol
no thanks. less redundancy belts are better
Kaiser is underrated asf
At least one doesn't need to splash kids for boos.
Dom just entertains me more than MJF right now.
No one has mentioned MJF in this thread until you did lil bro 😭
Well, one show wasted their commercial-free hour in promos and a squash with Omos, the other started with the Brawling Brutes.  They are not the same.
Cody wasn’t lying when he told him he wasn’t ready lol.
She’s 31 fam
And a draft in a few weeks
He announced the Draft
he announced the draft but thats about it
He also mentioned the draft is happening soon
The Draft.
WWE Draft coming soon
Tony Khan?
It was reported that he wasn't, but he was monitoring remotely. He saw the script and gave a few minor changes.
He always looks like that. That's just his face.
It was so bad. It was like he didn't say anything
Opening match went 20 minutes and it was great.
Yup Imperium and brawling brutes don’t miss.
So far, so good to me.
Yes.
I'm assuming there's storyline development and it won't be a clean ending.
To advance the storyline and build anticipation for their full match, it’s pro wrestling 101
In kayfabe it’s because Sami pinned him at Mania and this is a low stakes match off the back of that. In reality you’re not actually going to get that match tonight. Not straight up at least.
Valhalla, fka Sarah Logan. She *can* wrestle, but she's mostly a valet right now. Not sure she's had a match since returning, actually
She's Sarah Logan. She was released during Covid but HHH brought her back to be Viking Raiders manager. She's married to Erik in real life.  Like most HHH returns, she's inconsequential to WWE.
Sarah Logan
She’s married to the one not wrestling, fka Sarah Logan of Riott Squad
fightful famously has everything correct
L.A. Knight knows!
Smack down is the superior show anyways
He was in a backstage segment with Xavier, they set up a match between the two for next week.
He was backstage, broke Xavier ps5 controller
He had a segment earlier. Although I missed part of it. It was with Xavier Woods.
He was definitely already on the show
He was in a backstage segment with Xavier Woods.
Solo beating down sami. Guaranteed. Jey attacking Solo, 0%
shanky is gonna squash gunther and dance over his body
Raw needs longer matches. It's three hours.
Really hope they split the tag titles soon, lots of good teams that deserve a title run.
Vince probably forgot
I expect if she retired right now she'd be considered a legend
You really think he wrote this? Did u watch Raw?  It's night and day lol
Next week
Next week.
Next week
scheduled for next week
Next week
Next Friday
no he kicked him in the face
He doesn't have nearly the shine that his brother had.
You are overrating him. I like him. But “top mid card” are people like Gunther, Drew, Shamus etc. He’s not on their level.
It's pretty nice but I do think the pose is a little silly
That is a gross overreaction.
I think Sarah can stay but she needs to wrestle. NXT War Raiders were better
How?
They're spinning their wheels. We already did this "Will Jey turn on the bloodline for Sammi? LOL NOPE" shit like 2 months ago.
Makes no sense whatsoever, another Jay fake out, just cheapens the moment imo. If he ever turns face people won’t be sure if they should cheer unless he literally super kicks Roman in the face.   WWE once again failing to tell a cohesive story.
One day we will be booked to go over fellow Cowboys fans
were you not watching the show dawg
Kevin got his leg fucked up by solo before the match
Or maybe people don't want a sexual predator being in charge of their favorite wrestling show, I don't know...
I mean, WWE had one of their best Mania to Mania seasons ever and I attribute that to Vince not fucking shit up
Cole was so stressed on Monday he had an Irish accent and forgot all the names of wrestling moves
Weird considering Cole wasn't on Raw on Monday.
Cole doesn’t commentate Raw lmao.
Did you talk to Cole on Monday? Because he doesn't call Raw.
Why? Why do you just somehow know what Vince would do? Why are you guys like this?
The Rock's mother was adopted into Roman's family
It has consistency and even pacing. HHH
Triple h
Trips Episode for sure
TRIPLE H
Trips 100%
It's both of them. It's already been confirmed, Vince and HHH did this show. HHH did most of it while Vince made a few changes.
Been a hot show
Yes, Vince is still in charge (though many are in denial about it). No, we are absolutely NOT in the clear.
huh? the story is matching up. Rhodes vs Roman, Sami & KO vs USO's and now Riddle gets his revenge vs Solo. Solo was the "x-factor" reason why Cody lost story wise.
They’re not going to turn him face on a random smackdown. That’s a PPV moment
You're in too deep man. Go outside
Lol bro, this is the first week we've seen them OFFICIALLY on tv. Give it time
It’s only just started?!
There is no fire Vince wagon
30% of the Bloodline story has been about Sami and his latest t-shirt
Sami usually wrestles with a shirt on
No, he didnt. Cole said Matt Riddle
Well he already suffered from the same stipulation back at Summerslam, so he is, in fact, banned from challenging Roman.
No
No. Imperium v Brutes into recap of the Lesnar beatdown into Heyman promo.
Nope. Likely he should be here at the top of the hour
Nay
Nope, not yet.
Two fun matches. More recaps than needed. Overall good.
Very solid so far.
Been good so far
Feels a lot like a hhh card
Not yet
![gif](giphy|l0HlvtIPzPdt2usKs)
Bro chill
![gif](giphy|FzyoyDSaAsjHG)
Forearms are better tbh even good worked punches look fake
He's actually Valhalla
Good
She is
Shes a 14 time champion and main eventeds Mania
it's been legit great. crowd is hot so it's making it much more enjoyable
Better than raw i would say, looks like Vince isnt there booking tonight so that could explain it.
In my opinion I think it’s pretty good, the draft just got announced and more cracks in the bloodline are starting to show
Like Monday didn’t happen
Better than Monday
It’s been great.
Alright to fun matches so far, some more bloodline tension   Hhh announced the draft is happening soon   All in all much better that raw and dosntfeel like vince is in charge
Really good
Crowd has been fantastic. Been some great matches
bad, we re only waiting for LA Knight segment
Come on lol. Gunther and Sheamus put on a wrestlemania classic.
Pretty good so far
It’s been solid so far.
Yup
Definitely feels like trips booking so far. So yeah.
Meh
Sir respectfully, you shut your damn mouth
A segment similar to that happened weeks ago lol
Triple H booked the exact same thing not too long ago…
It’s not Wednesday
No.
A Puerto Rican was addressing his compatriot. What did you expect?
It was one show a few days ago. The tickets to this were already sold
Realistically, a lot of those tickets sold before Wrestlemania.
Lol
Hi TK
Because Wrestlemania is in LA and the next PPV is in Puerto Rico. Great opportunity to sell thousands of shirts.
Zeke
Just the start of the Gunther match, nothing crazy
Wrestlemania package straight into this match.
Injured
He's been out with an injury since February
Actual wrestling.
Roman all up in that ass
Seeing as Erik and Valhalla legit love all that Viking shit they're probably really happy.
Nectar of the Gods
Nope
Nope.
Everyone that went to school in the 90s immediately relates this to Marilyn Manson
Not yet
He said Baron Corbin is God and left the ring
Nope probably scared shows vibe would be off most likely
No HHH yet.
Nope. End of the hour apparently.
He’s showing up around 9
That’s what I’m wondering cause I was 30 minutes late
But she had the tank!
No
Nope not yet
Well, with Vince back in charge, I don't think anyone can sleep well.
These boos aren’t piped in
Yes. At Wrestlemania in fact lol they're great friends.
Im sure next botchamania we will have this
Zelina yeeted a chair at her. She was selling
Nah zelina dropped a chair in the way as she ran and rhea sold like it dropped on her foot
Draft is coming
WWE is here to stay!......and the Draft is back!
Basically but he also announced a draft is coming
He announced the draft
Not anymore but no one other than degenerate gamblers care about the XFL or USFL.   Thank god there’s more football.
How do you know he's at an Eagles concert?
Dark match
Or the guy even being at the show
Just meeeeeeaaat
Would it be fun/will I get a lot of playtime out of it if I don’t plan on playing online?
Because he’s the top billed face on the brand and he has a history with the blood line
![gif](giphy|6IPNUgkpCsDRK)
If anything it’s a sign that Triple H is running things because Vince’s women’s division was booked a hundred times better than H’s.
opposite actually... Vince booked the women better
Rumour is Boozer is a staff or has a family member that is
He was always doing this. No way in hell he was off the creative since summer. People need to stop believing that.  And yeah it seems like last raw was one of/for old times sake
I dunno, he’s got one of the best physiques on the roster, is great on the mic, plays both heel and face pretty well… he could be great. I see something in the guy!
Thanks. That sounds like a badass tag match
What
NOPE
no
Sweet have it DVRed
Got em
dynamite sucks as much
I am not talking about only this show, the chicago raw show April 24 is sold out as well
Wrestling fans only know NWO as just Hogan, hall and Nash.   Nobody remembers these 500 spin offs they had in wcw nor the other members
I knew it
Thanks brother!
Thank you!
Apparently that’s the rumor going around for where he is tonight.
He’s sick probably.
but why lol
This is true… except for “Charlotte Wins Lul”.
No don’t get me wrong I love him and wish he was rated higher. He just don’t have “it” maybe it’s just because they didn’t push him, maybe if they push him the “it” will be shown
Delusional
Yep and what do you mean already? A whole lot of legends had shorter careers than she's had already.
People overreact here and don’t realize casual fans don’t give a duck. Unless the product is really baaaad they will watch it. Not everybody see it as complex shit, personally it’s simple fun to me
Apparently he’s sick or injured so nevermind
Dawg I didn’t say anything about Sarah Logan originally😭  I was talking about Triple H, aka Haitch
be polite, pal
I know but she didnt earn shit
Last Raw was bad product but they are constantly getting huge attendances numbers for a while. which I find odd
Shit I replied to the wrong comment sorry
Sure she has. She's probably in six of the top ten WWE women's matches of all time and has been a huge star and a hard worker her entire run.
Lmao you’re good
shes the dirt worst buddy and she just got a vacation after 4 months work, LMAO hard work my ass
Thanks for the logical debate. You make excellent points not at affected by your personal biases.

If you want an ECW choice for the Hall of Fame, this guy right here.  I think his impact at least matches Hillbilly Jim.  Between his stuff with the bWo, Raven, Right to Censor, the Hardcore Championship, and Victoria, there's more than enough there for the video package.
He'll show us, we'll see
I'm out of the loop apparently, what happened to him originally?
Nice to see some positive wrestling news. Get well soon Big Stevie Cool
BWO 4 Life! Loved him in ECW. Miss the good ole days.
Stevie will always have a special place in my heart for absolutely tattooing JBL with that chairshot after JBL fucked up the Blue Meanie. Hope he continues to get better.
This has been Tez approved
I'm really glad he's recovering. It made me really sad to think that the winner of the WrestleMania XX main event was in such a bad way.
So so glad to hear this. Love Stevie. He'll show us, we'll see!
Who would of thought the leader of right to censor would have no need for medicine or science, just religion.  Happy he’s doing better, was a favourite of mine growing up.
Stevie was one of my favorites as a kid. The bWo was something I read about in the sheets and longed to get a glimpse of, before ECW came to my market or learned about bootleg tapes. I hope his road to recovery includes getting out of the conspiracy theory rabbit hole.
>God is great  Doctors at the hospital be like….  ![gif](giphy|x8U7CF3qRvzGwpK9hG)
too bad about all the god stuff, but happy to hear the man is making a recovery. hope he has the presence of mind to thank his doctors at least as much.
I’m happy for him, but I find the whole God Is Great stuff annoying. Would he be saying the same stuff if things went in the shitter?
The royal we.
Right To Censor was a really tremendous heel faction. It feels like they’re more forgotten than they should be.
Hell, even that gimmick early in WWF where he would impersonate other guys/girls with that underrated "Big Style" theme was great.
He elevated the mid card and late 90s women’s divisions really well. Damn good worker.
He had a very serious spinal infection, [here's a video of him talking about it in detail.](https://youtu.be/z2SjMSa19b4)
And also one of the nicest guys ever, I have never heard a bad story about Stevie Richard ever.
If I was waking up next to Bianca every day, then "God is good" would be the only thing I'd ever tweet too.
A dumb take from someone who can’t spell
If you watch his videos, he very clearly gives an extreme amount of credit to the hospital and doctors.
hahah this is great
Too bad you didn't watch his videos thanking the doctors
Maybe click the link and watch the video.
I remember it starting strong, but no one in the faction was trusted/respected enough by the decision makers to get involved in anything too big or meaningful.   If I am remembering correctly, it lost direction and was given no where to go.  Edit: I misremembered Molly's prude run after Mighty Molly as having started in RTC. I was corrected in a reply.
Spine stuff is so scary
You'd also tweet about eating her booty for dinner every night.
What was spelt wrong?
I don't think Molly was in it. Ivory was the woman in the group (& Kat, but I think she was let go from the company during the story where she was forced into the group).
i’m gonna guess he doesn’t know favorite is spelt differently outside the US
For the sake of answering, "should of" should be "should have". I dunno if that's what they meant, though. Have a good one! :3
You're right. I was confusing Molly's prude character with being in RTC. I need to go to bed.
Ah yes of course. Hopefully he may learn from this experience. Thanks for the reply.

We know it's Bron lol
Finally, Internet Explorer loaded!  Can't wait for the Switchblade!
Lit, but I'm randomly curious about the name for the special. Are people still gonna be having Spring Break in late April? Mine's been passed lol
When even is spring break in
Mostly likely lol. I was gonna say that maybe they're saving the rematch for their Battleground show in Massachusetts, but that's not until the end of May.   I doubt they keep this going that long, and Bron's probably gonna be gone by then.
It’s going to be Bron but it will be interesting to see who the other 3 guys are since these type of matches usually see come continuity with the runner ups being feuds for the champion down the line
They’re not known to be timely lol. Last year’s show was in May.
CT is just now having theirs.
My university does it the first week of March. Tho I know from work that the New York public schools have spring break this week.
TV special
Probably 4/25 or 5/2. I’d guess 4/25 though since Battleground is the May special and Roadblock was the March TV special although they had Stand & Deliver for March too.

A wild Chris Hero appears
Getting ready to head out to the show now.  I can’t fucking believe I get to see Aja Kong wrestle in person.  Speedball vs Oku, Masha vs Yamashita, and that main event all should be awesome, and the rest of the card is great as well.
Oku vs Bailey sounds amazing.
Still not used to long haired Jordan Oliver.
Let's go coach!
Vinnie Massaro that's my dude
Saw The Velocities Vs Aussie Open at York Hall forRev Pro last year. They’re friggin awesome. Great to see Oku making a name for himself in the US. He’s been killing in in RevPro.
Masha is so good, she hits so hard. I saw her at a Mission Pro, I caught the timing just right on a suplex. Masha laid this girl perfectly on the top of her head, like a half inch from the mat. But it looked so good.
Wrecking Crew were damn impressive when I saw them live in NJPW's San Jose show
Jacob Fatu is insane, he had a match against John Hennigan in New York last night, has this match tonight on the literal opposite side of the country and then has to fly back to New York tomorrow for two more matches
He showed up at their last show unexpectedly, and announced himself as the new official matchmaker. So he’ll be at most of their shows moving forward.
Reports already came out saying Endeavor had no input in who won any matches
At some point you guys need to accept that HHH just booked something that isn't well received and there's no boogeyman to blame.
Who the WWE champion is does not qualify as a risk for the overall company financially anymore. It's not the 90's where a cold top champion is going to drag the whole company down financially.
No.  HHH likes his long term storytelling. Look at NXT  WM 39 was the gut punch. He is betting that he can keep Rhodes as hot or hotter going into Summerslam or WM 40 against a Thanos-level Roman who has no family left to protect him
According to Fightful Select, the plan for Roman to go over had been set in stone for awhile.
Nope. I think getting Roman to a 1000 days was the biggest factor in decision.
No. Triple H made the call and thought it was the right idea.
The result was decided long before
I don’t think so. Who wwe has as champion isn’t changing the stock price of their shares.
So you think during 9 billion dollar negotiations they started talking about who should win a match?
I think so? People will point out all the stories saying they planned this weeks ago. But they probably knew they were likely going to Endeavour weeks ago.
No. Stop with the copium.   It wasn’t Vince.   It’s wasn’t Endeavor.    It’s was all Triple H.   Just like all bookers he’s had good booking and bad booking.   It’s ok.
Is there any chance you can send me the links?
This has been going on since he took over. How long do you think it's gonna take for them to realize
Ekkkiekee
No matter who booked it, it was a stupid move. If it was HHH, we're just surprised because he's usually great with booking that makes sense. The non-sense stuff is usually a sign of Vince and hence the reaction.
But for a company that owns ufc too, you would want your most casually marketable guy on top. A Samoan badass, or a mad with bleached blonde hair (from the eye of the casual)
The problem will be another year of Roman as champion will cool the entire product and the lightening in a bottle they captured the last few months no matter what they do is  lost.   It's hard - hard as hell to recreate what they had this past year. Kofimania and the Yes movement are the only things that are similar and those were once every 5 years? It will never be this hot again.
I knew I read somewhere that Roman was penciled in weeks ago, but I’m sure a deal would’ve almost already been sealed with Endeavour by that point.
Which is dumb. I don't care if its 2000 days, 3000 days, whatever. A streak in scripted entertainment doesn't mean anything.
During 9 billion dollar negotiations they had a conversation about who’s going to be the face of their company coming out of the biggest wrestling PPV ever, yes
Look over this sub and you'll find HHH booked that ending and the Brock best down on Raw
I remember reading a post on the sub, but couldn't find it in my quick search. I found [this aggregator](https://thesportsrush.com/wwe-news-did-roman-reigns-beat-cody-rhodes-at-wrestlemania-39-because-of-wwe-sale-to-endeavor/) that cites the Fightful report tho (it's on Select, so the actual Fightful report won't be available to us non-payer's for a while).
Ufc has no drawing champions all the time, matter of fact majority of their champs can’t draw worth shit.   Wwe is the draw has been for a minute, two of their biggest acts don’t even show up on tv half the time.
“A man with bleached blonde hair”. Good lord, get over your fragile masculinity.
If you think to the casual observer Roman Reigns is more marketable than a white guy with blonde hair who wears a suit whenever he's not wrestling, I have beach front property in Nevada to sell you.
Reportedly the deal with Endeavor came together during Wrestlemania week.
I really doubt it and it's not like Roman losing suddenly makes him disappear.
The fact the ufc doesn’t have drawing champions would play a big factor on acquiring wwe in the first place. Choosing reliable figures to be the face of their company.
How does that equal fragile masculinity at all, grow up
The Rocks cousin or Dusty’s Son?

Hey I was in that line, and that video. Highly entertaining
That line smells like the raccoon pen at the zoo
Oooh that dude in the wheelchair is gonna get it from MJF
God damn
If I went to an MJF signing and left without being humiliated or assaulted I would be so disappointed.
Salt of the Earth
Convinced that is Vince's favorite line in the movie, he wrote it, and he laughs his ass off to this day every time he thinks about it.

I heard a rumor that Simon Gotch did a shoot interview once...
He did one eating raviolis. The man is a legend.
The stuff with him and Sean is legendary. Kliq This has done a great job of approximating those and highlighting Kevin and Sean’s chemistry and rapport with each other.  If you aren’t watching/listening to it you should be.
The one where he put over ravioli while simultaneously burying olives was amazing.
To me, Nash is the perfect interview subject.  Real laid back, honest and that great sense of humor.  I've never watched a Nash shoot and felt like he was bullshitting.  Comes across like the kind of guy you want to hang out with...which is probably why his KC shoots were so good, as it feels like two guys having a natural conversation that just so happens to be recorded.   Raven is another really good one and, to me, the most watchable RF shoots as he talks so much that RF doesn't often get to ask his dry, poorly researched questions.
I've watched his Timeline shoots of 1995 WWF and 1997 WCW.  I love his story about the kid who tried to sue him over MTV Spring Break.
https://preview.redd.it/ftf2f1qozksa1.jpeg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a152cda927d4ab024434511dd1093ac346349198
Nash is very addicting to listen to. I must have binged on his shoot interviews 2 or 3 times over the years.
London and Kendricks Excellent Adventure is a great one, especially the part where they talk about Benoit
I'd you want an entertaining shoot you really can't go wrong with Cornette.
Vince Russo and Jim Cornette's shoot interviews are better than their podcasts/real life views.
Great to put on to fall asleep too.
He's too smug for my liking but he is undeniably entertaining. I think perhaps when you've been the smartest guy in a room full of idiots for your whole career, you probably overestimate your intelligence out in the real world.
*This isn't business, this is petty bullshit and you know what, fuck you*   These were his words regarding NWO in WWF  This was from a shoot involving him and Scott Hall.   I can't find the video anymore
You son of a ….
GODDAMNIT! I just read this and got a video suggestion on YouTube
Fun fact about that one, the food was from [Johnny Gargano's dad's restaurant.](https://twitter.com/joe_dombrowski/status/1565579532966543360?s=20)

>	McMahon is not in Portland for tonight’s show  >	Ultimately, this has led to an improvement in the morale among the WWE roster.  I like that you can gauge the locker room morale now strictly based on Vince’s physical proximity to the show.
this has probably been happening the whole time and would align with what HHH has been saying for months
Small rewrites is probably a pretty good use of Vince creatively. He's had good instincts in the past, and would probably work well as a consultant rather than an overseer micromanaging everything.   Still wish being a rapist had consequences though.
He’s probably sitting at a Chili’s, eating a sirloin steak with ketchup on it and using voice to text to send aggressive messages to Trips that he better not see LA Knight on TV tonight.
Look, no matter what dirt sheets report  > Good show = HHH booking  > Bad show = Vince booking  Get on with the program
Triple H has said from the jump that he was consulting with Vince about creative. This is in line with that.
>There are also some who believe the internet reactions to all of this tend “to make everything 1000% worse than they actually are  What? Fans on internet overreacting? They would never!
This mf is gonna part time creative.
I can live with minor changes as long as Triple H’s vision is still at the forefront.
Has anyone made a Carmen Sandiego logo but for Vince?
>There are also some who believe the internet reactions to all of this tend “to make everything 1000% worse than they actually are.”   Idk about everyone else but I'm just worried about the lack of MMM segments the past 2 weeks, that's where my main issues lie.   I bet Chad had something to do with this...
>There are also some who believe the internet reactions to all of this tend “to make everything 1000% worse than they actually are.”  So incredibly true.
Well things probably got back to normal, lets hope this is true! Lets pray my Boy La Knight is on the show 😅😅  YEAHHHHHHHH!
I think it's safe to assume that Vince doesn't want to book a bad show and a lot of the reason why things tended to be shit was because of all his constant mind-changing and micro-managing. If he's cool with HHH's general vision and isn't travelling constantly to every show, things might stay the same.  Remember though, there were some bad shows under HHH too, so let's not jump to conclusions if tonight's isn't a banger.
I don’t mind Vince being slightly involved as long as he just doesn’t take over the entire process and changes things at will. Just let Triple H do his thing and give some input once in a while if that’s not too much to ask for.
>There are also some who believe the internet reactions to all of this tend “to make everything 1000% worse than they actually are.”  Who are 'some'? We all saw the same thing. None of it was manufactured. Yes, it was **that** bad.
Vince isn’t coming back to the company.   Well, he’s coming back but he won’t get involved in creative.   Well, he’s getting involved in creative but we swear it’s only for one show!
Vince coming back to book a terrible Raw after Mania and prove "he's still got it" is the best case scenario at this point. We'll see what happens over the next few weeks.
I'd love to know who has this magic morale gauge that seems to change for every article
I have no problem with this if this is true and stays that way. Triple H has been open about talking with Vince about creative for months now. So Vince’s fingerprints have likely been on some of the things people have liked for months. Just keep it this way and everything should be ok.
>There are also some who believe the internet reactions to all of this tend “to make everything 1000% worse than they actually are  There's a lot wrong with this. A sex pest being in person is something I'm sure fans and talent don't want backstage
> There are also some who believe the internet reactions to all of this tend “to make everything 1000% worse than they actually are.”  Lol they don't think Raw was as bad as the internet thinks it was.
Hopefully his role in Endeavor keeps him far too busy for creative and hopefully the larger company will give him busy work to keep him away.
first match will be at 8:45pm sharp pal
Prove it tonight. We will talk tomorrow.
If he rewrites things ahead of time then I'm cool with that. As long as he doesn't drastically change the product.  The issue with RAW was he rewrote things as the show happened. Bayley was cut minutes before her appearance. Rollins' promo was literally scrapped when he came down to the ring, that's why it was so awkward on TV. Reportedly his promo was going to introduce Pretty Deadly.   So if Vince is giving input hours beforehand things won't seem chaotic. Vince sitting backstage rewriting things as the show happened is what screwed up RAW.
But I thought Vince was no longer “in the weeds”? He promised. /s
If Vince wasn't backstage Monday after the major announcement following the weekend that would have been odd.    You don't mention the major sale of your company and then not show up to the performance you're putting on that day.  Once Vince was in the building Vince started behaving like he does when he's in the building.  There's no reason to believe he's going to continue to be in the building at every event he's 77 years old he is not going to do all of that travel and he still has executive level responsibilities he's going to be fulfilling that he can do remotely.
IWC in shambles for four days for nothing Lmfaoo
WWE fans are insane
There's a part of me that thinks "this is what they want people to think" lol
Wait so you're telling me that the internet (and myself admittedly) overreacted??😱
>internet reactions to all of this tend "to make everything 1000% worse than they actually are."  I dunno. If you're not doing it for the fans it kinda just becomes masturbatory
This still proves that he’s involved with creative. What happens when he’s got no reason to be in Stanford and decides to go to a show? None of this is good. The mental health of the talent is literally a day by day because they’re going to be walking on eggshells everyday
Vince fears hipsters
***There are also some who believe the internet reactions to all of this  tend “to make everything 1000% worse than they actually are.”***  The only true thing to ever come out of that site.
Once again, the IWC panics and acts like wwe will die until evidence comes out. I heard people thinking Vince was running everything like pre 2022, some even saying they expected HHH to be removed from creative. I wish this sub and dirtsheets would learn to be more level headed until more info comes out.  Btw, I agree Vince needs consequences for his horrible actions and is not a good person. My point is about the IWC assuming he's back in full control because he contributed more than usual to a singular goddamn show
A second Vince McMahon has hit the Titan Towers
"There are also some who believe the internet reactions to all of this tend “to make everything 1000% worse than they actually are.”"  True of literally everything.
I don't care whose "fault" it is for bad booking decisions. The fact that this rapists mere presence causes bad morale amongst the roster is awful. I get that Vince is an evil piece of shit and probably enjoys the fact that his presence can cause people to feel bad, but it's just so... wrong. It's just an encapsulation of so much of our society. Just rich evil bosses who can just on a whim ruin people's days or their entire livelihoods. Fuck this sucks.
Imagine knowing that a good percentage of your talent roster wants you gone and thinks of you as obsolete. Man fuck Vince.
I honestly doubt this is true. I feel like at this point they’re feeding false news to the dirt sheets so the fans don’t have a continuous sour taste in their mouth and keep watching the product.
Yeah well, I’m in the consensus that we’re gonna wait and see how this show stands and delivers  Because if it’s BAD? Then SOMEBODY’S LYING /s
The amount of damage control and putting people at ease really leaves me uneasy. I'll wait a while until there's a consistent pattern of quality shown again.
Even Vince doing small changes is already a gigantic change from when he wasn't involved with the company. If people actually believe is just gonna stay there and do small changes instead of giving the major direction he wants the company to go, it's kinda naive.  It even says in the post that he made those changes remotely, so he can very easily run the ship from home without physically being there, there are plenty of tools (thanks Covid!) to do that.
It would be nice if some fans also had a “wait and see” attitude.
So the Dirtsheets are just going to milk this for engagement forever huh.
RAW wasn’t even that bad. There’s just a lot of marks who worked themselves into a shoot because Vince was backstage. It was underwhelming sure, but people never once applied a tiny amount of rational thought to the situation. People thought Vince came in, ripped up the script, cancelled the Brock match, demanded that Cody be beat up for 10 minutes, sent LA Knight and Pretty Deadly home early, and then spent the rest of his night screaming in Cole’s ear.  The creative process has not changed from the past three months. Triple H just had a bad show. It’s happened before and it’ll happen again.
Attendees just shouldn’t react when/if VM comes out. No boos, no cheers, just silence.
Honestly? This would be the bets use of Vince, despite all of his blunders, occasionally he is right and we are wrong. So minor suggestions isn't that bad.
The internet overreacting??? 😱😱
Meltzer makes everything a 1000% worse, which in turn makes the IWC crazy
"There are also some who believe the internet reactions to all of this tend “to make everything 1000% worse than they actually are.”"  We're the fans, ultimately we dictate what is over and what isn't. Spare me the internet is overreacting bullshit that WWE always puts out when things aren't going well.
I mean; fuck creative on a tv show. Dudes a sexual predator.
Omg the iwc overreacted!?!?
Again I am choosing to believe this because it fits the narrative that I want
shane mcmahon will return with the no chance theme and take over smackdown
Vince coming back for one night was basically an “lets do it for old time’s sake” and produced garbage   Have HHH consult but it’s still an HHH show
Hasn’t Vince not appeared at shows in the past and still had input of whats taking place on TV regardless of who’s in charge for the night?   Legitimately, I can’t see this guy going through all what he’s been able to since his “return” (drove his daughter out the company, hostile takeover of the board, and merging the company) to just say naw, Paul you can keep control of creative now.   This is gonna be the new norm going forward for a few months if Vince will be backstage or not.
It’s got to really suck for the talent to be on these eggshells knowing this horrible man can swoop in at any point in time and totally change the course of your job.
![gif](giphy|vRf4Z1OZ21j9e)  Minutes into the broadcast in gorilla:
You mean this sub overreacted? Bullshit, we never do!
Makes sense that Vince was still in town for Raw after mania, especially if it was the same day as the endeavor deal going public. Vince is gonna sit at gorilla and no one is gonna tell him to get out.  It’s like when Gen Z parents fly in to help their kids pack up after graduation. Telling you to clean up, fold your laundry, and they’re driving the moving truck. They paid for your stupid philosophy degree in the first place.  But theyre not gonna follow you to Smackdown in Portland the next weekend. You’re on your own, kid.
Meh. 7/10, maybe 6.5 for this one. Step up from raw though.
Its crazy that Vince just don't care about the fans.... It's not like it cost more listen to the people
> There are also some who believe the internet reactions to all of this  tend “to make everything 1000% worse than they actually are.”   Or maybe keeping the rapist around is bad.
It will happen to fans when 10+ years of inept booking and the death of creativity to one of the things you love when it goes away then shows its head again.
So basically, the writers purposefully made RAW trash so that they could sabotage McMahon. If I were HHH I'd fire all of them. They're snakes.
But like he’s still in charge of creative so nothing has changed
I think they're building a HHH vs Vince program. The payoff match will be at summer slam.
That last sentence makes me so happy. 99% of y’all on this sub and all others have been absolutely insufferable this week.
He's gonna hop on the company zoom at 7:59 and just make somebody carry laptop him around all night 😂
I guess I'm ok with this?
I feel like if Vince is at home he will change only small things but if he starts showing up every week then he will change the entire show.
Morale is like the price of WWE stocks.
Ts & Ps for Michael Cole
so basically what he's been doing before last monday's RAW.
It's just bizarre how everyone just accepts that he's terrible and that no one is happy. And he just merrily does his thing.
Dancing Shanky as the Smackdown return.
The "wait and see Attitude Era" begins
What are the odds that Vince was in Gorilla just to see if it would still work then noped the Hell out of there after the reaction?
I want Vince to show up on a tablet attached to something that makes him mobile so he can drive around backstage.
Imagine the moment someone goes rogue and reverts to a script point Vince rejected? He'll be on the jet and touching down before the show is over.
This week has been a roller coaster man. It’s just up and down and up again.
That’s great to hear.  And also, Vince has never particularly cared about Smackdown. Raw has always been Vince’s priority. I’m not particularly shocked that Vince would have involvement on Raw, but not Smackdown. If I were guessing, that will likely be the pattern going forward.
Honestly, if the way it all works is that Vince says "Let's do A to get to B so we can do C and that leads to D" while Triple H handles how to get to those points and does all the minutiae of the week to week, that can honestly work out fine. It's Vince just bulldozing everything like on Monday that can't keep happening. I think Vince and Triple H can work together and work well, but they just need to actually do it.
> There are also some who believe the internet reactions to all of this tend “to make everything 1000% worse than they actually are.”  tee hee they noticed us :blush:
Honestly hilarious that the first thing Hunter did was cut his own promo
I wonder who gets these morale updates. Do people listen in on gossip between wrestlers backstage?? Do these people ask around? If they did, I'm sure the wrestlers/personnel might get a little suspicious??  Or are the wrestlers leaking it themselves???
Regardless of what the reality is, Triple H must be feeling pretty smug about the fact that he’ll be getting all of the credit and none of the blame from here on out.  That’s the corporate dream!
This seems completely fine to me. If it stays this way, I can definitely live with that. Time will tell I guess but first match down and everything seems fine so far
I don't want the rapist near the company but this is honestly best case scenario and hopefully when he's in leadership of this new company that all of the other businesses that he'll be responsible on checking on will preoccupy him too much
The (wait and see) Attitude Era
The rewrite was to remove LA Knight :(
Raw being 3 hours long is so draining. Smackdown is a much easier watch.
Lmfao why do all these reports make it seem like Vince is a unstoppable unpredictable monster. And all we can do is wait and see lol
wait and see attitude era is finally here
Did not hear any Fire Vince chants tonight.
Sucks for LA if every show that runs there is only ram by Vince
To be honest, im ok with Vince tweaking shit, not changing whole ass shows last minute.
Pure speculation but I’d say this was “the way” while Vince was “retired”.
oh man, I’m sure it’s all true and not some speculation based on absolutely nothing
>	There are also some who believe the internet reactions to all of this tend “to make everything 1000% worse than they actually are.”  Public reaction was the way it was because a rapist took back complete control of a thriving program and attempted to pretend nothing had changed. This is after a historic Day 1 WM and it was palpable that the quality of the product dropped considerably on Day 2.   This is such a lack of personal accountability for the blame shifting attempt to label the massive viewer reaction as an “overreaction” rather than owning that creative was solely responsible for multiple terrible decisions being made. This is some grade A corporate blame dodging technique utilization though, like did Vince write this himself because the level of “it’s your fault, not ours” written here is palpable and reads exactly like something Vince would actually say.  WWE had a chance to launch to a level not seen in multiple decades by delivering a WM Day 2 that was equal to or better than Day 1, but they came up well short. Plain and simple, Day 2 felt like a hangover compared to what it had the capabilities of being. Then creative follows that up with an absolute egg of a commercial driven and low creative effort of a Raw after Mania which was completely and solely on them. Like what the hell was that Rollins segment?!   Raw was weird as hell and the “shock to elicit fan engagement” is the same style Vince disillusioned so many viewers over the years with. If anything, Raw was 1000% proof that Vince is out of touch with the modern audience. He can’t shock away the attention to the rape settlements as much as he wants to try, which is exactly what we saw on Raw. So blame the audience all you want for their overwhelmingly appropriate reaction to the company going from historic to complete momentum rug pull in only 48 hours. This company is at a hard fork in the road and doing the right thing both morally and creatively will define the company’s direction for next two decades.
I don't think WWE actually care what people online think / have to say on the matter as long as the discourse is a debate on whether the show is better or worse with his creative  involvement and not should a sexual predator be at the helm of a family show.   The juggernaut will go on regardless of his input. He can pull all the wacky bookings he could want and it wouldn't really hurt things in the long run, as long as people have  forgotten about his sexual misconduct and general predatory behaviour.
They had 3 full matches in the first hour. Def told me Vince was less hands on.
Even if Vince only shows up like once a month and wrecks the shit out of a show, that still ain't good....
You know you work at a good place when your prevailing thought is “god I hope my boss doesn’t show up today”
HHH is hard at work reminding the live events team to not schedule any events in Connecticut.
Everyone has a manager that they absolutely dread running into when they show up for work  Imagine if that manager was Vince McMahon  Edit/sidenote: there is also NOTHING worse than a "retired" owner of a family business meddling in affairs at their own whim. Total culture killer
"Everybody's too happy for my liking time to fly to X to knock them down a few pegs"
It's like Michael and Stanley
I think this is accurate.   Which is why he stuck around in LA, which distance-wise from Stamford is really far so he had to balance the meter a bit.   West coast swings would have too high of a morale if he didn’t show up to lower it.
Vince lurking around like the Xenomorph in Alien Isolation
Sounds like the one place I use to work, you could literally see the morale improve when the one supervisor was gone. When the guy eventually quit the joke around the place was that the place was now cancer free.
Some people backstage can feel Vince's ki and they react accordingly.
It's also fascinating to see so many people watching something they apparently detest simply for reddit street cred.
We now need a chyron that tells us whether the show is live, the location, and whether Vince McMahon is actively backstage.
Trips comes out tonight with big “Per my last email” energy
I don't think there is an overly large group of people that would be bothered knowing HHH talks creative plans with Vince and uses his feedback.  As long as Vince can stay in the minor consultant role and not go back on his word about staying out of the weeds, we're all OK.
I imagine most conversations regarding creative between Triple H and Vince go something like this.  > Triple H: Hey Vince, this is the run down for the show. You got any suggestions or more ideas?  > Vince: Hmm, looks good pal. Maybe change this segment right here. *Insert more weird Vince mannerisms here*  > Triple H: Alright, I’ll keep that in mind. Thanks boss.   Triple H still has the book, but Vince will always have atleast *some* amount of influence and suggestions. More so now since the whole merger. Either way Triple H was bound to ask his father in-law, who for better or for worse ran the entire show and micromanaged everything for a very long time, for some ideas and his thoughts on certain things.
Iwc overreacting shocker
It felt like Triple H would only talk to Vince occasionally… now it feels they’ll talk before every show
Yes it’s a shame that all it took to move past this was the attacker forgiving himself and moving on.
Our former CEO has a similar career path after merger. He became adviser working under the new CEO and few months later retired.
Most normal take on this sub
The one thing on Raw that he changed that I actually liked was making the women's matches a tag team tournament rather than single's. The tag titles need a boost. Bianca and Rhea will be fine.
its not vince's ideas that are the worst - its the rewriting everything constantly. him just throwing a few notes in during the week isn't bad
i agree fully with both parts of your comment.  also him just being their to help with and change some minor things could be good. Jericho has plenty of stories in his books and on his podcast of Vince suggesting small character/story adjustments that ended up being genius and turned good moments into great ones. funnily it reminds me of the general opinion on Vince Russo. he had valuable when he had other people to filter his ideas, otherwise it was a nonsensical shitshow when he had full freedom.  im just hoping this is the case if Vince has to be involved again
Vince was never afraid to make bold moves.  HHH seems more like the type to play it safe.  Vince is an asset if he's working with others and they don't give him full control.
Yes. I’ve been saying it for ever but when Vince wants to create magic he can, only in the main event scene though. The main storyline’s have never been a problem it’s once you get down the card where it starts to get ridiculous.
This and tbh I believe it was always like this. I refuse to believe he was really off the creative since summer…  So no change and that RAW was (🤞) on of.
Being a billionaire bypasses all that
Is he a rapist? I thought he was just paying for sex
Is he actually a convicted rapist or what??
You had me in the first half, not gonna lie.
Wait - he raped someone? I know about the scandal at a high level, but actual Rape? God dam
I'm sure he thinks he's suffered consequences, it cost him money.
Exactly and even broad strokes aren't terrible.  after all the bloodline was a Vince thing.  Vince's micro managing has always been his worst problem creatively and him giving instructions to make A and B happen but letting triple h figure out how to get there seems to be a good idea
Vince prolly: Hey paul, lemme talk to you! Man! That sounds good. Such good shit. Can't believe i made it up! Me! Vincent Kennedy McMahon.
Lolol.
A Sirloin steak... with ketchup... AT CHILIS??  This guy is definitely a god damn monster
Steak with adderall
"Smells like vince"
I mean thats what its gonna boil down to.  From now on we will have  "This was deffo a Papa H show" and when its bad we will get a "This is definitely a Vince show" , when it could very well be the reverse, we could have minor changes that are massively approved of here without people ever knowing being lauded as an HHH call.  its gonna be hilarious,   Edit- as much as I hate Vince, I am absolutely loving the IWC now being conflicted or not on liking a television show.
The one I found the funniest was the shows right after Vince got removed. They were celebrated as great booking on HHH part until everybody found out that they were still going off of Vinces work for the first few shows
I don't care about what happened at Mania as I'm personally going to buy their wait and see BS that the HHH/Cody/Roman triumvirate spread after the show, BUT it was really hard to watch Raw and not feel like this was a Vince show. The lack of wrestling, the replays to things we just saw, random segments that didn't make any sense (Seth Rollins) and Bayley being cut out of the show altogether last second. HHH has had some bad shows along the way but they were never bad because of those trademark Vince things. If the trademark Vince production quirks are here to stay, it will be evident to all as to who is running the show despite not being at TV because HHH simply wouldn't book things like that.
I think that Vince booking cieling is way lower than HHH's booking floor but I don't think HHH's TV shows are massively better than they were before. His PPV's are way better though because he just let's people wrestle but the TV is mostly just fine.  If the Bloodline aren't on then the shows have a massive difference in quality. Imo.
And likewise:  Good Cole = No Vince  Bad Cole = Miniature Vince literally in his ear yelling into his ear canal.
Even suggesting it makes me furious!
I’m 1000% positive there were mfs sending death threats to everyone on the roster for Cody-reigns ending.
On one hand, yes. On the other, we were having fun most weeks watching WWE for the first time in a long time. Nobody wants their feel good to disappear lol
Watch all the "dirtsheets" who were saying "VINCE IS BACK! WWE FUCKED" backtrack now. Uh plans change.
"DO IT ROCKAPPELLA!"
Hey he had to do something, they're trying to steal his gym bro.
Even if Vince came back full time, MMM are 100% safe. They were his brain child and this thing with Otis is right up his alley.
I assume this is what’s been happening the whole time. If Triple H wasn’t taking advice from the most successful wrestling promoter ever I would be surprised.
It's like when your parents let that one mentally ill aunt or uncle stay just for the weekend...month... forever
This rapist wouldn’t be so bad if it wasn’t for YOU PEOPLE!!
>Lol they don't think Raw was as bad as the internet thinks it was.  Because it wasn't.  Was it brilliant? no, but it also wasn't close to being as half as bad as it was being made out to be.
Seth in a faction with Pretty Deadly could be incredible
Honestly like what am I even doing here anymore, I'm dumber just for reading these threads lol
Yeah they should just Let It Play Out
Nah… Raw was ass
The circlejerk over it being the worst episode ever according to cagematch was embarrassing.
That will never happen. Too many casual fans who worship the ground he walks on.
Blaming Meltzer instead of Vince lmao
I don’t think it’s hyperbolic to be concerned about Vince coming back. We’ve had 9 months of a steady ship. And while not every creative decision was a success, the narrative rhythm of the show felt emotionally true. Bloodline is case in point. I don’t think I’ve been made to cry in wrestling since Macho Man and Elizabeth reunion.   If Vince comes back and takes on more of a show runner role versus an executive producer one, it would be VERY concerning. It’s similar to Weinstein attempting to butcher so many of the early Miramax acquisitions by asserting creative control.
Im sure he would jump at the opportunity
No as he will never accept he had a bad idea.  It's not he made a bad Raw he made a fantastic Raw its  every single fan and reviewer who is wrong
Raw is coming to Hartford on June 5th....that'll be interesting to see what happens.
“Don’t schedule any shows in places that Vince has heard of”
I think this is especially true if your boss is a billionaire. There were horror stories of Apple employees trying to avoid getting into elevators with Steve Jobs because he would turn around and ask you a question about the work you're doing and if he didn't like your answer you were gone.
There is that story from a former writer of WWE  who ran into Vince outside of work and Vince wanted to street race the guy. The writer agreed and got the better of Vince at first until Vince started bumping into him and nearly trying to ram him off the road. The writer slowed down and let Vince go and win because he didn't want to die. He relayed that story to coworkers and their response was something along the lines of "Well, Vince loves to win." Not sure if that entire story is fully true or accurate, but if it is then Vince is actually fucking crazy.
Absolutely. I worked for a place where dad "stepped away to let his son run it," complete with selling him the business. Of course, every time he visited, he would question policies, countermand his kid, or make a show of chuckling with contempt at how things were being done.      The worst would be when he'd give an order to someone who had no clue who he was, because they were a new hire. He never could handle that.
I really do agree with you BUT at the same time- this is the mans company he's worked his whole life to build. He sort of has the right to be involved like it or not
“Vince, I think ***you’re*** what’s stressing everyone out.”  https://preview.redd.it/ktecm31d8msa1.jpeg?width=1168&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1ff594eeff67405bfef5390cc66a2ff0bc19b93a
Someone should get HHH a flamethrower for Christmas.
I had a mustang captain that I threw a little party for my crew when he PCS'D.
I hope the lights dont flicker with a weird noise followed by michael cole annoucing he has an email from the anonymous smackdown general manager
Per my last announcement uhhh.... i mean the game uhhhh.... nothing is changing uhhhh.... for now uhhh....
Better than “Please advise” energy
as long as Vince is there to give an opinion and not make everything exactly the way he thinks is best then it seems like a great deal, he’s just clearly out of touch as a week to week show runner and booker. I understand a lot of people watch wrestling for the storylines but there shouldn’t be 12 minutes of wrestling on a 3 hour show, and the storylines that take place shouldn’t be disconnected every week and sometimes amount to nothing
It doesn't matter. Anything people don't like will be blamed on Vince and anything good will be credited to hhh based on nothing
Exactly, it's Vince's company (or division I guess now?) so he has a right to have his say and it's not like he's a booking moron.  After all the bloodline is a Vince thing.  Leaving the details to triple h and allowing him to stably write scripts will make even the worst ideas at least interesting.  Vince just kept submitting first drafts of crazy ideas and put them on tv.
The “as long” in your last sentence would surely fail a wellness policy with all the heavy lifting it’s doing haha
It’s local medical facility pal
Did you see RAW?
No one is going to know how this all plays out in such a short time. The sale is a massive change.
Don’t forget a settlement.
I think it's weird that more people are angry about Vince's booking versus a rapist returning to power. Like at the end of the day it's just a TV show and Vince is still a monster who can take advantage of people.
Yeah, the first few shows Triple H booked were much better even while they were still using Vince's work. Also, if Vince's input made the show as bad as the reported last minute changes on Monday, most of the shows since he was brought back would have been that bad.   As long as he can be kept from changing details less than an hour before the show airs, we should be good.
The Vince Russo defense I see. Let's see how this plays out.
He's had sexual assault and rape allegations and paid off the accusers with hush money.  https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianbushard/2022/12/13/vince-mcmahon-reportedly-facing-another-sexual-assault-allegation-and-wwe-referee-asks-for-millions-in-damages/
A female ref in the late 80's/early 90's accused him of out and put rape. At least one other wrestler came forward and said she told him about it at the time. I know Vince paid her off once but I think I read that he's actually paid her two settlements.
He's worth $3Billion after this sale...I don't think he thinks that
Their seasoning is salt. Like, they think they're putting other seasonings on, but all of the spices have been replaced with salt, and they still use all of them in all of the same proportions.
The steak is well done too.
People are going to assess it segment by segment. Gunther has a **** match on Smackdown? Triple H. Matt Riddle wrestles Rick Boogs? Definitely Vince McMahon.
Yep. People are going to be reluctant to give their opinions on shows and matches now. Nobody wants to admit they disliked a storyline only to realise it was HHH writing it, and even moreso no one is gonna want to accidentally admit to liking McMahon writing
Turns out Vince never booked anything, he's strictly talent hired to play the on air authority figure after the IRL boss Jack Tunney decided to focus his time on working behind the scenes.  Even went so far as to fake his own death but I hear he's responsible for Roman Reigns going over Cody.
There hasn't been a good Vince show in a long time lol
The three best things in the HHH era have been the Bloodline, JD turning into cheesy bullies and Gunther's dominant rise.  Two out of those three were already taking place when Vince was still booking.  So yeah, its not like the tv shows had this massive leap in quality.
The biggest difference after Triple H took over creative was just the pacing of the show. Everything didn't feel so disjointed.
TIME TO BRING OUT THE PITCHFORKS
*Dear Piper Niven,*      *Huge fan. Sooooo glad you're name isn't doodoo anymore. Can't believe they did that shit! Anyway, were pretty much the same me and you, which is why I'm writing to tell you how mad I am that Roman Reigns is still the stupid champion and Cody isn't! I mean aren't you just soooooo mad like I am? Sooo I was thinking you could maybe talk to one of the bookers & give Cody the title already!*          *K? Soon! Plz!!! TY!!!!!!!!*
*WHERE IN THE WORLD IS* **CARMEN SANDIEGO?**   Frig, that was a good show.
Well I'm glad you enjoyed it.
Underwhelming given the context, but it still had some fun segments and a good match. People definitely overreacted.
Everybody who said it was the worst episode ever should be forced to sit through an entire month of late-Pandemic era RAWs.
Keep giving that $12.99 away every month.
He might even "leapfrog" into it
Maybe he should avoid jumping at anything for awhile….
That was well before Jobs was a billionaire. That was because he was an insane visionary perfectionist.
If that story is completely fabricated, then vince is still fucking crazy
Absolutely toxic. And you don't fully realize how bad it is until you have hindsight; each shitty interaction is a cumulative droplet of resentment
"you know, my brother once told me that nothing someone says before the word 'but' really counts"
Worse, a storyline about vince vs HHH for control of the company.
I hope they do and i hope the gm is El Torito
…Based on a long history of Vince booking creatively bankrupt main roster shows with declining ratings; while at the same time, HHH booked well-received NXT shows.  Then, when Vince steps down and HHH takes control of the main roster, there are immediate creative changes that are well-received; followed by increasing ratings.  I’m not going to pretend that Vince’s booking didn’t have its bright spots; or HHH’s, it’s failings (e.g. overly-long heel champion runs).   However, the track records of both are clear; and the idea that ascribing, say, chaotic last-minute changes in RAW’s script* to Vince is somehow indicative of bias against the man and not just familiarity with his well-documented foibles is laughable.  \* ^Or ^pushing ^jolly ^green ^giants. ^Or ^promos ^in ^which ^the ^wrestler ^says ^nothing ^and ^leaves. ^Or ^inexplicable ^heel ^turns, ^leading ^to ^confusing ^and ^dissatisfying ^story ^beats. ^Or…
Based on ~~nothing~~ the last 10-20 years of Vince’s booking decisions.
Lmaoooo @ based on nothing.   Reality distortion field game is strong with this one.
FWIW, I didn't think Raw was good or anything, but I didn't think it was as awful as people made it out to be.  But I also get that the standards for the Raw after Mania are much higher than that of a regular Raw, and it was the first Raw after Vince returned to the public eye, so the sentiment being the way it was makes total sense.
Marks don't want logic - they just want to tell you everything WWE does is gold.   Nobody wants to admit the crowd reaction to both Roman and Cody on Monday was lukewarm at best and the biggest pops were both for Lesnar because it was a decent swerve if it wasn't for the bullshit move of having Brock destroy Cody.
You mean the show HHH booked? yeah, he really messed that one up.
I'm sure that pocket change occurs to him more as a fee than a punishment sadly
A settlement that Vince makes back in 2 years under his new contract.
Angie Mysterio on a pole match next week
With a swerve of course
Oh geez that’s worse than I thought
I can see that happening.  People legit micro analysing promos line by line to discover Vince influences.
Exactly what happened when Vince Russo worked for tna, Dixie even came out and said that Russo was specifically for longer matches on tv even though according to the internet short matches was Russos biggest wrong doing. Lol
I point to the last couple of months of raw, for all you know you liked one of those episodes based on a change Vince recommended.  You can sit there and say 'lol Vince has never made a good show in a long time' but you have no clue now of what is going to be a Vince adjustment or whats not.  For all you know tonight on Smackdown Vince could have made a request that isn't reported, that you end up liking. Im not saying the mans a good person, im saying the IWC running on paranoia now of enjoying the shows is hilarious.
No, it was because he was a giant asshole.
Jobs became a billionaire in 1995. A lot of his horror stories are from projects that were worked on after that like the iPod, iTunes, iPhone, etc.
Except for "and I cannot lie"
Vince has said the character of Mr McMahon is dead, hence why he has grown the mustache so he can play his greatest character ever in Gomez McMahon, his long lost brother
"I'm sorry, I love you pop"  *Pedigree*
Custody of ~~Dominick~~ WWE ladder Match!
Then, now, forever
>e.g. overly-long heel champion runs  Stares tribal chief
I believe that comment refers to the booking of the main event of mania, where people instantly started saying it had to have been booked by Vince until it came out that it was HHHs plan all along.
His new contract pays out no matter how long he works/quits/fired. It’s literally structured to pay off that hush money
"Vince McMahon definitely wrote the second and fifth sentences; the rest were Hunter's lines"
You can also say that for the first year or so of Roman’s reign Smackdown was one of the consistently best wrestling shows on, and that was all Vince
I'm saying I had been enjoying RAW for the first time in a while the last few months, then this past Monday I had to change it after an hour and LATER found out Vince was largely responsible for RAW that night. So that's a pretty big indicator, I'd say
Ah yes, the Dario/Antonio Cueto approach
“Mr McMahon? Who is Mr McMahon?  My name is Guy Incognito.”
Vince looks poised for the win  (*glass shatters*)
Perhaps. The statement as he phrased it though was hilariously absurd.
> LATER found out Vince was largely responsible for RAW that night  Not true according to Keller Raw was mainly an HHH booked show.  try to spin it how you want, you ultimately just disliked an HHH booked show.
He has all these good Elias/Ezekiel scripts that have just been sitting on his desk that he has refused to rip up over the past 8 months, can’t let them go to waste, so a few of those patented McMahon tweaks and *chef kiss*
Yeah I get both sides. It's definitely a real thing on this sub to automatically assume an unpopular booking choice has to be Vince, and anything good has to be Hunter without knowing who actually made those decisions.
So is the info from a few days ago and the info above completely made up?  "The hope among talent is that Vince McMahon was only so influential on Monday’s show because he was in Los Angeles when the taping took place."
Zeke, Mr. America and Fuego Dos Flanks Gomez Macmahon. There is a stalemate until Omos evil twin Somo and Brain Strowman arrives and destroys everyone.
Re read what you wrote and what I wrote  But in short yes
Lol alright well if RAW had been going pretty great and all of a sudden fucking sucked and it's all Triple H, then Triple H fucking sucks now 💁. I didn't read the report after the fact and then decide I didn't like RAW. I changed it in the middle of the show before I even saw anything about Vince possibly being involved, wondering to myself why it was so bad all of a sudden.

Warner Brothers being such a big part of the announcement, and All Out being the next week, I think your theory is a solid one.
Can't remember who it was that said it but one of the podcasts mentioned WBD having an event next week to introduce their new/HBO Max & Discover+ merged streaming service and it's possible it could be aired on whatever that is.
Supposedly, the All In at Wembley is going to be a special for the new HBO MAX streaming service.
While I really like the idea, I would hate for there to be commercials for such a great event.
PIP for this event would be awful tho
It would suck because of the commercials
TV Special would suck, Streaming on HBO Max would be amazing
If they still go and do All Out the week after as a PPV... it could make sense.   But then again, "just" doing a TV special could(!) hurt ticketsales.   So... I dunno
It should be on sky sports.
That makes sense. I was wondering if they were just replacing All Out, but having All In as a TV, All Out then Grand Slam (if they do it again this year) would be a massive month for gates.
The two PPV events after Double or Nothing 2019 were free on Bleacher. They may do something like that. Heavy speculation it could be free with the new HBO Max No way in hell TK thonks he can ask fans to pay $50 two weeks in a row, on top of DON and Forbidden Door right before.
Yes
Is All Out official for the next week?  I know that's been tradition but it just seems weird to sort of hamper what's supposed to be by far your largest crowd ever.  It would be very tough to properly tell a story for anyone you want working both.
yeppp I'm thinking its gonna be a big streaming special which im HOPING leads to AEW's backlog finally getting added
That makes a lot of sense. Live Sports have been huge for streaming services lately, makes sense WBD would want AEW events on their service
That's just as interesting to me honestly.
Yeah Anthony Bowens was talking about it last night I believe. But if one is dream matches and heavy in cross promotion that could be all in and then all. I would be your typical AEW titles and storyline finales for that card. Especially if all in is a streaming exclusive.
If they did that, then AEW already got a chunky deal on the rights. TK has said he was keeping streaming rights a separate deal from TV rights.
Yeah, I can see All In being more dream match and outside promotion focused a bit.  To me booking Wembley is just so massive though I don't know why you'd get cute with it trying to do another supershow a week later, make it your biggest show of all time.  Pushing All Out and Full Gear back a month or so for one year isn't a big deal at all.

***Wrestler cuts passionate promo on his client***  Stephen A Smith: "Listen, we don't care, HAHA. Alright? We don't care"
Oh God, he'd be annoyingly PERFECT at this.
He would be very good as a heel manager. He has played a heel on live TV more days than not over the last few decades
I have very little knowledge of NBA and basketball altogether but whenever I see a clip of him he comes off like a smug prick in the exact way I'd love to hate in wrestling
Stephen A. already covers sports like it’s professional wrestling so he’d be a natural fit.
Walks up to Riddle “ Get off the damn weeeeeeeed!”
He’d be MVP on steroids…. just imagine SAS promo in Dallas oh my….
He would be fucking incredible in this role. I doubt he’d be able to commit to the long term travel and touring but WWE needs to lock him up for a big SummerSlam season or WrestleMania season angle.
Dude is a natural heel and a great talker.
Stephen A. Smith and Logan Paul would be legendary lol
He'd have helped a hapless talent like Corbin more than JBL did...
He’d automatically be the best behind Paul Heyman. It’s all he’s done his whole career idk how he wouldn’t instantly make an impact
Smith booed everytime they went to Dallas.
If I'm AEW, I find a way to bring him in immediately. I'm sure Stephen A would prefer to work with WWE, but if AEW can convince him, I think it would be a big mainstream boost because you know he'd talk about it on ESPN and his radio show.  As far as who you pair him with or put him against, I'd take the Bobby Heenan route as a manager. You just have Stephen A feud with a face, and manage a series of opponents vs that face. Orange Cassidy would be perfect. He could rehash the same schtick we've heard people say about OC for years. "That's not real wrestling, it's a disgrace to the industry, etc, etc." But to his mainstream audience it would feel new. Maybe even have Stephan A temporarily manage whoever takes the International Title off of OC. Let him brag about on his radio show.   If he's willing to work with AEW, I think the upside would be worth whatever his price tag is.
Just get MVP to coach him on what to do, get a few house shows under his belt, and he'll be fine
I thought FOR SURE he was going to have an on camera role at Mania this year.
I absolutely hate how much id love this. SAS has been a real life media heel for most of my adult life. Guy is a natural.
Screaming’ A branching out?
Please make this happen lol
Perfect if you throw him up against a face who can hold their own for promo
Stephen A. vs. Heyman on the mic is a main event quality match
On his sports talk show he basically plays a heel most of the time anyway
"HAHAHA HOW DO, HOW DO, HOW DOOOOO..."""  *Glass shatters*
SAS is way too busy and would be way to expensive to bring in full time. When he says this Ik it would be for a 1 off
Give them the entire show
I’d pay big money to see that
I wouldn't expect him to be there every week for a long stint. But every other week for a month or so, and then at a PPV. Ideally I'd get 3 or 4 appearances over the course of like 6 weeks. But you're right. He might be too busy for even that.

I thought the actual finish sucked, but the winner was intriguing. I kinda liked how they swerved everyone because in real sports like MMA / boxing, the results are sometimes shocking and not everything transpires in storybook fashion, and if they do stick the landing of this story, then we'll all reflect back on the genius of that booking decision.   You could also make the argument it wasn't time yet for Roman to drop the belts. It doesn't make a lot of sense for him to lose when The Bloodline, who've been helping Roman win every match, are still technically together and on the same page. And despite a lot of people being upset, I think there's a large portion of fans who want to keep seeing Roman dominate and that's evident if you go to any of these shows (I was at Mania Night 2)
everyone likes a good swerve until they're the ones who get swerved
All these people here would've loved if Avengers Endgame ended after Thor chopped off Thanos' head and credits rolled.   Doesn't matter that Cody has no personal story with Roman except for a few daddy insults. Sami, KO and Jey have a hundred times more heat than the dude who has had 14 matches since returning to the company. Fucking Seth is a better candidate off the back of one shoot interview.   Cody must suffer at Roman's hands till SummerSlam. Just like Sami did. Just like Jey did. Then he can dethrone him. And if the crowds lose interest in him like people are saying they will by then, then he shouldn't be the one to dethrone him in the first place.
Been rooting for Cody since post Royal Rumble. I was annoyed by the constant promo packages before he returned and even at the rumble i was like "bruh of course Cody is winning how boring"  But now i'm the biggest Cody mark on the planet
Well.  I was pulling for Roman so yeah I popped like my team just won the Super Bowl on a hail mary. And considering that I'm a Falcons fan, best believe I relished that feeling while it lasted...
I just laughed after the pinfall
We dont live in a 70s attention economy. They rewarded me for not tuning into raw, they rewarded me for not flying out to night 2.  Literally if sami and jimmy werent doing their thing, I wouldnt be looking for clips. And I dont think thats a cody thing, I thing thats a wwe thing that just happened very suddenly.
I had sympathy for Cody just as I had for Finn after he was beaten by the ring post, after Drew lost and then sang as nothing ever happened and as Sami lost after being red hot in front of his home crowd. All three of them hot, all three of them ready to begin a new era. We would have gotten tired of them, of course, even sooner than usual after the monster reign of Roman but what if we wouldn't have gotten tired? Now, we can't answer these questions.
U and every single person in this sub
I saw a fan video and I was surprised to hear a giant pop in that section, so Roman still has way too many fans. I can’t wait for him to lose when his entire family finally turns on him.
Leaving Sofi I’d say the overwhelming majority wanted Cody to win. But the Roman fans were living life and taunting the upset Cody fans. So yes while lots of people were made. Plenty of people were happy that Roman won. It’s not a cut and dry as people make it.
i mean they say fuck you roman and boo him but you can hear them plain as day getting hyped when hes about to spear someone  hooo ahh
Ask not for whom the swerve tolls, it tolls for thee
Exactly. My only gripe and one worry would be:  Gripe: He should have lost clean to Roman to signal that even though he has potential, he is just “not ready” yet in terms of kayfabe.  Worry: If this drags on until WM 40. I love Roman and the Tribal Chief persona but another 365 days of sporadic title defences and keeping both world titles on one person just doesnt sound like much fun to me. I hope the program culminates at Summerslam.
> Cody must suffer at Roman's hands till SummerSlam. Just like Sami did. Just like Jey did. Then he can dethrone him. And if the crowds lose interest in him like people are saying they will by then, then he shouldn't be the one to dethrone him in the first place.  Perfect analysis.  In my opinion, Cody needs to scratch and claw his way through hell before he takes that title from Roman. And that's something he hasn't done since returning to WWE.
Yes this is how I feel too! I was kind of astonished to see how quickly some of the IWC go from “fuck this company, poor Cody! They made Cody look stupid! Haha actually Cody DOES look stupid! Now nobody will believe in him because he’s STUPID” like how quickly they went from defending him from bad booking to actually just saying he sucks.
Most fans would have preferred Sami or Jey who had better stories or Drew who had as much momentum but when they passed all of these guys fans thought it at least made sense because it Cody had a good shtick going.  Now theyve passed up four opportunities fans are ready for and they just want it to be over. Mant are just burnt out and will stop caring, especially when theres not a clear "next guy" to get behind.
I think the mistake with those three was there was no real follow up confrontation, I’m glad Cody called him out the very next night and Roman was exposed for being too scared to give a rematch. They had the crowd chanting “Roman’s scared” and to my ears Cody was even more over than before. Maybe this is just bad booking but I’m kind of impressed by the way Cody seems to be getting more popular every week, despite potentially bad booking. I think he’s gonna be at the top of the card and keep getting more popular as long as he’s chasing the title, but maybe I’m just too optimistic.
From my anecdotal evidence, like 50% of people there, especially kids, were rooting for Roman or wearing Bloodline merch and there was even a contingency of people who actively disliked Cody.
My entire Night 2 section was Bloodline and Roman fans. I was one of two Cody marks. Was quite interesting because throughout the weekend, Rhodes merchandise was flying off the rack and people were rocking the hoodie and hat, so I assumed it would be 60-40 split for Cody but definitely felt like Roman was a lot more popular by the crowds on that night.
"You were the better competitor last night. I had you." At no moment the words "cheat", "cheated" or "cheater" were uttered.   As for Cody, we hope he'll end the reign of terror. He's just the guy we put our hopes into like we did with Sami or Drew. If he fails (looks like's more of a when than if), someone else will come and we'll do it again. It's a vicious cycle. Guy gets hot, everyone believes maybe now it'll end, guy gets beat, then next guy gets hot. Rinse and repeat. If Ziggler would have come out at RAW out of nowhere and say "Roman, you're a goddamned cheater", he would instantly be over.
Yeah that’s so crazy to me, I’m not sure what else Roman has to do to be a heel. Acts like he’s God when he’s basically MJF always cheating to win. Maybe they’re saving that promo where somebody finally breaks down how often he’s cheated when they finally pull the trigger.
I am waiting for someone to call him a cheater! Was very frustrated Cody didn’t. I am HOPING they’re saving it for somebody’s promo when the company finally pulls the trigger, but it’s frustrating that not even the commentary mentions how much Roman cheats.
I think most of the rabid post-WM crowd of yore is mostly watching AEW now, saving Roman from a loud "Same old sh*t" chant this past Monday. I don't know why Cody called him the better competitor, or why Brock didn't help Cody get the rematch and win the title before turning on him for it. They think they got something better, I guess.

I like the idea of certified medical professionals legit having a kitchen sink with healing properties
Stories such as 'Throwing the kitchen sink at it' in order to be deemed fit enoigh to have a ladder thrown at your head is what makes this the sport of kings
Finn is a crazy bastard. 🫡
Beer? Yeah right, dude has never seen a carb in his life
Jesus Christ, Finn.
Wrestlers are just built different man
Just throw a z pak at it!!
Vitamins and prayers, brother!
Yeah, I cringed because he went straight through it. My knees would have been in my chin if I had done that. I couldn't imagine doing it after having a calf injury earlier in the month.
The Prince doesn’t fuck around.
I'm surprised he didn't maul Edge in the match if those are his x-rays
Id rather this match be the ending to The Demon rather than the match vs Reigns. Killing the demon with a conchairto is a fine end to the character and the year long story with TJD.
More pissed about the Demons loss to Reigns. After the ladder it would be ok for Balor to have taken the loss.
Finn being hurt and then being cleared has nothing to do with the ending. He wrestled the same match with all the crazy shit.  Edge just won because that's what they wanted.
How? Finn was already cleared by the time the match happened so it doesn’t make sense for that to be the reason.
Weird how edge won a lot of feuds as a heel

It's been an open secret for years that fans put way more importance on Meltzer's star ratings than he actually does. He's very open that it's a personal preference thing for him and styles he likes the best have an edge.
I loved reading Roger Ebert’s movie reviews. He was a fantastic writer, funny, incredibly knowledgeable about film. Still, there were many films he liked that I didn’t, and many films that I liked that he didn’t. I didn’t think he was wrong in his analysis (and I’d confidently say he’s agree vice versa). Opinions are opinions, not fact.  I can understand being interested in Meltzer’s ratings, but I think some put too much stock in them.
I like using Meltzers ratings to go back and watch some matches that he rated high, just to see what the fuzz was about.   Other than that: I think pure numbers are dumb in discussion the quality of anything where taste has such a big factor.
Meltzer's ratings are most helpful for people who have similar tastes to him. It's also a guideline for what matches should be searched out if you'd like to see the best matches of the moment. They are not the be all, but they're a good guide.
No one cares as much about Meltzer's star ratings as the folks who claim his opinion doesn't matter.
The amount of hate Meltzer get on twitter for just giving his opinion on matches is insane. Unlike other people he doesn't hate on anybody, he does the opposite. I've learned about so many Japanese classic matches because of him
He's like a movie reviewer. If you find his tastes are similar to yours, you should seek out the matches he highly rates. Otherwise, YMMV.
Indeed. To me Charlotte vs Rhea topped everything and Dave under-rating them vs the men doesn’t change my opinion at all.
I'll never understand getting upset about his ratings. Did you enjoy the match? If yes, that's all that matters. Stop worrying about this kinda shit and enjoy the matches that you enjoy instead of acting like Dave is your dad that your desperate for approval from, lol.
Amazing how that same thing needs to be repeated every few months because somehow the concept of an opinion is too difficult for some people to understand.
I don’t understand people being rude anyways. If you disagree just say your opinion of the match or whatever and go on your way. No need to be rude.
The people who complain about Meltzer's ratings care about them the most. That includes both fans and wrestlers.
It's so hilarious how easily gotten to people are about Meltzer's ratings. All they do is boost his credibility when they freak out about him
Remember the overreaction that was Twilight Princess getting an 8.8 from GameSpot where a ton of people thought it was too low? If it had gotten a 9.0, there probably wouldn't have been a shitshow...but at the same time, a .2 difference is barely enough to matter, especially for how arbitrary scores are.
I like Uncle Dave
Some people have never had a favorite album get hit with a 6/10 by Fantano before and it shows
Kinda wild that a lot of people take his star ratings as gospel.
But what if we add Kurt Angle to the mix?
People put way too much stock into meltzers ratings.
Ill never understand why people get mad over his star ratings as wrestling is all subjective/personal thing. We all will never agree on what makes a great match because we all like different things.  Meltzer himself even says its a personal thing.
I will never understand why the inevitable diatribes about Dave being Wrong always involve comparing a given match to other matches as though that makes the rating more or less valid.  People come out of the woodwork saying, "I can't believe he gave The Jam Strangler vs Victor Van Vivian 5 stars. It was a 4 star match a best. He's saying this was as good as Death Triangle vs The Elite."  Like, friend, you can find two apparently contrasting things to be equally good under their own merits. I can think Mint Crispy M&Ms are a 10/10 chocolate food product, and also think French silk pie is a 10/10 chocolate food product. The only real shared traits between the two products are that they're chocolate and I really enjoy the two of them. I'd also put those chocolate oranges that you have to smash against a counter, and subsequently scare your cat, on that list. I could give a goddamn *litany* of chocolate things that I'd give a 9 or 10. But each one of those things I'm rating within its own context. And some of those would probably spark significant disagreement because of my personal tastes in chocolate.  ~~the point here is that I really like chocolate~~
Who the fuck cares about star ratings by 1 guy? It is his opinion stop taking something so stupid so serious.
Are people sad that he didn’t give Rhea vs Charlotte 5? It’s not even in the top 20 mayches that Dave Meltzer didn’t give 5 stars to
I wouldn't really care if it didn't just further highlight a bias against women's wrestling in general from him  if there was ever a womens match that deserved 5* it was that and he still didn't give it, maybe if they were men or had more superkicks I guess
My only issue with Dave’s ratings is that he’s been much more generous with 5 star matches in recent years, when there were matches in the past that should’ve gotten it. How Bryan vs Orton vs Batista as a Mania main event isn’t a 5 star match, while multiple somewhat random tag matches on Dynamite (think all of the Bucks, Lucha Bros, etc matches) have that rating, totally hurts the legitimacy of his ratings.
The stars fascination is funny and fickle. I get that it is Dave’s gimmick and all but I think it is past tired now 40 years later.  Nobody should care this much about what he rates a match he half watches once while trawling his Twitter replies for bait.
I find grading matches on a scale silly.
"I know I shouldn't waste time with rude people"  Come on Dave, that's all you do on Twitter mate.
I mean he’s also said/implied he views his opinions as objective facts, and has bashed others opinions like Miro (tbf Miro did say he wanted Meltzer to burn in hell, so I can understand that).   Although yes, fans do take them too seriously. I don’t think guys like Gunther really care about star ratings.
Dave shut up nobody cares
My only opinion on Meltzer’s star rating system is that if he’s going to keep throwing around half stars he should just switch to ranking matches on a scale of one to ten.
My god people care way too much about this shit. Imagine being a movie buff and only using ONE journalist’s opinion as your measuring stick and getting bent out of shape about the ratings.
This should be stickied on every wrestling subreddit.
And to Dave's credit here, I personally would have knocked off a hell of a lot more than a quarter star just for Charlotte popping up and practically giving a bow to the crowd while she should have been selling and giving Rhea her moment.
Some people interpret his ratings as a personal attack on what they enjoy if it differs from their opinion, which is silly. I'm sure there are cinephiles out there that used to rage at Siskel & Ebert movie ratings. I've watched movies I thought were pretty good, then I see it's 17% rotten. It's okay to have a different opinion!
People getting hung up on his match ratings reminds me of what Jack Nicholson said defending the silliness of the Oscars: "It's good for some people and not bad for anyone."   Higher ratings have given esteem and attention to a lot of matches that people might not have otherwise seen and there's no sign that lower ratings have ever hurt the perception of a match.  The very fact that people always knock him for not giving the HBK/Undertaker WrestleMania matches 5 stars is definitive proof of the latter since his opinion that they weren't 5 stars hasn't changed the majority opinion that they are.   It's just not worth getting upset over something that doesn't have a tangibly negative effect.
As someone on the spectrum has Dave ever talked about that aspect at all?  He seems so matter of fact and has these clearly delineated lines (a half star and a star) that makes it hard for me to think with my experience that he isn't at least somewhat similarly inclined. I hope no one takes this as a critique of Dave because his focus on wrestling has lead to so many great stories over the years that I swear I have nothing but respect for him.
Screw the guy that replied to Dave, I give the match 4.67 stars just to spite him
babe wake up new meltzer rating system ruling came out
Dave Meltzer is a man.
Honestly I didn't see any "omg wtf were you thinking" star ratings and yeah most were 1/4-1/2 a star off my thoughts at most.
What frustrates me the most about Meltzer ratings is that he says this but then uses a quarter-star scale.  We're going to disagree about match ratings and that's fine. But if anything better than 4.5\* and less than 5.5\* is *basically* 5\*, just do that and then say that if you disagree with the score you disagree.   He's the one that establishes there being three stops between 4\* and 5\* and then says "well, we pretty much agree." But then what is the point of the 4.75?  And while it's true that it doesn't matter to a pretty large extent--every person is allowed to enjoy whatever they do to whatever ever extent they do--it really isn't the same as movies or music. Your favorite album probably got a 4 on Pitchfork, but there are 3000 other places to look for reviews. There are so few voices in wrestling that the biggest one can absolutely steer the discourse one way or another.
>and styles he likes the best have an edge.   Then why don't all Edge matches get 5 stars? Smhmh
Yes, it's just his opinion! A guide of sort to tell what's good and what's bad. There's no need for arguments about it.
Yeah it’s no different than saying this match was great, that match was fine, etc. 4.5 stars just means the match was better than you can ask for, 5 is supposed to be stupendous
He says that, but he has also genuinely used his own star ratings in arguments about whether someone/a match is better so I’m pretty sure he’s just covering his ass from criticism
One of my biggest annoyance it how fans put his match ratings on such a high level that we don't even talk about what how other wrestling journalist rate matches.     Imagine if there was only one movie critic that everyone brought up and didn't talk about all the other critics.
Yea but the people who an axe to grind don’t care.
I've assumed if he dropped the ratings, half his subscribers would vanish overnight. It's the tail wagging the dog for his media empire. Whether or not he wants to keep doing it or not, he's got to, even though it's clear he doesn't care about it anymore. His tweet just reads as tired to me.
It's been an open secret for years that Dave has his cake and eats it too.
> It's been an open secret for years that fans put way more importance on Meltzer's star ratings than he actually does  What a polite way of saying "Meltzer doesn't put any effort into this shit."
The problems is, as it is with reviews in general, when his reviews help wrestlers gain popularity, and become successful. This is in itself good, but fans tend to make the logical leap that reviewers are actively slighting or hampering the success of people they don't review highly.
What is normally missing is his reviews that come with the ratings. The comparison with Ebert is on point. Also, vgdunkey has an amazing essay about reviewers in general
>I like using Meltzers ratings to go back and watch some matches that he rated high, just to see what the fuzz was about.     That's literally what Meltzer uses them to indicate. And why he'll rate promotions of different levels differently.
They definitely shouldn’t be discussed, when talking about how great a wrestler is or  kayfabe accolades. They’re best used as recommendations for what matches you should be watching
That’s literally the point of his star ratings. They serve as a guide to recommend what to watch and not watch. It’s crazy that people get so riled up about them.
I mean, as he said, it’s an opinion. Are all opinions dumb? I don’t think any reasonable person thought Dave was insinuating these numbers are undeniable fact.
Just FYI, the expression is "what the fuss is about."
Plus he breaks his scale so they are almost meaningless to me. 7 stars is an A++ 😂
Absolutely. Meltzers ratings have frequently guided me to matches off my radar.
Dave is a big reason why I started watching new Japan.  That run from wrestlekingdom 8 onwards had so many high rated matches that I had to see what the fuss was about
It also helps wrestlers to make a name for themselves. I'm not likely to go out and watch every Will Ospreay match, but I do know he has a lot of 5\* matches. So when he randomly pops up on my tv screen or is advertised for a big ppv, I'm gonna be excited to see what he can do.
Yeah it's the subjective opinion of an influential match reviewer. Same deal with music reviews or film reviews or whatever.   I generally vibe with him on most things and so his ratings can be validating or a good way for me to find more of what I like. But he's one opinion, one reviewer, just one with outsized influence because he started doing this before anyone else. But holy fuck if I think a match is five stars and he gave it two stars why on earth would I be mad about that.
Seems to be the case about people who say awards shows don't matter. They seem to care the most about them anyone.
Unfortunately the other exception are people who have a lot of pull in some companies and base their entire match on it. Therefore creating a perpetual cycle on what they think wrestling should be. Which is moving the business away from some fans. Because too gymnastics moves and interference false finishes vs solid storytelling.
That's not true at all and pretty disingenuous to say. Many times you see people comparing wrestlers by how many 5 star matches they get, and also they act like it's a great accomplishment if a wrestler gets a 5 star matches. Personally I wouldn't have no problem with his ratings if he was more honest too. The small tag team showcase at Mania was wrestled in the same way, if not better, than any Elite matches for example.
I feel tribalism plays a factor in this situation.  I've been following The Observer for the last 5 years and I get the impression that Dave will give his honest opinion. Maybe it's WWE fanatic who scream the loudest but they don't like to hear criticism. Meltzer isn't Jim Carrey in Liar Liar.
Hell may not even wanna listen to movie reviewers lately. Did you see the metacritic score vs fan score on the Mario movie?  Oof.
I find that some people don't get that if you follow a critic's work long enough, even one you don't agree with, you can figure out how your opinion would differ. I check out Mark Kermode's reviews not because he's a genius authority but I know how we would differ on certain things and to get a grasp on what's out there and what might be worth my time.   Critics have always been guides, but people don't get that once you know your guide you don't need to follow their words to the letter to get the advice you need.
This is why we have this sub, so we can talk about it. Because I actually thought that the first 1/3 of the match was pretty mediocre. Then it picked up and it got really good. But in my opinion, it was not a 5 stars match. For me, it was 4,25.
Also, in retrospect, an 8.8 for Twilight Princess is pretty much about right. Great game! Just not as great as other Zeldas.
The same people that take PWI top wrestlers seriously when it’s openly kayfabe.
>Are people sad that he didn’t give Rhea vs Charlotte 5?  He set high expectations saying that it was the best WWE women's match of all time.
Stupid comment.   Akira Hokuto   Kyoko Inoue   Manami Toyota   Have a combined 26 five star matches.   Toyota alone has more than Ric Flair   Inoue has more than Akiyama  Hokuto has the same Steamboat  Also All Japan Women have more than freaking WWE
Why is it entirely out of the question that the Lucha Bros and Young Bucks are just fucking incredible?
I get your point here, but it's subjective, so he may have liked those other matches more than the Bryan/Orton/Batista match. Also, people's preferences evolve over time, so it's not unreasonable to think he might rate the WM30 match higher or lower if he were to re-watch it now, or vice-versa. Maybe he would rate some of those Dynamite matches lower if he watched them 5-10 years prior.
Have you considered that maybe he just likes modern wrestling more than the older stuff?  It's okay to have preferences.
Oh, good idea. Then he can give something a 9.5
I mean if you know basic maths you can do that yourself with his ratings
aj styles and edge matches 8 stars
Well, he was a part of “the greatest wrestling match ever”
This is the part that people forget:  The rating system was created during the tape-trading days, as a way for Meltzer to quantify his recommendations on which matches he thought other wrestling fans should check out.  Literally:  * 3 stars means “This is worth seeing”. * 4 stars means “You should watch this”. * 5 stars means “You must watch this”!  There’s no meaningful difference between a 4.75 and 5 star match; in much the same way that there isn’t much in the way of meaningful difference between Ebert giving a movie 3 stars versus 4.  It’s not an empirical scale; and it shouldn’t be treated as one.
I love the discussions his ratings bring. I just wish it wasn't so much "how could he think this?" and more "this is what I think"
It's different now, but for years Roger Ebert was the most prominent film critic and his reviews were talked about in a similar fashion. He was the standard for many. But obviously for films and matches, everyone has different tastes.
You think half his subscribers pay $10 a month to see his star ratings that are widely available elsewhere for free?
Tired of children who try to insult him because they can't handle seeing opinions they disagree with, yes.  That doesn't mean he doesn't care about his ratings and I don't think he's going to stop them because of the children, nor should he
Take the L lmao
Most of his tweets responding to idiots read as tired.
And thats perfectly fine. "You" either value his oppinion or you don't, and thats fine either way.
That's a pretty... Determined way to read that my friend.
> Also, vgdunkey has an amazing essay about reviewers in general   if it's not knack, it's whack.
>And why he'll rate promotions of different levels differently.  I still say Dave FEARS YANO.
Especially when it’s not even official. It’s just one man’s opinion yet a lot of people seem to take it like it’s gods word which I always thought was weird. HBK vs Taker at Mania 25 not being 5 stars should be reason enough to not take his ratings too seriously
Some however act like it.   But then again, I've seen years upon years of stupid discourse about scores in videogames and how mad some supposedly fans get for outlets not giving out 9 and 10s to games they think they will like.
I would have never gone back and watched Joe vs Styles vs Daniels from TNA Unbreakable if it wasn’t seeing that it was the last American match to pull a 5 until Cena/Punk MITB
The Wargames match in WrestleWar 92 for me. I sought it out because I was curious and holy shit, it still holds up to this day. Amusingly, Austin himself isn't that fond of it.
This is basically how I use his ratings. Some matches that he rates highly I’ll go back and watch, but mostly if someone gets a lot of highly rated matches I’ll be looking forward to what they do next.
Same people who get all pissy about the Oscars ''snubbing'' blockbusters.
“All right, fine, let's play the game. But I want to be very clear about something. This literally means nothing to me.”  https://preview.redd.it/k701ksxnalsa1.jpeg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0baefa191f9e0fa02f8c1ef0eba5a47fcf42ea51
Saw someone say that all Oscars discussion is entirely manufactured by bots and that there is no human being that cares about them in any capacity.  I guess I need to investigate whether or not my film class is being infiltrated by THE ROBOT MENACE.
You can have storytelling in high flying matches, you are just putting making up an imaginary limit on what storytelling in wrestling is.
>That's not true at all and pretty disingenuous to say. Many times you see people comparing wrestlers by how many 5 star matches they get, and also they act like it's a great accomplishment if a wrestler gets a 5 star matches.  I’ve seen this argument presented substantially more than I’ve seen people actually doing this. I actually think I’ve seen this argument posted in almost every single solitary post about Meltzer star ratings.  And I still cannot remember the last time i’ve seen someone on this sub that has used star ratings unironically as a metric for anything other than “woah cool.”
You lasted three paragraphs before making it clear that you're just mad that AEW gets more 5* than WWE, I'm honestly impressed.
Honest?lol it's his subjective opinion. He isn't claiming he views these matches as some objective unbiased source. He likes the stuff he likes and doesn't like the stuff he doesnt. I'm not sure what else people expect, he's just a guy giving his thoughts
I have not seen fucking anyone unironically use Meltzer's star ratings to compare wrestlers both on reddit and on Twitter, and I've seen some of the stupidest arguments on both those sites.  Fuck are you on about lmfao
>The small tag team showcase at Mania was wrestled in the same way, if not better, than any Elite matches for example.  I greatly disagree, I wish you were more honest about your *opinion*.  see how that works?
Film reviewers watch literally so many movies a week that you'd grow to hate the medium. They get excited about stuff that innovates or surprises them, as anyone would. If they're not as excited about a movie as someone who is actually super excited for it and doesn't see as many a variety and range as they do, that's fine and unsurprising. The divergence in metacritic scores is also unsurprising, because you're seeing two different groups of people who both say 'The movie's good' but one writes it as 6/10, the other 10/10, but the latter get mad that the other side's score is lower.  I'm still in my 20's but I've seen this happen so much that I wonder if this phenomenon/cycle will be recognised by future anthropologists as a community ritual as important to our society as Easter.
The critics seemed to approach the Mario movie like they were expecting a movie for adults or at least a Pixar kind of animated movie. It's a Mario movie people. It's not supposed to be serious or taken seriously. It's supposed to be fun.
Whereas I saw it as a slow build to something magnificent. It felt a lot more like a fight than the tag match did to me, personally.
Dom and Rey was my top match on initial watch. I plan on rewatching soon
TBF wwe have only really had proper womens matches since 2016, hes also gone more than 7 years without giving men a 5 star match in wwe
And that isn't worth a 5?
That TV match was not better than the Mania XXX triple threat. It didn’t have as good of a story or build. It’s also not fair if Charlotte vs Rhea getting only 4.75 is justified by the story and build lacking while that tag match did. Bryan’s title win had good story and wrestling.   Dave’s rating legitimacy goes down if he’s inconsistent like this. No, it isn’t the end of the world, but Meltzer is an influential guy in wrestling news and reviews, so his ratings are considered fairly important. Roger Ebert was similar for movies, wouldn’t have been good if his ratings became inconsistent.
10 stars in Tokyo Dome
Goddamn it. I forgot all about that until you. I was fine with not remembering.
No, I think *you* forget:  If everyone on the planet doesn't validate my opinions, that means there's a possibility that my opinions are wrong, which is impossible, which only leaves the possibility that everyone else is wrong and therefore stupid. I'm a nice guy, I don't *want* people to be stupid, but by not agreeing with me they are kind of forcing my hand. That's the real reason why I get mad when people disagree with me, because I'm just so *disappointed* that they aren't living up to their potential... of agreeing with me on everything.  ^^^^/s
What about the rest? He screwed his scale by going above 5
Some people don't think and just speak
Before anyone else in one place? Yeah.
I don't pay attention to them. I just think he'd rather talk about his feelings on a match in a more complete and nuanced way than reducing everything down to a number. People like the feel of taking a complex thing and treating it as a single number and saying "This better than that." And once he puts the number on it, then all the spreadsheet nerds come at him with the "whatabouts." And that's what he's dealing with today.  I don't actually have a problem with his ratings scheme. I have a problem with how they're used to shut down conversations instead of used to start them.
Which is honestly just as weird, he gave that match 4.75, you guys are like a quarter star off lol. So if he went full five then suddenly his star ratings are more serious? I think Undertaker vs. HBK is 5, personally but that doesn't make my or your rating more legit.
how can ratings be official?
I also think that the previso that five stars means 'You Must Watch' and that the ratings came from a guide to Tape Trading, he'd probably not immediately give a match the full five stars if everyone, especially his near-entirely US readership, would have seen it already. That's lost on a lot of people.   Taker HBK's match was excellent but it's hard to effusively recommend once you know everyone's seen it and maybe the only people who haven't would be jaded puro guys who'd sniff at it being seen as up there with King's Road bangers but admit it's good nonetheless.
Did he ever say why he started rating matches over five stars, or has he always done that? I feel like that's an indication of how he feels about the sanctity of his ratings.
Well that’s on them. I don’t blame Dave for that and I actually like taking a look at his star ratings.
Go onto literally any popular gaming sub. Hell, go onto damn near ANY gaming sub, particularly one that's a triple A title with a lot of marketing hype. Wait until reviews start dropping and grab your popcorn.     Everybody is mad about any review that doesn't line up with their own opinion.     If the game didn't have an early access option (so no regular player has gotten it, or a statistically irrelevant number of folks got it a day early from Amazon shipping, etc) and people are excited for the game, any score below 8 will be subject to unfiltered rage.     Well, aside from the handful of people who are upset about some detail that they noticed in a preview on a gaming site, and who think the game will be total dogshit. THOSE folks are furious about any score above a 6.     If there was an early access period for people who preordered or got a deluxe edition, these rules hold true, but now they'll start going after any person who had a different opinion as well.
theres like 20 comments in this thread already complaining about people taking meltzer's ratings as fact and 0 comments implying they are fact
This guy's being an idiot, but I have seen people use his ratings that way. They weren't stating it as an objective opinion though. It's just a useful metric for comparison, as he's been fairly consistent in how he rates matches, and there's a long public record of his ratings going back many decades.
Which is exactly why Siskel and Ebert made mad money reviewing with simple thumbs up/down and not numerical values.
Yeah several reviews literally phrased as 'well its an okay movie *if youre only there for nostalgia purposes.*'  And everyone is like 'its a Mario movie, what the hell else am I here for?'
How dare you have a civilized discussion on the internet!
It not being a 5 for him doesn't also not make it the best one.
Maybe it is, Maybe it isn’t, at the end of the day it’s **HIS** opinion.
You're mentioning the occasion of the match a lot.   >random tag matches on Dynamite  >Mania main event  >TV match was not better than the Mania XXX  Do you think Wrestlemania matches are just inherently better than TV matches?  >It’s also not fair if Charlotte vs Rhea getting only 4.75 is justified by the story and build lacking while that tag match did.  The Bucks and the Lucha Brothers have wrestled so many times in so many places. If you've watched all those matches, you're not sitting there now wondering what the story is.  Each match builds on the last one.   That can be true of Charlotte vs. Rhea too down the line. The Bucks vs. Lucha Bros didn't get 5 stars until All Out 2019, their sixth match.
> That TV match was not better than the Mania XXX triple threat.  Well we'll just have to fundamentally disagree, and apparently so does Dave.
The meme is fun but it's actually Osaka-jo Hall where he dispenses mad stars
As someone who used to susbcribe for a few years, nost of his subscribers don't really care for that. They do it for   1. The newsletter which is a legitimately wrestling business overview and has some great writing. Seriously the best account ever of the Montreal Screwjob that even guys like Bret Hart reference came out like the next day in that newsletter.  2. The radio shows where you get reviews and industry discussion along with hot topics.  3. To vote in some end of year awards.   The time the subscribers get the star ratings and the general public get them are negligible and have been for years.
As long as one person is subscribed and posts them, the star ratings are readily available within around 5 minutes of the newsletter being released.   So, for most people, they will be out by the time they actually read them.
There is no way anyone subscribes for the privilege of seeing star ratings like half an hour before it gets posted here.   I mean it doesn't even get posted at the same time every week, so are you assuming thousands of people are hitting refresh for hours on the every week just to see the ratings first lol
LOL, you clearly have never read his newsletter. He doesn't put the ratings in one section. They're scattered throughout the newsletter. It's a lot more effort to get his ratings from the newsletter.
  He does give his specific comments on the show, in the newsletter, and on social media when he wants to.  He just doesn't have something to say about every match. I think listening to what he says will help tell us what he'd rather talk about.  >I don't actually have a problem with his ratings scheme. I have a problem with how they're used to shut down conversations instead of used to start them.  Another area where the problem is children, not the ratings
Yeah, I've always found it weird how bent out of shape people get over his rating of 4.75 star matches, but that match in particular. A .25 difference is so incredibly minor, but some people take it so seriously and act like it ruins his "credibility" or something.
Very True even though they used numerical values in their written reviews as well. Maybe America's most beloved critics got by through letting their words do the taking.
if it makes you feel any better, i said that i didn't think night one was one of the greatest mania's in history and someone said i was wrong and insinuated that everyone else liking something was proof that i was wrong.
> Do you think Wrestlemania matches are just inherently better than TV matches?  It's not that, exactly, but it being a WrestleMania main event is absolutely part of it.     WrestleMania is the biggest event in wrestling by a pretty wide margin at this point, making it similar to the playoffs or championship games in sports. And if you ask people about the best NFL games of all-time, the list skews pretty hard toward the playoffs.   [Here's](https://www.yahoo.com/now/20-best-nfl-games-time-220000129.html) a Yahoo list just as an example. There are obviously good, competitive games all season long, but only three of twenty are from the regular season and not a single one is from the first seven weeks of the season. The stakes being higher or lower absolutely changes how games are viewed.   And Meltzer agrees! He says that part of the rating of a match is the story leading up to it. And while there are definitely some storyline stinkers that come to mind, the WrestleMania XXX main event was not one of them.  I don't think anyone would say that *any* match taking place at WrestleMania or even *any* main event of WrestleMania is necessarily better than any match not at WrestleMania. But a great match with a great story is absolutely made better by it being the main event of WrestleMania, same as a great game is made better by being the Super Bowl.  EDIT: corrected spelling
That's fair, Osaka-jo is an awesome venue.
I forgot about the year end awards. I can definitely see that. It's a big echo chamber for his fans to reflect his preferences back to him, with a few notable exceptions. But I can see the participatory element of it being fun.  The radio shows I've listened to are not really to my taste. They sound too much like the general discourse around here for me to be interested in them. But that's probably because people are parroting takes they heard on the shows, so by the time I hear a clip from the show, I've already heard a dozen times here.  The excerpts from the newsletter people post here are usually pretty poorly written. I'm guessing you're referring to the longer-form historical articles. I've always thought Dave was an excellent historian and a terrible reporter, and I'll stand by that.
>Another area where the problem is children, not the ratings  We can agree on that.
To me, and this is with any reviewer, that last .25 is a huge difference. A five star match or movie is one of the masterpieces. A classic the reviewer thinks should be remembered for all time. A 4.75 is a really, really great match but just not quite a masterpiece. Sure there isn't much difference between a 3 and a 3.25 but there's a big difference between a really, really great match and a masterpiece.  So I understand why people get upset that a reviewer doesn't think their favorite match or movie is a masterpiece. I do agree with you, however, that it doesn't ruin his credibility.
Because in some ways it seems almost petty.  A match absolutely worshipped by fans due to the build up, the stakes, the quality of the match, etc.   Dave: "Eh, 4.75'  Random solid match on X day of the week with minimal/no build in a smaller company that had no stakes to it?  Dave: "5 Star. Watch immediately."
Show me a Meltzer 5 star match that you regret watching
yes, it is petty to be upset about a 5% difference in star rating.
Imagine you go 4-5 years of college with a 4.0 GPA and the last paper ever knocks you down to a 3.9 because the professor just decides he 'didnt enjoy it as much as last years, though this is still clearly paper of the year to anyone else who reads it.'  The guy literally said the match being long was bad and he knew all the false finishes were coming so he wasnt hyped and thus lowered the score.  *The guy who worships long matches with false finishes.*
This analogy doesn't work because my GPA has stakes. Meltzer's opinion doesn't.
'It's real to me, dammit!'

Would the Saudis pay extra for such a monumental title change at their event?
It could be a cliffhanger, it will be next month so not sure who is going to be a real threat to Reigns tho.  Unless Cody beats Lesnar at Backlash and then beats Reigns in Saudi. Cody goes from failed to finish the story in April, to bounce back by defeating a top star and finish the story that quickly in May? Drag the storyline, just to finish it in Saudi, which is like that Rollins-Fiend scenario all over again, it would be nonsense.  Could just be a celebration for his 1000-day milestone, WWE will let everyone know this 1000-day achievement, then let him face a top star (seems like Rollins is the best choice now) in Saudi and gets the W.  Let Reigns Show Up & Win.

Damn, that is awesome! You should play him out to the ring at Summerslam. Well done
Loved it, nice job!
Killer job! I love things like this
That was amazing! So impressed.

Force this man to rest till smackdown before Backlash if he has to be there. All this stop and go with health issues getting worse
I've been reading about Drew's health issues since like around WM38. Dude needs to take a break.
Dudes been banged up for awhile and they always have him come back to be put into hard hitting matches. He needs this break.
Doctors diagnosed him with an acute case of “Just wrestled Gunther”
Man give him rest and force it if he doesn’t accept it. He has been a work horse but his health should be the utmost priy
Damn this man has had a lot of bad luck in just recent time. From having COVID, food poisoning, the flu which he managed to still work Crown Jewel against Kross despite that, and now whatever this issue is. All the best to him but at this point he deserves some kind of break.
This poor man does NOT take the time off he needs. Duct tape him to the bed if you have to.
Drew's had some rotten luck with his health the past few years
Let him rest he needs it
force him to rest… Drew has been an absolute animal for the past 8-10 months.
These have been recurring reports since Crown Jewel, quite concerning now. Needs time off, don't need to explain how important it is in this business. Wrestlers literally work themselves to death.
Drew is a workaholic to the nth degree. Hopefully he uses the time to rest and recuperate considering how many times he’s worked sick or injured the past few years. We see you Drew!
Take a break Drew, there are no promising feuds right now anyway
Drew is 100% AEW bound and rightly so.
He also had food poisoning few months ago, hopefully he's going to be OK soon
Im glad he got to have a match at Wrestlemania. Always felt bad his big Universal title win was in a small gym in front of noone. Hope he recovers soon. As a side note, note how many of the wrestlers featured in the 2018 Vice "Evolve" documentary became big stars(Drew, Darby, Theory, Ethan, etc)
Someone needs to tell drew to stop and get healed up
Drew needs to take some serious time off. He’s been working hurt or sick for at least a year at this point.
This guy needs to take time off and recoup.  Too many stories of him working while sick or hurt.
At this point, they can force Drew to take time off. Hunter has been juggling hot storylines right now that Drew’s absence won’t be noticed as much. Plus we got Nakamura back to give out bangers again.
Always in hard hitting matches but no pay-off
It doesn’t help that he hasn’t had proper rest for any of that either. I know he’s passsionate but he needs to listen to his body and take a well deserved break.
What?? How did you jump to the conclusion he's 100% AEW bound?
Hope not, AEW treats big men horribly
I'm not sure i agree, but I'd be very curious what role and feuds he'd start with in AEW
Contract ending soon and both not agreeing on new one + being treated badly in later years
I agree but tbh I'd want him just for the matches
He lost to Roman in a really bad way and then sing a song after a loss!! he is pretty much midcard since 2021. in aew he can have adam page, Omega, and lots of other new faces
When does his contract end?
The singing wasn't meant to be broadcast, that was just to have some fun with the fans as Tyson Fury often sings after his fights
some reports say July and others say end of the year
And you’re just listening to the reports that serve your narrative?
Yeah?
Wow, I’ve never seen anyone just admit to that before lol
Considering his contract is up sometime this year and he hasn't agreed to a new deal with WWE makes fans speculate he is leaving soon. Some people think he is unhappy with his position in WWE. But only time will tell

Ready to see Moné, HZK and Ay Zee Em tear the house down!
Wonder what they’re planning with ELP and Finlay on the same team, with all this Black and Gold stuff starting
To anyone more familiar with NJPW than I am, do you have any idea what time they might run the three-way title match?
What an awesome card!  I just hope the four non-heavyweight title matches get a good amount of time.
Really hope they give the women's match time.  It's honestly the match I'm most looking forward too
SANADA is finally going to do it, I can feel it.  Also, I wonder if Finlay's newly dyed eyebrows are going over in that six-man.
The opener is actually the "Shinnichi Champion Grand Prix Celebration Match/6-Man Tag Team Match" so there are 9 matches. I guess they didn't make a graphic for it.
New Giga Chad Sanada thumbnail please.
Hiromu vs Robbie should be a banger AND Sanada better win that title or he is going to look like hot garbage!
This is going to be a real weird SANADA match. Conventional wisdom would say he should win, finally, and let the LIJ guys chase him. But... at the same time this all feels like a red herring just to level up Okada.   At the end of the day, probably the first time I'm not 100% sure SANADA is going to lose.
I haven’t watched njpw since WK13 might watch it again any matches I should watch to catch me up.
Interesting, isn't it usually that the NJ Cup winner gets the title shot at Dominion? I might be wrong though, thank you in advance
I think it's tomorrow for all timezones
Damn, New Japan have some ugly-ass belts now. Only the Jr title holding the fort
Looking forward to it, should be a fun show. Pretty hyped for Mercedes/AZM/Hazuki and Okada/Sanada. And as everyone has said, I do hope that 3 way gets a lot of time. It would be fantastic.
Can anybody tell me what the numbers between the names mean?
What time is this show pst?
It’s like the photographer said to David Finlay, “Look angry. No, angrier!”
Great card! Really hoping Aussie Open pick up the belts.. is Sanada in with a chance of winning?? He had a great run in the NJ Cup and is actually interesting for the first time since I've been watching New Japan
How would watch this in the US? I'm totally new to njpw.
Is this on NJPW WORLD?
I might be crazy but I think Sanada wins this as an introductory title win and drops it back to okada at dominion (maybe with a defence against Naito at Dontaku)  In njpw the first title win isn't the one that's emphasised the most, normally it's their second title win when they get their definitive run as the top guy, so I expect Sanada to win here, but have an even bigger win later this year
It's SANADA'S time. It has to be.
Feeling an Aussie gold sweep
Imagine one Bullet Club, an international organization with members like ELP, Jay White, Taiji Ishimori, and maybe even KENTA! Sounds awesome to me.  Or, the other Bullet Club. David Finlay, Gedo, Chase, perhaps House of Torture. That sounds like something less exciting.
Maybe about an hour into the show
I'd recommend you not to take any risk and jump in 40 minutes into the show. If the match was higher on the card, I'd agree with jumping in after an hour but the match is right in the middle of the card and if they want to give time to all the other title matches that aren't the main event (because that one is sure to take an entire hour), then the opening matches should fly by.
I have a bad feeling the TV title match is only going to get 15 minutes at the very most.
Nah it's always the Sakura Genesis main event, Dominion main event is usually set after Wrestling Dontaku in May
No…
Australia it’s tonight
For real… RIP to the old heavy and IC titles

I'd say he MUST win today or he's completely done as title challenger. He's like 1-7 vs Okada so they're not even close in their power level but Sanada has jumped to another faction very recently so maybe that could help him do what he couldn't in LIJ.
njpwworld.com
Yes
I mean, could have easily said the same thing about the Elite vs Firing Squad stuff too  The Elite had Kenny, the Bucks, Cody, Hangman  Firing Squad had the Tongans, Chase, and Big Yuj  Not really much of a feud tbh
I can't take credit for it, it was some random comment I saw a while ago, but basically it looks like we're heading for Bullet Club Dicks vs. Bullet Club Assholes.  You'll have the babyface-ish (by comparison) dickheads like Jay White, El Phantamso, and Juice Robinson where their shenanigans are cheeky and fun and they're basically amusing trolls.  And you'll have the full heel assholes like Finlay and House of Torture, where they'll just get rightfully booed out of the building for being irredeemably awful bad guys.   The most ironic part is that Dick (Togo) is not a dick, and in fact, Dick is an asshole.
Yeah I don’t see a world it goes a second over 15 honestly
Read it again edited my comment submitted it by mistake.
Ah okay, idk why I had that in my head haha, my bad!  Appreciate the explanation!
Man that’s a pretty dick way to respond to an honest question lol
My mistake, thank you!
Disregard my message. Idk why I was only thinking of pacific time
Thank you
Thank you
Slight correction which doesn't detract from your point at all but Chase and Yujiro were aligned with the Elite following the split between Elite/OG
Chase and Yuj are always getting the shaft.
If it does help clear up some confusion, when EVIL won the NJC in 2020, the timing of it led to him getting his title match at Dominion  As for why it was that way in 2020, COVID
I watch a lot of NJPW, and despite an overall positivity with the fans, the gatekeeping is strong.
Yeah I feel bad for Chase. Love the dude and think he does great work, but Gedo clearly doesn’t see him as anything more than a mechanic to shine up the low card.  He had a *great* match with Tama in the G1 two years ago or so that ended with a Gun Stun counter out of the Package Piledriver. Chase got carried to the back with tears in his eyes cause he was **so close** to a big win… and Gedo did nothing with it.
I guess why bother trying to get more people into the things that you like when you can just try to feel mentally superior to them instead?
I love Chase too. He mixes old school and modern in a very interesting way, and I always find him entertaining.  Yujiro though? Yeesh. I was ready for his singles surge when he entered the G1 the first time, but my goodness. It was a rough watch.
Exactly. It's crazy dude.

Honestly, I think there wouldn't be as much contention about Meltzer's star ratings today if he wasn't as sour on pro wrestling in the 2000s as he seemingly was.  A lot of stuff had happened in that decade alone to turn him off of wrestling, or at least make him cynical regarding it. The two biggest US promotions had both died off simultaneously, the Japanese scene was going through some turmoil with the departure from All Japan by Misawa and several others (not to mention New Japan going through its own rough patch with Inokiism), and TNA, despite rising up to be the #2 for a while, was severely mismanaged and giving off initial signs it wouldn't last long up until Panda Energy steps in. Just to name a few, of course.  That, plus the meteoric rise of MMA and ESPECIALLY UFC, had wrestling on the backburner for Dave, as well as subscribers to the Observer, even if he did still report on pro wrestling through that time. You can see this in the Promotion of the Year awards, for instance, where Pride won from 2001-2003, and UFC won from 2006 all the way up to 2011 with the sudden re-emergence of New Japan.
2 things stick out.  1. Meltzer has a style he prefers and will rank those matches higher, per his opinion. He's more about technical masterpieces than showmanship or energy. The fact that people get mad when he obviously leans one direction is hilarious. Like they expect him to wake up and suddenly hate work rate marathons in the Tokyo Dome. 2. He's getting more generous with his ratings as he gets older. Is he enjoying wrestling more now? Is he less critical now than when he was younger? Or is there an improvement in match quality over the years?
What is the average match length across all five star matches? What is the average age of the competitors? How many were won by pinfall? Submission? DQ? Any time limit draws? How many of those? Which wrestlers have the most five star matches per year as an active pro wrestler? Which wrestlers have had the most ****3/4 matches without ever having a five star match?
Meltzer was overly picky with some classic WWF matches, including Warrior/Savage, Undertaker/Michaels and Steamboat/Savage.   However, please show me the 5 star Mr Perfect match. Maybe against Bret, but only maybe. Show me the even 4-star Jake Roberts match; I can't think of a classic Jake match. Promo? Yes. Match? No.
"I will not provide any commentary."  Yeah, but you sure did selectively choose some "context" to make people draw the conclusions you wanted.
He only gave 5 stars to 7 matches for the entirety of the 2000s. All 7 of those were either in Japan, in NA with all Japanese wrestlers, or involved Samoa Joe.
I’m no expert but when I watch older wrestling videos it seems pretty undeniable that the technical quality of wrestling has improved over years *in general*. So if this guy’s ratings rely heavily on technical skill, makes sense that the numbers are getting higher.
> He's getting more generous with his ratings as he gets older. Is he enjoying wrestling more now? Is he less critical now than when he was younger? Or is there an improvement in match quality over the years?  He is getting more generous for WWE, but I think it's actually gotten better.  How many matches were amazing that he was wildly off on? I would have given Taker/HBK 1 the 5 star, but he gave it 4.75. Wasn't like he said it wasn't great.
As to your second point, I definitely think an improvement in match quality has led to higher ratings across the board. Even the most mid episodes of Raw, SD, Dynamite, etc. have better wrestling than a LOT of TV from 25-30 years ago.
Yeah I did this for fun earlier but have no desire to dive deeper into that kind of analysis. But the link is in the post so you're welcome to find the answers.
>Any time limit draws?  Joe-Punk II, Bryan-Kenny, Bryan-Hangman I. There may be more, but I know those 3 for sure got 5 stars.
New to statistics? And am I making then draw those conclusions or are those the logical conclusions to draw?
Are you only watching old WWF? Just because they're executing more complex maneuvers doesn't mean their technical skill is better. Especially since many of those maneuvers stretch suspension of disbelief.
Dude, you know exactly what you're doing when you mention the parking lot match from AEW having the same rating as the Flair/Steamboat trilogy.   Saying you aren't going to provide commentary when that's the kind of context you're adding is disingenuous. Just say what you think about Dave's ratings and be done with it.
Yes I know what I'm doing. I'm pointing out a factual statement that is noteworthy.

This is why the ending was so frustrating. It's not that Roman won, but the ending was perfectly setup for the most poetic Dusty Finish of all-time and they just... didn't.
Refs are generally worthless historically.  I wish it was mentioned more the next day.  Like Adam Pierce or whatever idiot is in charge should make mention. If not to set up a rematch which then just to announce that the ref has been fined or suspended.  The NBA issues press releases when there are blown calls in games that they review on video after.
I thought they were going to restart the match considering he came back and have the big fake out and then have Cody win. That's what I was more upset about, not how Roman cheated to win the match but how Solo was banned from ringside and there was and had been no  repercussions
Ejection ends when the match does.  Prove Solo didn't hope the barricade right after the bell ran.
Kayfabewise, what could he have done? Reverse the decision and make it a disqualification? How would that help Cody?
Once the match is over you're allowed back and he only saw him after the match was over.
Plot convenience.
I'm sure there's been people who've been ejected who've come out to celebrate after the match was over.
Adam Pearce should of added if Bloodline interferes, Roman loses his titles
Hes stupid
The match was over, it’s not like he is banned from ringside for the rest of the night
Bc… the match was already over
I would assume that he didn't see anything happen, so he couldn't reverse the decision. At most, he could have sent Solo to the back again
Roman winning was one thing, but it’s just stupid that Solo came back after being ejected to help Roman again. Lesnar should’ve cost Cody the title match. It would’ve been so out of left field, but at least it would make more sense in kayfabe that nobody could’ve prepared for that. Also would’ve been a crazy moment to close the show.
I'd like to give an answer but after Raw (and Vince's messing up the script and the morale) I couldn't bring myself to rewatch anything from Wrestlemania
[my reaction when](https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/129zi4i/comment/jequdxl/?context=3&sort=top)
My conspiracy theory is that is wasn’t supposed to be Solo.  They got cold feet on somebody, and just had to make Solo coming back out fit the finish.  That’s the only thing that makes sense to me, why even have Solo out to start the match?
I was thinking the same. I was convinced they were going to restart the match until Roman slowly walked off.
That big tv screen is just for looks apparently
Lots of kayfabe questions. Like why not cheat if the opponent is cheating. Why not kick Solo in the balls and eye rake/poke so he’s out then finish Reigns? Why fight fair when surrounded? Paul always distracting and Solo interfered 3x at that point I would’ve stepped on his barefoot toes or at least tickled him hell lol. It bothers me when these ‘superhero’ faces are too good to fight dirty like they’re righteous. Then heel turn 7 months later and suddenly become dirty tricksters themselves.  That’s the main thing I liked about Asuka vs Bianca. Two faces, Bianca didn’t attempt the hair whip UNTIL asuka tried to mist her. Meaning it was an option but she reserved it once her enemy started using cheap tactics so did she.
![gif](giphy|RzA2j0j0zJPY1nRnou|downsized)
Solo hid after interfering. From the ref’s perspective, Solo just appeared with Heyman in the ring after the match was over.
“Because this ref right here? This is my ref. This cameraman? That’s my cameraman.”
What’s he gonna do?  Risk his life by pissing off the bloodline?  No thanks buddy
\*Solo used hoodie!\*     \*Referee doesn't recognize Solo\*     \*Solo is hidden, highly effective!\*
The Jeff Jarrett special if we have a destroyed guitar somewhere
Cody winning with a dusty finish would have been so perfect I really thought it was gonna happen
To clarify, what we’re saying by a Dusty finish is when the babyface gets the pop for winning the match by the decision is overturned right?  Like when Jericho beat triple h for the title on raw in 2000
I was watching night 2 at a local bar and everyone at my table was waiting for the dusty finish for an absurdly long time. Really deflated the whole evening at that point.
I honestly thought briefly reverse Dusty finish with that as the reasoning.
They could restart the match. This sort of thing used to happen in the days of the classic "Dusty finish." And of course there's the infamous Starrcade '97 example of a big PPV match that had a finish and then a restart.
This is what I’m thinking. He didn’t see him actually do anything so can’t reverse the decision. But Monday a statement could have been sent out saying “after video review the referee missed Solos interference and we apologize to Cody and the fans. He has been fined and will be suspended for 2 weeks”.  That would be a master class in Kayfabe right there.  Where’s Jack Tunney when we need him.
If Solo isn't out at ring side, then everyone is going to assume the match won't end until he shows up.  Exactly the same thought process, I think alot of people had about the Usos when they didn't come out at first. We all knew they had to show up.  With Solo elected and the Usos chased off, the audience is going to believe the match might actually end and that Cody might actually win.  So it was done to create some extra believability in the false finishes and to drive up anticipation for the thing everyone wanted to see, before it got snatched away.
Would have protected Roman and everything.   More than anything, I’m just upset that the opportunity for the greatest ever Dusty finish was passed up
That's how it was originally used but now a Dusty Finish is just anytime a match ends and the decision is overturned.
Why restart though?  If you see Solo is there, how does the ref know he didn't catch Solo trying to come back in...but before he did?  There's still nothing the ref knows about and can point to conclusively that proves he made the wrong decision.  So its let it go, or DQ for attempted rule breaking.
Not sure more adding even more clusterfuck upon the already happening clusterfuck would have helped.

It's how they build babyfaces.
Probably. Didn’t make sense then, and it sure doesn’t know. And it’s worse because fans actually like Cody, like really like Cody.

This is a good team:  They have a unified motif  They're not a random team-up, there's a story behind why they're teaming  They have kickass tag team moves and a finisher  They've stayed together for two months!  -  Take note, main roster.
I'm really happy for Isla Dawn. From almost being bullied out of wrestling by Tessa Blanchard to becoming a tag team champion in WWE
"I am both frightened and aroused."
As a Scotsman, it’s crazy to see so many of my countrymen and women in WWE at the moment.  Doudrop  Nikki Cross  Drew McIntyre  Joe & Mark Coffey  Wolfgang  Isla Dawn  Alba Fyre  Noam Dar  We were happy to just see one Scotsman in the company (a proper Scot, sorry Hot Rod!), and now we’re spoiled for choice!
I will never remember that Alba is KLR. Confuses me every time I see a post lol
Finally, after carrying the NXT UK women's division for nearly two years, after leaving that brand and having her name and presentation changed in NXT, after losing an unnecesary amount of times to Mandy Rose, and even after losing to some rookies not so much time ago... FINALLY Alba is champion again!! I was starting to think that she was receiving the role of the 'veteran that wins every but the most important (title) matches'. Glad to see that was not the case.  Happy for Isla Dawn too! I thought they would simply forget of the talent that was left after NXT UK finished, but it was the opposite since not only Isla is champion In NXT but we've also seen Blair Davenport, Stevie Turner and Lyra Valkyria there too (the latter seems to have a permanent schedule with the show).  Finally, just realized that Alba is the only woman in the entire company that has chances of holding every active female title there. She's been NXT UK women's champion, now she's NXT women's tag champion. Hopefully in the future she reaches the NXT women's title too, she would be closer to the previously mentioned achievement of holding every active female title in the company.
i feel like these two are gonna be big draws with women
Stupid sexy Pennywise
Scottish Witch Project
These 2 were only put together recently, but already have so much chemistry. Isla might be my favorite star in NXT, since I’m a sucker for witchcraft.  Long may they reign.
Just dawned on me that all 4 women's tag champs are redheads.
The Hex Girls
I knew they always had something special with Isla Dawn, even back when she was a one-and-done in the Mae Young classic.   I hope she can carry this momentum forwards
Psycho Scott Gals.... I wanted to give that title to Nikki&Piper team. Hopefully both tag teams face each other one day
They should've edited Kamaru Usman's arm on them
Smiling! Vince is back!
I love this team. Alba especially
>Take note, main roster.  bUt cAn tHeY cOeXiSt?!
I'm sorry, from almost what now?
Scaroused*
Just FYI, she's back to being Piper Niven again.
Gallus boys on top
Two Scotty Hotties  &#x200B;  Turn it up!
They know each other really well since their days in NXT UK and actually teamed once there, so it makes sense to see that both work really well with each other even if they're been teaming for just one month and a half.  I hope they have a lenghty title reign (like KC²) since the NXT creative team could build more teams for their women's tag division while having Alba and Isla as the female top heels in the show and have good title defenses to give the titles some prestige (just like, again, KC² did last year).
I'd be 100% ok with the four of them as a stable on the main roster
Yep, [this tweet](https://twitter.com/IslaDawn/status/1216088241688010752) is from when everyone was exposing Tessa
Fearection
I knew that but for some reason still typed Doudrop.  Maybe I was just used to it at this point!
Wow I remembered the response to Tessa's whole "Can women support women" tweet but I forgot it was Isla Dawn. Good for her.
Yikes.
Hornified

I support Indi Wrestling
Long may she reign 👑
when did they jazz up the women's belt? it looks cute, i like it
👍
#👍🏻
👍🏽 one of my favorite moments from last weekend just because i really didn’t think it’d happen. great for her
That's not a render.  THEES is a render.  .  .  .  ...I see you've played rendery, imagey before.
Indi Wrestling! Clap, clap, clapclapclap!
I'm down for this. Well Deserved! And I actually hope she stays in NXT because I don't see her flourishing on the main roster unfortunately.
I think her mom is chilean so I take this like a champion for Chile... Viva Chile CTM!!!
👍
When do they start to take the UFC route of just photoshopping a random arm holding the belt onto a picture of the champion?
I was really disappointed that they made absolutely no mention of Index on NXT this week after Dexter helped her win. I don't mind Indi being the Champ if we're getting them back together, but on her own she doesn't feel like she's at the level of being the champion
![gif](giphy|MjowsTrZVoSqRLhgcF)
F in the chat for WWE's graphics guy who now has to deal with tracing a matte for a wrestler in white gear with a white belt on a white background.
I support Indi Wrestling 👍🏽
She looks cooler with her hands taped, IMO. Great picture, glad they finally put the belt on her!
I don’t watch NXT so I’ve never actually seen a Hartwell match but I thought she was a standout in the Rumble. I’m glad to see that she’s getting a real push.
No thumbs up in the pic.  Worst render ever……. /s
#indi champion 👍🏽
proud of our new NXT Women’s Queen
Impressive
I saw Indi wrestle in Australia just before she left for the wwe. It was in a match against Joey Ryan. I'm glad she's doing better now.
rEnDeR
This fucking rules. She deserves it and she's gonna win gold on the main roster too.
Good for her but isn't there tons of other nxt women that are better to the world champ
They should of shorten her neck a tad.
👍
She’s so cute
Looks like she could be Bella Rolland's sister or cousin in this shot. Iykyk
What a beauty
This has huge "school photo" energy
Indi Wrestling is hot!
Indi Melbourne, of House Way, First of Her Name, Queen of the NXT and the Women's Locker Room, Protector of the Lumis, the Mother of Ladders, Khaleesi of the Great Violent Parking Lot, Unflappable, and Breaker of Barriers
Both top titles got a paint job a few months into the 2.0 changeover
I really like her in a supporting role. She’s serviceable in tags and very entertaining during angles/promos/skits. It’s gonna be interesting how they play around her being the one that ran over Nikkita Lyons
Must have taken a lot of self control to keep that thumb down.
Respectfully disagree, I think she's perfect as a face champion. While she's average in the ring at best (and I think she's always gonna be average in the ring). She makes up for it with great character work, she's good on the mic, good with her expressions, has a natural face energy too.
She's impressive
ah makes sense, when they were putting rainbows everywhere

New shaved SANADA vs Emperor Okada  I really have difficulties to pick a winner for this match
SANADA now has supportive friends and a fresh look, Okada better get the red dye and balloons ready to go
It's Okada I just don't think they're going to give it to Sanada. NJPW loves to break hearts

Matt sorted the contract for the match. There's likely a clause included that if Ethan loses, he and PP are free from the contract. They're holding back the reveal probably for tonight.
Matt obviously put some kind of stip in the contract that Ethan signed without reading.  Probably that if Ethan lost, Matt and PP are free from The Firm.
Never sign a contract from Matt Hardy without looking at it. He's as shady as that carny piece of shit Don Callis.   Also Ethan probably wants nothing to do with them after being embarrassed
It happened on Wednesday....most of these things take time to see what the benefit was.
It was so funny that the same thing happened a while ago when Matt was feuding with Hangman. Hangman did a quick switch that lot of viewer weren't paying attention and quite upset Hangman sign the switch contract. It is a simple thing but you got to pay attention to detail here.
It’s something that we have to wait until next week to see how it plays out. Obviously Matt put some shady stuff in the contract that he had Ethan sign. But his turn just happened 2 days ago so we have to wait and see..
Because presumably the whole point was to gain Page's trust so he would let him handle the contract for a match where he'd put in a stipulation that Hardy and PP walk free if Page loses or something to that effect. It's not very difficult to piece together all the snippets that we've had for the last few months. Since there's a segment tonight we'll probably get more details.
That makes sense, thank you. I probably should have waited to post, but I just heard Matt's explanation of how this master plan all came together on his podcast, and I was left with these questions. Hopefully we get the followup tonight, maybe it was a bit premature of him to address it before the other shoe has dropped from a storyline perspective.
The second Ethan said something about having signed without reading, I *knew* Matt was screwing him over and getting their freedom.
> Also Ethan probably wants nothing to do with them after being embarrassed  I think it's more likely that he wants revenge.
Character growth from when Hangman pulled the same thing on Hardy
Yeah I forgot about the "Ethan signed without reading" bit. As noted in my previous comment, I heard Matt (in-character) gloating about the genius of his plan on the latest episode of his podcast, and without it having fully played out yet I came away with these questions.
I've explained twice now that I (admittedly prematurely) posted this because Matt was gloating (in-character) about how perfectly the plan was executed on the latest episode of his podcast, as though his actions on Wednesday put a bow on it. It's helpful to read the other comments before replying, as your point has been brought up three times already.
[This tweet](https://twitter.com/MATTHARDYBRAND/status/1643844801672912896?t=CJnoKtNKW9v63P3Ivz2Syg&s=19) implies he put that in the contract
This might actually be pretty fun. I think Page wrestles the perfect style to get a decent match out of what's left of Matt. And I'd Marq Quen is slated to come back any time soon, we could get some decent trios out of Page/Bill//Moriarty vs Hardy Party
He tweeted a couple of times as well about Ethan and Stoke "wait until they learn what was in that contract"
Well wouldn't it be helpful to also wait more then 2 days before expecting an explanation for a storyline that happened on Wednesday?
It would, but (now for the fourth time) I'll again note that it came to mind because Matt Hardy had just addressed it on the latest episode of his podcast, which also was probably too early since the story hasn't finished playing out yet.

Check the vents.
How funny would it be if Triple H actually came out on RAW to say "hey this shit is not booked by me, but don't worry it's just for tonight" and he really is still in charge of creative?
https://preview.redd.it/8t741d1vjksa1.jpeg?width=680&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f1c400dc7703a8f9bc14fabd1c17d801f4cfb586  LOCK THE DOORS TO THE STADIUM AND TAKE AWAY HIS PHONE
People really on McMahon watch. I imagine they're hidden underneath a table with binoculars.
The mustache has everyone fooled.
No signs of Vince McMahon, however Mince McVahon has been in the building for hours
I wouldn't be surprised if Vince booked Raw because he was bored
Doesn't he and many others arrive by limo about 25 minutes into the show?
HHH is waiting to leak if Vince was there depending on how the internet reacts to his show.
I think it's sort of more terrifying if he wasn't at every show yet could pop up at any event at any given moment and just disrupt any plans you have . I would probably like more what I was getting into on a daily rather than have the fear of is or isn't Vince here tonight
Did they check under the ring? He also may be wearing a black hoodie.
Wasn’t there a rumor he might run the show virtually?  Actually, I love the idea of a muted McMahon just gesticulating wildly on Zoom during Smackdown.
It never occurred to me that Vince was in Gorilla just because he was at Mania. Maybe he won’t actually be there every week (one can hope)

Him being involved in the creative process is not so much the problem as Vince McMahon being at shows, in gorilla, incapable of just fucking trusting the show as planned and fucking with it the entire time.   Like, yeah, Vince as the guy using his decades of experience to just help plan out a show is worthwhile, it's the way he runs shows that is largely the issue.
I put sugar in his gas tank. You’re welcome everyone
He’s gonna walk in right at 7:59 and sit in gorilla.
\*Hunter walks to the ring*  \*Picks up mic*  "The old bastard's back!"  \*Drops mic*  \*Vigorously and repeatedly chops crotch*
Hes in the limo that drives up. Yall never watched this shit before
So it’s like one of those situations when your dad comes over for a bbq and decides to take over the grill anytime you step out?
Thank GOD!!!!!!!!!! Please don´t show up, its for the better. Lets just keep Vince in charge of the side of the business and let the booking for PAPA HAITCH!
Didn't Vince show up right when the show started? Plus he could always change shit even if he isn't there
I'm surprised people aren't trying to track his plane.
Vince is too scared to enter Portland.
It's really not much better having the lingering shadow of Vince with the constant fear that he can just show up and ruin a show.
The entire internet can start writing their "SMACKDOWN WAS GREAT!!!" recaps early...
Well, that's good. If there's one thing we know, it's that if Vince McMahon isn't around at the moment, there's no way he's going to show up later and cause chaos.
So far so good
He’ll appear at gorilla like a demon emerging from hell the second Triple H finishes his opening promo

Week to week will be run by Haitch. PLEs and major storylines will be a collab between the two with Vince probably having final say.
He's waiting for HHH to reiterate that nothing will change before he jumps out from around a corner and changes everything again.
Vince McMahon is living rent free in the heads of so many people.
Vince arriving via helicopter midshow like the Shield
Talking bout this dude like he’s a serial axe murderer
Ffs check the blacked out bus in the parking lot.  You’d think they’d learn
He’s a private eye from the 1930s so he could be anywhere
He'll be working from home.  Will not surprise me in the slightest if he has a 1:1 replica of your typical Gorilla Position tucked up in some room of his mansion with a phone for conference calls with producers, match agents etc.
Vince is gonna be hiding in the weeds until Triple H makes his announcement. Then will try to sneak in and steal the producers chair.  [Triple H gonna have to be making his announcement like this from now on](https://media.tenor.com/ncx-M3SCySkAAAAd/steve-austin-wwe.gif)
Vince hiding in the woman’s bathroom
Vince can fuck everything good about WWE up no matter where he is. This piece of shit is going to be planning and changing some of the worst shit ever until he’s deceased. Fuck him.
Going to be great patter when we get weeks of Triple H booked shows which get your hopes up, only for Vince to turn up for the big ones and change it all.
Damn, we really on Vince watch.
I’m sorry to say Mr. Keller that I am under the belief that your words ring a little hollow. 😑
He's gonna be secretly escorted in like Adam Cole was on a wheelchair completely covered up while HHH is away from gorilla making his announcement.  This is good stuff pal
 His limo is going to show up and he’s going to get out with that stupid golden egg again.
Honestly it's probably worse if Triple H is booking the show but every now and then Vince just shows up and fuck things up.
Vince learned how to use zoom.
Hologram Vince at gorilla
Haven't you watched the show before?  He'll arrive in a limo 30 minutes after the show starts.
This is the narrative Shoemaker was pushing on the Ringer. I was so hoping it was true. If Vince doesn't show up it will make me really optimistic that RAW was just because Vince was already in LA for WrestleMania.   Of course it's still a depressing idea that Vince can just show up and scrap an entire show like he did on RAW. Theoretically he can do that anytime which is frustrating.
No sign of Vince but what about the guy with the mustache that kinda looks like him?   Feels like an Elias/Ezekiel situation.
There are still wrestling hotlines in 2023?
![gif](giphy|WPp6stsLjHvAg5qu39|downsized)
This so fucking ridiculous. I hate that the people backstage have to deal with this senile twat waffle.
When Vince was in control a year ago (and in recent years) it’s been previously reported that he wouldn’t show up to every taping like he would 10 years ago (and before). Regardless of that fact, he would still be in control with final creative say, and running production meetings remotely.  The good thing of him not being in person is the likelihood of continuous script/rundown changes decrease, but just because he isn’t on-site doesn’t mean he isn’t back running things once more. So, if he isn’t there in person tonight don’t overreact or get your hopes up that he isn’t firmly in control again, because history (of the last couple years) says otherwise. Only time will tell…
Vince wasn’t backstage for raw? I thought that was his younger brother Vincenzo?
This is so stupid. People really think that if he’s not there tonight it means he’s out of creative forever? After everything Vince has done to keep power through this sale, how on earth could you convince yourself of that? Defies common sense.
I find this shit so god damn hillarious Vince is like the literal boogeyman for the smarks. Some jobber on the roster feeding this frenzy because Vince didnt talk to him personally when he lost a match 10 years ago or something.
That's exactly what Vince's wants you to think.
I’m not going to believe it until I see LA Knight not being buried.
No Vince, but Señor McMahono is setting up his office backstage.
smackdown is gonna start tonight with triple h blowing up vince's limo and then he's gonna go visit shane in the hospital and hit him with a bedpan
Oh good. I needed to know if I'll like the show or not ahead of time
It's the hope that kills you...
I would not trust Wade on this
I"m sure if the show sucks we'll get stories that Vince was texting changes for 2 straight hours and ruined HHH's staggering work of genius that would have been the April 7 Smackdown.
What? There's no phones in 2023 after Wrestlemania? He can always phone-it in.
God wrestling fans and journalists are ridiculous sometimes.
This mother fucker showed up, ruined the Raw after Mania, and dipped. He really does hate the fans
HHH in the parking lot-  ![gif](giphy|knUDmFueEY2Dfy6Ijt)
But how can people blame Vince for the booking decisions they dont like if he isnt there!?
Wade Keller is probably wrong. This isnt wcw anymore guys he has no sources in wwe.
https://i.imgur.com/E20dWUE.jpg
Who cares if Vince is actually in the building?   Like he can't do all the direction remotely like he was doing before he left.
It’s like wade keller vs meltzer today who gets it right.

See for me I feel like you can easily tell the difference between an HHH show and a Vince show. So I’ll believe what you guys say about tonight before even the dirt sheet stuff.
People backstage must be like me when I'm praying my boss calls in.
Vince has never really seemed to be invested in Smackdown, the way he is with Raw. At least that's how it's seemed for a long time. Wouldn't surprise me somehow it's reported that HHH is running Smackdown, while Vince runs Raw
The man's hiding under a table or something near gorilla ready to pounce into HHH's chair when he gets up to address the crowd.  Not sure if I'm joking.
That's my theory. Vince was in LA the day WWE merger, so did he have a moment realising that this could be the last Raw he would have full control over.
He’s hiding in a closet waiting for Hunter to go out t the ring
Feel like we need an insider take here and Kermit has been oddly quiet..
As long as Vince has any role with WWE that I am aware of, I won't be tuning in. But if he at least isn't gonna be in gorilla ever again, that's still a positive for some people, I guess.
He's going to come down from the rafters like STIIIIIIIIIIIIING!
That's because Vince is just waiting for Triple H to go out to the ring for his promo so that he can sneak into gorilla and take over again. /s
Maybe he will pop up out of an office at like 7:55 PM EST and start ripping up the script.
vince gonna roll in with his own chair
Has anyone looked for his mustachioed doppelgänger Wince WcWahon?
He will sneak in when hhh is giving us another speech about how nothing is going to change.
Imagine a company that just sold for almost 10 billion that has put on a weekly tv show for this long and they don't even know who is running the show week to week.
He could still have his hands all over the show.  Like he can't make changes unless he's physically in the building.  He's got a phone and computer.
You know as soon as HHH comes back to gorilla from the opening promo, Vince will be in his seat.
treating him as a supervillain.
How many is many, Wade? Three? Four? How many of them are people of any consequence?
Lol yeah, it was *definitely* just because he was in town. Vince returned to his usual position running the show just once, as a treat.
This is **exactly** what it would feel like to be haunted by a fucking ghost, although, it didn't kill you it just made you fucking miserable when it was around?
They better not murder my boy LA Knight!
So the threat level is out burberry?
I think we are conditioned to Vince to being Vince.  So when we hear about scripts being rewritten we collectively pucker our buttholes.
Fuck it Raw vs Smackdown GM mode. Vince vs Hunter
That just makes the entire thing even more bonkers. Why would any person in their sane mind just stroll into Gorilla 5 minutes before the show and start rewriting the script? I know the answer to that question so don’t start but I’m just saying, for real…I’m so pissed at this company right now I’m starting to talk like Damien Priest.

And if not there, has anybody looked in the weeds?
![gif](giphy|lTj9KCbmt4A3T6PACE)  HHH finding out any shit booking he comes up with can just be blamed on vince
I’m just imagining soooo many people holding their breath up until show time (and beyond), hoping there’ll be no changes…
Triple H: That shit Monday was not my fault.
He didn’t know until he got backstage and Vince was in gorilla like “yo” and the started tearing up the script
“Starting next year, Raw after WrestleMania will not be in the same city as the weekend. Just feel like it, no reason!”
That would be perfect because i will be in attendance for Raw in Seattle this monday
Vince thought he was talking about the endeavor deal HHH slipped it right under Vinces nose
Would mean that Vince randomly shows up in person to screw everything up which is very funny.
Trips is bringing back hornswoggle to patrol under the ring.
It’s just KO with the pie on his face.
Asking the local hookers and strippers if a muscular man with a moustache has been lurking round recently isn't the best idea
Spoilers: He's under the ring right now, with a poop bucket and a monitor.
He's also wearing a hat
It's like how nobody recognizes Clark Kent as Superman just because he puts on glasses.
“I know it’s you under there”
He’s gonna remove a mustache to reveal a different mustache and we’ll all be like, “I KNEW HE WAS BACK!”
Mincent Vennedy Mcann.
Boo-urns.
He just sold the company and wanted to celebrate by booking a Raw again, wouldn't be surprised ethier.
When I'm bored I bake. Take notes, Vince.
“Hmm oh what can one do with his billions”
Lmao honestly if you were Vince, it’d be hard to pass up the opportunity to come in once a year and be like “we’re doing my shit tonight”
Or as a big dick move to prove to everyone he was still in power.
That's how I get to work with my co workers looking at a live feed
His booking style certainly backs that up.
He knows that's more or less how long a Triple H promo at the start of the show takes.
Or sometimes 10 minutes before it ends, if something really important is happening then
*Vince enters the chat*
He should carry a money in the bank briefcase at all times
This just made me imagine him on all the screens of the thunderdome, wondering why no one is in the ring.
I can see it now, giant floating hologram head Vince.
I imagine Michael Cole’s monitor cutting to Vince McMahon whenever he starts shouting at Coel
> Wasn’t there a rumor he might run the show virtually? >  > Actually, I love the idea of a muted McMahon just gesticulating wildly on Zoom during Smackdown.  He can scream and cuss in Michael Cole's ear from anywhere, really.
Vince McMahon on Zoom...  I imagine he's like my colleagues who can't seem to get it even after 2 years of WFH.  /joins unmuted still on a cell call, complaining about having to be on Zoom "God dammit"  /puts camera on and it gets a nice overlit up snoot shot of his hairy nostrils  /camera jitters while he adjusts it  /stays unmuted and puts Smackdown TV show on, causing feedback at gorilla  /keeps mistakenly muting himself with Logitech headset mute button  /stares at himself onscreen, admiring his mustache, and mistakenly says mustache, prompting Triple H to accidentally book Boogs   Etc
The way I’m looking at it, there are some outlets saying that Vince is back doing creative and HHH is out, and Wade Keller saying that isn’t true, and both have the same lack of sources. So it’s really just “believe what you want to” until there’s something concrete. Im down to say it was one bad raw until proven otherwise
After seeing him and hearing him speak, I don't think he could physically do it anymore. But that won't stop him from FaceTimeing into Gorilla.
I was saying it all week and was usually downvoted. The initial reporting did not sound like he was back permanently.   People also forgot that Endeavour leaked before the sale that they’d only be interested in buying the WWE if they had an assurance that Triple H would commit long term to booking the show.
Pretty sure if he went to prison over the steroid scandals that what he was planning on doing lol
Vince pooped his pants
Doing the lords work I see
o7
I'm imagining him having them play his music backstage when he arrives..."No chance!"
He'll pop up on the Codyvator
Plane you say.....
Oh fuck, I actually just did and it landed in Portland (the site of Smackdown tonight) from Stamford at about 1:30 PM. https://globe.adsbexchange.com/?icao=a24bf9&lat=45.599&lon=-122.608&zoom=6.0&showTrace=2023-04-07
We need that guy who tracked Elon's jet to do the same to VKM
He definitely couldn't possibly show up at the exact same time Triple H is cutting a promo promising that he isn't there.
Unless it seems HHH is booking Gargano in the main event scene. Vince has a private jet standing by in case of that thank god
Honestly Vince run PLEs where decent, it's just week to week and building up stars is what I'm worried about.
Then what does “run by Haitch” mean?  At the end of the day HHH has to deliver the vision he knows Vince will like. If he doesn’t Vince will just come back anyway.   So even if HHH is technically putting stuff together having Vince back in any capacity is going to damper any plans he has
Also, the last year or so he was in charge the shows were steadily improving. WWE's creative momentum didn't start the moment Triple H took over creative. It really started with last year's WrestleMania and was building up before then.
1-900-909-9900, that’s 1-900-909-9900. Kids get your parents permission before calling.
Baba Yaga.
Only trust people when the narrative fits my opinion
Why not
Because why ?
...there's also another several hours to go. Just thought it was worth sharing.
If that was the case Vince in 1 show would screw up 6 months of storylines
This needs to be on botchamania
HHH: Im striping roman of the titles. Karrion Kross, you are getting the universal. Johnny you are getting the WWE. Cody, You are getting a firm handshake.
Pretty sure even after Vince is dead anything that happens that fans don't agree with, they'll find a way to blame it on him
I know this is a running joke on here but if we’ve learned anything from the last 2 weeks it’s that any time anybody books anything now, Wade Keller or Ryan Satin or Meltzer is gonna tell us who specifically booked that segment. Happened after raw and there’s a few front page posts up rn about the same thing from mania
Power! Unlimited POOOWEEEEER!
Trips: “Hey. Hey, Vince, look at me…. Bitch.”  https://preview.redd.it/we6agxgl5msa1.jpeg?width=189&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=aa07705613c224fdd86df007da83483880157a34
Which is almost fully believable, all things considered.
Does he also have a crowbar to go after Vinnie's quads?
Actually, at one point DC explained that. Superman had super hypnosis and was able to use the glasses to magnify his powers so anyone who looked at him was hypnotized into not making the connection.  Granted that was some early silver age stuff. So I don't know if it's survived DCs continual reboots but still.
Take a look at my sourdough starter, pal!
Vince prefers cooking… the storyline  Sorry
I tried it for a while, kept getting chewed out for not turning up at the start of my shift. Fucking marks.
While they stand at an awkward angle.
With his camera accidentally zoomed in on only his forehead.
At this point "WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT COLE?!?" plays on a loop in his sleep.
Best we can hope for really. This SD show will be pretty telling IMO.
Do you have a link to this?
Cue the bowing fans in the arena  They can't hear the music but know somewhere deep down he's entering to it
Isn't this just the WWE Corporate jet that even Triple H would use?  I remember reading Vince had to give back his company cell phone when he "retired" so wouldn't he have given the jet to the other executives to use? Obviously now that he's back he would have access to it again but I think it would stand to reason that the jet in this link is the other corporate employees, which may or may not include Vince, but the mere presence of the jet landing could be anyone.
Gunn’s in AEW
Why are you giving him ideas?
Plenty of people have mentioned that Vince is great at taking a good idea and making it great. If he didn't involve himself with every detail, but maybe has a tweak here or there, it could be beneficial. It even giving the beginning and end while having Hunter do the middle in a consistent way that makes sense.
Mannn I read that in Mean Genes voice haha.  Wonder how many dads got $900 phone bills back in the day thanks to the WCW hotline hahahah
This could be the IWC’s tagline
Wade's sources seem to be WWE brass based in previous reporting.    Bruce, Terry, and Hayes.   Guys who don't want the boat rocked and are historically tight with Vince
Knoxville, Mundo or Gargano?
Cody: And hot dogs?
Don't you put that bad JuJu on us! Kross has to be the most boring NXT champion of all time.
Vince actually pre-wrote his booking plans for the next 5000 years, and the trust that will inherit his controlling stake in WWE will be obliged to follow it to the letter.
Vince's ghost comes back to haunt HHH whenever he sits in gorilla.
Vince McMahon's terms in his will.  &#x200B;  1. Bury all the money in the casket with me 2. Here is a 500 page pamphlet of everything I want booked for the next 20 years PAL
Vince‘s soul taking over HHH‘s body so he can book Roman Vs. Brock for the 900th time.
That's because none of us will believe he's actually dead.
One 'report' comes out and you guys will do anything to defend this shit.  The ending to to WM and that WHOLE RAW wasn't an 'anything' type deal. RAW was a mess and based on everything previously said - booked exactly how Vince would book it, whether he did or didn't.
Doesn’t really have to, as soon as Vince tries to get up from under the ring they’ll go on him. Clearly a family weakness. He’ll sit there ringside yelling while Michael Cole cheers because he can keep his sanity.
Someone later explained that as it's a posture change, behavioral differences, and a lot of really subtle things to make Clark seem very different than Superman.
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
I agree, and that's the most likely the case given the post from OP... *but* I guess it also doesn't disprove that it's Vince, as the jet *not* being in town likely would.
Why can't Hunter just cut the promo from gorilla
What's your source on wades source
Whoever gets there first
All three will compete in a ladder match. Winner gets the title and the rights to the name Johnny.
Silverhand
Ultra swerve and it's Johnny Bravo in awful CGI.
Pretty sure it’s Johnny Nitro
Legend says Michael Cole can still hear him in his sleep screaming "Oooooooh myyyyyyy"
Two decades worth of emails scheduled to go out at 8:00 every Monday to make sure he can still make last minute changes to the prewritten scripts beyond the grave
> Bury all the money in the casket with me  "Burn the money; dont wanna risk graverobbers getting rich."
Just reading years of his reporting. Logical inferences and all.
They all arrive at the same time, clawing at the door, only to see Johnny Stamboli shaking Triple H's hand
Mundo and Knoxville absolutely tear the snot out of each other trying to get their first, with Sami & KO fuckery thrown in at regular intervals.  When they finally get there, Gargano is there first, belt around his waist and happily eating his favorite ice cream. Nobody knows how he got there first and it's never spoken of again.

It's not even his worse loss as Demon. I mean, he lost to a damned turnbuckle.
Yes, Cody losing wasn't the only strange result of night two. Cody, Finn and as much as I like bianca and feel she's an incredible face of the company, I don't know why she won either.
It was really bad too. Edge already went over at EC and Beth got her revenge. So what did Edge need it for?
Honestly the feud itself should've been over and done at EC.  Balor should've gone into a rebound feud with someone who poked and prodded and claimed he "didn't have it anymore" until he goaded the Demon to rise. If AJ is cleared, that would've worked great. If not then honestly Ziggler could've been fun.   Edge needed something fresh as well. Just saying, he and LA could've cut some damn fun promos together.
Purple Demon looked great 🤌🏼
Gimmick is dead. You can’t have this fearsome persona strike fear in wrestlers when he loses. Him threatening with the demon should make his opponents happy it gives them a greater chance of winning
Yes he should have won. Why did Edge not put him over? Edge winning means nothing to his career or legacy.
Yeah it was cool the first few times he did it, but now every time I see it, I just think "why are you flailing around and crawling around being weird?" I liked it when it was something cool he did for big matches. But then WWE started acting like he was an otherworldly supernatural being because he has cool body paint and it got lame.  The mystique is dead. Not sure if it's the bad booking of the last few times that killed it or if it's just something that worked better on the smaller stage of NXT.
His whole look was just not good at WrestleMania.
I HIGHLY doubt this will be the last time we see him as the demon
The demon is not cool anymore. It worked in NXT, to some degree. Maybe it's the size of the  arena, but waving around smokey glow sticks while half crawling down the aisle doesn't work on a big scale. He looked so incredibly hokey at WrestleMania that I hope this is the last time we see the demon. And I absolutely love Finn.
I loved the Demon on NXT but I think it's time for it to be done, I don't think it works on the main roster.
I feel like they ruined the demon. Not because he lost (again) but because of how corny the demon is now.  The fact they announce it beforehand is already a bit meh, but ever since he debuted it on the main roster, it keeps getting weirder.  The whole tongue out shtick and generally how he acts during the match like he is some kind of crazy dude now because of some paint like..  I get it, it's pro wrestling. Undertaker has mystique powers aswell, but i just don't buy it, it's way too much acting imo and i don't think Finn made the decision alone atleast to change the character like that.  It also doesn't fit into his current judgment day gimmick.
Well i gotta be honest this was the lamest form of the demon yet not even because he lost but he literally didnt do anything that made this a special appearance character wise. He wrestled completely normal he wasnt "impervious" to anything.   I always had issues with this character but this time it was really really bad and i wouldnt mind if that thing doesnt pop up anymore for  a long time.
The demon has devolved into carrying smoke sticks and making more wild noises than the Tiny Wichati Warrior from Ace Ventura 2. It’s comical what they’ve done to my mans entrance
He looked like a dude on acid at an EDM festival.
it feels like every time he brings out the demon he loses  like maybe the stats don't add up but a lot of the shine is gone for me
I agree that the demon should not lose, and when he does, it should really matter.
The demon frightens opponents, refs, announcers and small children. The demon's worst enemies are inanimate objects, first the turnbuckle then a ladder.  He should have worn that hat in the match.
As far as mania entrances go, for the demon his just felt underwhelming. And the match was even worse. At this point, good riddance to the demon. It can no longer live up to what it once was and it's just disappointing to try.
Until Alpha Academy gets to playing with a Ouija board.
It was a shame, all the amazing entrances and I expected the Demon to be the best.  Front face paint is the exact same it's been for ages with just a bit of purple tossed in and not committing to full purple, the heartbeat buildup in his entrance was cut, and it just awkwardly cut to him on stage rather than crawling out.
Honestly I think the Demon has had its run.
Yeah probably is. At least for a long time.
I'm more on the side that if Finn wasn't injured the match & outcome may have been different. It seemed after Finn got hurt they were just going through the spots in rapid succession to get to the end as quick as possible.
The story meant Edge should win. Edge said numerous times he wouldn’t stop until he won so how do you explain him leaving Judgment Day alone after losing? They tried to end his career on numerous occasions and did the same to his wife. Heels don’t generally win those stories.
I'm probably wrong, but I'm starting to think the injury to Finn that caused the stoppage maybe forced them to call an audible on the spot and have Edge win. They could've gone at least ten more minutes.
I’ve never liked the Demon stuff, I’m kind of hoping it is the last time
Man that back piece is lame, what happened to the cool designs
Great wrestler. Overrated character.
Hasn’t been been pretty vocal about not wanting to use the demon anymore and only does it because they ask?
41 year old balor lost to edge, this is the worst outcome of any match at wm
I hope so. It's such a dumb gimmick. His moveset doesn't change. He just grunts and makes angry faces.
I hope it's the last time. I'm firmly of the opinion that the demon is lame as fuck.
It’s the story Edge and Finn went with. Also the theme of the match ‘exorcising the demon’ gives Demon Balor a good send off for the character rather than the rope breaking shenanigans with no explanation.  Finn doesn’t need the Demon anymore
I like Finn a lot, but the Demon character is very cringe
Unpopular opinion. The demon is stupid. It’s with a mop on his head. He’s infinitely more interesting without it.
If you’re over 11 and think the Demon is cool, reassess some things in your life.  Then again, here my dumb ass is, posting about fake fighting on the internet so… yeah, go ahead enjoying a 40+ year old man wearing a tourist dreadlock hat and splattering himself in paint.
tbf, maybe he was gonna win but the Ladder gash ruined it
😜😜😜😜
What’s his record w the Demon on the main roster
Wasn’t Balor suppose to win but due to his injuries they had to cut the match short? Then again if so I guess they could’ve ended it with the finisher through the table
It felt half-assed. The paint job (while it was done nicely and probably took some time) was pretty much the same paint job we've always seen but with some purple. I thought they would try something different and new. The entrance was flat cause there wasn't the build up of smoke for him to rise from and it wasn't dark enough in the stadium. I felt like the heart beat build up felt too quick as well. He was over doing the tongue thing and making weird noises. I don't know if Finn had his heart in this. It being sponsored by that new exorcist movie and Russel Crowe introducing the match didn't help either.
Yes it should be shelved. Nonsense goofiness
The whole demon and any supernatural stuff doesn't work in wwe any more. It just makes no sense.
I feel like Judgement Day will look week if they don't have any big wins , so i was really hoping they would have at least gone 2 out of the 3 wins at WM..(Sorry Dom)
I’m pretty sure that Finn said a while ago that he had enough of the demon and couldn’t wait to stop using it
The turnbuckle always goes over, brother
I'm still impressed with how terrible that angle was and yet remains the most creative finish to a Reigns title defense.
This is correct answer. Fiend died the night he was sacrificed by the turnbuckle
Night 2 was number 2.
My main issue with Bianca is less with Bianca, and more with them not building up more people that could credibly beat her. They'd either have to do a rematch, or its Charlotte.
Finn and Asuka had no business losing. Cody losing was stupid, but it's not the worst decision ever
If you pit bianca v reigns right now, bianca will win, shes super cena levels
I believe its to keep her mania streak. iirc she debuted on mania in that garza/andrade w/ Vega v. street profits feud
I remember when Edge said his return would be a full-fledged return and wasn’t gonna be a part-timer. Needless to say, it’s disappointing that he shows up every two months, cuts one promo and wins every feud.
I’m really confused on this too. Did they write themselves into a corner when Finn’s character attacked Edge’s wife?
Ngl, this Edge run feels like a vanity project
The ego boost
When he won I thought they might point him towards Roman for a rematch. He never really lost to Reigns as Rollins interrupted the feud.  I figured him winning gives him momentum, and Roman can get a more conclusive win over him.
That's a feud I didn't know I needed.
I've still got baby-rage over him not being entirely purple and just being half-red half-purple. With Edge already being red, he really could've done with being pure purple.
I honestly think it was because it was still bright outside. Him flailing around in demon paint while the sun was still up looked a little silly.
I was just happy the OG music was back
I feel like this is what it needs to be.  My more casual friends watched Mania with me this year and they all just thought the Demon was cringe.  Time to retire the gimmick, shithead Finn Balor is a much better character anyway.
I felt that way too. He had the right look but the wrong movements, and I know it's his music but the music imo doesn't fit.  Edge seemed way more evil with his entrance.
The staging in NXT was better for it. The short ramp meant the crawling was diminished, which makes it work better. The long wrestlemania ramp really doesn't work for It. They should have done what theyd do with taker sometimes and had him start down the ramp.  The other issue with it, is they put so little effort in the production of it. In nxt, they would dim the lights and color them for his entrance. They would give him a lot of smoke work and sometimes performers acting with him. At mania they gave him some smoke to wave and sent him out in the open sunlight. It wasn't as much effort, and is kinda reflective of how WWE is often lazy with entrances these days.
It looked meh at wrestlemania because it was still day light.  It's something that needs atmosphere and you can't do that without turning off the lights
It doesn't work because it's always booked to both look weak and lose. If the demon only lost because it took half the roster to contain then losing is fine. But that isn't ever the case. It was a cool gimmick that has been utterly ruined by WWE creative and Vince.
> He wrestled completely normal he wasnt "impervious" to anything.  Eh, he no-sold early on at the start of the match and there were times he undersold. I think if you were expecting him to get right back up after a big move like The Fiend (I was definitely expecting him to no-sell the Conchairto... Only for him to be pinned), you were disappointed, but I wouldn't say there was no difference between Demon Finn and JD Finn at all.
I was thinking that, I don't remember The Demon going "Blah, blah, blahhhhh" as much in the past. Just when he takes off the headgear.
Ya, right out of the gate it was off when you see him just kneeling there awkwardly. I don't know if its cause there's too much open air with the stadium and entrance but usually they have a ton of smoke to cover him up and then he rises from the smoke.
The outcome would've been the same. I still thought the match was good. Honestly, it probably would've dragged on too long without Finn getting hurt like Edge tends to do
They still let Finn jump through a table man he was never winning
they wrestled quite a bit after the injury, there was no audible
It was a cool entrance in NXT. It got ruined when it became some outworld character on the main roster. Especially when he loses. It’s just dumb now.
Same. Too stupid.
He needs to strip it down and drop the mophead, streamers, raver smoke, sticking out his tongue, and all the other dollar store cringy costume stuff. It'd be cooler if he just had some badass paint and wrestled a more aggressive moveset
Worked himself into a shoot
I always wondered: let's say this stuff happened in 1997 and Vince pitched this idea to HBK: "Hey, so you're fighting Bret for the WWF title, you go to the top rope for your elbow, turnbuckle collapses, 1-2-3, Bret wins." Kudos to Finn for not losing his smile.
Wrong wonky supernatural gimmick, but at least Demon losing got rid of it for a while. Balor is better without it
My dawg
Well, that's a HHH issue people aren't ready to discuss yet.   If I didn't know better I'd say he's building to Charlotte beating Roman lol
As she should. Bianca is awesome and I personally wouldn't mind her carrying it till the MITB cash in.
Did he? He said after winning the rumble he’d be on the shows every week until Mania. But I had always heard this was the idea.
Love Edge but I don’t wanna see the guy wrestle anymore tbh.
I disagree, I don’t think Edge has much say in what he does.
Reigns stacked him on top of Danielson and pinned them both. That's pretty conclusive.
But it’s not for you or your friends. Kids love that shit
i agree 100%.  i wished it was regular, tactical violent waluigi screamin' finn.  i dont even think demon really makes sense in kayfabe or not
It was cringe, his entrances at the NXT shows were awesome, this entrance sucked.
In WWE kayfabe there’s only 1-2 superstar who can be more evil than Edge lol . (Orton or maybe Triple H i’m not sure )
Don't forget when he powerbombed Lashley at WrestleMania a few years ago and the Usos at Extreme Rules. Maybe that was a spot they had planned for the Cell match before he got hurt
There was definitely an audible, they fast forwarded at a bare minimum.  You could feel the desperation in the uniquely   long and awkward break as they killed time for the main event
*Shot himself into a work
If thats the case then he needs to take a page out of y2j's list and be more adamant that building up these stars are better than padding meaningless wins in an already great career.
For that match it was, but wwe continued the feuds with both danielson and edge afterwards. He conclusively beat Danielson, but the edge feud didnt end decisively. I figure it gives them an in story thing edge can say if they want a one off match in Saudi or London
Not gonna lie, I didn't really think about the demon being over with kids, and you're totally right if he is, but he's been made to look like such a chump that I'm a little skeptical, lol.
Bring back the chainsaw.
Nah, I think showing a recap of Rollins' complete entrance was always the plan.
I mean I don’t he’s the one who is decided this.
I can tell you that if it were 20 years ago and it was 12 year old me I would eat that shit up. Same with Wyatt. As a kid you don't have the insight of things being "over" and losing making him feel weak. Shit just looks cool.   I honestly wish I could go back to viewing wrestling the way you do as a kid.
I think he has a ton of input on his creative side if we're being honest
I just don’t.   Things aren’t nearly as political as they used to be. People may have more weight for the ideas of their characters, but to try to book themselves to go over? Nah.

I hope he's just taking time off for himself, he has been working through a lot of injuries if I recall
He's been banged up for a few months and he has been in 2 hard hitting matches in the last month. He deserves a break and to heal up
You saw that IC match? I’m surprised they’re not all at home after that, resting some ice on their ground beef chests.
I don't really know what WrestleOps is implying, but whatever the reason is for pulling him, I hope it's not injury/illness related. He's dealt with a couple over the past few years and I'd hate to see him hurt again
Sapp confirmed his contract has nine months left so let's nip that in the bud right away.
He wrestled with the flu (or a stomach bug), during his Steel Cage match with Kross, had back problems, around Last Year’s Royal Rumble time, he deserves a break, hope he’s ok.
IIRC he’s been working through injury and illness. Hopefully now that Mania’s over he’s taking a break to rest.
For at least the last 6 months, maybe year, he has been on/off travel due to his health. Hoping he’s ok.
He's celebrating that five star rating at: _________
Pretty sure he's recovering from having no ribs left after that IC championship match
Man idc about him leaving WWE, I just hope he’s fucking resting because that guys been the unsung hero of WWE since the pandemic started
Missing the meet and greet is what makes me think this is injury related or an illness, Vince can cut someone from a show but cutting someone from a meet and greet makes no sense.
Love Drew, and the IC match may have been my favourite of both Nights (though Rhea/Charlotte was great too). I really hope that whatever this is, he's not injured. That always sucks.
I hope he’s not injured, but I also hope it’s not contract related. He’s one of my favorites so I’d hate for there to be any issues.
Come to think of it, was Drew even formally announced or planned to be doing anything tonight?
And now they just deleted the tweet.  Sort out what that means yourself.
Drew Galloway with a surprise debut for All In at Wembley Stadium. 🥹
I read somewhere that he’s been sick so that may be it. Or it may be because Gunther caved his fucking chest cavity in with those chops, who knows.   I wish him the best.
Dudes seemed really banged up for a while, should def take time off cuz when you start prioritizing the business above your health shit can get real dangerous. (see my pfp for example)
I'm sure this thread will be treated with courtesy and there'll be no wild speculation whatsoever.
Drew is the best.
He got the soul slapped out of him at Mania and has to take some time to find it again
Regardless if this is related to his contract status -- pro wrestlers having leverage over their employers again is great.
AEW debut at Wembley confirmed!!!
He might need a break after that match. Sheamus vs Walter is the obvious rematch. Drew can take some time off. They want to keep him happy because his contract is up in nine months.
Damn there goes my hopes of a heel turn tonight
![gif](giphy|WqpWNCtPlauchQljqd)
Look all I'm saying is, Wembley.
Drew McIntyre going to be at “All In” confirmed
"Hold on...You booked Wembley Stadium for what???" /s
He gone
Not that he doesn’t deserve time off if thats what it is but every story about WWE this week has been pointing towards a big creative lull. No Roman, Drew, Bayley, Bray and a lot of top storylines peaked at Mania and likely won’t be as hot (Dom/Rey, Usos vs Zayn)
Drew Galloway is All Elite
All in bound baby
I took the wockkkkkkkkkk to Portland
This tweet's been deleted, it seems. Waiting to see what that means, I guess.
Thought he was Vince’s favorite?
Unless they suddenly started paying attention to the wellness policy again then dudes probably just taking a leave for medical issues. He's been pretty banged up according to the rumor mill.
Hopefully he’s alright!
28 chops was too much. Poor Drew 😅
Ok, thoughts that he takes some time off to heal up, and comes back just before MITB? Maybe he doesn't win, but hell he'd be a great candidate.
Hopefully they change his gimmick because he's destined for midcard mediocrity with this stupid stereotypical highlander bs. People like him and Sheamus can't do anything with these awful gimmicks where it's like hey let's make the most stereotypical goofy Scottish or Irish guy!!!
There was also a mention of him being sick recently, which seems to happen quite a bit. Maybe run down from being on the road a lot and just in need of some time to recover.
There was from PWInsider (further confirmed by Meltzer) that his contract is up this year and he and WWE are far apart on money. No idea if it’s in any way related to this, but it’s something to keep in mind.
Hes been banged up and sick for years.  Dudes a workhorse continuing through all of that but i really hope he takes a month or 2 off to rest.
Legitimately. I think it gets overlooked just how brutal a match like that would be on someone’s body and the toll it takes.
WrestleOps is a shitty ripoff website that just “rewords” news from legitimate sources.
My current measure of injured is compared to Finn's head slash.
Like that's gonna stop people from posting "______ is ALL ELITE" unironically.
Any longer would make it a damp squib
Man, he is really a guy that would be fun to see have a run in AEW. Unironically, Sheamus too...both dudes who have shown there's a side far beyond their gimmick that people would really connect to, and being a genuine heavyweight athletic dude. A McIntyre/Hangman match and McIntyre/Kenny would probably rule.
I wouldn’t put it past WWE to put him out for injury time for something minor just so they can extend his contract  for being inactive
Also had neck issues around the rumble last year as well
Drew seems like a Buffalo Wild Wings kind of guy
In an episode of Celtic Warrior Workouts he mentioned his favorite chest meals are Burgers, Pizza, and Crumbl Cookies.   With this in mind, I imagine Drew ordered a good asss fat ass burger with all kinds of topping and an order of fries, a medium pizza with all his favorite toppings, and a box of his favorite Crumbl Cookies.   Truly, a meal made for a Scottish Warrior after a hard fought, 5 star worthy battle.
He looks like the type of guy to down a Scotch and a steak after crushing back day
Taking time off to prepare for the Fozzy concert on the 13th.
The nearest dispensary.
Disneyland. Probably taking his sword to the dragon during the Fantasmic show.
There was a report earlier today that he's got an injury
He hadn't come to an agreement with WWE on a new contract
Him vs PAC in Wembley would be epic.
Must be the dream of all wrestlers to perform at a half empty stadium!
I’m not saying it’s what’s happening but i’m sure that Wembley show sounds really fucking nice to him
[removed]
Yeah, that does pop up a bit. IIRC he was also sick at Crown Jewel, too.
I would be sick literally all the time if I had to keep up with their schedule, travel takes a lot out of me.
Didn’t he take time off because of COVID?  Could be something to do with that, too.
bro needs to wash his hands
Yeah he keeps getting sick I'm wondering if he has something chronic and reoccurring at this point.  Poor guy either way
yeah in 9 months lol
Drew took the worst bumps and was involved in all the biggest spots. Sad thing is he probably gets the least shine from the match. Thankless job to put other guys over, but I'm sure the bigwigs appreciate the shift he put in. He definitely earned a vacation.
Wouldn’t mind it lol 👀👀👀 but only if we bring Shaemus too—I dont wanna separate best buds
bro got the tar beat out of him against the two stiffiest guys in the company, im gonna assume he’s hurt
It's something in wrestling contracts. You can think what you want about clauses like that existing, but to say "wouldn't put it past WWE" like they're doing something shady or it's just something they do is just wrong.
He's on the haggis, neeps and tatties
As a high school/uni athlete this was kinda the thing, generally eat well but if we had a great performance or anything, everyone was eating as much crap as we could. In high school the coach would order a pile of pizzas and fried chicken, would spend the last 3 hours of classes half comatose from food.
I prefer AEW to WWE but  come on man lol he just put on one of the best matches of WM
Yeah, I really hope he doesn't leave. Yes all we can do is wait and see what happens.
I fucking get sick every time I go on vacation. I don't understand with all the travel, enclosed airplanes, and sleep deprivation, not to mention constant contact with fans who, let's face it, don't have the greatest hygienic reputation, how these folks aren't constantly dealing with some sort of illness.
He did but I don’t think his other illnesses have been related to that. He had food poisoning and the flu just a few months apart last year.
I said “this year.” It wasn’t specified when it was due, only that it was at the later end of the year.  Again, not saying these things are necessarily related, but it’s an interesting bit of context.
Drew has been an unsung hero for a while. Never forget he kick started Sami interacting with the Bloodline. Around the start last year he was stuck feuding with Madcap moss and Corbin them had his Roman feud interrupted with Cross. He's with Seth has been a reliable hand to get people over and both are world champ material
tbh both guys have fucked up necks It's probably more likely they go part time/on legends contracts in a few years
Sheamus already lost his boy Claudio, we can't keep doing this to him
Are they best friends in real life?
Well, it's no wonder he's unwell. 👀
Why would he leave? Unless you mean retire. No real reason to retire if they're just going to give him days off when he wants it.
Also the diet and workout routine. If I work 3-4 shows a week, spend a significant time in airports, cars, hotels, live out of a bag, the last thing I wanna do is work out 1-2 hours a day and watch how many carbs I'm eating.  Wrestlers are a different breed. Even when I look at the extremely high paying full time contracts, I wouldn't even consider it.
This guy’s luck is kinda shit for real.
I mean, if you wanna be technical about it, in nine months it’ll be next year.
Drew was Sheamus's best man
I heard his contract is going to expire in a couple of months and he may not resign...... that's what I heard but I don't know how true it is.
He's Scottish, we don't tend to have the best genetics, it's probably just the generations worth of vitamin D deficiency finally catching up with him.
Nine months isn’t accurate, R0DAN was incorrect. The report from PWInsider and Meltzer indicated it was *specifically* this year.
And vice versa according to Drew.
Even if that's true, WWE still uses those wrestlers until the last day (and sometimes beyond) for their contracts. Like with Adam Cole and Dean Ambrose recently.
I guess he can't get Irn Bru whilst on the road :(
Four days in Los Angeles is probably more vitamin D than we get in four months.
Yeah it’s blown out bs :)  Tweet was also deleted
Yeah. I'd prefer he stay in the WWE though.
None of us can get the real stuff anymore.
Genuinely can't believe they don't just charge twice for the real stuff. They'll make a fortune.
1901 is roughly that idea, just not the original drink. It's been so long I forgot what Irn-Bru tastes like anyway, lol, so 1901 recipe does it for me when I really want some Bru.

Finishers are only finishers when *used by a person who uses it as their finisher*.  A Stunner from Stone Cold, or KO, is a finisher and should be (relatively) protected.  If Otis does a Stunner tomorrow, that doesn't mean it's a finisher, it's just Otis doing a fuckin' Stunner.  The kayfabe purpose of finishers is that it's a move that *that person has spent the time to perfect*. They know how to best apply that move so that *when they do it*, it's *extra*.  *You* go into a ring and do a DDT on someone, that doesn't mean you used a finisher just because Jake Roberts used it as his 30 years ago. Jake shows up *tonight* and does a DDT, the motherfucker should sell like we all would for Sue.  tl;dr: Random Wrestler #65874™ using a move someone else uses as a finisher =/= Random Wrestler #65874™ doing a 'finisher', it's just Random Wrestler #65874™ doing 'a move'.
Omegas one winged angel and Corbin’s end of days are pretty well protected
That was the first time the 1D had been kicked out of…
Super kicks haven’t been over as finishes for years.
That’s not how finishers work or what they are  Batista’s finisher was a powerbomb. If John Cena gave somebody a powerbomb and they kicked out, that’s not a finisher kickout. It’s not Cena’s finisher   Finishers are still protected in most promotions (WWE probably least of any though). You’re complaining about guys kicking out of high spots
If the only match of the Usos that you watch is one where the opponent kicks out of the 1-D of course it doesn’t seem to be a protected finisher.
The only reason finishes are protected, is to make it a big deal when they're kicked out of. Same with win streaks. Neither are intended to be protected forever, and you shouldn't have more than a couple at a time.  It was the right circumstance for the 1-D to be kicked out of.  A Mania main event.  I'm not sure what's protected out there currently, though. The Punt? End of Days, maybe? OWA? Bianca's?
3d is pretty protected that was the first kickout in forever
You're example is from the main event of WrestleMania. God forbid there's some drama in the match. Did you really want a single finisher and 1, 2, 3 to be the crowning moment for Sami and KO?
Heard Chuck Taylor's Awful Waffle was too?
https://preview.redd.it/2w284qg7gksa1.jpeg?width=180&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=20151316fb98aaa0a62eea85f51084400d8e99ac
They're protected during weekly TV or lower tier PPVs/lower tier feuds for it to matter when people kick out in big moments. For example Michael Cole clearly shouted that it was the first time someone kicked out of the 1D, and it happened at Wrestlemania during a match in one of the hottest storyline in the last decade. As for the superkicks they aren't considered finishers anymore since it's a really simple move and basically anyone who's not over 7 foot tall can do it more or less well.
Kenny Omega's One Winged Angel does not get kicked out of
Jay White's Blade runner is pretty well protected. So is Okada's spinning tombstone into rainmaker combination
[Eita still sometimes ends matches with a particularly nasty Superkick](https://twitter.com/PuroresuFlow/status/1634611926654238720?t=QP54J4hzC2vUuXVOzCuvNg&s=19) *Imperial Uno*
I like them being mostly protected, but I do enjoy the drama of wondering if the person will kick out of the finisher. If they were all 100% protected, you'd see the finisher and then know the match was over. No drama at all.
I blame Rock and Austin.
Unless it's their finisher, why should it be protected? The whole assumption is that if they're executing a move that's someone else's finisher, they're not as good at it, hence it doesn't need to be protected. Do you want the DDT to be protected because Jake Roberts used it as a finisher 40 years ago?
King’s Road proves you can kick out of finishers without making the wrestler doing it look bad.
Because it's a lazy way to get drama.  It used to be a rare thing.  Warrior kicking out of Hogan's legdrop shocked everyone.  Now fans don't even pop for a finisher in a big match because they know it will happen multiple time.
I read somewhere that if Scott hall was told that he was doing a job he DIDN'T EVEN ATTEMPT the razors edge. That's how protected his finisher was, and tbh I think that's what guy's should strive for.
I remember what a big deal it was for someone to finally kick out of the 3D. Then they changed it to 1 and done which ironically takes more than 1 apparently
There are a few examples of protected finishes like Kenny’s One Winged Angel. An internal contradiction in the use of near falls tied with the trend in American wrestling where wrestlers will only have one or two signature moves that end matches. Near falls only work when the crowd believes it will end the match or is capable of ending a match. Crowds have been conditioned to believe a John Cena match is only over once he hits the AA. So they’re not going to bite on a near fall on a move he’s never won a match with before. The only way to get them to bite is to use your actual finishing move for the near fall. I think the HBK v Taker match at Mania really sped this trend up.
You might have a point about some finishers, but the one and done IS very protected. That’s why you were supposed to see it as a huge moment when it was kicked out of at WM. Omega and Jericho are other examples of protected finishers.
Still is in NJPW
Is the super kick stuff why people were throwing huge fits about the Usos/Zayn and Owens match? The Usos have been super kicking their whole career. So have tons of other guys. It’s not a finisher unless HBK is doing it. Or Lance Storm.
I have never understood how people don't understand this.
Shit, I'd never thought about the kayfabe reason before, but it makes sense. So it's more the wrestler than the move itself.
Omos could do a Stunner sitting down lol
The Usos usually use the 1D as a finisher tho
To my knowledge, nobody has kicked out of the Meltzer Driver and the Stormbreaker.
Yeah but what if they hit six of them?
Going by the fit certain people were throwing after that match, apparently.
Unless you’re ibushi
And Angle
But this was the first time someone kicked out of the 1D
Man we live in a world right now where all the people younger than me/us/idk I'm 38, have lost the ability to properly Google search things, and literally rely on going to Reddit, asking a question on a random sub, and waiting 1-11 hours for someone to comment with the result of the Google search *they* had to do to answer the fucking question.  3 years ago we had to teach millions of grown ass functional adults who vote and procreate and shit how to properly wash their hands for the first time in their lives and some of em still don't get it now years later.  I will never be surprised at the lack of things people understand. Not anymore lol.
Bingo. Think about it. The One Winged Angel. Think of how protected it is as a whole. With very few exceptions it's at the top of the list.  Now picture this Wednesday Peter Avalon shows up and does it to Moxley. Do you think Mox's shoulders stay down *just because it was a OWA?* No Moxley would and should be *mildly* stunned (cause even if Avalon pulls it off, Mox is getting dumped on his head at the very least), but he's obviously not going to be anywhere near the skill level that Omega is, nor the experience at using the move. It's going to be nowhere near as effective as it would be if Omega was doing it.
At what number is it a party?
I'm 37. I also work in a hospital.   Your assessment is painfully accurate lol
This was even a plot point in the Hangman/Kenny world title match. Hangman did a OWA and Kenny kicked out, and commentators said that it was because no one can do a OWA like Kenny.
