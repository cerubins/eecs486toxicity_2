[Acoustic Ver.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vek5DNDJZ_U)
They should rolled out itzy character tbh. Complete with members skins.
That look is..  something.
All i know is, kpop fans dont care about survey 🤣
done, good luck!
I know it’s less than 19 days away, but I’m just now realizing how impatient I get for new albums lol  😵‍💫
That’s not a flower, that’s a whole garden.
that was fast
Blinks don't play around when it comes to youtube.
Flower Power
It's a pretty good MV, definitely worth being the most expensive of BP.
And in comparison, (I'm a huge Forever btw) Everglow, PIRATE still has only about 66M views even after a year released. Insane how much BP grew over time.   Just letting you guys know this is only my observation and not to let anyone down.I am aware that it is bad to compare groups and I am in no way trying to put any groups down.
this is actually pretty great compared to most other releases this year— youtube’s policy has gotten a lot more strict, making it harder to reach higher numbers
I haven't seen a single kpop MV to reach 100M views on 24 hours like in the past, at the beginning of 2022 YouTube changed the streaming policies and started deleting a LOT of views.
The disclaimer is longer than the actual comment. Either say what you want to say or don't. You can't live your live that afraid of the backlash from the crazy k-pop fans. The vast majority of people wouldn't read anything negative into what you said.
this. they take away views rather quickly. also spotify is also gaining alot of ground for streaming
The person is just being polite. What triggered you.
I was just trying to encourage somebody to speak their mind without having to put a massive disclaimer at the bottom because of the part of this fanbase that they would get backlash from.
This scandal be like  ![gif](giphy|3o7WTyfrAJcQocEBgc)
Season 2 just dropped!
![gif](giphy|6pJNYBYSMFod2)
If a company doesn't turn this entire saga into a fully fledged K-Drama it's a missed opportunity atp 😭✋
Jesus fucking christ, here we go again  ![gif](giphy|ggHmCDJXx4om4hNWbM|downsized)
Can rich people stop riching for two seconds please I'm so tired
What is going on???
"Sir, we found nothing. Except for hundreds of notebooks with I HATE SPOTIFY scrawled all over them"
Woah... next development.....
Oh well, SM and Stock Manipulation does share the same acronym. Just business as usual.   Just hope this doesn’t somehow add one more month to the aespa cb delay.
And the saga continues….
The Saga that keeps on giving
I can't believe that I now know the names of korean entertainment firms and getting updated on their drama. I don't even know the name of a single entertainment firm in my own country! What did Kpop do to me?! Smh.   Also, why am I imagining it like some sort of action movie sequence? lol
And so the plot thickness 😭
Goodluck to the police. I doubt they will find anything. With Kakao's power...I don't think they will find much. But the saga continues. This drama doesn't seem to end.
You mean this isn’t over??? 😭
Kakao will probably get a slap on the wrist with a fine or something like they have been the last 453987435935 times.
What the hell ??
Yikes
Does that mean Gwangya might still be a thing?
Kakao vs SM III: The HYBE-ening
As I said before: ain't no drama like corpo drama
Yeah, just like most suspicions of stock manipulation, this is going to be hard to prove especially since the stock fell lower than what their tender offer was and they bought the stock at an overpriced rate. Unless they were the smaller shareholders they were acquiring from which is possible but again very hard to prove unless they did a shoddy job of hiding their tracks.  Anyway, its been fun to follow up on Korean corporate law, mergers and acquisitions on a kpop sub. Let the saga continue😅
I think after this we need one documentary in Netflix lol
part 2, electric boogaloo
I swear history and current events are the best kind of entertainment 🤣
A new chapter in the saga just dropped.  Still no clue what's really going on with sm
Oh?!? Well let’s see if this turns into anything other than a fine and a finger wag for being naughty
Waiting for Kakao's downfall (I know it won't happen but let me dream)
Oh look season 2
Yes!!! The drama continues!!  (I'm actually not happy. I'm worried about the artists under SM and its subsidiaries)
People thought the drama was over
Can't wait for the k-drama adaptation of this. Jisoo can play Karina!
Insane. It just keeps going. I need someone to compile this into a documentary pls
Ah we all thought it was the series finale but we’re here just in time for season 2!
when i thought all this sm drama was over but nope, there's a new plotwist that seems out of any makjang drama
"Welcome back, welcome back, welcome back"
HI SEASON 2 IS HERE!
I can see a K drama made about SM scandals in the future
SM Crush Saga! 😂😭
whatf
What season are we on? Succession got nothing on her!
if the drama Reborn Rich with Song Joongki was based off the founder of Samsung, we'll probably get a drama in the future based off SM (or Kakao or HYBE or etc) lol.
Black Mamba was intended as SM's first line of defence against police raids but unfortunately aespa recently defeated it.
This is not the investigation into SM I was asking for. LSM is that way -points towards whatever country he ran off to-.   If they are guilty I doubt serious consequences will be served so at this point the 99% just shrug and the megacorps pay their "cost of doing business" fines. But at least SK is investigating. There are sure a lot of companies I'd love to see get raided by my governments authorities.
oy vey
Kakao bro 😂🤦 they had an investigation case opened by the TMC on "Massive media manipulation" including TV, newspapers, and blog outlets. Another investigation on 2022 by the Capital Monitoring Center against the founder and chairman a 800B won tax evasion violating the Tax Criminal Punishment Act during DAUM acquisition   You really can't trust this shady company how many other things go unnoticed probably
Bro I feel so bad for SM artists, this has been such a mess but imagine the headache they’ve been dealing with.
Lol! Things just keep getting better and better.
Lmao
Holy shit! This is like a season of Dragon Ball Z!
I thought the drama is over
Bit confused, are they not allowed to buy up stocks to raise the price?
Man we were so close to that long delayed Aespa comeback 😭 honestly though this saga has been fascinating, I’m kind of excited to see how deep the white collar crime rabbit hole goes.
bruh, when does this fiasco end
Oh this kdrama getting good
Is there any other sources? It sound like the execution of hybe complaints of weeks ago when they failed the tender offer. Or is it different lawsuit?
woah. just like a kdrama.  hybe was smart to pull away.
Hybe is waiting for SM's stock to plummet before they swoop in and finish it once and for all
Lmao wtf happening to KakaoM and SM nowadays? They a mess. HYBE on the side be watching all this go down. 💀🐍  ![img](emote|t5_2r1ox|30157)![img](emote|t5_2r1ox|30157)![img](emote|t5_2r1ox|30157)![img](emote|t5_2r1ox|30157)![img](emote|t5_2r1ox|30157)![img](emote|t5_2r1ox|30157)![img](emote|t5_2r1ox|30157)![img](emote|t5_2r1ox|30157)![img](emote|t5_2r1ox|30157)![img](emote|t5_2r1ox|30157)![img](emote|t5_2r1ox|30157)![img](emote|t5_2r1ox|30157)![img](emote|t5_2r1ox|30157)![img](emote|t5_2r1ox|30157)![img](emote|t5_2r1ox|30157)![img](emote|t5_2r1ox|30157)![img](emote|t5_2r1ox|30157)![img](emote|t5_2r1ox|30157)![img](emote|t5_2r1ox|30157)![img](emote|t5_2r1ox|30157)![img](emote|t5_2r1ox|30157)![img](emote|t5_2r1ox|30157)![img](emote|t5_2r1ox|30157)![img](emote|t5_2r1ox|30157)![img](emote|t5_2r1ox|30157)![img](emote|t5_2r1ox|30157)![img](emote|t5_2r1ox|30157)![img](emote|t5_2r1ox|30157)![img](emote|t5_2r1ox|30157)![img](emote|t5_2r1ox|30157)![img](emote|t5_2r1ox|30157)![img](emote|t5_2r1ox|30157)![img](emote|t5_2r1ox|30157)![img](emote|t5_2r1ox|30157)![img](emote|t5_2r1ox|30157)![img](emote|t5_2r1ox|30157)![img](emote|t5_2r1ox|30157)![img](emote|t5_2r1ox|30157)![img](emote|t5_2r1ox|30157)![img](emote|t5_2r1ox|30157)![img](emote|t5_2r1ox|30157)![img](emote|t5_2r1ox|30157)![img](emote|t5_2r1ox|30157)![img](emote|t5_2r1ox|30157)![img](emote|t5_2r1ox|30157)![img](emote|t5_2r1ox|30157)![img](emote|t5_2r1ox|30157)![img](emote|t5_2r1ox|30157)
All these big companies are going to destroy each other or themselves until all that's left is JY Papi.
Damn LSM has the connections /s 🥵 this drama is too spicy.
i need an episode thread
i'm eagerly hoping for a documentary in a few years
Well, Taxi Driver season 2 kinda based some of their episodes on the Burning Sun case, I won't be surprised if years from now someone would use this as an idea for their kdrama
Imagine SM's own talent as actors/actresses in this KDrama.  ![gif](giphy|3ohuPxds1YIK5LRUNq|downsized)
Poors do the same thing, just at a much lower level.
New season of everyone's least favorite K-drama just dropped!
the girls are fighting
I'm on the Next Level
>Oh well, SM and Stock Manipulation does share the same acronym. Just business as usual.  aespa better cb on time!
>Just hope this doesn’t somehow add one more month to the aespa cb delay.  Oh no if that happens, I'm getting my post it notes and we're weefuckingwooing SM
AH HA! You’ve cracked the case. Book em boys!
I've been into kpop for a while, and I remember my mum kept being curious about it, wanting me to introduce her to some groups.    I straight up warned her from the beginning the world of kpop is full of drama, intrigue, suspicion!!!    She didn't believe me until, like you she fell into the kpop hole and she said to me yesterday "it's like a soap opera!  As soon as you think the story is going to end some new villain comes in!". 🤣  Love it
I seriously doubt anything is actually going to happen. Maybe some fines at most, if that. "Raid" makes it sound super dramatic, but the authorities had already long announced that they would conduct an investigation... and they came to investigate. Doesn't mean they're actually going to find anything, and in any case, the acquisition is a done deal at this point.
And a hard hitting no nonsense good one produced  by someone NOT connected to LSM.  I NEED it!
When Hybe filed its complaint, the Korean FSS [said](https://m.pulsenews.co.kr/view.php?year=2023&no=168429) a company is not allowed to artificially inflate the price to block a competitor's tender offer, it is punishable under the "capital markets act" apparently.
HYBE is the one who asked for Kakao to be investigated.
Any guesses who will play the leads?  We should add this to our annual kpop predictions
*Least* favorite? I'm lovin' it ![img](emote|t5_2r1ox|3560)
…, yeah.  Jeoldaejeok rureul jikyeo.
With SM aespa might even cb early as a distraction
I need that famous gif from that famous Enron case where they're all shredding as much evidence as possible.
Let's see what happens. I'm excited, Kakao needs a little blow, they're shady.
I guess that depends on what exactly "artificially inflate" means.  Why wouldn't a competitor be allowed to offer a higher price during someone's tender offer in order to ensure existing shareholders sell to them instead via the tender offer? Are you just blanket banned from buying at a higher price? That doesn't seem like it makes much sense.
Mark as LSM 😭
Red Velvet alone has three members with acting experience, four if you count Wendy on Korea SNL actually.
Shredder Unnie as herself
I'm just gonna put this out there. I will watch Lee Seung Gi in anything. I don't care if he's playing LSM or has a cameo as JYP. Find him a role.
Oh don't do that to our beloved Mork 🤣
Red Velvet as... Red Velvet.     Ain't nobody can be Red Velvet but Red Velvet.
Mork
I want there to be a mid-series episode where Lee Sooman and Chris Lee just starts a catfight in SM HQ and Red Velvet's standing there at the background like 🧍‍♀️🧍‍♀️🧍‍♀️🧍‍♀️🧍‍♀️ and then the camera zooms to Wendy's stank face a la the Office.
MORK!! ❤️
Oh I just got the mental image.   And I nearly cried tears of joy, I need this in my life.
I hope other songs they released at the end of last year will also be noticed.   Especially higher, lovin me, tell me are as good as cupid
leggoooo. hope they put this momentum to good use
This is just getting insane. They are over 14 million Spotify listeners now! And it just keeps going.
Highest Kpop GG chart position in the U.K. besides Blackpink
Every time there’s a fifty fifty thread I will talk about how special Aran’s voice is. It’s so round, and full. Sounds almost like a horn, such a rich and jazzy tone. I’m so glad her group is getting popular and blasted through nugudom to setting themselves up incredibly well for their next comeback. I’m so proud of these girls.
The way this song just keeps giving me a bigger and bigger oh my god moment
As a Hunnies since their predebut days, LETS GOOOOO
Omg this is so crazy!! If it gets into the top 40 it'll be on radios everywhere
This song’s been going off everywhere in my algorithm and I love that
Yay! Glad to see its rising and the recognition
Wow wow wow
Wow!! Let’s go FIFTY FIFTY!!
If you haven't heard of Fifty Fifty yet, you need to listen to *Cupid* and *Lovin' Me*
![img](emote|t5_2r1ox|3558)
Just listened to this song for the first time. Really enjoyed it. It's very heavily inspired by Doja Cat though, right? I can't be the only one who noticed that. The instrumental, the adlibs, and especially the rap section. Again, I like it and inspiration is fine, just making an observation.
RISE  ![gif](giphy|yr7n0u3qzO9nG)
manifesting that this fame and support will carry over to their subsequent releases 😫😫🙏🏻🙏🏻 these girls deserve it!!!
as a UK citizen my duty is to getting this song to Top 10🫡
Can anyone explain how these charts work? Like what is the ranking based off? I thought it was radio play, but I saw someone mentioned that this isn’t even on the radio.   Also is this for the Korean version? English(twin) version? Or combined for both?
Please don't hate me for saying this but i'm genuinely curious, why is this song gaining so much popularity?? I heard it last week and it was just a mediocre song, i believe in DIFFERENT PEOPLE DIFFERENT TASTES but even after that i can't seem to understand how it's happening
Lets goo!!! I really loved the song 🥹 Also learning about the company's sacrifice for this girl group makes it even worthy. They deserve more 💗
Their songs are so good! I hope they get the recognition they deserve.
Yepp. This is insane! So amazing.
Soooo happy for them!
Her voice is honeyyy. So smooth. And I love how their song selection compliments her tone so much too. I’m excited to see where they go next’
Her voice is so special.  She's so young too, which surprised me. In Cupid she just has such a mature tone if that makes sense. I can't wait to hear how her skills progress as she and Fifty Fifty continue on their next releases.
the first time i heard cupid i did have to double take lol i was like, “this is kpop?!?! wait ... a young rookie kpop girl group ????” bec her voice (and the english lyrics & pronunciation) was unexpected and very impressive. i don’t think i’ve ever heard a rich jazzy tone like aran’s in kpop (for me deep voices like moonbyul’s and yuqi’s and that indie cursive tone like swan’s and minnie’s are different) and it’s just very refreshing and i’m so glad they really leaned into it. i hope companies follow suit in that they don’t force high pitched songs (which sometimes result to nasal vocals) on girl groups anymore.
And she's not even the main vocal (though you'd never know by listening to their music)
It really reminds me so much of Yerin Baek with how resonant it is
the mix of r&b and synth-pop in doja songs like say so and kiss me more has definitely impacted the k-pop industry. apink chobom’s copycat is an example that comes to mind
and not the first k-pop hit to bear the resemblance, either
uk charts are purely streams and sales
Dreamy city-pop esque style inspired by Doja Cat (Who went viral in 2020 for this exact style of music) English lyrics that are coherent, stylized as if written by a native speaker, and pronounced as if sung by a Native English Speaker. Jazzy like vocals from both the main singers. *Extremely relatable lyrics* (even those who aren't single use this song to express how glad they are that they found a lover) + anti-romantic sad-girl-hour type love song almost designed to be used as aesthetics for TikTok (Aesthetic + editing TikTok is one of the largest branches of the TikTok algorithm). TikTok in general actually (A popular non-kpop stan used this song in an edit and the rest is fucking history). So they essentially had the groundwork for success from the beginning
It's like the least offensive song of all time and there's a popular TikTok challenge or something for it
I don't understand why the BIG 4 has never tried to buy 88rising, it is recognized in the United States, especially in the Asian community, it also has subsidiaries in Thailand and China, in addition to having good connections. Of course it all depends on whether the shareholders want to sell but with money everyone changes their minds.

Wow, congrats! That's great for him! Put Up A Fight is such a good release!
**[Coachella Twitter:](https://twitter.com/coachella/status/1644416394069696513)**   >LØREN will hit the desert on Sunday, 4/16, special thanks to \@88rising ❤️
The last part with Shooting Star got me feeling so sappy. Also it's great seeing OT5 together. 🥺
So many weddings as of recent. Wishing them the best.
Man I'm happy for him. I feel like when I've seen a headline for Seunggi recently, it's been because he's struggled with some misfortune. Really nice to see his name in a headline for such an exciting reason.
This is really some good news. Losing my mind in  my girlfriend is a gumiho ost was one of my first kdramas and i always liked how professional he was and still is as singer and actor. Wishing the best for the couple.
This is a fluffier and probably irrelevant detail, but it was gratifying to see the rest of the OT4 from Master In The House plus Eunwoo attending.
My best wishes to them on their happy day ❤️
I had to do a double take. I thought that said Seungri. I didn’t see the photo right away
Congratulations!!
Did Lee Sun Hee attend his wedding?
I really hope she doesn't fucked him over   If her personality is anything like her parents, she's going to cause the guy a lot of problems and stress. His reputation had already taken a hit...
Am the only one only caring for the music. But I send my congratulations.
Congratulations newly weds!
Still waiting for a huge one. Come on IU and her BF, Sooyoung (SNSD) and her BF, a soloist like Sunmi/Chungha or an out of nowhere shocker like a gen 3-4 group member.
I think a lot of people did. When I originally commented, it seemed like a lot of people downvoted because of that
BP- "what's your favorite song of ours?"  JC- "the most recent one, ya, ya, it's been playing non stop."
Corden has a reputation of being a massive dickbag but it is some pretty good promo and the carpool karaokes i've seen have been solid.
Corden’s a dick, but I live for Carpool Karaoke I’m ngl 💀
Oh I love Carpool Karaoke, this is a great segment for them. I wonder if they’ll choose any non-BP songs, it’s always fun to see what other artists the guests enjoy. I’d guess Taylor Swift since there seems to be mutual respect there. Just stream-of-consciousness at this point but that made me want to see Rose sing Willow or Exile.
omg!!! I know people don't like james corden, but the carpool karaokes have been fun!
i like carpool karaokes so im excited
Iconic! Gonna break some serious records. I like his shocked look too. It’s like he knows how damn big they are hehe.  Wonder if he stans?!
I want to see it.
So excited for this!
NOOO GO BACK
Yeah the Corden thing was more of a disappointment. Like we get it, he's an ass and it's likely good that he's gone ... but he's been a supporter of K-Pop for quite a while. And while the cynical people will say "oh, he's just milking mainstream stuff" ... he was the one hosting CL during her solo stuff while the big shows were doing BTS (which yes he eventually did too). Point is, not all people are just a single thing ... he's an ass but I also believe he truly does love him some K-Pop and he gave it some legit exposure while people like Jimmy Kimmel seemed like they had no idea what was going on around them / mocking the fans (he did the same with video gaming)  Also, Carpool Karaoke was always good, say what you will about his other content.  Now we have Kelly Clarkson doing a excellent job without being an ass ... so we're better off without him.
I quite agree with this kind of thought of enjoying the content and being able to separate entertainment from a person's real life personality.  It's like even if I liked a song and the singer was in a controversy, I'll still enjoy the song but not the singer.
He's a massive scumbag but they are a lot of fun to watch
He’s a Karen but he’s show us actually really fun and I’m going to miss it. 😭
james corden is NOT a supporter of kpop 😂 he’s a supporter of deluding people into thinking he’s a nice guy so he can exploit them for money and views  (which he’s failing miserably at, especially after his last painful interview with bts)
Wasn’t Corden mocking k-pop fans by generalizing them as 15-year old girls in a demeaning way and being shady towards BTS during their UN speech? If he likes k-pop, it’s because he sees it as an opportunity to make money, not because he genuinely respects or appreciates the artists.   Carpool karaokes are fun though, as much as I dislike Corden.
Honestly this comes off bad imo. Like “I get he’s a bad person but at least he promotes Kpop”
Eghh.  I don't feel like Corden really likes it and just sees it as a way to garner attention for himself.  So many weird interactions especially with BTS where he's basically trying really hard to use them for clout.  One time he made a passing joke generalizing KPop and BTS fans as fanatic 15 year old girls which ARMY didn't take kindly to.  BTS were on his show afterwards and RM brought it up.  Instead owning up to it and apologizing, Corden was trying to sweep it under the rug acting like it was just a joke that didn't land along with having a "we're still cool though right 🥺" attitude with the guys.  It was pathetic to see him squirm like that.  That being said Carpool Karaoke is still pretty cool and this will be fun.  Tbh if I were to pick a favorite one, it's probably Jimmy Fallon.  Doesn't try to do too much that could overshadow his guests and does a great job in filling the gap in conversation with the language barrier.
I don't think he's a supporter of K-pop when he shaded BTS and generalized the entire K-pop fandom by calling them 15 year old girls 💀
If he did I didn't catch that one, not gonna pretend to act like I follow Corden outside his on air K-Pop segments. Still, even if not genuine I do still feel like he at least faked it better than all the rest ... and that still acts as a positive for the genre. After a bunch of less than stellar (almost mocking) interviews back in 2nd gen from various US Shows that treated K-Pop like a gimmick .... then seeing us switch to the 3rd/4th gen where shows either fake it poorly, still treat it like a gimmick, or just have no clue whats going on .... Corden at least FELT genuine and made K-Pop look good .... motivations aside (and possibly quotes I hadn't heard yet aside too I guess)
>Wasn’t Corden mocking k-pop fans by generalizing them as 15-year old girls in a demeaning way  I'm almost certain that was someone else, but it's hard to remember who
Bad people can do positive things, like it or not. The problem is when people say the good things are the reason the bad person should stay ... I'm happy with him gone.
It was Corden and he generalized BTS fans as 15 year old girls. He got a lot hate and the next time he saw BTS, RM said something like “you were in hot water with ARMY, are you ok?” And Corden just said he didn’t think his jokes were too bad and that he was a huge BTS fan.
He’s not the only one to do it but here’s a source: https://amp.scmp.com/magazines/style/celebrity/article/3149900/whats-beef-james-corden-and-bts-army-late-late-show-host
I get that but maybe if you had led with we’re better off without him it would look better. As is you said “he sucks … but at least he supports Kpop.” And only at the very end you said we’re better off without him. And quite frankly promoting Kpop isn’t some huge positive thing. It’s not like we’re talking trans rights or BLM, which maybe he does promote, but those things do a lot more for people than a music genre
>And quite frankly promoting Kpop isn’t some huge positive thing. It’s    not like we’re talking trans rights or BLM, which maybe he does    promote, but those things do a lot more for people than a music genre  I feel like you're over thinking this, but I just wanna reply to this. We're on a kpop forum ... that adds context to the conversation. Whether or not something helps promote KPop is relevant to this sub and has nothing to do with whether or not WAY more serious topics are getting the attention they deserve.
Additionally, this makes her:  * First & only female K-pop soloist to enter the top 40 * First & only female K-pop act to enter the top 40 at debut * Second female K-pop act in the top 40
Another day another slay
As well she should
Just Jisoo winning everyday.
' you keep talking we shut you down ' blackpink shutdown 2022
Blinks had to fight hard for this. That fuckass company didn't make the single available for purchase in the BP shop and the MV was also not available in iTunes. These could've boosted the sales somewhat and earned us better charting.
Oh amazing! Which was the first female Kpop act in the top 40?
She’s probably the 4th solo act to enter top40, with the 3 of them in the last two months alone. And it’s probably the second song fully in Korean to reach top40, that’s the more insane part.
Blackpink had their first placement in 2018 with Kiss and Make Up and their best placement was at #17 with Sour Candy
Thanks!
He sounds wonderful!!
You can really feel the work he’s put into his voice.
I want the full clip 😭😭😭
Sheeesh , Both are shining
two very successful, thought-provoking musicians 🫶🏼
- [Shorts version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRrAhqA9hm4)
I love this duo ! Both very respected and deserve all of the success that has come their way.
I agree, it really shows he took months of vocal training.
Balkan core once again in kpop.

I did not know that CyA had recently changed his stage name to his real name Giuk... I was looking at this tracklist for the last ten minutes, trying to figure out which Onewe member was Giuk at all lol. It's exciting that he's having a solo release! I'm looking forward to this.
Those features 👀
Sunwoo……? As in TBZ or is there another Sunwoo 😅
8 tracks!? Holy shit, I wasn’t expecting this to have more than 4 or 5 songs 😳   Cybernetic is (was?) one of my favourite song of his on his Soundcloud and I’m glad we’re getting an official version of it, as well as for So You Want The Flowers to Bloom Without Watering Them ❤️
Giuk pulling out all the stops on features, we simply love to see it!
"living puff" is the cutest name...
I think he’s still CyA but for this Giuk since it’s solo?  edit:nvm, he did change it & Im just behind on the news 😅  ![gif](giphy|83QtfwKWdmSEo)
looked at the credits & it is Sunwoo from TBZ, holy shit my worlds are colliding 😳 2 of my favorite rappers omg 😭
Haha I was very behind on the news too! Good for him though for sure
Fun fact: Giuk and Sunwoo went to school together and are part of a crew called [Named Late](https://instagram.com/namedlate?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=). :D
I never knew that! Thank you lol!
Aww I didn’t know that 🥹🫠
this concept execution is so good omg  edit: i wonder if this is their version of a highlight medley since specific songs are underlined on each
SM WHO ARE YOU! Like I’m obsessed with this concept and they’ve actually delivered, are being coherent and it’s actually so beautiful.
THE MELODY OF SCENTS: Triangular Theory of Love  Story 1: PASSION - 2023.04.09   Story 2: COMMITMENT - 2023.04.11   Story 3: INTIMACY - 2023.04.13
this new a24 movie looks amazing
actors ✨
Ahh yes passion, commitment, and intimacy… things that my exes struggled with.   /half joking
This concept is soooooo good and Jaehyun is slaying every last one
I like this cover because it shows her range and her nice tone!   She's 100% a star
OP you always beat me to the punch hahaha   One of these days I'm guna post faster than CronoDroid lol  (Probably impossible) lol
congratulations to EXO for being the only group to have What Is Love, History, MAMA, Angel, Machine and Two Moons in their debut mini album! it's amazing how that album still holds up 11 years later, just hit after hit
My favorite "hags". To another 11 years 🎉
Damn, I can't believe it has been 11 years. I also can't believe there are still 2 more enlistments to go.   They have one of the most stacked discographies in kpop, and it gets even more stacked if you include their unit and solo releases.   Looking forward to the fanmeeting this weekend - it has been *years* since we've seen them all dance together as a group.
I dont know much about them but I hope the penguin is D.O hahah
Happy Anniversary to my ult group!!!  Really cherishing the time and activities they’ll be doing all together 🥹
For the curious  Squirrel - Xiumin   Carrot - Suho  Ghost - Baekhyun  Chick - Chen  Dog(?) - Chanyeol   Penguin - DO  Bear - Kai  Crescent shaped object - Sehun
every passing year makes me feel older 🥲 it’s been such a privilege to grow up with them  exo saranghaja!!!!!
happy anniversary to my first and ult group! I would never have been interested in k-pop if it wasn't for Sehun in the Obsession MV <3 (Obsession is a non-skip album tho). hoping for more good news coming!
My money's all for EXO having the best boy-group discography of all time: their sub-units just leave every other group in the dust (Fly Away, Cherish, Mama, Thunder, Vroom Vroom...). Happy anniversary to the absolute kings of versatility!   Surely we'll get some group output sometime before the 12th-year mark rolls around...?
Got into exo late 2020 and this makes me so excited to experience an actual comeback. Praying they spill the tea during the fan meeting 🙏🏾
 i was planning to write a long congratulatory message but it just boils down to the idea that there will never be another group like exo.  a group like them not only comes with an impeccable discography and immense talent, but also an interesting and storied history. they are the definition of resilience.   can’t wait for the fanmeet this weekend! 🪐🎂🖤
This is sooooo cute. I'm so excited for the fan meetings too, I bet Jongin will be crying on the first song lol
It’s kinda insane how long ago they debuted and were new to the scene, seemed like almost yesterday when I was just in pre uni.   still remember when the skies and the grounds were one legends through there twelve forces nurtured the tree of life. An eye of red forces created the evil which covered the heart of tree of life and the heart slowly grew dry.  To intent an embrace for heart of tree of life, the legends hereby divide the tree in half and hide each side hence time is overturned and space turns askew.  The twelve forces divide into two and create two suns that look alike, into two worlds that seem alike. The legends travel apart. The legends shall now see the same sky but shall stand on different grounds, shall stand on the same ground but shall see different skies. The day the grounds beget a single fault before one sky in two worlds that seem alike, the legends will greet each other. The day the red forces purify and twelve forces reunite into one perfect root – ” A New World Shall Open Up “
The members have had a great run so far as soloists and units, but there's still something irreplaceable about EXO. Excited to see them as a group again soon 😭 Happy 11th anniversary 🤍
Congrats to one of the most iconic boy groups of all time!
happy 11 years to the best group ever! Don't @ me lol.
The reason for my being. Happy 11th to my boyfriends!!!! 🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
Happy 11 years! I can't believe it's already been that long. It was so fun following debut era EXO. I can't wait for new material from them. They never disappoint.
Happy 11 years! It's crazy that we are going to be able to see the almost whole lineup after so long!
Who is the screaming bear? I know Baekhyun is supposed to be something else but it’s just looks like him in every exo group activity
Happy 11 Years to one of the best groups in Kpop & my personal no.1 favourites. EXO’s music & most importantly their vocals & the set of members & the way their vocal placements go is what makes their music click & that’s the reason for a lot of their hits!   I was in a dark time in 2019 August when I found them. Though life got way way better post that but again they’re a full line up & I was going through an emotional turmoil & their fanmeet & anniversary colliding at such a time just gave me the break I needed & the hope I require.   Thank You EXO & Happy 11th
Happy 11th! 🤍
from calling myself an exotics to exo-l, I still vividly remember the chuckles and comfort exo showtime brought me back then. I can’t believe it’s been 11 years, I basically grew up with exo. I may have found many many groups to follow along these years but my first group still holding a special place in my heart throughout these times proves how distinctly them EXO members and their discography are.   Miracles of December will forever be a song I cry myself to sleep to. All the bangers they produced from El-Dorado to XOXO to Tempo (any song really) still regularly make appearances in my playlist. Everytime a group or a survival show contestant or anyone covers their song, a sense of pride and joy overtakes me because I’m super proud with how far they’ve come. Solo albums, acting gigs, variety stars. You name it, EXO has it all.   Happy 11th anniversary to EXO, the guys that never fail to deliver, has immaculate tracks, impeccable sub-units, highly regarded vocal-line and many many more. Thank you for being a source of contentment for me 2013 onwards. Here’s to a comeback again because the whole DFTF album slapped (no DFTF slander is allowed here) and I need more new releases as a group.
happy happy 11th anniversary 🤍🤍🤍🤍 we finally get to see them again!
Happy 11th anniversary to the group that gave us nonstop bangers! 🥳
Happy anniversary to the group that got me into kpop! And a special thank you to Monster Chen for your creeping, creeping, creeping almost singlehandedly making me a fan
it took me aback counting only 8 drawings,,, so lay really is gone from exo after leaving SM :o
Happy 11 years
Happy 11th Anniversary! Can't believe 11 years past by so quick... growing up along side EXO has been a wild ride and I look forward to many more years to come.
now why is there a fucking BANANA on the poster who drew that 😭😭😭😭😭
Congratulations EXO! Wishing you many, many more!
this art is so cute!! exo we are one saranghaja !!
God I feel OLD 🥲🥲🥲 I'm streaming EXO today while I reminisce about my youth 😔 I'm now officially a kpop hag but their songs still slaps just as hard now as it had before. Happy 11th, kings! 👑
The moment I heard those gorgeous vocals on What is Love in Kai's debut teaser I just KNEW I had to stan and 11 years on we're still here   Their discog is one of the few which actually don't sound to dated (the EX'ACT album for instance could be released today and still slap). On to another 11 years!
Happy 11 years! Time feels like it’s flown by but also doesn’t, you’ve lasted so long in this crazy industry, I’m so happy and proud 🥺 hoping for many more years 🤍
Happy Anniversary to my ult group!
Happy anniversary to EXO! The quality and variety of their discography is unmatched, especially when you add the sub-unit and solo releases, plus all the members have that star quality you can’t help but love and admire. Super talented but equally as humble about it. Never mind the quality of their vocals… imo that will help their discography stand up for a very long time. They’re just so damn good.
Here's to another eleven years.  Happy anniversary, EXO.
oh wow, congratulations to exo! the poster is cute
I don't even call myself an EXO-L (yet), but I can't express how proud of them as a group for staying so strong.  Hoping for more Chen albums!  Also hoping for Lay's return and an OT9 comeback!
Happy anniversary EXO! Thank you for being my happy place for 8 years now and counting!
How time flies!! Congratulations 🎉🎉
Happy 11th anniversary Exo ! May the fanmeeting go smoothly..  Thank you for everything. Here's to another 11 years 🥳🥳
Really vibing with the sad ~~strawberry~~ that's a _carrot?_ personally
Yay happy 11 years of great music
I selfishly want them to make music until we’re all old and grey together 🥲 I can’t wait for the fan meeting and the album later this year!
AHHH IM SO EXCITED FOR THE FANMEET! happy anniversary everybody 🎉
NEOUI SESANGEUROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Eterna11oveforEXO 😩🤍
MAMA is the best debut track of all time, and one of the best tracks period.
Are they really the only group to have ‘What is Love ?’? 👀
Correction, Ahjuicy’s***
u guys made me think i was on r/kpoopheads for a sec
If it’s EXO and there’s a penguin it’s 100% D.O. You can also tell by the eyebrows and big eyes lol
I am almost positive that's a wolf. Also "crescent shaped object" is so funny to me 😂
Jongdae really took Sehun’s baby chick status from him
where's Lay?
Sehun is supposed to be the chick (who became chicken acc to Suho) right ? How did chen become a chick ?  Everything is confusing except for Kaisoo's drawings
I remember when they debuted. this makes me feel old 😭
I have a feeling they’ll announce a comeback soon. Kai even mentioned that when he heard Rover he told the label it would be good as an Exo song as well, and they have said they plan to release new music
omg the\_red\_curtain I haven't seen your comments in so long how are you and its so fitting to see you in an exo thread LOL
@you
Kai is always the bear.    Baekhyun is the ghost 'ㅅ' is his face emoji
i wonder if he’ll post something separately which he sometimes does
no seriously, i was surprised to count only 8… i guess this tells us a lot about where things stand
Not quite. He posted a video of him writing 10 + 1 = ? on a piece of paper for the anniversary. It was released on his Weibo account.
I guess that and to avoid political drama. K fans hate him cause he’s Chinese so that’s that plus the fanmeeting is on the head so maybe they don’t want chaos but yeah a lot of EXOLs need to accept that he’s gone. He anyways wasn’t there since 2017 but whatever.
It would be really awesome if he appears on the fan meeting even just through a video call.
It's rumored it was sehunnie lol 😂
Careless careless
Everywhere is r/kpoopheads if you try hard enough
Thats what I guessed it from, never seen a mascot remind me of someone this much 😂
Chanyeol is usually a puppy/dog though, not a wolf.
Well, he's not part of the fanmeeting
I dunno what's going on, but the face of the moonana is Sehun's face emoji.   Xiumin's squirrel ties into his Acorn Market from Brand New and Suho's carrot is a direct reference to his rabbit.  BeakChenChanHun though 🤷‍♀️
right? who would think the most solid indicator of his status in exo would be cute drawings 😭
Some fans have post one edit and add one animal form for Lay
Please be a hit  Please be a hit  Please be a hit
I’m really excited about this
I loved Dance On, I hope these hit the same way!
No Do-A in the name list?
I wish there were more songs
No DoA or Yeonje for this comeback.  "This comeback will be excluding members Do-A and Yeonje, as they have halted activities due to health problems as previously reported.      The ALICE members said, "It's very sad that Do-A and Yeonje, who have always been together with us, can't join in our album activity together, and we hope for the day when the two members recover quickly and return on stage."  They couldn't afford to wait, they need to be promoting consistently.
Thanks for the info! I hope they recover well :((
Youngji is the model we should aspire to be.  Imagine being able to casually drink, eat, talk, and act like an absolute clown with all these big name idols.
So many dance challenge videos do nothing for me — they’re so manufactured, all the life’s gone out of them — but this was cute AF. Sure, let’s just do it in the hallway by the washing machine and goof off. <3
Young Ji(soo) an iconic pairing 🤣
Wow. Jisoo looks even hotter doing this dance in jeans.
Jisoo is super cute. Now I want a full smiley performance of Flower
And in front of the toy mess on floor XD, love this
Excited to see what they're going to do for debut!
My mind went to Vixen immediately
DALL-E in action.
Is she going solo?
Yes
Thanks for the info! all the best to her!
I will never get bored of how good JO1 look in 4k
omg finally! I was waiting super impatiently, lmao. obsessed with this song and choreo and they are all looking so good!
Immaculate choice by their side and they did so well.   If they upload it to YouTube, I will delete this post and post the YouTube one.
Man this ate
This was fantastic!  Is this for a tv show or something??
Took that, tore it up, stapled it back together w the KARD print all over it. Insane.
I didn’t expect them to go for a >!deep house!< sound but none the less they’ve caught my attention 👀
didn’t put on the sound because i don’t want to spoil myself, but loving the outfits!
This looks it is all stemming from a video of Bambam being asked his ideal type on his YouTube show.  The clip is from February but is making the rounds again and going viral.
I hope the NewJeans girls and any idols who are still minors have a good support system around them. It's sick that she was even given as an option in the first place and really just shows how normal it is to view minors in that light in Korea.  Not specific to BamBam but I hope all the underage girls in the kpop industry takes what [Sistar advised](https://twitter.com/sistarlives/status/1105125378853466112) to heart.
Respectfully, he needs to acknowledge that he did not handle that conversation about his ideal type and Haerin well. Like he really should've not even had her in that conversation. Because it's real easy for folks to run with stuff and label him a predator.  I don't think he is, I just... really don't love him discussing being attracted to a 16 year-old in any way when he's 25. That's gross.  And he needs to acknowledge that it was icky.
Imagine trying to sue people for posting screenshots and clips of things YOU said on YOUR OWN SHOW.
suing ppl for something YOU said is crazy
Sorry, but this is not a good look. Seems like they are trying to shush people talking about it.
Well damn. I was expecting the classic "sorry for any misunderstandings" apology, not for them to double down on this.
Oh shit. They did NOT just double down on this huge issue that he caused?!   Unintentional or not, it’s harmful to say things like that. In this day and age it shouldn’t be a shocker that indicating you’re kinda hot for a minor (child) is getting backlash.   There’s no excuse. Period . So much ick.  The company clearly doesn’t care and that’s kinda sad!
“rumors” 💀
What a wild response when he's quite literally caught saying something in 4k which people take issue with ...   I think a response to the actual controversy should come before any legal action against those going too far.
some of y’all are being intentionally thick. they’re obviously not taking legal action against anyone who is discussing the clip; it’s against people who are calling him an offender, a predator, a rapist. there’s a massive difference. attempting to put together and convince the public of a horrific narrative like that is completely unfair, uncalled for, and defamation.   you can blame him for bringing this shit upon himself with his weird ass comments, but it’s still wrong and he still has a right to defend himself against being called a rapist.
Is this the only statement we're gonna get? Cause that would be disappointing
Via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bambamxabyss/status/1644327596786880512?s=46&t=HgQsxZnBp_IvfPXFfNN1_w)
He is a man and he is in Korea, so nothing will happen even.
You can still think Bambam is weird for those comments and agree that this is the right move for him to do. People have taken this and gone as far as to accuse him of actual criminal activity towards minors, which is absolutely defamation. Criticism is one thing, but people going as far as to say that he *is* someone who has/ will violate others is downright disgusting.
First I want to point out that the translation is misleading. if translated directly it is very clear that he is talking from a fans pov.  2nd the og post mashed up points. The actual timeline and flow of the conversation is different. So try watching the video again but as I said the translation is of (as it has been with various videos of bam's house before)  Finally let me get to the main thing: the whole ideal type stuff in sk does not have to mean a romantic or sexual atteaction. For example Sana (Twice) literally saying a toddler is her ideal type   https://twitter.com/wxh4nh_/status/1463012590196445185?t=kaJHTrkoBx23vXxlgajBjA&s=19  I am NOT saying this to slander Sana in any way. I just want people to understand what I said above and that words/phrases, especially when they are integrated into another language, should not always be taken as in their original one. Tbis is what I also get from Bambam pointing out  various times that it was not ment in a romantic sense but only as a fan. He is active internationally. He's constantly on twitter and he tried to prevent people from misunderstanding.  (sadly I guess it wasn't enough plus some intentionally try to misconstrue the narrative) He knows what's up. Meanwhile Poongja, who as far as I know is not internationally active, asked the question within a korean mindset, not even fearing that there is an issue in that sense. I do not want to blame her either.   In the end it all comes down to incorrect translations & people just jumping in on it without having any sense or will to actually understand the context, the surroundings, linguistic differences & so on. AND the main perpetrators, the ones that intentially spread misinformation As well as them constantly adding to or rephrasing the situation. Making it worse.  I would just hope for people to actually be carefull with what they share, how quickly they join in on sharing (mis)information and on what base they are doing so.
I just find this situation confusing as a long time fan. I wanna gather my thoughts for a second regarding everything I know about the situation and provide more info. ESSAY INCOMING. I won’t be engaging anymore as this is all I have to say.  One of the things I’ve seen with this situation is that people are saying BamBam is (romantically) “into” in Haerin (and Winter) because of the English translation. But he describes them as a person he is a fan of (입덕한). This is a nuance that was not captured correctly and the translators routinely make errors in his show. That is obviously not an excuse for people being angry at him but for this specific conversation (before the ideal type game), he did not view them romantically. If you want time stamps go look at my comment history though I think I left out some bits unintentionally cause I was tired lol. This is the negative aspects of relying on subtitles too much.  Now for the ideal type game, I agree it’s weird to choose Haerin over someone else. However, it’s not clear to me how Bambam was choosing in regards to context. Sometimes he chose one person because the other one was like a sister to them but then sometimes he chose one person because he was a fan?? He switches over a lot which confuses me and by the end of the game it does not seem like he’s playing a regular ideal type game (i.e, choose who you’d date). Overall, it is not clear what his intentions are when choosing and that lack of explanation is the major problem. In foresight, he should’ve just excluded this segment.  So what did he mean when he said Haerin was too young? Honestly I don’t know. You can say that he’s being creepy and yes it is definitely creepy without explanation. He seemed to be backtracking and stuttering after stating Haerin was too young but this wasn’t captured in the subtitles and they concluded he chose her as a fan. Was he backtracking and stating it was dangerous cause he was thinking of her in a weird way or was he backtracking because he thought he was going to be misunderstood and that it was inappropriate?  More information in regards to people calling him creepy, etc., I’ve seen people say Bambam did not want New Jeans on his show so I snooped around to find out and this is correct ([BamBam WeVerse Live 230221.](https://weverse.io/bambam/live/2-114635549?hl=en) Time stamp: 5:50-6:10). I’m not great at Korean but he makes a flabbergasted noise and says they’re minors (미성년자) so how can they go on his show? He then adds that his show revolves around making and drinking beer so it wouldn’t work (unsure about this translation).   I’ve also seen people say he doesn’t wanted to date anyone younger than him and I looked again and that’s seemingly true. ([Sunmi Showterview 2023](https://youtu.be/FdLMcIZKkU4). Timestamp: 20:47). He had to choose between someone 10 years older or 10 years younger and immediately says that 10 years younger would be a minor. He chooses the 10 years older option.  General disclaimer: >!I haven’t deeply followed Bambam or GOT7 in ages so I didn’t know any of this but I guess my fossilized ahgase feathers got ruffled so here I am typing an essay lol. I obviously believe in the protection of minors and I am not blaming anyone here, however I just wanted to provide more information and map out my thoughts. There is definitely going to be bias here as you know. Again, I don’t blame New Jeans or anyone, I don’t follow them at all but I am a fan of their music and wish them the best.!<  Anyway, that’s all my thoughts. With this info in mind, in the defamation lawsuit case, they are only suing the people who are calling him a pedophile, etc. They are not suing people because of what he said, they are suing the malicious comments that tarnish his name and extrapolate from what he said- there is a difference so he has a right to defend himself here. He would benefit from an explanation but he might not need to if it’s a misunderstanding.
I'm curious what even happened 🧐
This response is disappointing
This just makes it worse like
I absolutely do not support him anymore. The better action to take would have been to put out a serious statement of apology and clarification (if any). Because honestly what he said was very wrong, gross, and creepy, and that should be addressed first and foremost.  That being said, I assume the “defamation” is toward the people literally calling him a criminal predator/rapist who has creeped on girls before which is… Let’s take exactly what he **said** as evidence, and not say things for the sake of saying them. Kpop fans try to approach things rationally and truthfully challenge… I still don’t think this is a move he should have taken though. Addressing the issue should have come first.
Lmao what
Not a fan of BamBam, not a fan of kpop twitter either. Let's be real, both sides are in the wrong for this. BB probably could've just avoided the whole situation, but he did preface saying he liked her as a fan and to not take things the wrong way.   Kpop twitter needs to chill as well, cause at the end of the day WE WILL NEVER KNOW what his true intentions/feelings were.  He could be getting cut down for the biggest misunderstanding/mistake of all time (he doesn't have a history of this type of scandal).   Everyone talks about bullying this, ped0 that. Kpop fans are the biggest hypocrites, cause they'll force issues like this with BB and bully them into depression/suicide. Then turn around and bias wrecker groups like NewJeans/Enhypen like they aren't the peds.
Watching the video in the shows context, they were treating it as a safe moment to speak openly. But unfortunately bambam was too honest and expressed his admiration and support for a underage member (haerin) of a popular group in a ideal type world challenge. He even mentioned as a fan and aware she is young, didnt say he was going to do anything with her. He tried to cover himself but still got in trouble. he should have just said his ideal type was Jackson Wang.
I keep seeing people say how weird it is that he kept mentioning how young she is but I think the reason why he was so overly conscious about it is because he knows that kpop stans like to take stuff out of proportion and run with it. Saying you’re a fan of New jeans and being an adult will get you side eyes from left and right bc you’re automatically assumed to be a creep, and I know he’s aware of that. In the video he even says not to misunderstand him since he knows how harsh people can be on idols.   The whole thing was sensationalized and turned into something that it’s not so I’m glad they’re doing something about the defamation.
Not him making matters worse for himself when he could have clarified and cleared up any misunderstandings and apologised. People would have probably moved on quicker and maybe give him the benefit of doubt.
I am (unfortunately) active on twitter so got to see this whole debacle happen in real time yesterday. Honestly sad to see the company and his fans try to cover the whole thing up, even sadder to see people directly attacking NewJeans to try to draw attention away from the actual issue. Victim blaming is lame and no matter which way you spin it saying a teenager is your ideal type (while acknowledging that she’s too young) as a grown man is very creepy behavior. It’s frustrating how so many popular male idols never seem to hold accountability, hope there’s at least an apology or something.
Well the company didn’t even bother to put out an explaination of what he said and just went for this?  Trust me, I’ve seen far worse from those twitter stans shamelessly acusing or even sending death threats to kpop idols for no reasons yet no company bothers to do anything except for this one lol
K-pop fans taking things way to far once again like they literally do with every issue. No wonder fans get a bad reputation lol
Wait so are we not allowed to talk bout this?
Very disappointing response, the proper course of action would be an apology, if he really had no ill intentions and it was just a very unfortunate usage of the word "ideal type" he should just say so and acknowledge where does the criticism comes from. This makes me think he doesn't understand the gravity of what he said and thinks everyone is just exaggerating.
I don’t use Twitter but I wonder if this is the classic case of kpop fans find out someone did something bad so now let’s say horrible things about them. I found what he said weird and a bit creepy, and the most I could reasonably see people doing is speculating if it’s a sign of something bigger. I don’t think it’s really that strange for people to give pause and consider the possible gravity here but speculating can often lead to witch hunts so it’s a tricky thing. Plus when it’s all public on the internet where the game of telephone is king. Even tricker.  Also didn’t people recently freak out on him for the whole crush on Nayeon thing? Could just be an unfortunate timing thing and not about this new situation ( old situation? Maybe new viral moment is a better descriptor) at all.  Anyway, I hope he’ll recognize why what he said is weird and that it’s nothing more than a surface level creepy thing.
Wait, did he ever apologize for the comments or did they go straight to threatening legal action?
Another kpop witch hunt. Good on him to take actions against people who accuse him of actual crimes and comparing him to criminals. I think once the holier than thou mob has made up their mind, the accused can move the heaven and earth and they'll still not believe them. And it sucks that this issue of a minor that everyone cares oh so much about has been blown out of proportion to the point that her name is being dragged everywhere.
Suing people for something YOU said is... interesting
Okay why are some comments here being downvoted for arguing that the purpose of the statement is to call out people who were accusing and calling him names like pedo or rapist? Like defamation is a real thing. You don't just willy nilly throw out "x is pedo/rapist" especially in today's age.    Y'all don't have to like him, and it's also fine if you hate him, but don't be obtuse and understand the context of the statement.
What the different between criticism he kinda deserves and hate tho... the line seems thin here.
i'm of the mindset that what bambam said is wrong, no matter how he meant it. he is a fully grown man. i think that the company handled this wrong, there is not reason to resort to legal action, because if anything, bambam should be the one to comment.
[removed]
pov : you're finding out all these while listening to BamBam's new album for the first time
this is like really bad?? instead of releasing an apology or maybe an explanation of how this could’ve been misinterpreted they decided they’d just start suing people. Which is why it’s hard for me to believe this was misinterpreted/taken out of context and they’re just trying to get people to shut up about it and let it die off
while i do think that some of the things he said in that episode weren’t meant how they sounded and i do think some have misunderstood CERTAIN things, a minor like haerin should not even be mentioned in a question like that about ideal types
Threatening to sue when you’re the weirdo for saying a minor is ur ideal type😭absolute loser
this generation is pathetic, and we're the ones calling out our parents/relatives for falling for clickbait-y fake news.
This along with Lip J's comments towards Yujin in this episode and last week's episode of boys planet is making me even more concerned for minors in this industry.
I feel that we shouldn't defend Bambam but he did say from a fan's perspective. I know haerin is just is just 16 but liking someone as fan is not bad.  So many fans call their fav idol who are almost 10-12 years older than them their husband/wife , he is just say  he likes those types of girls. He did not say that  he likes Haerin more than a fan. He said that he likes new jeans. Just like us he also has a bias.  But yeah, we should wait for Bambam to say something about this.
how is it fabricated? its backlash caused by what HE said in content THEY posted and translations THEY made. Suing people for finding your attraction towards minors weird is insane
Does anytbing ever happen though? Like has any troll ever been arrested from malicious comments? Just a genuine question.
Legal action??? Gurl what? Everything he said in that clip was straight-up creepy. No stan overexplaining how it's out of context is going to change my mind.  Why are you a grown man choosing to name one of the underage members of the group as your "Ideal type" or being a "fan"  then following it up with "She's too young now"  There was no taking out of context or making up a rumor. He said it with his whole chest, you could see him gasp to himself over how dumb it was what he said and backtrack, all recorded on camera.
It’s giving Japan Defamation laws (where you can be sued even if you tell the truth or not)
> call him a predator and put him on the level of actual sexual harassers is too much  You do realize there’s many types of predators, right? Being called one doesn’t equate to being accused of sexual assault. Claiming that a 16 year old is your ideal type but she’s too young right now IS predatory language no matter how you try to twist it.
My brother in christ, YOU made the comments
I don't know much about law, but can he really sue people for something he uploaded himself?? Especially if the users aren't from korea??
People claiming that the threats of a defamation suit are in regards to false and exaggerated allegations only should remember that the defamation laws in Korea are much different to those in the US for example. Defamation cases can be made against people even if they have said something true, as long as it can be determined that reputational damage could be done to a person.   This is a threat from the company to get people to hush up. It’s not the first time nor will it be the last time a K-pop company throws legal threats around rather than addressing the issue head-on.  International fans shouldn’t worry themselves too much. Korea can’t come after you in your home country, especially if you’re exercising your own freedom of speech rights and not lying to be considered a libel issue.
well he should have shut his mouth idk what they expected
Bambam makes creepy comments about an under-age girl and he gets called out for it, yet apparently he's the victim.
what rumors?? you mean the clips of him saying those things himself? LOL
Didn't he say he'd prefer someone who was 10 years older on Sunmi's show?  C'mon Bam. Make it make sense.
Maybe he shouldn't have said the 16 year old was his type. Seems pretty simple to me.
Yeah not a good look for BamBam for something he said on his own show.
I mean... He said what he said.
What an unfortunate situation....
Saying some messed up things and then sicking overzealous fans that don’t care about the people who have legitimate concerns and those who are going overboard with accusations.   This is the wrong move. You may say people are being obtuse, arguing that the company is going for the second afore mentioned group of people, but in my eyes, he is simply burying his head in the side and brushing personal responsibility aside.
I hope this isn’t just an empty statement too many people were comfortable making false accusations & twisting his words calling him names like p*do, predator, r*pist
r/kpop discovers that korean defamation law is not good, actually
As they should.   BamBam handled the situation badly. But if he genuinely meant “as a fan,” suing folks saying the opposite is the best way to drive that point home.   Honestly, I think this whole thing shows a bigger problem with western fandoms as a whole (not just western kpop fandoms.)  I’ve watched a lot of morals and ethics issues pop up in a lot of my go to fandoms lately (anime, kpop, gaming and vtubers.) coincidentally coming from western fandoms.   What I’m noticing is that there are a lot of fans who feel like they aren’t being heard in their actual life, find peace in an online fandom or community and then something comes up and it’s like “Seriously, again? Here too?” And these fans so badly want to be heard that things become twisted and it becomes a “you’re either with us or against us” mentality, and no one wants to support someone being painted as a pedo/ableist/racist/whatever. So then we have this huge loud crowd of people screaming about how BamBam is creepy, or a pedo, or whatever whatever.   It’s totally fine to call out an idols actions. It’s fine to say “That’s creepy,” and stop supporting them. But I wish western fandoms (of all types) would stop throwing these big accusations out willynilly, because it softens the meaning of the accusation.   People are saying BamBam is a pedo for being a fan of an idol younger than him. While actual abusers, and predators are out there. Lessening that term throws us back to the 70’s and 80’s where grown men were dating and marrying teenage girls and it was normal. It’s disgusting and creepy and still predatory, but it was normalized. I don’t want this behavior to become normalized again, but blurring the definition of what a pedo (or any accusatory term) is extremely dangerous, especially when you add in the “you’re either with us or against us” mentality.   At best, BamBam is a creep.   I dunno. Just some food for thought.
I would like to see them try to sue anyone for talking about his pedophilic comments. Lmao. What jokes.
isn't this sunmi's company? not surprised
WTF he did it himself lol
this is making him look worse than he already does. why sue people over something HE said. out of context my ass
What a joke of a company
[removed]
They didn't even apologize? Yikes bro. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)
This is an empty threat.  Social media posts are, by definition, merely the opinions of the author and are protected by free speech laws.  You can say anything you want to about any public figure and they have zero legal recourse against you.  To illustrate this, look at the name calling and lies voiced by candidates, their supporters, their enemies, and the media during any election.
Literally went to bed and this was the first thing I woke up to 🗿🙃
What’s happening to Double B??
Tbh I have no opinion on this situation for now because I’m not really sure what happened   All I’ve seen is some clips and some screenshots and it’s not making sense to me 😮‍💨
He wasn’t asked that question directly they were playing the game which initially started off as him picking between two female idols based on who his ideal type is when it was his turn to play. Just in case it’s not clear to anyone
erm can anyone here give me the full context? i cannot seem to find the video on reddit
It's actually disgusting how this is so deeply rooted in entertainment all over the world. The types of questions underage actresses get asked all the time in interviews make me so uncomfortable. Remember how crazy western media acted over Billie eilish wearing a tank top. Actually even out of entertainment adults love to sexualise young girls. Why can't adults just let girls be what they are: children!
Unfortunately with someone in charge like Min Heejin and parents who sent their 14 and 15 year olds into the industry I don’t have much faith about their support system. The only positive thing is that the idea of minors in the industry have gotten a lot more heat recently and maybe the Korean government will *finally* step in. I was hoping the major backlash during Cookie would be enough but I guess not.
Yk!
People have moved past talking about it and have moved onto outright accusing him of inappropriate behavior towards others; that’s the defamation his company is worried about.
They're announcing legal action. This isn't about making people stop talking about it, it's about the actual *defamation* of their artist.
His fans are then intentionally thick too coz what you just described in the first paragraph is exactly what his fans have been doing.
But he’s not Korean so let’s see what happens
He isn't Korean
He hasn’t even addressed the actual comments he made. This shows us exactly where his priorities lie.
It's not the right move at all considering he hasn't even made a statement about the issue? He could easily be like "I'll choose my words more carefully next time, I'm sorry to anybody I've cause distress to, and we will take legal action on the basis of false accusations"  The way this is going, so far, is that anybody who expresses an upset about his opinion are at risk for legal action. It's like trying to silence people for talking about the words that came out of HIS mouth. Feeling uncomfortable, posting the clip and saying it's weird, or saying it is indicative of larger problems in society are all a healthy conversation to have about this topic, and this move is trying to get people in legal trouble for it. It's absolutely not right.
ugh I do not give a crap about BamBam. I’m not a GOT7 fan. But I am so sick of international fans who don’t speak Korean taking a short clip or a shoddy translation and running absolutely wild with it and blowing it out of proportion. Like the fact that there are comments calling BamBam a predator for being a fan? Saying the NWJNS girls are in danger? (like I agree but not bc of this) That BamBam is one of those seniors to be wary of like SNSD warned? Holy crap.   From what I recall, BamBam basically hesitated between Haerin and Nayeon (?) and then he said Haerin but stuttered and said that could be dangerous (my interpretation: people would misunderstand). Then the guest said something like “well do you think I’m going to do something with my ideal type?” (aka ideal type doesn’t mean you have any weird intentions). Then he confirmed he’s “into” her as a fan. Then the guest asked if he would rather live forever with Haerin or the guest and he said “you” and justified it.   Idk like I guess you can debate if he’s creepy for bringing up Haerin in the first place, but the vast majority of people are saying such out of pocket and unsubstantiated things that it’s frustrating to see.
[removed]
the first step shouldn’t be this it should be bambam releasing a statement
[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/12dw8gg/what_bambamgot7_said_about_newjeans_haerin_is/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1) is a link to a thread on the thoughts subreddit, where people discussed the issue
Start watching from 10:05 https://youtube.com/watch?v=-jRjcgBjyKs&feature=share   A chopped up portion of this was on twitter and people were angry because they think he’s saying he sees haerin as an ideal type
Bambam has had back to back issues now as he mentioned female idols. First it was TWICE’s Nayeon when he said he had a crush on her when they were trainees.  He told Jihyo this when she appeared on his YouTube show.   But he got backlash bad that he called & apologized to Nayeon directly and said he won’t mention her again.   Now there is a clip going around of Bambam being asked to chose who is his ideal type between Nayeon and New Jeans’s Haerin.  Here’s the alleged full [clip](https://twitter.com/luvlyeseo/status/1644074826041106433?s=46&t=HgQsxZnBp_IvfPXFfNN1_w)
[removed]
>he should have just said his ideal type was Jackson Wang.  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  That might start a completely but more fan shitshow...  Anyway this is why idols just lie to us all the time... honesty gets rewarded with innuendos and accusations.
Agreed
I think it’s a fine line of saying his statement is creepy without saying that he is a predator who actually broke a law 😒
Basically yeah lmao. His fans are mass tagging the company on anybody who talks about it. I saw someone post the full clip and say "I'm uncomfortable but here's the full context if you want to decide for yourself" and they got ratioed with people telling abyss to sue them.
The latter.
I mean he didn't say he wasa rapist, pedophile or a Kris Wu and Seungri in the making though. It was just an awkward situation which he handled badly that brought a witch hunt to his door.
“ there is not reason to resort to legal action”  Why not? When people are calling him a pdophile, predator, rpist etc & if he does comment himself what’s that going to do? Even if he comes out with a statement saying it’s a misunderstanding people have already completely made their minds up.
[removed]
Why wouldn’t they threaten to sue when people are calling him a pedo, rpist etc. equating him to people who have actually committed disgusting crimes.  He said in the video for people not to misunderstand & this still happened. What’s explaining further going to do when people have already made up their minds?
saying something like that about someone older is NOT the same as making the same comment about someone younger.
he said she was his ideal type he didn’t just say he was a fan of her?? literally why try to justify what he’s saying i don’t get it
That’s how it is in SK too.
Korean companies who threaten to sue are rarely referring to anyone outside Korea, their reach isn’t that far no matter how big they are.  Defamation laws are different in each country so what’s considered defamation in Korea isn’t always considered defamation outside Korea.
[removed]
It’s not an empty threat if they go after people who have outright accused him of Kris Wu type behavior. Saying he’s a sex offender is the type of stuff that will get you hit with a defamation lawsuit.
Still his show his platform his house. He clearly knew how it could be perceived and he should’ve just avoided the question entirely, or at least made some kind of acknowledgment that a minor shouldn’t be included in that type of conversation but he didn’t
And the person who was asking him deliberately put an idol who is underage as one of them. He picked her, but said she was too young.
It's tricky because technically, picking who is more your type (i.e: who is closest to your favorite archetype) is not the same thing as picking who you would prefer dating.  Your type could lean heavily into introverted girls and if you have to choose between 2 extroverts and an introverts well that's it. It also depends if you consider age to be a "type", which many people don't.  All of this is speculation though, I don't know enough Korean to understand the nuance of the exact question and response in this case.
Here is the full segment: https://youtu.be/-jRjcgBjyKs
Idk if anything will actually change. I saw a lot of “only westerners with minds in the gutter could see cookie as gross and it’s all virtue signaling.” I need people to realize that criticism against cookie and mhj isn’t hating on the members of the group
Backlash for Cookie was only foreigners, and HYBE was able to control the Korean narrative and basically say foreigners are the dirty ones trying to make it sound like Cookie is sexual. There was no consequence, and NJ still performs Cookie like there’s no problem.  MHJ was proven to be obsessed with lolita, and there was never any consequence.
>The only positive thing is that the idea of minors in the industry have gotten a lot more heat recently and maybe the Korean government will finally step in.  There is actually a 0% chance that the Korean government step in into any of that. Minor superstars are incredibly normal not just in Korea but in many other countries including the US (remember Stranger Things?). There will never be a rule against it. The "heat" as you call it is only online talk and nothing that's being actively discussed IRL or by "non-fans".
I’ve watched the entire video and all this “context” ahgases keep hollering about doesn’t make him look any better.   In the ideal type game he choose nayeon over haeeun because he sees haeeun “as a sister” …..when haerin was brought up ALL he had to say was “I see her as a kid/junior” and then move swiftly on. instead, he chose her and then tried to clean it up by acknowledging her age and trying to make it out to be a “im just a fan!!” thing.  People shouldn’t be comparing him to the likes of Seungri (though personally I’ve not seen that happen) but you and all the other ahgases are just gonna have to suck it up and accept that it was a weirdo comment and people are gonna permanently side eye him now.
What’s the context, enlighten us 😋
give me a single context that would make a 25yo picking a minor as his ideal type something thats ok, bc i dont see how u can.
he literally said she is his type but she is too young right now. how can that be taken out of context?
Every single instance I've seen of his fans tagging the company in a "malicious" tweet about him today has been people just posting the clip and saying "personally I'm uncomfortable but it's up to you to decide how you feel, here is the full context"  To issue a statement allowing your fans to try to get you to sue people for having feelings about the words that come out of your own mouth is kinda bonkers. He could've just as easily made a statement addressing the controversy, promise to choose his words carefully, and only take legal action against false accusations towards him.
Yes because predators say “hey! I’m a predator!”
What a strawman argument. 99% of the comments are about how his comments are gross and he shouldn't be talking about a minor like that.  Don't act like everyone was comparing him to a rapist.
is that what ur worried abt…it’s funny that u say this when in the video the interviewer justifies him having a 16yr old as an ideal type b/c “he won’t do anything to her”. i hate to break it to you but having a child in your head as an ideal type is predatory behavior.
I’ve hardly seen anyone doing the latter though. Yes I’m sure people are out there doing that but the good majority are just simply pointing out how it was weird, inappropriate, &/or that they no longer want to support him.
in my opinion the company should’ve started this after having bambam speak out and get the situation in line. This just looks bad
& that is reasonable, however this being the first & so far only response is a terrible look. The first thing that should’ve came out was an apology/clarification. Then this response should’ve been made if people were still actually accusing him of being a child predator
It's not defamation simply to talk about what he said. Feeling uncomfortable with how he answered is not defamation, neither is posting the clip and saying you don't think it was right. And I've yet to see anybody else be reported to his company?
Because the truth is damaging and that can still count as defamation under Korean law? His image deserves to be damaged by this and it’s obvious the legal threats are to stop people talking about it.
I don’t think he’s actually caught backlash though outside of very specific internet circles. Not to mention even if he addresses the original comments, it won’t help him. He can stand on his head with his hand on a Bible swearing he didn’t mean anything inappropriate and people won’t believe him.   The far more concerning issue is in fact people accusing him of criminal activity and saying he’s done the same things that put Kris Wu and Seungri in jail. Those are the things he’s rightfully concerned about and Abyss should absolutely take legal action against people falsely accusing him of those things.
Honestly, BB seems like is in a lose-lose situation. Releasing a statement weeks after the video dropped is a bad look. And even if he did release a statement, people are still gonna call him names and defame him.   Atleast the company can somewhat protect their artist by doing this blank threat. But I think this is gonna make it worse.  Should've just let it blow over since people are gonna forget in about a month.
Like zero accountability
I personally think if he didn’t have any malintent he doesn’t really need to apologize, but I see your point.  But the kind of defamation that both he and Abyss are ultimately concerned about is coming from the people going way overboard and saying he’s a sex offender etc. That’s far beyond the scope of sheer criticism and that’s the stuff that should be squashed.   You’re allowed to have a negative opinion of him because of this and I don’t think they have any legal grounds to sue anyone anyway over statements like “this made me uncomfortable and now I think poorly of said person as a result” but to say that and then go on to make Tiktoks or whatever with “evidence” that he’s basically Kris Wu is where the lawsuits come into play.
That’s not really what he said? And regardless, people are making up rumors that he’s done actual criminal activity, which is something that should be addressed. There’s an enormous gap between what you just said and the stuff that Abyss is actually concerned about dealing with.
Also, it's not even specifically about "ideal type" actually but more of a "huge fan of". It's why he brought up Winter and then Haerin earlier.   Then as the video went along it was pick Haerin or Nayeon (from *Transit Love*), he chose Haerin and even hesitated due to the possibility of being misinterpreted and due to her age. Exact line from him is this: it’s “risky” to mention liking her as a fan.  **BUT** he has already said that for "ideal types" he prefers short hair, and in the 3 names mentioned thus far only Winter would've met that. So, if he was actually picking his "ideal type" he wouldn't even consider Haerin because of the short hair preference, even if she's magically 24 years old right now.
It wasnt between haerin & Nayeon from twice it was a different Nayeon
There was backlash for mentioning nayeon?
He mentioned having a one sided crush on a mutual friend (Im Nayeon, who is older than him, and who he has known since he was around 13) to a friend (Jihyo) back when they were trainees, which ONCEs decided was creepy for some reason. Despite it being a childhood crush. He got so much hate from ONCEs that he apologized to Nayeon, to which she responded that there was no problem, and she thought it was funny. Don't act like he is out here causing a bunch of shit or has some history of being a creep. ONCEs caused that.
Yeah people equating him to the likes of seugri are blowing it out of proportions but before releasing a notice to sue for defamation, bambam could have released a statement with an apology to clear up the air. Something like how ravi apologized for his sexual lyrics towards red velvet
[removed]
Agreed. I was asking bcoz I don’t wanna be accidentally sued lmao😭
Yea that’s wrong. I don’t think I can support him anymore cause I truly believe what he said was wrong and creepy. It’s sad I used to really like him but comparing him to kris Wu and seungri is too much.
is this really just a “something people dislike” situation though or is it a little more serious than that?
Well.....that's a choice...     Thanks for answering!
I dont feel sorry for him at all. There are many ways to shut down an inappropriate question, and he chose to to act on them, so 👩‍💻
that’s a small majority that have been saying the extremes like that. Regardless of if people believed it or not an explanation would’ve went over a lot better than this
Ohh thanks. I thought the backlash had been mainly international
Ya. If that happened to me, I’d be like, “omg why is a minor even in here? I prefer people in my age group” and move on.  Like why would I choose them and then be like, “but he/she is a minor”.
He could’ve ,  but it seems like he thought clarifying he’s only a fan/picking as a fan would be enough to avoid misunderstanding. By the responses obviously not
He literally did. He said she’s too young and clarified that he was choosing from a fan’s perspective
I mean he did say it’s weird because she’s young but people took that to mean he’s a creep for pointing it out. It’s like people want to see what they want. It’s okay to not like the Convo around Haerin but it’s not okay to say he’s an actual predator. He has a right to defend himself.
I think she put haerin because he was saying how he was a fan before same with winter & Taeyeon. But obvs  games like this can cause misunderstanding
Yeah, he picked her when he could've picked the other person (who I'm assuming isn't 16) as his type by default. He could also have not chosen. That was also an option. There were no stakes to this.
when asked about his ideal type he couldve chosen anyone and yet he still chose winter and a minor.
I think by ‘ideal type’ they meant who do u fancy more.  But from his explanations to me, it seemed like he wasn’t always picking based on who is his actual ideal type despite that being the initial objective of the game.
Thank you :)
He literally also states he chooses haerin from because of the fandom
You guys are all coping. Before haerin is even mentioned as part of the challenge he says he’s a big fan of two people right now, winter and haerin and not to misunderstand.  The guest jokes what is there to misunderstand to which bambam says as a idol people are more harsh on him.
Someone could just post a screenshot of what HE SAID and his fans would be under the tweet tagging the company to sue them. Like... that's not how it works
He should speak out about the situation and offer clarification as well. but I’m saying I’ve seen worse on here and on Twitter. So just because you saw a few innocent tweets doesn’t mean that’s what the majority of them were or that there weren’t ones that were way out of line. In that case he has a right to feel that way about the trolls or more extreme people. It’s like two things can be right at once. He can need to clarify his statement but people saying he’s a predator/pedo can also be wrong. It’s like idols who mess up getting death threats. Yes you can say how they’re problematic for being colorist etc but death threats are a separate matter
Lmao. If only people cared about adults being inappropriate to minors as much as they did about said adults being called a predator by mostly children on twitter.
They're just a defensive got7 fan, they've admitted they don't see anything wrong with what Bambam said, and they replied agreeing to someone who said they were reporting the thread about Bambam on kpopthoughts to ABYSS (for defamation) and to reddit.
Having a thought in your head in and of itself is not "predatory behavior", it's not behavior by definition of the term behavior.  Since we are able to live in a society, it is expected that most people have thoughts, in fact many, many thoughts, that they will never act upon.  To me the biggest problem about this is that by stating her as his type, he encourages this type of discourse, especially because as an idol he's supposed to somewhat represent how men should act.
[removed]
Does no one on here actually watch the full video? And clearly no one speaks Korean. He said he was a fan of her.
The video is months old though and if he didn’t say anything inappropriate, then he shouldn’t have to clarify anything. And would trying to clarify it really help? People who think he’s some creep won’t believe him anyway and it’s probably better for him to ignore just the general criticism if he knows these commenters are off base. The criminal allegations are the far more serious thing to deal with.
Because calling someone a p*do, predator, r*pist is defamation
>the truth is damaging  The truth is that someone took a short clip completely out of context and spread it. Defamation lies in the attempt to ruin someone's reputation and it's obviously the case here.
And also this has no impact on foreigners who are posting online anyways.
For me, if I hurt somebody without meaning to, I apologize. Most people do. If I said something that came across as creepy, I would apologize and explain my intent. I think that's the bare minimum personally, and I don't see what's gained by not doing it, but of course it is okay that we see different on that end!  I haven't seen anybody saying that stuff but that's really gross that they are. It's a very clear minority in the situation so I guess I just don't see why they didn't sue without the generalized statement made- you don't need to make a statement to sue for defamation if you're being falsely accused of actual crimes. The statement itself just rubs me the wrong way because of just that- it's a small amount of people, and the nature of it is so vague that it makes a lot of fans have to silence themselves or be harassed. And fans don't have a company behind them to sue people when they're harassed.  Maybe because I also used to be a huge ahgase, I feel that Bambam is somebody who openly has known how fandom spaces are and has been in them, seen it all, etc. and he would had to have known how this would play out? If not it's an oversight. But the harassment I've seen for people just talking about it and being uncomfortable is more intense than for Bambam. People are being doxxed.
Don’t let them see you say this, you’ll be their next post.
Thanks for letting me know. Which Nayeon so I can edit?
Lol stop dragging Onces to his mess. There was definitely no intense backlash about his confession from the fandom. This current issue is him having questionable statement not related to Twice at all.
No one except for a few trolls had a problem the first time. It was that he kept bringing it up over and over that it got annoying. And every time he did so Korean sites put out articles about him "addressing dating rumors with Nayeon." And his fans kept saying nasty shit about her and even demanding she apologize even though she didn't do anything.
I wanted to respond to you but decided it wasn’t worth the energy as clearly you will hear what you want to no matter what someone actually said.    Have a blessed day.
Ravi’s lyrics were a LOT worse than this tho. Not even comparable imo
[removed]
They can’t sue you unless you’re in Korea, realistically.
Having followed Bam for a while, I can tell it was just panic and word vomit. But he dug the hole for himself, so yeah. Although, I don't think it's fair of people to actually accuse him of crimes and comparing him to criminals. There is a very thin line between what's appropriate and what's not in sensitive issues like this. And people have been crossing that line.
A small majority? It isn’t at all especially on twitter. Those tweets have likes in the thousands. So what? The company shouldn’t take legal action & just allow people to make serious accusations like that?
It is bc he and his company are very aware of what is said about him both in Korea and internationally. This video has been out for over a month and watched by almost half a million people and there has been no outrage from Koreans or Korean comments. Probably bc they actually understood what was being said.
Like if he was just some regular dude and made these comments and not an idol everyone defending him here would be calling him a creep. It’s okay to hold your faves accountable for things, you don’t have to immediately cancel them
I mean if that was his intention he could’ve done a *much* better job calling out how inappropriate the situation was
I watched it over and that’s what I got from the conversation as well but tbh common sense dictates that the correct answer would’ve been “she’s too young, let’s remove her from the list”.   I mean if someone showed me a picture between Niki and Jayb, mt automatic response would be “oh my god he’s a kid!”, not sure why so many men can’t do this.   But I also agree that calling him a r@pist and a predator is way too far.
Yes he said she’s young and acknowledged it might be “dangerous” but still went ahead and picked her anyway. you can spin it any way you want, it’s still irresponsible and dumb that he went along with it at all.
He said it was from a fan pov at the beginning when he brought her up but not with the “type” game. He should’ve said neither or just picked Nayeon, picking the 16 y/o girl was definitely the worst choice out of those 3 no matter how you try to frame it. & suing people for pointing out the weirdness of this is certainly an even worse choice
I honestly don't get this excuse, as a "fan's heart" type of thing doesn't ideal type usually mean someone you would be attracted to? It was literally the game and by most definitions the question was about who your type was, if he wanted to change the context as a whole he coulda just said shes too young exclude her or make it not an "ideal type" thing. Because what does only picking my ideal type as a fan even mean? I've honestly never heard ideal type played in that way, if it was like as a fan thing it would've been who's music/art do you prefer more  Saying it was just as a fan thing to me personally sounds like a lazy cop out excuse honestly, whether intentional or not it really was inappropriate honestly he even knew it was dangerous even if we have the context that he was gonna add on to his sentence before he got cut off, he clearly knew how it would be interpreted and if he wanted to really say it he would've still addressed it if he was so worried about being misinterpreted and considering his company is taking legal action for this, he clearly should've thought his words through lmao.
I never called him a predator, but the comment / conversation is weird regardless. He still went along with it and picked her (like what???) even after acknowledging how young she is, so it kinda invalidates the whole thing.   Even if he *didn’t* have any malicious intent (which I squint at considering he’s said controversial things in the past) he still has to be held accountable as it’s his show. He knows first hand how minors are sexualized in the kpop industry, and allowing this situation to happen at all is irresponsible. Haerin is the one who deserves to be protected and defended.
the other person was nayeon who is around his age
i don’t really understand why him picking winter is an issue? she’s a 22 year old woman and he is 25. obviously he is nasty for picking haerin, but winter is someone who is actually around his age
he wasn't asked about his ideal type first though, he was asked who he is a fan of recently. and then the ideal type convo came after that
yeah i’ve seen the entire video actually! he still says she is too young for him now so.
Exactly!! Literally there's a girl on twitter who did just that and she's been ratioed by his fans tagging the company, spreading her selfies and trying to find her legal name to send it with her pics, and called a nazi for it. He's trying to silence people and his fans are doing the work for him.  The harassment people are receiving for speaking about it is way worse than what is being said about him.
But was he actually inappropriate to a minor?   I think a lot of nuance is being lost in this very important conversation that we should be having.  I think it's fine, fair even, for him to be criticized for his comments however to say he's a predator and come to other conclusions is disappointing.
>I’m not saying it’s correct I’m saying don’t inflate issues because it minimizes the real thing   Adults making inappropriate comments about children and calling a child their ideal type is *the real thing*. Honestly, I think you are srsly downplaying the situation by caring so much about the language used by people on twitter, many of whom are children btw, when you could put that energy into caring more about the adult making inappropriate remarks about children.

He did say something inappropriate though…..& if he didn’t mean it that way (despite that being what he said) then he should at least clarify it if not apologize. & yes, believe it or not some fans will take a bare minimum even half ass apology as enough to continue to stan with a clear conscience. It would’ve retained some of his fans, but “we’re suing people” being the first & only thing said leaves a bad taste in people’s mouth
It’s not *completely* out of context though. The context of the game is him choosing between two women to be his “ideal type” and he chose a minor. regardless of how he tried to spin it, it’s weird that she was even included in that type of conversation at all- and that he went along with it in any way knowing she is underage and how it could come across.  This situation absolutely deserves criticism. The one we should be defending and protecting is the underaged girl irresponsibly thrown into this mess, not a grown ass man.
I’ve seen the full video and this so-called context changes nothing at all. People’s concerns are completely justified, and framing that concern as trying to pettily ruin someone’s reputation is not okay.      I’m not going to discuss this any further.
Exactly. I personally think he was in a bad situation and dug himself into a hole instead of looking for a way out, but that’s not the issue at hand. People are going around accusing him of violating underage girls; I would *hope* his company does something about that.
He said ideal type with a 'fans heart' meaning no dating or sexual stuff. Earlier on he said he viewed her as a sister. Gross stuff from commenters here, it's no wonder male idols are scared to interact with female idols.   I'm really concerned that people jumped to the worst possible thing and ignored the multiple clarifications Bambam had in the conversation to prevent what he said from being taken the wrong way. This is just as weird as Exo hating Chen for having a wife and kids. There is no scandal here just Kpop fans witchhunting.
I’m saying this from the perspective of his company. Bambam said numerous times he is speaking as a fan and nothing more. If you’re a company and people are making up videos etc. saying “here’s all the evidence that x person under my label is a violent criminal” it’s your job to put a stop to that. You can’t just sit back and allow people to say “your artist is the next Seungri.”  And what is Bam supposed to say? “I’m sorry my words were misconstrued because I never once meant anything remotely romantic or otherwise towards a teenager” isn’t going to sway anyone’s opinion who decided he’s some freak.
Never underestimate a kpoppers ability to defend their fave lmao. There are literal rapists and criminals (not at all comparing BB to them) that still have stans so nothing really surprises me
There’s unfortunately zero nuance when it comes to Kpop fans online. I think what you’ve said is completely valid and a very respectful critique of the situation! Fans going after people like you who are voicing discomfort is the wrong thing to do objectively. And doxxing is of course never ok.   But I do think a statement like this from Abyss is warranted considering there *are* people who are saying wholeheartedly he’s actually done criminal activity so this is a warning to cut it out before they actually come after you (obvs not you specifically).
People are making up Tiktoks and shit with “evidence” he’s secretly Kris Wu or Jeffery Epstein; all of that is what Abyss is concerned about.
It isn't.  Any court of law will tell you that sexual thoughts regarding minors isn't illegal until action is taken by the perpetrator regarding said thoughts.    BamBams behavior was icky.  Not illegal.
Lee Nayeon, a contestant on Transit Love (EXchange) Season 2. They used her picture & wrote it in the caption of the clip you linked
Honestly I think I’ve seen  her surname or where she’s from only once so I can’t remember but her picture is at 12:20 https://youtu.be/-jRjcgBjyKs maybe you’re able to identify her?
It’s kinda wild how most of the fandom was just like, “get in line bro!” or “he’s just like us fr” but people are choosing to fixate on like 5 trolls with barely any likes who got ratio-ed HARD.   Every #savenayeon tweet was about her fucking stalker too.

i never said they can’t take legal action…i believe a statement should’ve come out before threats to sue. They also never said that was the reason they plan to sue people, they could be willing to sue anyone saying anything. In korea talking about an issue even if it’s true can get you a defamation lawsuit because it brings negative light on the person.
then who is he gonna sue? aren't defamation laws different around the world? sure, you can sue hate comments in korea, but can he do that if said commenter was from the US?
Yeah I agree. I guess we are in a weird phase where society makes you feel like you have to cancel. And so people that don’t want so cancel feel like they have to 5749% defend.   Which means no lesson learned.   We can dislike something an idol did but not cancel them. Unless it’s really crazy where they deserve to be cancelled.   But bambam’s comment is so questionable. Like what did the entertainment company expect lol
bambam has been my ultimate bias since 2016 but yeah i can't defend this. it's disturbing
He does literally say “I’m only their fan don’t misunderstand” so I don’t think this is a matter of ‘if’
Exactly. People are doing backflips trying to absolve him of any fault
“doesn’t ideal type usually mean someone you would be attracted to?” if it does then Sana calling a literal baby her ideal type on a show should’ve gotten just as much attention from i-fans
And ofc his stupid fangirls are downvoting you Would y’all sell your little sister or daughters too just to defend your favourite male celebrity? If a random grown man said it about your sisters/friend/you, you think you would have this type of reaction too? You don’t know him, he doesn’t know you, you don’t get paid to defend him. Stop worshipping PEOPLE   He should have never picked a minor even if he was a fan of them. He’s a weirdo for it.
But she is also his friend so I feel like he was put in a hard position and not answering would have been the best movement tbh
i never said him picking winter was an issue, i just gave more info.
“im into them” “dont be harsh on him its ok for idols to like people” “seems like i like girls with bob hair” yea this really wasnt about him being physically attracted to them at alllll 👀
I saw a lot of threats about people getting extradited too 😭 Can you imagine the Korean government calling up the US Department of State and requesting a kpop stan be sent to Korea for some tweets?  It's a shame that the statement is riling up his fans so much that they're actively harassing people. Now they think they have the moral and legal grounds to do so (spoiler alert, they dont!)
>But was he actually inappropriate to a minor?   I should have said being inappropriate *about* a minor. This feels a bit pedantic.    >he's a predator   I'm not gonna call him a predator, but the comments he made are predatory.    >I think a lot of nuance is being lost in this very important conversation that we should be having.   When it comes to inappropriate comments about minors, in most cases it's a black and white issue and adding "nuance" in these conversations usually just means trying to defend the celebrity or downplay the celebrity's actions as being not *that* bad. What nuance do you think is lost?
[removed]
And that’s valid for you to feel that way. He clarified a number of times during the course of the video though that he was saying things only as a fan and in the grand scope of things, this incident isn’t actually catching a lot of attention outside of specific internet circles. Saying you’re suing people who are casually throwing out criminal allegations against your artist is a pretty appropriate response from the label’s perspective.
Thanks again.
“i believe a statement should’ve come out before threats to sue.“  You didn’t say that initially tho.  “ instead of releasing an apology or maybe an explanation of how this could’ve been misinterpreted they decided they’d just start suing people. ”   You even said “an explanation would’ve went over a lot better than this” which makes me think you’re saying the company shouldn’t take legal action at all. But it’s good you’re clarifying what you actually meant.  “ They also never said that was the reason they plan to sue people”  Malicious posts & abusive language. Calling him those things deffo falls under those categories.
No one, it’s just scare tactics. It would especially be laughable if he tried to go after someone in the US since defamation laws are weak here and the First Amendment definitely protects the people criticizing him, yes even if they accuse him of stuff he didn’t do.
100% agree. And like he should’ve at least issued an apology or explanation or *some* kind of acknowledgment before this announcement came out 💀 it makes everything look so much worse
>We can dislike something an idol did but not cancel them. Unless it’s really crazy where they deserve to be cancelled.    Or if you still wanna listen to the music, at least seperate the art from the artist. Don't go bending over backwards to defend someone just to ease the guilt of liking their art.
You can't cancel someone in any significant way let alone a celebrity. Morgan Wallen after getting caught calling a group of Black people the n-word career became even bigger right after the scandal. Cancel culture isn't real.
He also says it multiple times throughout the video.
I have a co worker who sent me a picture of the LSU player (Angel) winning photo with the caption “she’s so fine”, he’s 34 and she’s 20. My instant reaction was “bro she’s a kid, that’s inappropriate”. Now if I had that type of reaction over a 20 year old, I would be more feral if a MINOR was brought up.   I genuinely don’t think he meant in a romantic way but it’s hard for me to comprehend why men seem incapable of doing the BARE MINIMUM when it comes protecting minors from any unwanted conversations. I would never tolerate anyone to even bring up a kid into an adult conversation (pertaining to types whether physical or not) and neither would any woman in my life.   What I think he should’ve done is issued a clarification and apologized. People who choose to forgive him will and those who will continue to hate him/not care for him will; he can’t control that.   I’m not a fan of the twitter rhetoric comparing him to Seungri/Kris Wu, that’s way too far and I definitely don’t think he deserves being called a r@pist by 100s of people but he needs to actively take accountability for his words and actively show that what he said is completely UNACCEPTABLE.
this is crazy I thought people on r/kpop were better than to downvote you and the person you were replying to. it seems kpop twitter has taken over this place too I guess.
if I was him I'm definitely picking my friend over a literal kid but that's just me.
I'm not defending him, I'm trying to correct wrong info. bambam was asked about who he 입덕s meaning became a fan of which they translated as "into." im not happy with with the ideal type thing at all, either yes he is disgusting for liking haerin or he really didnt mean it that way and was extremely stupid for answering (extreme benefit of the doubt which I'm not advocating). just ignore me im nitpicking
Like I said a conversation should be had but it's not happening...he said she's an ideal type, not made sexual or derogatory comments about her or towards her...the problem is putting a black and white view on a situation that is not black and white.  It's not being pedantic to make a distinction between being inappropriate to or about something...even the definition of what is and what isn't appropriate is something worth talking about.

It’s not anywhere near on the same level as accusing him of actively causing harm to underage girls, which is why Abyss is suing people. And he was never “thirsting” over a 16 year old. He never talked about her appearance even.
ohh thanks
Yeah. Agree. No one should be defending bambam here.   But I guess my “crazy” example is like Kris Wu. Lmao. He deserves everything bad to come to him
Yeah that’s why I said “no lesson learned”.
This is all so very well put. I obviously don’t think he’s a predator (at least I *hope*) but these conversations are so dangerous and there should be no tolerance for them. He knows how the kpop industry sexualizes and objectifies minors (*especially* women) and considering how close he is to so many other female idols you’d think he’d have a little more integrity regarding the entire situation.   I do hope a more genuine apology is coming soon, not only to appease his fans, but because haerin herself deserves one.
>he said she's an ideal type, not made sexual or derogatory comments about her or towards her   That he named a 16 year old as his ideal type is bad enough. "It could have been worse. At least he didn't do X, Y or Z" is not making this a nuanced discussion, it's just derailling. It's being dismissive and setting the bar too low.   Can you imagine if I told someone about a guy who cat-called me, and their response was "he cat-called you, but it's not like he raped you or anything"   It's super dismissive, so can people please stop doing this when it comes to celebrities they like.    >It's not being pedantic to make a distinction between being inappropriate to or about something   Fair enough   >.even the definition of what is and what isn't appropriate is something worth talking about.   For most adults it shouldn't need pointing out that calling a 16 year old your ideal type is not appropriate.
Omg yeah. And Seungri
Haerin deserves an apology from her parents, from Min he yin, and from HYBE for exposing her to the public eye at such a young age. Things like this are what happen when you debut childs. They definitely asked for this to happen.
If he actually said anything remotely close to what you’re saying I would agree with you but he didn’t. And people aren’t “asking” if he would act on it. They’re saying he did in fact violate underage girls and saying it like it’s common knowledge. THIS is why Abyss is taking legal action. It’s not that hard to understand.
The kpop industry imo shouldn’t even allow minors to debut due the immense amount of physical and emotional stress from the microscope they’ll be put under, and the insane workload. Also having a platform is a big responsibility and kids sometimes don’t realize how influential that is.  But yes In a perfect world her parents would’ve been more protective of her, min he yin wouldn’t have been an absolute weirdo in giving a sexually suggestive song to minors on their debut, and men wouldn’t put minors in predatory situations
Oh wow, Nicole is busy busy! Hardly out of Mysterious promos and already preparing for a JP comeback. That's great! Can't wait to listen to it! Very beautiful and elegant in the photos! 😍
Has she debuted in Japan as a soloist before? I never heard of that.
Do we know when it releases ?
Nicole is so busy! I really hope she gets some recognition! Mysterious was so good and she killed her lives! I don't know why everyone is sleeping on her!
Her JP debut song was '[Something Special](https://youtu.be/-Wax11lTKvI)' in 2015 and her first jp album 'Bliss' in 2016.
May 10!
Beautiful smiling bunny 🐰 🩵
For a second, she looked like Momo to me lol
Oh they want for a slightly different look. Very intense and charming. 🩵 I like it when the girls can show their concept versatility. Wonder if and how it has to do with the album concept.
Love this 🥺
Me too I thought it’s Momo before reading the caption
E-chan is right about his "charismatic eyes" - having met him in person, he really does have that thousand-yard stare.
Actually pretty surprised to see Yoon being included as normal in this one. But judging from the hair, looks like they must have filmed this in January or February. Hope people gradually gets used to him being there.   Anw, glad to see Jonghyeong's character back for this. I've missed seeing him like this. Mingyu being a loud annoying old man full of puns is amazing and lol @ Giseok's nepo baby concept.
Oh wooow. Comeback is in the corner?

Easy SS501
I literally do not care how many times they post a performance vibes of this song, I will watch every single one 😭🥲 This song is just so good
Before anyone reports this for not being kpop, lol, this video is Baekho from NU’EST’s new series about his car! He grew up in a car-mechanic family before becoming an idol, and his younger brother is currently running the family car repair shop, so Baekho has always had a lot of interest in cars! This show happening was just a matter of time, he’s been bragging about this car before, haha
Short and cute. I'm glad that it has English titles.
Niki is wearing the Baby Cross Earrings Jimin had been wearing all throughout 2016 (and 2019) while nervously talking about Lie ... cute!
ohhh for some reason overload still feels so recent to me that I was taken aback a little djsdhsjdhsdjs
I will keep an eye on this release! One of their songs has been coming up a lot in my Spotify+recced playlists and I enjoy it, so I am very open to trying their music. I prefer to get into a latest release first, then go deep dive if I enjoy it.
COMEBACK YES LETS GOOO (i was lowkey hoping this would be a full album but i'll take it)
The boys are back in town
HYPE HYPE HYPE
did they draw themselves for the back of the photocard? They were doing  lots of drawings for stuff last comeback too... Woollim likes to get them to draw stuff.. lmao.
