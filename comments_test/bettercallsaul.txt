Even a minor-misdemeanor can get you disbarred. My laywer got a DUI and was forced to do public defender work for a while as part of a diversion work. Best free lawyer people ever got.
Looks like Walt jr
Post-9/11 Don Draper
thats so cursed…
cannot unseen anymore.
Oh my god 💀
He kinda looks like the dad from the original spy kids lol
💯
“Listen to your heart” is genuine, the “give Chuck my love” part is kinda fake. He is just telling Jimmy he likes Chuck more than Jimmy, as an insult. Howard is fake in many ways. When Kim confronts him after Chuck’s death: “did your share your theory (Chuck may have committed suicide) with Rebecca?” Was spot-on. There was no reason he couldn’t keep that to himself. His suicide theory was nothing more than an attempt to make Jimmy feel like shit. He sees Jimmy as a narcissist, and an ambulance chaser, while he himself is a “real” lawyer, dedicated to the law. Howard does see a competition between the brothers in Chuck as an aboveboard attorney who works tirelessly for clients and the firm, and Jimmy as a get-rich-quick con artist out to twist the law to get ahead. Jimmy lashing out at Chuck being made a chump is simply Jimmy wanting to degrade Howard because Jimmy wants Chuck to choose sides: his law partner or his own brother. Jimmy is jealous of the relationship between Chuck and Howard. Jimmy wants to portray Howard as an enemy, in the hopes that Chuck would distance himself from Howard and become closer to Jimmy
Only those with filthy minds.
No because that's his brother 💀
Chicanery
Memes and the fact that you can never stop interpreting and analyzing new things out of a deep story
It’s a good show.
If I had to guess I’d probably have to say it’s because I am not crazy! I know he swapped those numbers! I knew it was 1216. One after Magna Carta. As if I could ever make such a mistake. Never. Never! I just – I just couldn't prove it. He – he covered his tracks, he got that idiot at the copy shop to lie for him. You think this is something? You think this is bad? This? This chicanery? He's done worse. That billboard! Are you telling me that a man just happens to fall like that? No! He orchestrated it! Jimmy! He defecated through a sunroof! And I saved him! And I shouldn't have. I took him into my own firm! What was I thinking? He'll never change. He'll never change! Ever since he was 9, always the same! Couldn't keep his hands out of the cash drawer! But not our Jimmy! Couldn't be precious Jimmy! Stealing them blind! And he gets to be a lawyer!? What a sick joke! I should've stopped him when I had the chance! And you – you have to stop him! You-
Well, in my opinion...it's just a good show. I prefer Breaking Bad, but I still like most of BCS. Most TV shows these days are literally drenched in political propaganda, and it shows in the final product that there is an ulterior motive. There is none of that BS in either show. It's just  story. Anyway, some of us (at least me) it reflects a phase in our lives. Also, you miss stuff the first time you watch it because they made the characters so complex. I come and go from these because I don't think about BB 24/7. Every once in awhile there is a really good joke or video, etc. Long answer, sorry...but very specific.   **B,** ***R,*** ***^(A,)*** ***V, O - Vince!***
Because people who live lives of quiet desperation run to TV and movies and then attempt to commiserate with others about minutiae that no one outside their magical circle really cares about but appeals to others within as they simultaneously bail in the same leaky boat with the name It's Just A Fricking TV Show.  It's passed down from Neanderthals who grunted around a fire as a way to regale each other with boasts about the hunt.
Like that time Ted ran and slipped on his rug...what a buffoon.
This, the show is so rich and opens to so many different angles to see things that is actually interesting to see what other people got out of it and understand the different points of view. There are book clubs around the world discussing books that were written hundreds of years ago and people still find those discussions a learning experience, just saying.
Lol...I wrote this detailed long, heartfelt response. Then I scroll down and see what I should have written. Nice. Well said.
Wow, that's a really depressing, cynical way to look at it by generalizing everything into your perspective...or maybe it's just people wasting some time, enjoying themselves by communicating and sort of connecting. Great outlook on life.
Me too! I kept editing and rewriting, and explaining how it develops this theme and these ideas…
Or maybe not.
You are, yes.
Not even close other than they are both males humans

Don't.
I’m glad you got Ernesto on the 4th slide. Most underrated character by far.
Don't.
Ah yes, the famous BCS character Walter White (with like 1 appearance)
is there actually a breaking bad Lego set
Used midjourney to make these
😠
why is this downvote?
Hank most definitely: he might be loud and annoying at times, but has a good heart, he's supportive and cares about his family. Chuck on the other hand is bitter and jealous, has some severe mental issues he refused to address for years, he's the kind of person that makes everyone around him miserable, especially those who care about him and try to help.
Hank has an unending loyalty to his family and as such would never, ever make moves against me out of petty jealousy. So long as I don't start cooking meth Hank and I would be just fine. Chuck is the kind of person that destroys all of his relationships through pettiness and self-destruction.
I find Hank pretty annoying as company, but he would be an amazing person to be related to.  So helpful.  Look at the fact that he was willing to take in his wife’s niece and nephew, one of whom was an actual baby, when their parents were in crisis.  It would be worth having that annoying cowboy around the family cookout to be able to rely on him when necessary.
Depends on your personality.  If you are Walt, having Hank as a brother is a negative.  However, I bet Walt and Chuck get along better than Jimmy and Chuck.
Hank 100%. He might be a little annoying at times, but his intentions are all good.  Chuck on the other hand thinks his brother is an irredeemable low life, no matter how hard he tries. Not a good person to be around.
Chuck. As long as I didn't scam, I stood a good chance of inheriting some decent money after he set himself on fire.  With Hank I would be forced to drink his shitty craft beer all the time.
A better question would be is who is a better sibling. Marie or Chuck?
Elon Musk.
Hank is a cool guy, maybe he can come off as rude sometimes but he's definitely way better than chuck.
Hank 10000% it aint even close lol, Hank would probably be a fun brother, maybe can be a dick and be insulting but also supportive and endlessly loving. Chuck would probably judge me for every little thing i do and he'd always try to overshadow me. Chuck is envious and straight up devious. Hank is very far from perfect, but mostly had good intentions and would never in a million years block me out of my dream job or not tell me my dying moms last words.
The point you are missing is, even Hank would be Chuck if his brother is Jimmy.   To answer your question, I'm not slippin Jimmy, I didn't defecate through sunroof or steal from my parents, so I would have Chuck as my brother since he would have nothing against me. I think Chuck's jealousy is mainly incident to hatred and not otherwise. But Hank would have been a bully no matter what throwing snide remarks. Mind you, all that disrespect from him and others played a role in Walt's psyche and broke him morally.
I wonder about that. I imagine Walt and Chuck would respect each other's intellect and get along superficially. But Chuck seems like a guy who always puts others in their place. Pre-Heisenberg Walt would be resentful of Chuck's success, and Heisenberg Walt would subtly try to assert dominance over Chuck before giving up and just poisoning him with ricin.
Well I’m biased against Marie, I felt like she was careful but stuck her nose in everything. I would rather have Chuck as a better sibling because you could avoid him, Marie’s ass would just pop up knocking on the door until you answer
You really think Walt is the one who would kill his own family for a reason as silly as such?
Too real
Nacho Varga went out like a boss!
- 2003  This means that all the characters in BCS got to see the invasion of Iraq in real time.
Nacho deserved so much better! In the end he went out like a boss on his own terms, but he still deserved better!
OP thinks Better Call Saul aired 20 years ago, is he stupid?
And it’s also my birthday!  Edit: actually it’s one year before my birthday
>Nacho found out he belonged to Gus.  In light of recent revelations about Gus, that statement takes on a new meaning.
It really was all good man
Nicely done.
Feels like 20 years ago
They grow up fast 🥹
I love Beatles reference
Wow, it feels like it happened only a few years ago
Always bothered me the shows supposed to take place in 2003 and no one ever freaks out about terrorism or anything like that
Brilliant!
Did this show ever reference the Iraq War?
Hell yes, 2003. Can still remember that year (not American, btw, but it was also eventful elsewhere in the world). Long story short, my life trajectory went the opposite direction of Kim & Jimmy, the same year. Boring / unhappy life getting better and more interesting with each month. 2004 was even better and 2005 was turning point - for the best, unlike those two. It amuses me, the parallel.
Confusing
Gus would've fancied Nacho.
Running out of post ideas?
And Shrek
I mean, yeah? Did you think they were younger than 20?
Not chuck  Who, if he had died roughly 2 weeks prior to this scene, may have died on the day of the invasion.   Bravo vince
He didn’t.
OP thinks Nacho belonged to Gus, even though since 1863 it has been illegal to own people, is he stupid?
From my interactions with him, I can safely say he's something stupid.
Nice. April 7th will always be your birthday......and oh yeah,  happy birthday 🎂!
That was my 16th birthday!
That is nacho ass.  That ass belongs to me.
Recent revelations?
I know what you mean.  It feels like it was 2018, but obviously it was 2003.
Weird take.  I doubt the terrorists at the time were concerned about the happenings in Albuquerque, NM, which probably means the residents didn't have much to worry about either.
No, it didn't really get into things like that.  It was alluded that the character, Mike, might have been involved in the Vietnam War, but overall, it didn't have any kind of political or social undertones involved with current events of the era. There was actually a hustle on the show where they had someone pretend to be a war hero, but that's just so they could use an air force jet as a prop in a commercial.
Check the check's date
Absolutely not.  A year from today, this post will be 21 and of legal drinking age.  I plan to celebrate with champagne and reposting to honor the monumental occasion.
Just wondering when season 7 will drop tbh
TIL Shrek got to witness the invasion of Iraq
Unfortunately, Nacho and Lalo never got to see Shrek 2, while Howard could have possibly seen it.  Shrek 2's release in Mexico was June 16, 2004 (and July in Germany), and since the incident where Lalo was presumed dead was exactly a month before, unless he caught a showing when he returned to Albuquerque, Lalo would have never seen the much-beloved sequel to Shrek. Nacho never left Mexico or captivity, and would have never seen it either. It's likely Lalo was planning a nice outing with his new pal Nachito, where aside from having a man to work under him, he would have a new friend to enjoy Shrek's antics on a sunny June afternoon, but alas it would never come to play.  Howard possibly caught a screening after one of the tough days being scammed by Jimmy and Kim, maybe after being confronted by Cliff, and exhausted with his strained marriage, he caught a matinee showing of Shrek 2 at the local Regal, weeks later leaving this earth with thoughts of I Need a Hero in his mind.  Mike, satisfied with Lalo's apparent death, took Kaylee to see Shrek 2 on its US opening on May 19. It became his favourite film.
Clearly BCS is a highschool slice of life drama
Are you stupid? Chuck clearly was a force ghost that was spying on them from the painting in the conference room at HHM so he clearly watched the iraq invasion in real time.
I own people and it's 2023.  Checkmate libral
Actually most countries abolished slavery ages before then, and didn’t even need a civil war to do it.
Are you telling me Max was more than just a friend? Like a best friend?
The early 2000s were fucking crazy about terror though. It's funny cuz they actually reference Iraq and terrorism a few times in Breaking Bad, like people did in '08 and '09
Cheque the cheque's date
I feel like he's talking about the quotes, which if read together, seem pretty bi-polar
BCS spun off a different series, called *Breaking Bad*. The last season of BCS works in some scenes from the new series to make the transition more seamless, kind of like what *Buffy the Vampire Slayer* did with *Angel*. You're welcome. 🤣
I fucking love this sub
Are you stupid? Chuck's force ghost was clearly in Iraq with Kim and Dick Cheney prospecting oil rights- he was far too busy to be watching helicopters.
Gus don't own people  Nuh uh   I own people   With Gus (bang)
Well Gus and Nacho are both in the US
Cousin maybe?
I was afraid for a second that there'd be allegations against Giancarlo Esposito or something that I'd missed
I member.  Part of me wants to say it's a fictional TV show and not a documentary, but I could be wrong.
And check the cheque's date in the wrong date formula.
I mean how nacho found it and which episode is it?
[citation needed]
Me too !
Holy cr*p youre right! Cince has done it again! Brabo!!!!!!!!!!
Fuck I forgot [that video even existed](https://youtu.be/xC03hmS1Brk) thank you  Here’s a bonus if you [show me your genitals](https://youtu.be/qqXi8WmQ_WM)
Like a brother!
yeah, you wrong!
It's episode 4.2 "Breathe" ....... I'm not sure what you mean about Nacho though - how Nacho found what? The quote is from the end of the episode when Gus suffocates Arturo and then tells Nacho he knows that Nacho tried to kill Hector by switching his medication.
A *hermano* even
Ok thanks, I thought these facts were connected
The top pic is when Kim is about to enter Howard's office to get Jimmy's part of the estate, and Howard's assistant is jotting down Rebecca's name in her ledger and applies the date as well.  Kim's pic is the end of the conversation with Howard after she gets info about Jimmy's portion or the estate and discusses Howard's actions since Chuck's death.
Gus answers to Bolsa, not Eladio
Have some respect for Peter Schuler, man. 4.8M€ ! It's a miracle he hasn't been caught. Last year, the auditors came this close.
Gus reports to Bolsa, Eladio says this explicitly after Hector is disabled.
Walter needs to be slightly above Jesse
If you didn't want to repeat elements you could use carbon, oxygen or even cobalt for Tuco
It doesn’t seem right that Saul only has one branch, he’s reported to most people on that chart in some way or another
I think Bolsa should be between Gus and Eladio
Werner's too high
Gale is a freelancer?
It's WRONG.  You misunderstood how the network works.  Juan Bolsa is above the Salamancas in the hierarchy.  Gus Frings responds to Juan Bolsa who responds to Eladio.
It's hard to have BCS and BB characters together because the power dynamic changes at the end of BCS.   At the end of the BCS, Gus reports to Bolsa but controls everything north of the border except for the Salamanca territory in South Valley, New Mexico. Hector is basically stripped of all his former territory and authority is passed to Tuco. This would put Hector below Tuco and Tuco well below Gus in terms of cartel influence.
I like how walt and jesse rise up to the top just by everyone else at the top naturally eliminating each other and then walt jesse eliminating the bottom ones
They were 50/50 partners when gus was alive
I don't think Tuco is necessarily below Gus in terms of influence. The Twins are still shown to be very important in BB, to the point where their arrival in Albuquerque is a big deal. Bolsa drags Hector out and forces Gus to promise him Walter White's life. This suggests that the Salamanca organization still ranks above Gus. Bolsa and the Salamancas answer only to Eladio. Gus answers to Bolsa.  The only reason why they're so decrepit in BB (aside from Gus having a more advanced setup) is because Tuco lacks ambition and is content to get high in his shitty base of operations. He feels like a king and doesn't put in the effort.
Remember Marco's wallet with the $1500 in cash that the guy found in the alley and later swapped for the fake Rolex? I figure that cash was fake. They wouldn't likely risk losing a real $1500 dollars on the scam. If the copier could make fake $5 bills, it could make fake $100s at least well enough to pass a quick inspection in a dark alley.
That’s exactly what was being implied there.
Technically it was James McGill baking bread
Saul's better calling!
With Saul calling his better half, Kim.
At yeast Kim made it out ok
I expect we'll be seeing you live at the Apollo next.
Better call, Saul
Oh, the off season.  ...wait.
Gone (away)
Bonacinn
Saul Calling it his way.
Gene Takavic, technically.
It's all good man technically
Except she has a Floridian yeast infection
Bob Odenkirk, technically
Yup!
cinnamon roll, technically
Yup yup
I think he means the scene in the prison.
Stop after episode 9. The final 4 episodes take place after BB and El Camino.
>!Never really was a fan of Howard but GEEZ have I felt bad for him this season and that instant death had me on the floor!! Unbelievable!<
Here's what you should do at this point.   Watch THROUGH BCS season 6 episode 9 "Fun and Games"  Then Watch Breaking Bad  Then watch the final 4 episodes of BCS (610-613).   You can also watch El Camino anytime after Breaking Bad
When aired, season 1 didn’t do as good as the rest of the seasons. I can honestly say, that breaking bad is a show that just progressively gets better. You’ll become more intrigued as the plot thickens throughout the coming seasons.
What didn't you like about the first episodes of Season 1. I ask this because BB like BCS is a hell of a journey involving the main character.
Nope.
This is how I feel too.    Personally, I think it hits harder if you don't like him.
following this order thanks for the advice!
honestly might just be because 13 yr old me was trying way too hard to understand what the hell was going on lol, but now years later im a sucker for good tv and can somewhat understand what is going on, definitely giving it the chance it deserves!
You should watch El Camino right after Breaking Bad. Then, finish BCS for Nippy onwards.
Jimmy could have turned the copy shop guy's story inside out in a minute, and as for Ernesto, Chuck probably burned that bridge when he fired him.
I doubt it. They had Jimmy's taped confession. I'm sure they felt that had him dead to rights.
Evidently not because they weren't at a TV hearing that's made up fiction not fact.
In real life, maybe. Chuck seems the type that wants overkill for his case.
A bit alike, which is part of the reason Mike hates Walt.
Id say no because Mike was able to eventually say enough is enough and quit. Plus I do feel he succeeded in helping his family
Eh I think the difference being where they stood and their acceptance of it. Mike wasn’t as ambitious as Walter who always wanted more.  Mike was completely comfortable with where he was at he wanted the money first and foremost and didn’t have the ego Walter had.
I think there is a stark difference between Walt and Mike, in that I don't believe Mike has any illusions he is doing anything "good"  He understands he is a criminal, he understands what side of the law he is one, cause he's been on both, and he is making practical choices based off of the decisions he has previously made.  I would say in a certain sense, he is closer to Kim, who is willing to pay a penance for their sins.  You get the feeling that Mike ended up here, because Mike feels he deserves this.  Walt on the other hand is doing it for himself.  I don't even think he has bothered to consider the morality of what he is doing, and is simply intoxicated by the power trip he's been on.  Walt also has more of a limited time line, at least within his perception of the show, which changes his range of behaviors a lot.  He's simply willing to risk his life for more gains because he doesn't have much left to gamble with anyways.  Mike on the other hand is clearly torn between the life he wants and what he feels he's earned.  He's in way to deep to get out cleanly now, and I think it eats at him every time he realizes there is no reconciliation between his two lives.    Walt wanted to live one life, where he was the kingpin, but Mike is caught in between two incompatible lives.
Didn’t Mike do it for his family though? He was a shit person but he didn’t seem to enjoy doing it and had pretty much accepted by the end of BCS that he was a bad person.   With Walter it was pretty just ego after a while. He blew everything up so he could be top dog. Mike was there to make his money and give it to his family. Both bad people but differently motivated. Mike should have done a job that didn’t involve murdering people but I don’t think he did it for his ego.
Mike had no where near as big of an ego as Walt and it could be argued that Mike was actually just doing it for his family unlike Walt. Mike felt guilty abt his son dying on his wife and kid and felt it was his job to be next in line and try to take care of them.
Scapegoats for their own reasoning
Mike actually likes to be around his family. Recall the scene in season 6 where he's on the phone with Kaylee watching the stars pretending to be away for work but he's peering from the window. He's very upset because he can't be physically with them due to the Lalo situation. You never see Walt take time away from his meth business for meaningful family time. He only ever thinks about work and his family interactions are only ever a nuisance to him.
They both should have quit once Gus was killed
Mike was smart and careful. Walt was reckless smart/dumb and let his ego get to him.
Close parallels, yes.  Like many of the other main characters.  But I think Mike is worse.    Walt would prefer to operate his business in peace and quiet if that were possible.  But the plotline doesn't let him.   Circumstances beyond his control keep forcing him to play dirty (e.g., Gus decides to kill him, the Nazis come after them, or Jessie screws something simple up).  Mike doesn't need to do anything he does in the series.  His daughter is gainfully employed. He has one healthy granddaughter who generates no apparent financial needs other than a spare bedroom.  Mike could chip in what he can out of his cop pension and/or doing legitimate odd jobs.  He chooses to do dirty work because he is drawn to it.
Same in what way? They have similarities, sure.  Motivated to a life of crime to help their family.  "Playing the cards they're dealt" mentality.  Regret for a lot of their actions.  In over their heads.  Experts at their craft.  Seemingly good people who do some really horrible things.   &#x200B;  Mike seemed to hold on to his code a bit longer, tried to be a bit more moral on some occasions, drew lines for who was in the game and not, tried to get out and not totally ruled by pride/ego.
Mike is more like Walt than he wants to admit.  The line "we had something good going" I think refers to other things as much as the current situation with Walt.
Yeah except internet chooses to hate only Walt.
no fuck walter
It's an excuse to justify what they are doing.
Mike was a hypocrite. He was a murderer, drug distributor and a liar. But always behaved quite self rightest.  I understand that he is also a likeable character because of his no-bullshit attitude. But scenes like the one with naccios father show us  that that’s also just a coping mechanism of him.
Mike could have let Werner keep walking!!
Mike didn’t tear his family apart while trying to save up money for them like Walt did. Mike didn’t let his ego and pride consume him and his work. Mike stayed in that line of work because he felt like he was a lost cost. He didn’t think he could go back to a normal job or life after killing so much and witnessing so much violence through his line of work. Mike truly did it for his family. Walt started that way but completely spiraled out of control and lost his vision along the way. Mike stayed loyal to his goal and his family the whole time.   Edit: punctuation
bffr
Mike doesn’t have quite the same ego. He’s still an awful person for a lot of his actions, but there’s a few things that sets him apart. I don’t imagine him poisoning a child, sexually assaulting anyone, having a whole group of people brutally killed for his own benefit, or evilly manipulating a man to be his meth partner on the threat of turning him in.   It’s clear he’s out for himself, but there is a moral compass somewhere in there, albeit a little misaligned
That's a good point.  I never thought of it that way.
I don't think Mike hated Walt until he ran over the dealers to save Jesse, and even before it was a little indifference and irritation at worst. After definitely ramped up the hate for that reason, especially since he beat Mike and Gus at their own game multiple times.
So did Walt? He ended up retiring halfway through season 5.
His money was taken by dea. Those secret account numbers under kayle was found by dea. He didn't succeed it was all for nothing
It is kind of the opposite.  Mike did help his family while he was alive, but Kaylee never got the safe deposit box full of cash that Mike put aside for her.  The DEA took that, after taking the millions in the offshore bank account before that.   Walt was able to arrange for roughly $10 million of his drug money to go the Walt Jr, through Gretchen and Elliot.  Also, Walt quit more willingly than Mike.  After Skyler showed him the pile of cash and begged him to quit, Walt decided to he had made enough and to retire from the meth business, while he wasn't even on the DEA's radar.   When Mike arranged the buyout and got the $5 million, it was because the DEA was onto him and tailing him constantly, making him getting caught inevitable if he did not quit.
> he succeeded in helping his family  He succeded partially, just like Walt. Then all the money he left them got taken away, he abandoned his grandaughter alone in the park surrounded by cops, and their family will live the rest of their lifes knowing him as a criminal who dissapeared.   BB isn't the kind of show where people "succed" in helping their family by being criminals.
When did he quit?
>Mike was able to eventually say enough is enough  Mike had several opportunities to do that in Better Call Saul.
He didn’t help his family. Wasn’t like all the money he had saved to his family seized?
because Better Call Saul revealed that Mike's motive was getting revenge on and destroying the Mexican cartel by working with Gus
I was with you until you said Mike was like Kim,way off imo. I think he’s closer to Skyler and Hank than Kim. Kim did everything she did for Jimmy, she was never bad before or after dealing with Jimmy. Unlike Kim, Mike has hurt numerous people no matter what side of the law he was on.
He literally says in season 3 that he enjoys the work when taking the bugs out of Walt’s house
Walt didn’t have to do it either tho, he could just taken the job at GreyMatter with full health benefits and a sizable raise and could have continued living a clean life.
Mike was a criminal, but he wasn't an egotistical psychopath, who killed and manipulated people to get whatever he wanted. The only similarity is that Walt and Mike both got into the drug business to financially help their families.  Mike was a hired bodyguard with an internal sense of justice but a lot of inner-conflict. He worked for Gus to make sure that his own family would be financially secure since a single-mom nurse and a dead dad (which he admitted was his fault) would not be good enough for his granddaughter. When Gus was killed, he continued operations to make sure that his loyal men & their families got paid, and took the chance as soon as he could to get bought out from the business.  What was Walter's conflict? How to build a drug empire? How to kill (including Mike's men...) and manipulate people who would have exposed his lies or sent him to jail? Walter denied being bought out when he had the chance, multiple times. He risked his family's life for his own success and vanity. He is straight-up the villain in the show.
I always laugh when I see “Mike deserved better, only good character in BB”, like he wasn’t an enforcer to a drug kingpin who had no problems killing innocent people and children
Mike and Jessie are silly little goof balls
Also Jessie, Jessie had many opportunities to quit working with walt but he didn't
Mike's family is absolutely destroyed by the end. He had to abandon Kaylee at the park and disappeared off the face of the planet, never giving her closure about what happened. And unlike Walt, he never actually managed to get the money to his family, leaving them to struggle alone.
Only after he actually realised he couldn't physically launder even half of that money lmao. Mike was sensible, 5-10 million was probably a good limit.
He actually did a lot for them in BCS. He bought them a house and a dog for example
When he retired to the lake I guess
He was trying to until Walter shot him.
Mike quit after he arranged the deal to sell the methylamine to Declan, which Walt renegotiated into a partnership between him and Declan, and Mike received the $5 million.  But, shortly after that, the DEA caught his lawyer Dan Wachsberger, putting Mike cash into safe deposit boxes for the hazard pay for his guys from the Fring operation and for Kaylee and then Walt killed him while delivering his go bag full of cash.
>she was never bad before or after dealing with Jimmy  Untrue.  It was kinda the point of the earring scene with her and her mom.  She picked up those traits in childhood and was/is attracted to them in Jimmy.  It's very evident, from the very first time Kim is shown on screen that she wears a mask to work, but she conceals the "real" her.  What Kim is, is risk averse.  All of her moments of "goodness" you described are actually her risk/damage assessment of a situation.  She doesn't not do the bad thing because she doesn't want to, she doesn't want to pay the price if it doesn't work out.  Generally when Jimmy brings up a scheme, her reaction isn't this is bad, it's this is what will happen if you get caught.  In any case, the comparison is about them paying penance for their sins.  They way they are alike is they both chose to live a certain way as a reaction to the horrible thing they did.  In this regard, it isn't like Skylar or Hank at all.
I'm not sure Mike was really doing it all for his family, any more than Walt was.  But, I took the comment about enjoying his work as Mike being snarky in response to Walt's insult, as opposed to a true admission that he enjoyed the work.  I think Mike enjoyed the strategy and logistics of his job with Fring and didn't have a big problem killing other bad guys.  Like Walt, I think Mike got a certain satisfaction out of doing something he was very good at.     But, I think Mike stayed in the game largely because he was trapped in it.
I was going to say the same!!
That is true.  Walt was motivated more by pride than Mike, though I do think Mike felt some pride in being a really smart and effective criminal.
Walt was definitely more greedy than Mike but you don't need 5 million dollars for one kid. I'd say they both quit far too late and ended up hurting their family.
But, Walt walked away when he was still not even on the DEA's radar and could have made far more.    Mike walked away (though he was killed shortly after) because the DEA was all over him and would have caught him engaging in drug trafficking.     That said, Walt was definitely far more greedy.
Doesn't he just give her enough money to move to a better neighbourhood rather than to buy the house? Unless it happens later and I forgot, but in S2 when he gives her money when she's paranoid about the "shootings" it can't be more than 25k because that's how much he gets for getting Tuco arrested. He obviously gets money laundered by Gus later but do we find out if he gives any of that to Stacey?
That was a hallucination ig?
Even then she never wanted to do it, she did it because it made her mom engage with her.   I also wouldn’t compare Mike to Skyler or Hank but I think any other character is better comparison to Mike than Kim is. She was always trying to be straight, the only people that could change that as far as we know were Jimmy and her mom. Mike on the other hand never had to involve himself in anything, he never had to be a dirty cop (Matt wasn’t and died anyway) and he never had to go into the drug trade because he could’ve just stayed as a parking attendant. No one ever compelled Mike to be Mike, but everyone around Kim compelled her to be what she ultimately ran away from.
Or that Mike actually enjoyed being a fixer for Jimmy, in that it was typically non-violent detective and infiltrator work which he liked  &#x200B;  But did not like working for Gus
It wasn’t because he was trapped. It was because he had nothing else to do with his life. After Werner dies he just drinks himself silly and gets into fights with random people. That was the point of dedicado a max, to show that Mike really had nothing to live for and his choices were either slow burn suicide or work for a drug kingpin.
At that point, the DEA was the least of Walt's worries. His entire life had completely fallen apart. His kids weren't even living there. He had reasons to stop, too.
Saul and Mike were both in this movie, was pretty cool to see Saul basically play himself though
White people lame no dance good either
Not toll free - that's a nice touch
What about a Best Quality Vacuum card? In case you need a new dust filter for your Hoover MaxExtract Pressure Pro model 60?
One for me plz
Works on contingency?  No!  Money down.
Beat me to it lol
That's the biggest crime.
Not dramatic but Nacho and Lalo sitting down over tacos and beer to talk about Crazy 8. Lalo staring at Nacho for a second too long then saying, “Nah I got something better in mind for him.”
My favorite is when he and nacho are talking in the garage to Jimmy to get him to give the info to crazy 8. I also like the weird sounds he makes sometimes like when Jimmy said he wouldn't have time to help in the future and Lalo just says aaaaaaa you'll make time and drives off.
Two words: Werrrrrrrner Zeeeiiiiiiiigler.
Well, it might be a popular opinion, but I love Lalo’s visit to Kim and Jimmy’s apartment in S5E9.  What a scene.  What an episode.  I love his first scene, too, when he meets Nacho.  “It’s gonna be like I’m not even here.”  Lalo was great in every scene, so it’s hard to pick.
I liked when he murdered howard
"Just Make Money"
Okay..show me! Nah but in all seriousness the scene where Lalo keeps interrogating Jimmy and Kim steps in to save Jimmy. Shows you how quickly he can go from charming to straight menacing in a matter of seconds.
That moment when the sound of his feet walking on gravel turns into thunder.
The time when he almost clapped mrs.ziegler.
Open-world GTA style game where you play as Mike doing jobs for ABQ criminals
Press x repeatedly in order to convince judge to acquit
Press R1 to shoot lightning bolts from your fingertips.
Would have happened in the 2000’s.
Press Circle to say “Abogado!” on demand.
I would like to see a courtroom game, similar in some ways to the Ace Attorney series, but more along the line that you can choose how you handle a case - whether you play it clean or play it dirty. A game where you can maybe pay off or intimidate witnesses and jurors, or bargain a plea deal with the DA, or try to discredit or tamper with evidence, things like that. It could be very compelling, but I imagine it would be hard to write a game like that, considering you would need very good dialogue to write good court room drama, but also be willing to accommodate multiple branching paths for different decisions made by the player. Might be too difficult to make but I’d play the hell out of it.
“Petty with a prior”
"Kim's inviting you to have coffee in her house press x to accept"
Think it’d be disappointing because a video game won’t be able to capture the awesomeness of the directing and cinematography
Mini games include cleaning the fryer at each Los Pollos Hermanos location. Get it done in less than 8 hours in-game for the gold trophy "It Is...Acceptable".   The hardest mission is grocery shopping for Chuck. You gotta drive the Suzuki Esteem all around Albuquerque finding his freakin' newspaper and apples and other stuff. Gotta dodge the skater twins trying to scam ya and the teenage thugs that wanna steal your burner phone money. Better hope the car doesn't break down 'cause you gotta get to the hotel to steal the ice before it's all gone!  If you don't complete the tasks before sunrise Chuck will berate you.   My favorite chill mini game is doing crossword puzzles at the court house parking booth.
A Telltale style game could work
Huell slipping Chuck the battery becomes a QTE
it's a shame that Telltale games isn't around anymore, because they could make a solid game based in the breaking bad universe I think
Because video games based on TV shows have famously been amazing?
It would be a good immersive sim you can play as multiple characters different gameplay styles like a build engine game or early 2000s Deus ex
If they were to make this, it would need to be new territory. A faithful adaptation BB or BCS would make a shitty game, but I’m sure there’s some new territory. Possibly a Gus prequel, or something post BB.   Or of course a Lyle game
This wouldn't be a good game
I would buy this! 😄
The that’d be amazing af
Honestly a ace attorney game but with the flip of being a criminal lawyer instead of a good lawyer could be interesting.  The funny thing is I would almost want it made by a Japanese company because they can make some weird genres I would never play fun.
He already has a game, it's called inFamous
This could be a great interactive story game. Obviously it would need ‘new’ story and not coincide directly with the narrative of the TV series. It could have hilarious Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney elements in the courtroom where Jimmy pulls antics to get clients off who should never have been given a break. Gameplay could change depending on the story segment— maybe a reimagined version of the trip through the desert w Mike in ‘Bagman’ where it turns into a survival game. Maybe even gameplay as Lalo and other characters. Some people saying this has no potential as a game, but it has so much.
Me: (Playing as Lalo)  *Press X to jump*
It's called GTA V
it would sell faster than Jimmy's  free phones
I would play this game. I bet u could do a lots things involving a sunroof.
How is he gonna call himself? What a stupid cover.
So sick. U could just press A to go thru the entire movie. Insane.
Doubt
I’d rather have the Gameboy version
would be pretty fucking boring
Some shit game🤣🤣🤣
remember sopranos?
Imagine the chicanery!
“Go to the Taco Cabeza just around the corner”
Jokes aside I think a telltale styled game in the BB/BCS universe would be really cool
The only way I could see it working is as a fighting game with BB/BCS characters
It's a yakuza-style free roam beat em up. You get to witness jimmy smashing howard's head in with a flying wall kick
i hated the court trial mini games, i just wanted to get through the main story missions 🙄🙄
What about Xbox users?
If they did this like L.A. Noir or Detroit: Become Human, it could have a chance at being good, new, and interesting, but it might need the talent of someone who comes up with innovative ways of making games, like a Hideo Kojima or Quantic Dream.    I think some people believe that all success games are just Call of Duty, Minecraft, and GTA. Plenty of successful, high-quality games focus on linear storytelling, character development, and world building.
A Telltale game would be fun.
You can choose to play as Jimmy or Kim.  Imagine boss battles with Tuco, Chuck, Howard, and Lalo 😂 and of course different judges. Each enemy has their own personality and special attacks and shit.
I can’t… the ps5 has no games
But you'll gave to pay DLC for the Gene Takovic levels, though.
YES PLEASE!!
Hi Francisca I am comming.
i literally had a dream i found Breaking Bad the PS2 game in a pawn shop last night
The dialogue choices type of game for this can be good too! And lead different ways of endings
I would want to be lalo Salamanca so bad
So a detroit become human type game where you collect evidence as saul and lawer people?
☑️Convince Ernesto to commit fraud
Press x to aim the car for Chicago Sun roof
There's a really good [Breaking Bad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foOaLzx2qSc) game by Xploshi entertainment. Would love to see them do a Better Caul Saul game
Imagine that halfway through the game, there is a long and tedious mission where, as Chuck, you have to smash up your house to look for wires to remove. And then the mission ends with:  - Press R2 to Kick the Table
Press x to kill lalo Salamanca
Boring af
Press R2 to shoot lightning bolts from fingertips.
Imagine the dancing mission from San Andreas but instead you’re controlling Danny when they make the squat cobbler video
Danganronpa: I have the better trial in any video game  Phoenix Wright: No, i have!  BCS The Videogame: Kids, kids, both of you are just a petty with a prior
Time for a remaster of a classic:   https://youtu.be/ZbjURepoeJ8  There's also this overlooked masterpiece:   https://youtu.be/MuKUKZKpgVo
***OOPS*** *all cutscenes!!*
Best part is we can have different endings...and post credits scene #BetterFuelHuell
A Telltale game.
Objection!!!
Can't wait to play the Nacho DLC missions
I would buy 1216 copies of this.
Or like Disco Elysium style game. I think this type of style will work well with something story driven with the player needing to make a lot of moral decisions.
And is canon and expands the lore.
“Fingerin ABQ”
If Rockstar weren’t a GTA and RDR machine these days I think they’d have been capable of making a really good BrBa/BCS game adaptation.
This sounds fantastic.
It should have multiple characters like GTA V, Mike being one, with Huell and Badger as the other characters.
Rage acquit lol
Petty with a prior
Hold RT to turbo toss the bowling ball at Howard’s car
You start as slippin jimmy. But as you level up you become a god in human clothing.
Such a weird time when everything was getting licensed. Nowadays anything remotely close to requiring film or tv rights is pretty much dead in the water.
In the 2000’s you’d get a GTA knock off that’s way better than it should be where Mike lives and comes back to ABQ to take down Walt. I’m the 2010’s you’d get a mediocre Telltale game where Badger and Skinny Pete are the only two consistent characters and Walt shows up at the end.
It would’ve been a Wii game with simplistic gameplay and bad graphics, and have been like 4 hours long.
Nice. That’s the dodge mechanism
You mean "avocado"
Would be a neat idea in general to make a game like this. But you are correct, would be a conceptual nightmare having to keep track of all the branching pathways after a point.   The YouTuber Ross Scott who does Freeman’s Mind has done some good commentary on his game review series - Ross’s Game Dungeon - about the feasibility of doing a game that is truly choice-driven, arguing that popular examples like Mass Effect or any of David Cage’s games (Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy, Heavy Rain, Beyond: Two Souls, Detroit) are mainly linear and give the illusion of player choice over the narrative by giving you the option to choose things that turn out later to be superficial to the overall plot. He mentions this issue in his recent review of Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy, which I’ll leave a link below.   [https://youtu.be/iSw-4YjiiJU](https://youtu.be/iSw-4YjiiJU)
Bill Oakley boss fight
X button absolutely demolished
*Red Dead Redemption 2 has entered the chat*
The middle part sounds like a Simpsons Hit n Run mission or something lol
That and the Nacho pill swap in Hector's coat.   OH NO. HECTOR NOTICED!. WASTED! ...end screen .scene of bloody glass in the desert.
It be cool if you made a choice as Saul that ends up preventing Breaking Bad from happening, like thinking about Howard’s job offer
This could be one time it worked well.  Sony knows a thing or two about making good games. And I think the creative staff would come up with a satisfying story. And I feel like everyone involved would wanna take the time to do it right rather than rush it out for some arbitrary date like season 6's debut or finale.
I actually think GTA V might be the perfect template. Big open world map of Albuquerque with nice big desert to the south (for a Bagman type mission) and a border crossing into cartel land in Mexico. Switching between playable characters. Gotta have Jimmy, Mike, Kim, and Nacho I think. Lots of side missions to interact with our favorite side characters. Plenty of easter eggs. And they can add things the show never got around too like the Sandia Mountains and the Balloon Fiesta.  Just imagine the twins ominously walking through all those colorful balloons surrounded by happy people 🤣
Oh damn I didn't know you played as a bus bench lawyer in GTA V.
Playstation has a lot of 🔥 exclusives, sorry XBOX players. 😜
*Chuck flies up into the air, lightning bolts shooting out of his eyes*  You reallyyyyy underestimated my power level, Jimmy.
Press and Hold R2 to push. Use L3 to aim.
With all due respect you are muddying the waters
That is just crazy.
I bought all 1261 available, sorry
What a sick joke
Failed, try again
LB to perform the Chicago sunroof.
L3 to travel in worlds you can't even imagine.
It certainly was wild. Sure, most of the games were  half-assed money grabs, but we got a few gems out of it.
In the 2020’s you’ll get a game where you can customize your character, 2/3 of the game is cutscenes and the multiplayer mode is unfinished and laggy
That’s during the levels where you play as Lalo.
Not now, Foggy.
He’s going to Oakley all over everyone.
So when you get around to the Breaking Bad episodes you're not allowed to play it because of previous choices you made
I love better call Saul and PlayStation but this just sounds like a boring game.
> rather than rush it out for some arbitrary date like season 6's debut or finale.  What? They didn't rush anything with season 6. And they weren't "arbitrary dates". It was to qualify for separate award seasons, which is very important for the network.
Lalo has a bigger part in this story at least
I've been PS my whole life but got an xbox series x for Xmas from my partner.  I feel dirty.  I'll miss uncharted the most.  😪
😆
I AM NOT CRAZY!
I KNOW HE SWAPPED THOSE NUMBERS
Imagine Scarface from PS2 but if it was inspired by Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul 😳
Some were phenomenal like The Godfather and Scarface, and then there was The Godfather II (wrongly judged and I think is pretty fun and been meaning to replay), but also Sopranos Road to Respect. What a fever trip that is thinking back on that one, mainly since it did and didn’t fit continuity and giving us some more Big Pussy commentary and moments.
> but we got a few gems out of it.   *Simpson’s Hit and Run*
What I meant was the creative staff wouldn't wanna rush a game just to coincide with season 6 or whatever. If they did a game I think they'd wanna "do it right".
Lalo is an antagonist. I'm picturing a few stealth missions of Mike evading him.
$80 preorder edition with a kickstart on your drugs/money/mansion in game, sure I’ll pay above the regular price of the game.
That Scarface game was absolutely stunning 🤩
It’s a shame, too, because The Soprano’s game had great voice acting from the cast.
I unironically loved that game.
It's amazing lmao
This is awesome!
Make a Finger one that smells like pimentos
Well now we all want one
That is really cool!!
I need one for iPhone 13!
But you'll damage it when you have to break your phone in half.
HOW
Swweet
If you make s22 I'd buy one.
I want a Namaste one!! 🥰🥰🥰
How do people react to it? If I saw someone with such a case it would be impossible for me not to approach them.
GOATED
So cool
It goes insanely hard. Would go well with your yellow hummer
How much was it?
How they hell did u do that
TAKE MY MONEY!
Take my moneeeey
Photoshop
Can you help me make one of these?? I don’t know how to use Marrple! D:
Awesome!
Thanks :)
Thank you! I was worried about the picture quality but it came out better than I expected :D
You’re done.
If I was rich I would make a bunch and give them out :0
[Would look cool](https://i.imgur.com/kIbgq8o.png) also! I had it made on a Korean site called Marpple but I bet there's custom prints available wherever u live
(⁠｡⁠•̀⁠ᴗ⁠-⁠)⁠✧
Would u buy a [picture](https://i.imgur.com/qZeN0Ni.png) of one tho?
In my country BCS is not as mainstream (?) so barely anyone knows about it when I bring it up in convos. I always leave my phone case side up in case somebody notices :')
You need a new motto. Just. Make. Money
That's sick but no I'm not messing with no nft situation
LOL...that's a good one. Thanks for the reply...and a Happy Easter!
Fair enough, NFTs are a scam
Is boring nonsense
You're not a real professor!
I have heard nothing about ratings, but I got two episodes into it and it just didn't hook me. I might give it a chance once the full season is released and available, but I think the damage will be done by then. and it's highly unlikely to continue for a second season. It's got serious Low Winter Sun dead on arrival vibes for me right now.
This show is gold for anyone that’s worked in higher education.
Appears that there might be a level of tint on the windows that is not legal on an Illinois-licensed vehicle?
nice... I like it!
Nacho’s death wrecked me.
Kim’s breakdown on the bus.
"I made him lesser... I made him like me.  And the bastards killed him anyway."
Jimmy saying "I thought you were proud of me."
saul bullying irene and her crying and running out of the room when no one applauds her for winning bingo :(((
When i realized nacho is the longest guy in the show, he seemed not even have someone to talk with, not a real friend or a girlfriend ，he is always and forever by himself
I didnt cry a single time in BCS but the only time i came THIS close to crying is the death of Werner Ziegler. not just how tragic his death is but how you can obviously see the regret in Mike's face and he actually sob a bit before shoot Werner. That moment is when i decided that Mike is one of my favorite characters in fiction.  Saul gone ending also almost did it but not quite.
Yea Mike's death in BB wasn't anything at the time.
THEY BROKE MY BOY
Wouldn't necessarily say it made me cry, but I find Jimmy and Kim's break-up scene absolutely devastating.
Did you watch BCS before BB? What was it like? Any cool moments unique to watching in that order?
Fun and Games ending
When Jimmy tells the judge about getting his brother's lawyer's insurance revoked. Bill Oakley just looks at him and says that wasn't even a crime. When Jimmy replies with "But it was." This is the best line in either show and makes me cry just thinking about it.
Seeing Walt in the shower. Guy’s got an ass like an onion, makes me wanna cry
For me it was in Lantern during Chuck's final psychotic break where he's tearing his house down.
The finger guns at the end will always destroy me
*”We always end up having the same conversation”* was the moment I realised there wasn’t much time left with these characters, and I broke.
Waterworks. </3
Howard being buried in the ground under a meth lab he didn’t even know existed next to his own killer broke me. The whole thing with Howard’s death broke me tbh The lead up, the aftermath, the funeral…
It didn’t made me cry but these scenes were very sad.  - Saul manipulating Irene’s friends into disowning her.  - Werner’s death.  - Mike’s “ I Broke My Boy” story.  - everything that happens to Howard right before his death.  - Kim’s breakdown in the bus.  - Papa Varga finding out about Nacho’s death.
I can't watch the divorce papers scene. The way Jimmy flippantly says, 'Have a nice life Kim' like he no longer gives af about her kills me. He is so devastated.
When Ernie was fired from HHM.
Winner takes it all really did it for me I don't know why. I sobbed like a baby
Irene crying at Bingo
The winner takes it all... the looser has to fall.
I don’t think I cried in any part of either show, but Andrea’s death is a scene that’s still really hard to watch. Jesse screaming and crying like a rabid dog in the car being forced to watch. It’s something I still look away from lol
Oddly, Skyler and Walt's last scene. I actually teared up a little. They both were bad people and deserved what happened to them, but you could tell they still had love for each other.  Skyler letting Walt see his daughter for the last time probably did it for me.  Also Skyler's sad look on her face when Walt finally admits to why he did.
Howie getting his brain exploded
season 5 episode 8, jimmy’s “worlds second best lawyer. again.” cup got shot.
Jimmy's speech about Chuck in “Winner” (S4E10).
I never cry to stories I can't relate to. But felt very bad for Nacho's dad
Ngl the way he went out soldified him as my favorite new better call saul character liked him better then jim and lalo
Same
same, i felt that
“I was proud!”
Hardest scene in the show to watch. Hell I’ve seen so many brutal violent scenes in shows like both BB/BCS, Thrones, The Boys, TWD, and much more. But seeing a sweet innocent old women cry bc she’s getting ostracized is horrible
Do you mean loneliest? Or do you know something?
I thought Gus was gonna die at the laundry mat. And I expected Mike to have a happy ending . But I watched it in the order of BCS, BB, el Camino, el caGeneo (last 4 episodes of BCS)
That surprised me. He definitely didn’t deserve to die.
"Back when you worked in the mailroom I was very proud"
Yes, sorry the typo
They cast him as Scorpion in the MCU for a reason
"So that's it then, right? Keep ol' Jimmy down in the mailroom because- cause he's not good enough to be a lawyer."
And as well as having no friends or girlfriend, he’s alienated from his dad.
*well... we're waiting* gif
Yes he absolutely love his dad but they don't seemed too close and he literally can't talk about his stress and pain with his dad  , that's why i thought it is sad
It's because of his massive dick.
Hot hot HOT
They didn't get updated driver's  licenses. They had to show their driver's licenses to get a marriage license. Jimmy most likely lied about his height years before.
Jesses height is coined at 5’11 in BB when in reality he’s around 5’8. It’s just actors inflate their height
The answer is in his “bad choice road” speech and Five-O. Pretending he cannot escape the criminal world is how he copes with the fact that he got Matty killed by being a part of it.
He was always dirty. He was dirty as a cop and he tried to clean up, but in the end there's just some stains that don't come out.
>And he could make a decent amount of money as a legitimate professional either as a P.I. or a security consultant.  He could have done alright working in a legitimate profession. But not $2 million cash in a safety deposit box kind of money like he tried to leave Kaylee.
Initially it was because everyone else was dirty, but after what they did to his son, he was just completely done with cop hypocrisy and decided to turn to the dark side 100%
Because he was too ungrateful to work a normal job and give what little he had to his family. He had his chance to start again, but ultimately, an honest wage wasn't enough for him. So he got in bed with murderers and drug pushers    He justified what he was doing by giving his wealth to his granddaughter, but she didn't need the abundance of wealth he accumulated. He tried to police what he was doing with a moral philosophy, but this philosophy falls apart at even the most basic interrogation.
Because he used to be one, and he seemed to enjoy it and the stakes that came with it. Obviously he wanted that sweet money for his family too
he was always a broken boy
1. When Jimmy realizes they could have taken the million from the kettlemans but didn’t, Mike realizes he should have taken it too. Then he robs  one of Hector’s trucks.  2. Like everyone else in the show, he’s often faced with two choices: a bad choice, or a worse one. That’s the essence of film noir.   3. The Mike we see in Breaking Bad is *already* more corrupt than Saul or Walt. Mike has essentially become hired muscle for Gus, and knows police procedure well enough to cover up their crimes. Werner foreshadows what happens with Gale: a talented man who has a fragile constitution, and ultimately can’t survive in “the game.”  4. Everyone in the universe gradually becomes more like the villain. Kim becomes like Saul. Jimmy becomes like Howard and Chuck. Walt becomes like Gus. **And Mike becomes like the corrupt cops who killed his son.**  The sole exception to this descent into corruption is Jesse. This is why El Camino is truly underrated. It’s a fantastic film that wraps up the universe brilliantly. Jesse faces two choices: a bad one or a worse one, and he chooses the good choice, but has to deal with the consequences, something everyone in the show was attempting to avoid.
To paraphrase Papa Varga, he's no better than Gus or the Salamancas. Mike willingly chose to work for a man who threatened another with his family.  It's also likely that it's all he knew at that point. While he did do it for his granddaughter, part of him probably did enjoy what he did or justified it as doing it all for family. He was all in favor of getting Jesse killed in Breaking Bad until Gus told him to work with him.
It was written into the script
"Every cop is a criminal."
Greed. And btw I think Walt's is both ego and adrenaline rush. But for Jimmy, it's just his nature.
Try to live with a policeman pension+parking lot attendant salary, you will find the answer.
To support his daughter in law and granddaughter. They were struggling for money after his sons death and he felt responsible.
[Spoilers for BCS + Breaking Bad]  This question is perfectly timed with my rewatch of Better Call Saul.     After it is revealed that Matty was murdered by his partner for hesitating to take the "taste" money, he has a conversation with Stacey about her money struggles in regards to Kaylee and their future. He gived her his approval to use the cash Matty had stashed away, and she is momentarily super relieved. But then she starts  talking about future money concerns, and you can see an entire unspoken conversation between Mike and Stacey in that scene.     It's really a testament to Jonathan Banks as an actor, because you can see the gears turning in his head, and i believe that moment is the turning point for his entire arc. Others in this thread have mentioned that he was already dirty as a cop, and i'm sure Mike's guilt over his son's death had a large part to play in his future decisions.     He's already dirty and got his family killed, and now his daughter in law and grandchild need help. It's a really simple and powerful moment that speaks to the love he has for his family. Also, there is a core character difference between Mike and Walter White that will reveal itself all the way down in Breaking Bad's conclusion.     Mike started down the path that would lead him to Nacho, then Jimmy/Saul, Gus, and finally Walter and Jessie with his focus always on helping Stacey and Kaylee. Walter reveals at the end (even though he was also baiting the cops on wiretap at Skylar's apartment to exonerate her) that he did everything he did because he loved it and was good at it. This is the core difference between them - Walt is prideful, spiteful and egocentric, and Mike is broken and guilt stricken.       Mike would never brag about his clout or play scrooge mcduck in piles of money, he just does what he does with good intentions, and evil though his actions have been at times it never fills him with pride for his job to murder people. All of it is just a skill set he possesses to achieve his goals.   TL;DR Mike went "full-measure" after his conversation with Stacey about her money struggles
Love how Chuck basically said the opposite of what Mike said
Yeah but that money was seized by the Feds after they found out about his activities.  If he went legitimate he wouldn’t have to worry about his life savings being seized by the Feds.
He believed he was safe at the time. He had no idea of what was going to happen
Mikes hair🔥
You can tell how much it makes seniors respect and bond with him, look at that old man's tiny eyes growing wide with delight
I think he looked better with a spray tan and Howard’s haircut.   Wendy would agree.
Same barber?
Dude, there is a person behind James McGuill slide 19.  Does anybody else see Kanye West?
Fuck I forgot about Hutch Mansell. He’s after prison Jimmy but before Lucky Hank.
You could have included Jimmy when he was a kid at his father’s store.
Bro uses names like Reddit accounts 💀
you forgot Jimmy as a kid AND Saul Goodman from Saul Goodman Productions before the Early Saul Goodman
I still can’t believe that cartoon was made
First pic- I very highly doubt that blue-collar Cicero-based Jimmy went to  a prep school that had blue blazers with a school emblem/crest as depicted.   All’s I’m saying’.  :)
It's Viktor with a K he clearly mentions it...
Being chair of a college English department is far worse than Supermax prison.  Things just keep getting worse for Odenkirk!
You forgot about the original iteration of Saul Goodman, from the commercial selling commercials.
You missed one “Salamanca’s Guy”
I'm gonna pretend you didn't include the first one
Lucky Hank?
You forgot Viktor with a k
"None lawyer Jimmy" cracks me up for some reason. Also am I missing something from the series with the last photo? Lucky Hank?
Why is he so chunky on "I was last night". It looks edited almost
You skipped Jimmy, the kid working in his Father’s store learning about naivety
outchicaneried once again
What about Hutch from Nobody where does he go at
But lucky hank is not jimmy.. its William Henry and has no connection to jimmy and your timeline 😵‍💫
You forgot the 2 childhood flashbacks (Chuck reading Jimmy a story and Jimmy working in the corner store). You could probably throw Mr.Show in there somewhere.
Love it. But I’m dying here with no evil Saul in the mansion or getting fitted for a suit in BB. I think most Jimmy lovers just completely block out the existence of the evil Saul from BB.
He's been through more transformations than Goku.
You forgot Saul3D
😭
Slippin' Jimmy is NOT cannon.
That scared me
I see Morpheus or Laurence Fishburne if you wish
It's the prison guard escorting him. Put down the bong.
it's fine, that's just the guard.
That’s Saul Badman lol
I tried but there wasn’t enough space unfortunately 😭😭
Sadly there’s a limit to slides
Is it good
Can we all agree to treat it the same way people treat the last airbender movie
Is this cannon? I’m so confused as to whether that character is in the BB universe or not
Lucky Hank is a new dark comedy series starring Bob Odenkirk - totally separate show to the BB/BCSverse, so just a little joke on OPs part!  I'm actually watching it week to week to get my Odenkirk fix, and it's good fun.
are you sure about that ?
It's the ghost of Gus Fring.
Probably could have taken out slippin jimmy from the cartoon 😂
you're kidding me ? that's the best animation show i've ever seen.
Yeah, it’s surprising good. You may not like it at first, but stick through the whole thing, it’s really worth the watch
this masterpiece ? god no
I agree, it's SUPER underrated
I really like the black and white episode where Jimmy has to get that gramophone for young Chuck and when he finally gets it to him they have a really sweet moment at the end where they genuinely bond. It was surprisingly good and really heartbreaking. They were actual brothers at one point who loved each other. Makes Chucks death so much sadder, which is surprising because this is coming from Slippin Jimmy of all things.
What is it on? Is it amc+ if it is thats probably why it’s underrated. Amc+ was going so solid when they were releasing BCS as it was coming out, but the final season ended and they just took all of bb and BCS off the platform.
Howard’s death was truly needless. If he wasn’t there everything would’ve still happened the same; Lalo would not shoot Kim because then Jimmy would have no incentive to help him.
It would have been pointless for Lalo to actually kill Kim because Jimmy would probably no longer give af about anything anymore. But if Lalo put a gun to Kim's head Jimmy would have done anything Lalo wanted
Nah, he needed a hostage. My guess is he would've killed them both after Kim got back if Howard hadn't been there, but I think he shot Howard simply because he didn't want to have to watch 2 hostages instead of one while someone went and killed Gus.
Big brain post
Would've shot the fishtank
What need did Howard’s presence at the apartment even serve? The only person who needed Howard to be there was… Howard. The man died as he lived, indulging in his narcissistic tendencies and trying to impose himself on Kim and Jimmy. I can’t help but lol at the masterful writing.
It was the catalyst for Kim leaving Jimmy and it would’ve left a lose end cos Howard definitely would’ve pursued legal action of some sort
???? Lalos plan was just to distract gus. He didn't need any hostage he just needed someone to ring gus' door
I mean, jimmy and Kim did try to ruin his life
In reference to the lalo scene nothing would've changed
Ruined? What is this the 1840s? Howard's life was fine - he said himself that he will land on his feet and be okay - until he refused to leave the apartment and Lalo ended it.
I don’t think you are particularly smart
What does it say about you that you spend your time responding to such people? What are you even doing with your life?  And you accuse others of not being very smart. Lol.
He typed 2 sentences, it probably took him less than 30 seconds🤣
The best!!
Well he’d get crap done, that’s for sure
Feels like we already did have him as a president...
He would have become "Don gone"
He's a self-taught lawyer from Illinois; we had good luck with the last guy like that.
An accurate representation of the conversation I had with my aunt when she *insisted* I pick a hummel     My aunt: Pick a hummel pick a hummel pick a hummel!      Me: ...??!! Something something  Better Call Saul...  \*shows picture of The Alpine Shepherd boy\*      My aunt: I have that!!!
Do. You. Shit. Gold?
I think you are now required to sell it at an auction in Dallas.
8k right there
omg please cherish that little alpine motherfucker for the rest of your life. this is so cute.
You should have gotten Bavarian boy that stupid chachky is worth 8k!
That's awesome. Good for you!
I'm hoping she didn't have a Bavarian Boy.
So, you finished college then??? That's good.
ASB: Hmmm.  Lamb chops tonight.
It’s thanks to this show that I get the several references to these in an episode of Gilmore Girls. Also featured in that episode is Keiko Agena, who also appears on BCS as a paralegal working with Kim.
Easy job, you go in easy peasy sneaky like steal the alpine shepherd boy and get out thats all. I promise you thats all, these dumbasses doesnt know anything about, they wont even notice. Easy cash man, you an get-in-and-out job
My absolutely favorite episode!!
😂
No, but I do shoot lightning from my fingertips.  \-Palpatine
I was wondering about the ones that are worth of lot of money but I couldnt think of the names of any off the top of my head and my aunt is an intense person. So I was just like, 'Do you have this one??' after I showed her a picture of APS.
I think you mean *tchotchke*, Yiddish for “trinket”.
That’s awesome just saw the episode the other day so it was fresh!  :)
This one looks like it's in excellent shape for resale - no fading or crazing!
Yes THAT is what I meant thank you!  You’d think my years of watching sopranos, my Yiddish would be better. 😂
Are they mindreaders?
The company is Polish and possibly the truck too (just so you know).
Wasn't sator the bad guy in tenet
Satori? I like setting BCS at a Zen monastery. “Him? Part of the Sangha? What a violation of Dharma!”
Yes, I saw that too, it had a polish license plate
I don’t know what it is. I don’t know what it’s about. All I know is that I see Vince Gilligan, I see Rhea Seehorn, I’m watching.
Rhea Seehorn is a single mom in Albuquerque. Things get heated when her daughter gets poor grades from a high school chemistry teacher resulting in her daughters expulsion from school. Advised by a family friend who owns a chain of fast food chicken restaurants, that this was unacceptable, she receives legal advice from a shady lawyer.   Her lawyer is shocked with how much she looks like his ex wife. It turns out they were identical twins separated at birth. She herself also has two twin boys who had a traumatic skateboarding accident leaving both their legs broken in several places. The twin boys estranged father, (son of reputable attorney Cliff Main), has also gotten into some medical difficulties due to addiction.  There are lots of twists and turns along the way, but It’s an emotional drama of reuniting lost relatives and rebuilding relationships. I’m getting tearful even thinking about it.  It’s called, ‘Beneath the glass blue sky’ 😂😂🤪
I'm dying to know who else is going to star in it. We haven't heard Anything about that
Bring on the water works!
Might have to finally subscribe to Apple +
Back when it was first announced didn't they say it was sci-fi?  So not sure how "grounded genre drama" fits with "sci-fi" really.  **EDIT:** Actually just looked it up. I found some old headlines with "sci-fi" but this one article was better detailed: https://deadline.com/2022/09/vince-gilligan-next-series-rhea-seehorn-star-apple-tv-plus-two-season-order-1235124488/  > Compared to The Twilight Zone, the new series is said to be set in our world while putting a tweak on it, bending reality and focusing on people and exploring the human condition in an unexpected, surprising way. Thought-provoking but not a morality tale, the series also is expected to carry the signature Gilligan tone that infuses drama with humor.  Twilight Zone gets pretty crazy, but maybe they're not going that insane. Also that show was a classic so that suddenly puts your show into another expectation tier if it gets compared to that.
Kim’s backstory confirmed. Slippin’ Kimmy.
Wait this isn’t r/okbuddychicanery
Hope it works out, and looking forward to it.   Rhea, for my money, is the best actress of the past decade. Provided a truly exceptional performance in Vince's last show here, and I'm looking forward to whatever she does next.
I first read genre as gene. I read a “grounded Gene Drama” :)
Apple TV+: quality over quantity.
Blended, grounded genre drama means what ?
A blended, grounded genre drama? Erotic comedy? Horror musical?
FROM THE PRODUCERS OF HAMLINDIGO BLUES AND FUCK YOU AND YOUR EYEBROWS COMES ANOTHER TIMELESS CLASSIC…
Nice! Pretty excited for this Twilight Zone-esque show, Vince is going back to his roots.
Vince should do a spinoff of Kim. Her story is still left untold since her & Jimmy split up.
I don't care if it's about a women shoveling horse shit. It's Rhea! I'm watching.
Does anyone know if it’s in universe and about Kim?  Or does Rhea play someone else in a different universe?
Better call Kim
Apple TV has Severance and now this. Good time to get a subscription.
'Grounded genre drama' is a pretty opaque description, but with Rhea Seehorn and Gilligan it's on my watchlist.
When this comes out, it’ll be the show that finally compels me to pay for Apple TV+
Anytging with Vince, sign me up
I AM GOD DAMN EXCITED!!!
Better Call Kim.
I am so so pumped for this
Meanwhile Lucky Hank will be truly lucky if it gets renewed.
It's already been leaked, 'Gotta Swim With Kim'  it's about her life post-Saul as a small-town swimming instructor in Florida while the local Cartel is trying to recruit her to teach their workers how to sneak into the country by water. Nobody else heard about this??
Wait so the character that nothing goes right for, that’s supposed to be Rhea?
I have spoken.
I hope it's x-filesy
Blended, grounded genre drama? How can you go wrong?
name guesses guys?  mine :   Maybe Call Kim
Hopefully it's better than Lucky Hank, Odenkirks new show.
I just finished BCS for the first time yesterday. She is just incredible,one of the best performances of all time.
Spin-off of a spin-off
Wtf does ‘grounded genre drama’ mean??
"Blended, grounded, genre drama". Plugged into Google translates and still have no idea what this means.
Excited to see what this is about. I’m confident Vince is gonna make a masterpiece like BCS & BB were.
Is this in the universe?
Hopefully better than lucky hank
If I was mute and in a wheelchair I'd be smashing the bell so hard right now (and shitting my pants)
Hope Mando gets a role for that appleTV comeback (please we need this)
It must be after the events of better call saul
she deserves 6 seasons
I'm betting it about some girl in Florida selling plumbing parts that use to be a lawyer.
Kim Wexler, Attorney At Law!
Yyyyyaaaaayyy! Queen Rhea reign!!! 👑
Kim Wexler, P.I.
I’m not gonna lie, I kinda wanna see Vince do something non-breaking Bad. It’s the goat, but he’s been in this universe for so long that I wanna see what else he can do. I hope this is like that, even if it does star Seahorn
It should have been a workplace comedy about Lalo's hacienda where Tony Dalton occasionally appears like the original plan for Martin Sheen on the West Wing
Feet lady
its totally gonna be a spin off hahaha. its being filmed in ABQ!
Better Call Kim
He’s creating the breaking bad sequel series calling“ Anastasia”
Better R*m Kim lol
Apple TV 😮‍💨
Led the redditors begin…. When is bob odenkirk going to be added to tbe cast. Cameo opp for ehrmantrout.  Flash back to defend combo
Apple TV.  Guess I’ll just read about it.
OoOooh blended and grounded? Just like my ground beef breakfast smoothies 🤤
I have vowed never to give money for apple..
I’ll skip only really watched BCS for Saul
Too bad it's on apple plus. I'm done with new subscriptions.
It's gonna be so goddam boring too.
Any gratuitous nudity?
Corners will be cut
Better Skin Kim confirmed???
This MF could make someone making a cup of tea last 3 seasons.
I’m sorry this just doesn’t sound interesting?
Why apple tv though at least put on prime
Apple+?  Guess I'll never see that. Everything that goes to Apple+ seems to simmer out into the dark. I can't even think of one big hit on that platform
Too bad I'll never get to watch it bc it's on Apple.
APPLE FUCKING TV NOOOOOO
Love Vince and especially Rhea. But fuck apple+
looks pretty forgettable
Fingers crossed they’re finally bringing Pile of Bullets to TV
Is this something brand new or a Kim Wexler spinoff?
Can I get a second source?
THATS M GIRLL
AppleTV?? well, raising the black flag it is haha
🤔 Blended, grounded genre drama?  I’m in!
Vince is determined to get Rhea her god damn Emmy.
we need a show starring Johnny Banks pls
Is this going to be a spin off like how Better Call Saul was?   I love this. Keep it going.
That's a nice name.
What on earth does “blended” mean in this context?
spin off of better call Saul? kims backstory? id watch it
Better Text Wex
Yeah. I’ll give this a whirl for sure.
[Same](https://i.imgur.com/h2G1s8j.jpg)
Vince, Rhea, and Apple+ has been killing it. I have high hopes.
I saw a lot of comments about Bob Odenkirk’s show with that same type of comment early on, and that turned out pretty disappointing…
This series will have you saying "Hank on a Marie, I Flynnk I know some of those Gus!"
FIRE HANS 🔥
lmao. That was pretty funny
I'm pretty sure we'll hear more news in these upcoming months. So excited about it. There is a big chance that this show will premiere in 2024.
Bold of you to presume Vince can't create a masterpiece with her as the only character
I hope Michael Mando gets some role
A blender and a whole lot of dirt according to the post
We are Lucky Hank isn't in it.
I'm pretty curious as well.
Yup
you gotta see Severance!
They've been making great shows. For All Mankind is amazing.
They have a *lot* of good shows.   Ted Lasso, Shrinking, Slow Horses, and Severance are all absolutely incredible, and then there’s other shows that aren’t quite as good but are still very good and engaging shows like For All Mankind.
Grounded genre is what they call shows like Severance or Counterpart. There's one twist but no superheroes, magic or monsters.
best? hmm. i can think of some honorable mentions but i think i agree.
Rhea hit her stride late in life too, a nice change of pace for an industry where actresses age out quickly.
What else of hers is worth watching outside of BCS?
I don’t know any of her work outside of breaking bad unfortunately. What’s her best work beside that?  Edit: im not even going to change that since it’s accidentally made the thread hilarious
Here, here!  It’s bound to be a good watch given the pedigree here.
As a huge fan of The Leftovers, I gotta add Carrie Coon and Regina King to that list.
Carrie Coon in my books.  Actually Laurie Metcalfe.  She deserves it for that monologue in Horace and Pete alone.   Shoot, or Ann Dowd.  She is phenomenal in anything she does even if she is not typically a lead.
I hope they trend in that direction. I recently finished Severance season 1. Any other good shows on apple you'd recommend?
I’m truly stuck on blended. Genuinely don’t know what that means in terms of a tv genre
It means Vince is being vague af to keep the story under wraps until they’re ready, and to draw up major interest. And dammit, it’s working.
Subtle thriller!
It has nothing to do with the breaking bad/better call saul universe.
Severance has only like 8 episodes, and this new Vince show won’t debut until 2024 at the earliest. Is now really the right time? Hell, you could knock out Severance and Tes Lasso within the free trial period and then what?
I’m in the minority here I guess. I’m enjoying it. It’s a lot different than his BCS and BB roles but I like most of the supporting characters. There’s enough there that I’ll keep watching at this point. I’m not sure if it will lead anywhere, and no idea what the endgame is yet, but it’s got a strong cast.
Is it that bad?
Isn't Lucky hank a miniseries?
Thank god Vince is writing this show, and not Reddit.
Everything is in the universe.
Lucky Hank isn’t an original show. It's based on a book named "straight man". And also nobody from bb/bcs crew are on this show other than bob. Moreover "Lucky Hank" is just a fun comedic type show, not a serious one & I think it's decent tv on it's own.   In this case, Vince Gilligan & most of the crew who worked on bcs will be here & Rhea will star. Also this is a serious project because Apple already gave greenlight for two season. So, I'm positive that this show will be great.  (Edit: The budget for every single episode will be 13.5-15 million & some or most of it's filming will be in Albuquerque. So, we have an idea how serious of a project this is.) [ Source : Vulture.com & Rhea seehorn herself from various interview. ]
You didn't like Hankin' Time? It's even got geese in it!
Lucky Hanks boring AF
There arrrrrrrrr other options matey
Did you read about Ted Lasso and Severance?
It's $7 a month and there's a free trial. If a tv creator I was fond of put something on "android tv" I'd prob give it a shot.
this aint hbo 😭
Of feet? Yeah, I would guess that’s likely. No idea about about other body parts.
No but Lucky Hank will feature an entire episode set on a nude beach just for you, dear viewer
Show about a lawyer starting Bob Odenkirk. There will be lots of talking.  Bro they’ve said absolutely nothing about the show how have you decided that already
try 🏴‍☠️
>looks pretty forgettable  There is literally nothing to see. How can it look forgettable when there is no available visual information whatsoever?
Huh. People are so weird
The Reddit television discussion experience is really just people being presented with the least amount of information possible and then making big statements that don’t make any sense relative to the amount of information they’ve been presented with.
Something unforgettable or something stupid? 😏
After all, that is what I said when they said they’d be making a prequel about Saul Goodman.
If only ISIS had started a streaming service
But that wasn't made by people involved with the Methverse. This has Vince Gilligan.
Really? Have it seen it yet, but it seems to be getting really good reviews.
What show? Bcs?
It’s funny you mention that…, there was some light linkage to the DEA… her non blood sibling Daniel works for a pharmaceutical company, had some traumatic experiences, when his baseball cards were stolen from his home. Luckily they were returned to allow Daniel to finance and open a laser tag arena.  Daniel was interrogated repeatedly in relation to a young boy who went missing, last seen while riding his dirt bike. He was a frequent player of laser tag. The boy was never found.  …… DRAMA!!!! 🥸😝
Just when I thought I could take a break from hate-watching the emmys :-/
lol
Wasn't he kicked off a different apple show
Peter Diseth too.
Yep
Bro I binged watched severance like it was the only thing that mattered in my life in 48 hours dude ITS SO GOOD I cant wait for the next season
Seconding this, Severance completely blew me away when it came out. Such a great concept and it's explored in such a fun way
Severance is one of the best shows I've seen in recent years. Easily my favorite new show of 2022
Also Ted Lasso
YEE . IT SA GOAT SHOW
Really the lesson we're all slowly learning is that people need to give Ben Stiller all of the money to produce all of his weird bullshit.
my outie finished severance in a day.
And movies. The recently released Tetris movie is great!
Apple definitely seems to have a higher rate of hits than the other streaming services. They're at like HBO level.
Ah counterpart. Man I almost forgot about that show but I really need to go back and re-watch it. It’s a shame it never got any recognition
Blanchett
Well, she is still smoking hot so she has that going for her
And she wasn’t even in that lol
[I wouldn’t call it her best work. But she took it well when she was on the receiving end of one of Selena Myer’s best rants on Veep](https://youtu.be/GxCM0bszB6I)
Franklin and Bash. I like to believe it's a sequel where Kim gets back into law while trying to tell herself she's no longer charmed by unorthodox borderline unethical lawyer antics.  Also starring Gus's sommelier crush after he finished his law degree while working at the restaurant.
Much different from the likes of Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, Severance, etc., but Ted Lasso is very good. The first season is more plot-orientated and a bit sickly 'wholesome', but the second season is where it really shines when it really gets into the meat of the characters and their motivations and insecurities.
Servant is pretty good if you like horror.
For All Mankind is fantastic. It’s grounded character driven sci-fi that starts in the 60s and tells an alternate history about what would’ve happened if the space race never ended. The pilot is a little slower but it really picks up on the second ep
Black Bird was incredible
I really enjoyed Foundation. Lee Pace’s acting on that show is phenomenal. Shrinking and Ted Lasso are also great.
Check out Shrinking. It’s new, created by the Scrubs guy, and just finished its first season so you can binge it.  It’s a really quality comedy/drama with a lot of good actors.
I’m both dissappointed but also interested at the same time
They didn't even do the shootout scene in the library where L. Hank says *"Seems like... your luck's ran out!"* before blowing up the english department
I love Bob Odenkirk and several members of the cast. And yet… yeah. It’s that bad. Just not interesting or even particularly funny. Also in my opinion, there’s zero chemistry between Bob and the actress who plays his wife on the show.
*everything we know of is in the universe
I like Lucky Hank but I wouldn't watch it if Bob wasn't in it
Wth that's lot of money
Yeah Lucky Hank has been rather dull
Aye.
Definitely never saw them.
Bro probably saw blended grounded genre drama and got bored. Lol.
blended, grounded genre drama,   ...   sounds forgettable
You’d call your agent
Methverse 😂
6.8/10 IMDb..
Lucky Hank
Don’t worry pal I hereby say you can take an indefinite break from hate-watching the emmys
I’ve literally never known anyone who watches award shows. I always kinda thought they were just for the actors.
Sinking Spring
why?!
He and Brian Tyree Henry got into some argument and didn’t wanna work together anymore, and they fired Michael because Brian’s the bigger star
Oh yeah
Please try to enjoy each season equally.
me too lo.l,. i had 3 months free apple  tv as i finally moved to IPhone
I started warching amd got bored in 1st episode midway, but yeah it is in my watchlist next after better call saul
Did you get any of that?
What a wild ride Tetris is.
People age better now. Better nutrition, less smoking, sunscreen.
that's how good she is
Holy shit lol. Savage!!
Love slow burns like BCS and some kdramas, so the setup time won't be a problem. Thanks, I'll check it out next.
season 2 is even sappier imo, i mean that christmas episode?
🙏
I saw the trailer but totally misread the plot. Kinda sounds like Man In The High Castle but space based. That's very interesting. Thanks, I'll check it out
Thanks I'll check it out too for sure
Thanks, I'll check on it too.
Thanks, will check it out too for sure
I didn't find it bad but I wouldn't be watching it if Bob wasn't in it.
its not even bad enough to be watching it for the so bad it's good factor it's just incredibly bland I think I've laughed 3 times in 4 episodes. and I agree about the wife it feels like she's just there for set dressing most of the time, he has more chemistry with the guy who plays his son in law and he's hardly in the show. I just watch it to take a break from the good shows I'm in the process of watching to remind myself how mediocre television can be
Legal drama sounds boring too (Bcs literary has a plot about elder law). Look how that turned out. At least wait for the show to drop
I couldnt have cared less about the emmys and other awards shows for years until I finally discovered Breaking Bad. Now it seems like I hate-watch all those award shows now.
Sources say the Better Call Saul alum, who was set to star in the eight-episode series from Ridley Scott, was dismissed from the show following a clash with a co-star. Mando’s role has been recast, with Narcos alum Wagner Moura set to take on the part.   -Hollywood Reporter
AMAZING response  A laugh is available upon request.
Trust me, you won’t regret continuing Severance. So fucking good
If you can handle the first season of Better Call Saul, you can handle the first few episodes of Severance. I don't blame you for getting bored though, even the most amazing shows take me a while to get hooked and sometimes I'm ultimately not even in the mood for them either way.
Bro the first episode is nothing but putting everything on the table, just let it cook. Just like breaking bad had two whole seasons of Skyler being a karen! It became a masterpiece afterwards
LOL. it was a typo haha.
I’m all for that
Ted lasso is one of over best shows ever. But slow burn is not what you call it. You’ll get it when you see it. It’s nothing like bcs.
I watched the first two episodes and couldn’t get into the third. Just felt bland and dull.
Ignacio Varga Vs Pablo Escobar   Epic…
yikes! I suppose he did seem pretty intense!
He doesn't seem to have been active much on social media since. Hope his career recovers
So nacho vs Escobar
Ha!
Yeah , it is next on my list .. just finishing up BCS last season
The first season of Better Call Saul is great. Put it this way: it’s less developed opening season is as good as most shows. I had no problems watching all the pre-Pimento episodes.
Haha yeah man, i started watching breaking bad in 2018, left after 2-3 episodes .. then resumed again this year and boi, i am a huge fan of vince gilligan now , i am actually feeling sad now since already finished breaking bad and better call saul about to finish ...
[Waiting for the new Vince Gilligan series](https://i.imgur.com/om0rpLq.jpg)
Have you watched season 6 of bcs ? I know its not on netflix in some countries
It is available here and i am on S6E9 currently..
Damn im from canada and I couldnt watch it. I went on a trip to portugal and I was able to download them on my laptop from there and watch them back in my country by removing the wifi lol
Dear diary
Mike planted a tracker in Saul's car.  Mike drove a light blue pickup truck.
Mike pulls up in his own vehicle clearly in the episode. That vehicle is disabled when the lone survivor tries to shoot Mike.
The tracker was in his gas cap?
Totally missed it. Seen the episode nearly 10 times. Idk how I keep missing it.
Of course. Why else would there have been a close-up shot of Mike removing the gas cap?
They panned over to the truck to show it leaking coolant after the gunfight. Cmon you gotta remember that
The Many Saints of HHM
I wish the lord would take me now
I don't like this kind of tawk
He shouldn’t have done massive amounts of coke and kicked Wendy out in the middle of the street. He made his bed
Funny thing is I don't remember this sub saying that about him when he was alive
good god Tony Soprano’s mom was a horrible person
To be fair, being the only decent person in a show full of criminals and scumbags is about as close as you can get to sainthood in the Gilliverse, even if he wasn’t perfect.
Soprano’s references in BCS subreddit?   What’s this the FUCKING UN NOW!?
Ok but why is chuck on a wig crying? Who *ORCHESTRATED™️* this?
I'd wanna go golfing with him. Dudes a beast and wants people to do better
You threw bowling balls at Howard. That’s gotta be resolved.
The lord should take me
Howard Hamlin, another toothpick.
Oh madone
Howard was human. But perhaps less broken then most of the characters
being in the wrong place at the wrong time? oh poor you!!
Howard reminds me of those guys who are well-meaning allies. A little selfish, but nothing monstrous. Cares about people, but goes so over the top with his mannerisms that he unintentionally comes off as disingenuous. Full of benign ignorance, but super mean if you piss him off.  He basically reminds me of most of my past male bosses. Harmless people.
He's one in a million. He's got that shotgun shine.  >!Buried under a landslide with a bullet in his mind.!<
He was gay, Howard Hamlin?
Howard is the most relatable douche bag in TV. I say that as praise.
Oh poor you
Howard was always completely reasonable to Jimmy. He might have been petty about doc review, but he tried his best to deal with their shenanigans without getting vindictive. Howard didn't do anything slimy or illegal, unlike the retaliation against him.
Howard Hamlin was caught in between two feuding brothers, and one of them happened to be a major partner with his firm so he had no choice but to back him.
I don't answer the phone after dark.
But he put Kim in doc review. He deserved to die.
Howard.
I feel like the same could be said about most characters on this show.
“I DONT LIKE THAT KINDA TAWK 😡☝️”
Now just stop it! I don’t like that kinda tawk, it upsets me
Oh poooar yoou!
Howard never had the makings of a varsity athlete.
ARE YOU JOKING!!! He took a truck load of meth and had jimmy and kim work in DOC REVEIW!!!
Hey, you're Carol Burnett!
I wish the cartel would take me
Howard was real, that’s why he’s so polarizing. Was he a saint? No. But I think he always tried to do what was best without sacrificing his own well being, which is what most would do.
Wait, people really think that someone with a coke addiction and cheated on his wife with multiple prostitutes was a saint?
Howard was pretty genuinely a good person. I can't really think of anything he did that was flat out wrong.
Female Chuck
Chuck always calls his mother.
He was a polite but average lawyer... Which, in a world of child murdering drug dealers, makes him relatively great.  Relatively.
Howard never had the making of a varsity athlete.
Howard Hamlin? Whatever happened there?
Look at him! He knows everything!
>It's possible that he was a dick boss but also did not deserve what happened to him.  This, 100%. Also, just because your dick boss apologizes for being a dick boss doesn't mean you have to forgive him. You probably still shouldn't go on a personal campaign to ruin his life tho.
Chuck: "Jimmy never had the makings of a variety attorney. Chicanery, that's his problem."
Want some cuoffee jimmy?
It's so sad what happened to him, whatever happened there
Op, you go about in pity for yourself
Howard Hamlin, whatever happened there
HE TRIED TO BE BETTER
People ignore how rude and little Howard cared for people. He sent to Kim to doc review who had worked her ass off with no remorse
The need to constantly mention Howard is a dick boss is just stupid. It's like saying "Yeah this person donates thousands to charity every year but he littered once in third grade so he's not that great of a guy." It honestly feels like people only bring this up so they can rationalize his brutal murder.
how dare evil howard punish his employees for their mistakes? is he stupid?
“Yeah, okay, he was mean to Kim one time. Guess what? Bosses are supposed to be mean! My boss asks me if he can kick me in the nuts for fun and you don’t see me saying no, because I understand he’s going through his own shit and he’s human like me! I can’t believe Kim tried to con him! I miss the days Bince made more likeable characters, like Walter for turning down Elliott’s offer!”
You’re god damn right.
Ohh poor Howard....  Jimmy has blood on his hands for Howard 😒
Howard was an arsehole who deserved to be brought down a peg.   He didn't deserve what happened to him.  He was in the wrong place at the wrong time, but I can't blame Jimmy or Kim for what boils down to horrendously bad luck.
What ? He was cokehead cheating lying bastard who destroyed jimmy and Kim lives
Howard was not a good person.
Howard can be considered "a dick boss" only by current days snowflakes, when offices were run like workplaces instead of adult daycare for people with bullshit jobs there was a well defined hierarchy and junior employees would not dare to take half of the liberties that Kim and Jimmy took at HHM. Howard punished Kim, sided with his firm partner in every dispute, what was he supposed to do exactly? If he was a dick he would have pushed Chuck into retirement as soon as he started bringing personal issues at HHM, he would have asked Kim to repay her debth in full if she wanted to quit HHM, and he would have never tried to help Jimmy towards whom he had no obligations.
🥲🥲🥲
He was the best of us.
Your CEO Howard, whatever happened there
He frl was
I like how correct this post is, especially with Livia Soprano saying it lol it is so true
Diane anytime someone mentions Scott Ross
He's one of the only people in the show to realize he was a dick to Jimmy due to his own insecurity of partnering with Chuck, feel truely remorseful, accept whatever responsibility he felt he had in Chuck's suicide, and change who he was to be a better person and right his perceived wrongs.   And his reward was a quick death.
Lmfao this is so spot on!    One thing to remember though is it was always in Howard’s shoulders to be the “boss”. Granted he was way harder in Kim than necessary but I imagine that hard line he took with her is a similar one his father took with him and why he felt he became the “success” he did. On top of that he was dealing with being Chucks puppet whether or not he did or did not understand it ti that extent is up for debate but he really was in between a rock and a hard place. I think it’s why he breaks and ends up telling Kim in confidence about Chuck standing in Jimmys way to work at HHM.   In comparison to everyone else in the Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul universe Howard really is kind of a saint lol. So I get why people have a hard time demonizing him the same they do everyone else.
it's fucking true
He had it coming.
What is this? A crossover episode?
RIP HOWIEEEEEE🤕😭😭😭
I still hate Howard
I like being subscribed to this sub and the sopranos one. I gotta say… the sopranos subreddit is funny as fuck though. Great sub for a great progrum.
Oh, poor you!
He didn’t have the makings of a varsity athlete
HE WAS ABUSIVE TO THE STAFFFF 🤌🏽🤌🏽
Greatest salesman I'd ever known
Wasn’t Howard Hamlin that lawyer that had the come addiction, cheated on his wife with hookers and ended up killing himself? Thats all I remember about him anyway.
HE WAS A SAINT
Lmao having just watched Sopranos for the first time, I really enjoy this meme.
Kind of an ass
Hes only character is moral good and didn't deserve it in the end
Jimmy always said HHM is nothin’ more than a glorified crew.
He was a HOOOWAA
"Why didn't you call the plumber?"
“You didn’t say that when he was alive” - Carmela
Nah Howard for me was an awesome character played beautify by Patrick. But I was rooting for his downfall, he wasn't a saint or a devil be certainly had a big part, at least in my view of Jimmy's decent to the criminal world.
Tbf, Howard never had the makings of a varsity athlete.
It’s sad when they go young like that
Hamlin has the same problem that Hank has. Just because he died in a horrible way and suffered a fate that he did not deserve, the entire fanbase of the show needs to think about him as some sort of immaculate hero that would die for our sins, and dismiss every single bad and annoying trait of him
There was nothing we could do about it. Lalo was a made man and Howard wasn’t.
It's sad when they go young like that
He was though, no?   Wanted to hire Jimmy because he saw his potential. Chuck blocked it.  He respected Chuck so much that he let him be involved with the firm even though he was suffering from paranoia, anxiety and stress.   Throughout the series he took Jimmy’s side whenever he could.  After Chuck died he tried to recruit Jimmy to be part of HHM.   He was a “saint” when it comes to the BCS narrative. What happened to Howard is a tragedy🤷‍♂️
Am I a tocshic pershon?
He had a bee on his hat!!!
“Funny, I don’t remember you saying that when he was alive”
“HE DEFECATED through a sunroof carmine”  “It was an off color act. If you want, I’ll demand that he gets suspended for a year”
Look at the look on her face she’s smiling!
I think it's interesting to watch his villainous moments in season 1 knowing how it all works out. Knowing that he actually really likes Jimmy and it's actually Chuck acting against him THROUGH Howard.  That said, Howard IS an asshole to Kim.
HHM isn't even a real law firm! We got the five firms and then this other pygmy thing. Glorified secretarys ask me
The Many Saints of New Mexico
Lol that's great
*dabs her eyes even though there are no tears
Me too, thanks
I don’t like that kinda tawk!
If she ever made it to heaven, God would spit the bitch back out.
Seems like sooner than later he did
OP can’t be part of our social club no more, that much I do know.
Stop it, Junior. You're making me very upset!
Woke up this mornin  Got some Gobabool
Let the pasht be bygones
She was abusive to da staaaaf
It upsets me!
He was a HOOOWAA
I said my piece 🤚
It's all under Hamlinvestigation
The audacity of that whole scene. Nobody would ever believe anyone was crazy enough to make that up lol
That's the joke.  There's a saying in spanish: "no hay muerto malo" (there aren't bad dead people)
Eh, most people had already flipped their opinion of Howard by the time season 3 had started.
I feel like everyone started realizing he was ok by the end of season 3 or so.
Another character in the sopranos basically says that to Olivia (the older woman in this gif) in a different scene.
because he didn't deserve to die lol especially like that and be buried with his killer
I did, from Season 2 onward.    https://www.reddit.com/r/betterCallSaul/comments/9dr83c/bcs_bb_character_map/      Hank -> Howard. Both antagonists who are actually good guys, indirectly hurt by the lead character.
Her son wasn't that much better either, that's what I like the most in Breaking Bad and The Sopranos, in Breaking Bad we see Walt progressively becoming bad, in The Sopranos Tony is bad from the get go we just get to see how bad he can be.
You're talking about Ernesto. He was a saint.
He was an asshole in a world of literal sociopaths
There's plenty of good people in both shows, they just don't get much focus.
Nacho's father ?
Always with the scenarios
I never had a problem with Todd’s weight in El Camino. To me he’s beautiful. Rubenesque.
Take it easy. We're not making a western.
Ohh! Dats the boss’s mudda you’re talkin about!
That really confused me for a second there — why is Chuck in a wig? Wait, that not Chuck. Wait, this isn’t BCS…
Stupida facking game.
Except for Jimmy. I know it’s complicated but family is family
And I wanna fuck Angie Dickinson, let's see who gets lucky first.
45 years old, just a fucking kid
It’s sad when they go young
He wasn't harmless to Kim's career.  He was actually pretty fucking vicious towards it.
Now sing it loud
Maybe you're a flambé.
He also throws himself under the bus for others' well being and doesn't throw anyone under the bus for his own well being. Which is more than most.
Was he real though?  He adopted an entire persona around being who his daddy wanted him to be.  I have the total opposite view point of Howard, dude is fake as fuck, and is constantly making power plays, and participating in things because he understands them to be the "good" thing, while not actually participating in anything I would actually call good.
Didn't he drag out the court case with the old people so that his firm would make more honey, even though it meant that most of the old people would be dead by the time the case would finally get settled?
Agree. I think he’s as close to a saint as it gets. At least in the later seasons. He didn’t do a single bad thing to make Jimmy do those things to him. Actually this happened because he was trying to do a good thing. He offered Jimmy a job to make up for refusing him in the early seasons.
Whatever happened there?  **Whatever happened there??**
Yeah Kim definitely lost her mind for a bit. But I can still understand why she wanted to take Howard down a peg.
Whatever happened there?!?!?!?
I didn't like seeing her treated that way, either, and I think Howard erred on the side of being a bit cruel in this instance. But he was a partner at a firm founded by his Father and Chuck, and he felt professionally and personally beholden to each of them. His identity was intertwined with running a tight ship at HHM in their absences. It makes sense that he would be a strict disciplinarian when he felt it was necessary.
what employee of the month does to a mf
I disagree with this
>Howard can be considered "a dick boss" only by current days snowflakes  Calling someone you disagree with a "snowflake" on the internet automatically discredits your opinion.
If you think any of what you described led to more efficiently run businesses in the past, you would be out of your mind. This is the same principle as the notion that beating the shit out of children serves to build their character.
How does that boot taste?
Howard putting Kim in doc review can’t be interpreted as anything else than a “dick boss”.   1) He blamed her for stupid shit that Jimmy did  2) Even if we assume that Kim bears responsibility, the correct thing to do is either teach her or fire her. Putting a capable person in a menial role is a complete waste of human talent.
that would definitely ruin his image that Jim and Kim tried so hard to do so in season 6, also if you want to work in a hierarchy environment where bosses are allowed to harrass their employee, then you are the problem
With what? His f*cking toes?!?!?
A partner doesn't wear shorts.
They make anyone a lawyer over there. And the way they do it is all fucked up
Social club? He’s gotta GO
I GAVE MY CHILDREN MY LIFE ON A SILVAH PLATTAH!
Don’t they have medicine they’re supposed to take, these assholes??
Then I got up the next day     Got some Gabagool
Oh listen to him, he knows everything.
That's Hamlincredible to hear
Wait, huh Hamlinvestigation ?!
Some people are so far behind they think they're winning the race
Sharp as a fuckin cue ball
That’s the next line from sopranos.
There's an old Italian saying: fuck up once, you lose two teeth
Something something hitler
I don't know how you couldn't like alive Howard by the end.  He was genuinely impacted by Chuck's death and seemed like he was trying to change for the better, even if it was in a cheesy Namaste way.  I was shouting at the screen for Jimmy to stop being such an asshole to him.
Sharp as a cue ball this one
You must've been at the top of your fucking class!
You think he cares? He's dead!
In Sopranos we gradually realize how bad To y is. At least for me.   Same with Jimmy in BCS
I can definitely see the parallels between the two shows  they both have a mentality that their actions are only affecting those who are “in the game”, and they still have a sense of right or wrong to some degree… but their actions still end up hurting innocent people nonetheless
Ernesto's beatification is something I could get behind. Or that doctor who helped Chuck.  Also that dog that Mike got for Kaylee.
Don't forget Omar, although not on the exact same level
Too bad the Ernesto actor has been defending Kanye on Twitter.
He's not even an asshole. Besides putting Kim in doc review he always acted like a genuinely good guy
Kim's not a sociopath. She clearly felt awful about what she did.
You know, Quasimodo predicted all of this.
My mudda’s wake. Jeshush Chrisht
I really thought it was one of those deepfakes with chuck’s face on it.
You got a bee on your hat 🐝
Even then, isn't it kind of implied that he liked Jimmy (hence the fond nickname) and it was Chuck who was telling Howard to treat him that way? Especially in the beginning. Although Jimmy definitely fanned the flames and prbly soured Howard's opinion of Jimmy lol.
That cocksuckin' piece of shit Tuco Salamanca's cousin - I can't even say his name - murdered Howie. And what did I do about it?
WHEN THEY GO??
I mean Jimmy also does this, lol.  Not to mention, if he doesn't totally fuck up his relationship with his best employee, he doesn't need to do this in the first place.  It was his awful management that lead him to have to self sacrifice, when he could have not alienated Kim and kept Mesa Verde.
Yeah... well... forget about that!
Thais not his decision to make. Its the class representative, Irene.
That's fair, you get my upvote.
I'm not calling a snowflake someone because they disagree with me, I'm calling them snowflakes because they judge a very standard behavior as being too tough for no reason.
That's it I said peace
Ooooh, Poor you!
GO!!! INTO THE HAM!!!! 🔪
Woke up this mornin  Gaba-Gabagool
/r/thesopranos leaking hardcore rn lol
Amazing
They’re five fucking time zones behind their own ass.
I watched the series many years ago, can't remember exactly.   It might be time for a rewatch.
This line gets me every time I watch the series
Did Nazi that coming
Tony is very obviously a bad guy from day 1 in that show, I mean he ran a guy over in the very first episode over some money he was owed lol
Bronesto is a pure soul
And Lyle
I didn't want to know that.
She felt awful that he died, but one minute earlier she was getting off on destroying his career.  I don't like to use the word sociopath because people overuse it, but Kim is definitely not on the same level of niceness as Howard.
A lot of the characters have complexity to them. No one is really clinically diagnosable because its a work of fiction. (Except Tuco probably)  I think the comment is saying that Howard was a douche bag in more “normal” ways that are easier to relate to. Wherein other characters issues are more fictionalized and sensational.
That scene is goated as is, but Carmela and Tony's disgust on Chrissy being high at the wake while Carmela herself was publicly roasting the dead lady there makes it even greater.
Mr Williams, he don’t play.
Animal Salamanca
The wine makes you emotional
>I'm not calling a snowflake someone because they disagree with me, I'm calling them snowflakes because they judge a very standard behavior as being too tough for no reason.  Your insistence that people should just suffer mistreatment at work quietly like all the generations before them is also stupid.
🎶Keep on gettin different   types of… Gabagool. 🎶
You yap worse than six barbers.
I would love a spin-off that’s just the whole story start-to-finish from Lyle’s perspective. It’s a lot of serving chicken but then shit starts going off the rails.
✅✅✅
I think she regretted all of it. It was Howard's death that broke the spell and caused her to realize how terrible she'd been.
I never said people should suffer mistreatment or harassment on the work place, we ar enot talking about some random attack on a poor employee that did nothing other than disagreeing with her boss, we are talking disciplinary actions taken after Kim made choices that were going against the interests of the company she worked for. And by the way she always treated Howard with extreme arrogance, like she always knew better, and made scenes that were absolutely inappropriate, that's no way to interact with other people in the workplace and she does the same thing later with Richard. Being respectful towards your boss and being able to admit that someone with more experience might know something you don't know is not asking too much.

I love Kim, she's my favourite character, but being sorry doesn't cancel out all the douchebaggery she does or has done.  She was sorry for helping to tear down Chuck in "Chicanery", but whom did that help. Nobody.
Good work everyone
>I love Kim, she's my favourite character, but being sorry doesn't cancel out all the douchebaggery she does or has done.  That wasn't the argument, she was called a "sociopath" of which she clearly isn't.    She did a bad thing, it had even worse results than she intended, and she totally changed her life and behaviors because of how large of a mistake it was.  No one absolves her of the bad thing, but that also isn't all she was or ever will be either.
I'm not saying her being sorry makes up for it. I'm just saying the fact that she feels sorry is evidence that she isn't a psychopath.
Tommy Vercetti? I thought this Mothafucka was still smoking bones on the Polar Express
Nobody in this show is a psychopath, that's pop psychology.
I oughtta hit this motherfucka with a fettuccine uppercut
Lalo, Tuco, Hector, and Todd (BB but still) are pretty textbook psychopaths.  wdym by "pop psychology," though? Are you implying psychopathy isn't a real diagnosis?
Psychopath can be used informally  to describe a generally unstable person. So yes they are.  Idk why all this armchair psychologists come out of the woodwork to correct people when the dictionary definition literally acknowledges the informal usage of the term.
Oooh, you want me to get Joe Pesci to shoot ya in the face again?
I think pop psychopathy is just Hollywood dramatic interpretation.  Todd is the only one id call an actual literal psychopath.
Kind of. It's really a movie term, and has no place in a clinical setting. Just the very thought an actual medical professional would diagnose and describe patients as psychopaths and sociopaths is just ridiculous, those terms don't really really mean any thing concrete in terms of having consistent and well established prerequisitues..  The actual term is antisocial personality disorder, anyone that tells you other wise is literally using information decades old

HELICOPTER BITCH!!!
Howard did get badgered in the end tho
He won’t badger him but instead he’ll “Skinny Pete” him 🙃
You are not a real hitman!
I won’t badger him. I’ll just talk to him and let him know the skinny. Pete that is.
My heart sank when the laser appeared on his forehead.
"Laser pointers at Walt's college buddies? Why not an online course? What a joke!"
Lalo ran into the apartment to save him but it was too late
Hey, how are my favorite... DIOS MIO! What happened?
He just wanted to talk

And Hector Salamanca at the DEA.
He wasnt convicted. Anyway, people can be convicted criminals and still be attorneys. I've met people with felony drug convictions who still got their state bar license.
Chuck got him off. It was several years before. It was in another state.
Being honest about your sordid past goes a long way with the bar.  They’re looking for transparency and a willingness to accept responsibility for your actions.  It’s okay to have done some bad things (within reason) as long as you don’t try to conceal them.
He had Pastor Hansford vouch for his impeccable human character.
I knew a guy who passed the character committee after being convicted of a violent hate crime.
They passed the bar???
Chuck DID WHAT
AA def works on some people
I got him off! And I shouldn't have! I should have edged him when I had the chance! And you, you have to edge him, you-"
And they get to be lawyers? What a sick joke!
“What are you, my high school girlfriend, five fingers, no waiting?”
Did he get him off through a sunroof?
Son, Chuck gave Saul the best legal representation that money could buy.
I AM NOT CRAZY! I am not crazy... I know he colored those glasses...!

Good Gould!
As a colorblind person, the arrows - THEY DO NOTHING!
Holy shit, I just realized that’s Saul
No it may have been my single favorite moment of the entire series.
Lmaoooo
OK all jokes aside I didn’t even notice the cigarette on first watch
I didn't at the first watch
Hmmm sorry… Should I add more? Maybe that would help.
?? did you even watch the show that's Gene
What cigarette? What do I watch to see it? One of the last episodes or is it one of the season intro's? Cause I've watched all of them atleast 3 time probably more and never noticed anything.
The way they turn around and both wave
2005 Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution (AKA the "Evo 8") is Ernies car- The Blue Sedan      and the car next to that is Kims car a 2000 Mitsubishi Eclipse
Not flushing
Irene Landry. Ok, not necessarily a crime. But that's the worst that he's done.
Defending Lalo Salamander and going down the "bad choice road."
HE DEFECATED THROUGH A SUNROOF!
He couldnt keep his hands out of the Cash drawer
Alleged theft of cucumber water.
I mean Chuck killed himself by his own choice since he went mad, Howard was unfortunate circumstances, Kim left because she couldn't handle the life anymore, Walt went mad with power.   Irene Landry was just awful to watch. That's the worse Jimmy has done, the lowest I've ever seen him.
Teaming up with Walter White.
Irene Lander because when we got to know Jimmy McGill back in S1, he was known as the voice of the elderly. He fought tooth and nail for them with Sandpiper and was usually helpful to them with their wills and what not. Then when he betrayed her, he closed that part of himself. Then when he was about to kill Marion, he stopped himself.  Then raising Chuck’s insurance was another big one too. He actually kept that a secret from Kim for yeaaaaars. She never knew about it and I imagine that was his biggest cross to bear.
OBVIOUSLY depriving that old lady of her friends, I wanted to spit in Jimmy's face for the first time in my life.
Playing the bagpipes.      Playing them badly is an aggravating factor.
Being mean to Irene
what he did to Irene filled me with so much rage
Kimmy
I would say Howard  Because Howard seemed to always like Jimmy but just to keep Chuck happy he did what he did  Howard was deeply misunderstood by Jimmy.  Kim- Made her own choices so Jimmy is not completely to blame Chuck- Had bad intentions Lalo- He was a crime boss after all Walter- Well
His awful combover by BB and his gaudy home decor. But he did come through clutch with the snack bowl for the sex workers he frequented. 🤔🤷🏽‍♂️
he defecated through a sunroof
Looking so fly
Dragging the people around him into the life of crime that he chose for himself.
it’s easily helping walter.
Irene.
Most of these things are terrible consequences from relatively mild actions, which is really the story of Jimmy’s life. I think Howard’s the only case where there was a clear decision to do significant harm. Obviously Jimmy and Kim didn’t intend for him to get murdered, but they were perfectly fine fucking up the man’s life to the point where everyone who knew him best (with the exception of his estranged wife) was willing to believe he’d kill himself. And unlike most of the cases where the bad decision comes after things spiral out of control, here Jimmy and Kim could easily have stopped at any time.
his haircut
howard for sure. saul goodman is an S tier character but jimmy is a C tier character, i just despise him so much.
He left his fly open after the Asian lady was in his office and Jessie walked in on it
The suits
Murdering 10 people in prison duh
He deceived and ruined Kim Wexler.
His worst crime is getting Kim to drag along in all of this. Of course there would be no show, but this is the worst of all. He ruined her.
not just killing irene. lady deserved it
Caring too much.
The worst crime were shown imo is aiding in the manufacturing and sale of methamphetamines.
Kim
Making his brother mentally ill.
By the time Jesse and Walt meet Jimmy/Saul, his go-to solution for Badger being arrested is to hire someone to kill Badger in jail. Unless maybe you don’t count “Saul” crimes as Jimmy’s, it’s pretty hard to decide what is his worst!
HE DEFECATED THROUGH A SUNROOF
not crime but i couldn’t get over what they did to howard
Careing
by convincing us that he was a likeable character
Irene was the worst thing he ever did
His harassment and trying to frame Howard
Nightmare blunt rotation right there
stealing my heart
Drinking cucumber water that was only for customer!
The lighting becoming darker over the seasons 👌
Every time you flush a toilet, you waste a gallon of water. A gallon! What could be greener than this?
And we’re not talking about a number one!
What a big boy Chandler! Fill me up! Mmm. Ahhh.
Irene is the sole reason I talk myself out of rewatches. I can't go through that again.
ok, don't really need to reply if the answer is already here
I of course meant Salamanca but imma leave it as "salamander"
Sal Goodman defended Jorge de Guzman an upstanding family man.  I don’t know what you’re talking about with “Lalo”.
I think it was getting the money. Defending Lalo the way he did was illegal and unethical but he was still acting as a lawyer. Getting the money he was a bagman.
Not just defending him.  He committed fraud to get the mass killer released on bail.
AND I SAVED HIM!
Oh not Jimmy it couldn’t be our precious Jimmy
Disgraceful! That water is for paying customers only!
Kim actually could very well handle the life. That’s what bothered her.
They still went out and risked themselves just to ruin his reputation and firm, that's not to be taken mildly
Well, he later glibly suggests murdering Badger, Jesse and Hank, in a manner that suggests he has arranged such things before.  So, I am pretty sure he has done worse things than the horrible thing he did to Irene.
say my name
Who's Marion again?
Chuck trying to defraud the insurance company was his own fault tbh
I don't think Saul had anything to do with that.  That was Walt and Jack and his crew.     But, it was pretty clear from Saul casually suggesting the murders of Badger, Jesse and Hank that he had arranged the murders of witnesses before.
“Ruined”? What is this the 1840s????
They're low flow toilets Jimmy! From now on flush.
l cutting your shower time in half would do it even if you took a 2 minute shower.
Yes, thank you Erin.
B-9 We got good news that the tumor is B-9... thats B-9 everyone
For me it's a combination of this and howard. As much as I love his performance, he's arguably the best part of the show, subsequent watches just make me want to cry when he's on screen.
Damn auto correct
Salamander money! Salamander blood!!
Lalo? Who's "Lalo"?
Regarding that; before he changed his mind and agreed to do it, I seem to recall Jimmy first saying he was uncomfortable with the idea and probably not the right person for the job, to which Lalo gave the appearance of being amenable and ready to relieve him of the responsibility.   My question, and perhaps it's been discussed on this sub reddit before: If Jimmy proceeded to leave once Lalo agreed that maybe he wasn't the right guy, would he have been relieved of ever having to do it with no reprisals for being not being non-compliant? Or was Lalo just placating him, wagering that he'd change his mind due to the money he'd otherwise make.
But nobody knew he was a ”mass” killer, he just killed that one guy!
Took him into my own firm!
Stealing them blind!
Yeah Kim left because she realized what was happening to her after Howard.
And they helped cover up the murder lol
Yeah I pointed this out above.
I really wonder what kind of shit Saul got up to between BCS and BB. Mike was his private detective but I doubt Mike ever when to consult with Jimmy about the larger drug empire as Gus was keeping that locked down to only a few people (except for a couple of petty drug dealers who were using children, that was the one noticeable flaw in Gus’s attempts to remain anonymous). I really think Walt was Saul’s first major criminal enterprise he got involved with, other than the events of Better Call Saul. Much like Walt, it’s very likely Saul was in over his head stepping into a much larger world he used to not be apart of.  I guess he did have the little book of criminals that he probably utilized to help his clients or pull off scams, but I always assumed most of that was “petty crime” at least compared to what he ended up being involved with. Mike probably stuck around Saul just because the events of BCS made him somewhat of a liability after witnessing the Howard murder and parts of the Fring empire.
I don’t know if he’s arranged it before but at that point in time he’s calling out their shitty logic which they hoped they could scare him into not noticing
you're sussy baka...

I think lalo knew he was going to say yes for money. He is letting Saul think it was his idea.
WHAT WAS I THINKING
and he gets to be a lawyer??
Like every character in the show, she liked it because she was good at it. They were both good at it. It’s more that she knew their relationship only brought destruction and suffering to those around them.
You’re got damn right
Goof. I know you spent all my Robux...
Ah right
And the way she drops her prize and runs off crying. My heart nearly gave up
I feel like this isn’t discussed enough, wasn’t Jimmy basically forced to do what he did? If a cartel boss pick you up in a car, makes you drop your ice cream cone, and tells you to represent him, are you really in any position to refuse? His fate was sorta sealed back in season one when he tried to pull that stunt with the skate board kids and ended up crossing paths with Tuco and Nacho. The domino effect of seemingly small things seasons later is such a cool part of this show.
HE'LL NEVER CHANGE! EVER SINCE HE WAS 9
WHAT A SICK JOKE!
Just like what the final words Chuck said to Jimmy.
I did it for me.
The thing is that if he chose not to do it, Lalo would have no reason to seek retribution. Like Nacho said in that S1 encounter, killing a lawyer is bad for business. Jimmy had done all he had been asked to up until that point, and it was clear that he wasn't going to rat. So why kill a now notorious lawyer on US soil for saying no to a job that isn't even in his general wheelhouse? It'd be way too much unnecessary risk and attention drawn to cartel activities. I firmly believe that Jimmy could have said no and walked out alive, even if he had to continue being Lalo's lawyer/ended up taking the fall for Lalo skipping bail, like he almost did in S6E3. Him choosing to take the money was the moment he let pure greed and pride rule his decision making, beyond any moral boundaries he had broken before.
BUT NOT OUR JIMMY! COULDN'T BE PRECIOUS JIMMY!
I should’ve stopped him when I had the chance!
STEALING THEM BLIND!
AND HE GETS TO BE A LAWYER?!?!
AND HE GETS TO BE A LAWYER?!
WHAT A SICK JOKE!!!
Someone please say the line.
WHAT A SICK JOKE
I SHOULD HAVE STOPPED HIM WHEN I HAD THE CHANCE!
Mike is the villian in Beverly Hills Cop
It looks like Howard
I immediately recognized him by his voice when he was on BCS - I remembered him from Saved By The Bell.
He played an unscrupulous college professor in Veronica Mars as well. He's very good at straddling the line between charming and smarmy.
Is that Dennis Reynolds?!
“ greatest college mind I ever knew”
I remember watching this as a kid and finding the professor really creepy, and now I’m struggling to process all this.
My initial reaction to seeing him on Saul was oh it’s professor Laskey
At first glance I thought this was Hayden Christensen and I was on a Star Wars subreddit.
He's also in the episode of Friends when Phoebe has the triplets.  The male nurse that flirts w/ Monica.
Mike is an ATC controler in *Airplane !* The one that checks the turkey into the micro-wave oven radar.   Now you know why Wayfarer 515 happened. Mike was in the game.
Bro I swore this was Aaron Paul and was confused why it was on this sub
Rewatching Dexter recently, I was reminded after wondering for so long, where it was I'd seen Jonathan Banks as he pretty much looks in BrBa/BCS.   Towards the end of S2 he appears in two episodes as FBI Deputy Director Max Adams who arrived in Miami to take the lead in the 'Bay Harbor Butcher Case.'
He's also a gang leader who can't die on this penal colony planet in an early episode of Star Trek Deep Space Nine
I freaking love BHC! Part 3 was filmed at the theme park I grew up going to in Santa Clara.
And the “what an asshole” guy from Airplane!
It is! His speech cadence is exactly the same, and his voice is the exact same. Just roughly 30 years younger. Totally possible a story could be written connecting the two characters. From professor to big time lawyer, pushed out of California because of high taxes most likely. Or maybe he has a dark past and offed Kelly when she married Zack?
Now that is impressive. I had totally forgotten about him being on SBTB. I love how his resistance to Kelly lasted all of two minutes, but not nearly as much as I loved how Slater for the first time in his life realized he was Mexican.
Me too!
He played a role once where his death was so shocking I just stared at my screen with a blank expression for a looooooong time
Smarming?
Holy crap it does look like him, but this guy is actually hanging out with Lalo right now.
He's a 5 star man
Is he one of the nurses Rachel asks out?
Aaron Paul was in better call Saul, yo, although he may have been little young to be with Kelly.
He’s also Ben Wyatt’s dad on parks and rec, but everybody knows that one already
My elementary school was right down the street from great America so we all got a field trip to be extras! I’m in scene in the background haha
Dude! He got caught bangin students and then had to learn the zen self-control stuff. Namaste
I wanna hear out of context Saved by the Bell audio clips layered over Howard talking (some r/okbuddychicanery stuff)
He wanted a law career in LA, out of the shadow of his dad (who had mocked “cultural anthropology” and had dared him “see if you can hack a real job like law”), but during a crucial deposition his client dropped their unopened can of ginger ale. Howard nervously scooped it up and, with a winning, overconfident smile, opened it into a document destroying spew onto the table.   Hat in hand, along with the New Mexico bar study guide, he returns to ABQ and HHM. At the end of the first episode, Chuck consoles him while teaching him a trick he would never forget.
He has a really unique way of speaking, so I recognized that before his face lol.
A perfectly cromulent word.
No, he asks out Monica.
For two scenes yo
He is also Jay’s brother in Modern Family
Feel like we need to mention Wiseguy here:::
We're a Twizzlers family
Don’t forget community
lol I know I’m just being a douche
Is he really? Just started rewatching that the other day. Didn’t register the first time through.
I just found out Cam’s dad is mr acker
I love how Jay is a watered down Al Bundy. Here’s an interesting fact that, had it happened today, would have instantly resulted in the cancellation of Married With Children. Not sure how familiar you are with that show but there’s an episode where they’re at a high school football game and Polk High is playing a school with the nickname “Aryans” and one of their players is named Hitler. Still can’t believe it when I hear it. And I can’t find anything online about it to this day.
So good! Kinda groundbreaking for its time really.
Alan Alda
Never thought about this before, but I bet Michael Keaton would’ve made some great choices with the character. That said, to me McKean gives maybe the best performance in the entire BrBa universe so hard to imagine anyone but him in that role. Plus, the resemblance between him and Bob really sells the brotherhood.
I'd like to see Emma Watson give it a shot
Nooooobody!
Saulsuit
I've been looking for Saul suits for a while and they're pretty hard to find
Saul suit man
Better call saul fans when they notice water is w3t ⛄️ 🐖 🍊 🔥 📛 👩‍🚒 🚒
Doesn't he have them tailor-made, like his duplicate Howard suit?
https://cineb.app/episode/better-call-saul-season-6-episode-1/  Enjoy
If you’re in the US it’ll be on Netflix in a couple weeks.
Better call saul fans when they don't know how to Google seasons ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)(•_•)   ( •_•)>⌐■-■   (⌐■_■)┬──┬◡ﾉ(° -°ﾉ)
Doesn’t Netflix start showing S6 from 18 April in your country? You just need to wait a couple of weeks.
There were some people who wondered if Season 6 would just start up in Breaking Bad timeline.  Lalo is out there plotting vengeance while hiding. Kim and Saul are running the criminal lawyer practice while they plot against Howard. Nacho is now a major player in the  cartel and in Mexico helping Don Eladio's organization while Tuco is up north.
Bittersweet - I’m just glad the Season 5 finale wasn’t actually the end 😅.  But I already read about the death of the next person to kick the bucket and I’m annoyed!
Don't worry, I was in the same boat as you but it didn't ruin the experience for me. There was literally a thumbnail with an explicit spoiler on video that had like 5 million views on youtube get recommended to me before I even started the show. The thing that got spoiled still came as a surprise to me, and I don't think it will ruin your experience too much for the final season if you anticipate what's next. Who knows, maybe the spoiler was just a click bait lie, or you misread something. Don't sweat it.
No thanks
No.
how to make, a pimento cheese sandwich  buy yourself some pimento cheese, and some white bread. you take 2 slices of bread, and, you spread, the correct amount of cheese, like so. then, you close, and you’re done. congratulations
Use code "Takovic 10" for 10% off your next order.
He actually makes the comment, to Walt in BB, “If I'm lucky, a month from now, best case scenario, I'm managing a Cinnabon in Omaha.” :)
I had my first one the night of the BCS finale 😊
I tried it bcuz of Frank. It’s so good.
My husband thinks Cinnabon is disgusting but I think you gotta eat like 1/3 of one so you don't feel sick from the heavy super sweet sugar and fat. I haven't seen one in a mall in years.
I love cinnabon but ironically the only one I don't like is the main roll, too much bread
Hungover AF and flying somewhere is the best Cinnabon occasion. It’s science.
I love the single cinnamon rolls, the six packs usually lose something that the single ones have. I've only had the six pack one my whole life, then one day when I was out with my friends I tried the single classic bun and I ascended.
I live in Omaha and ironically, there are no longer any Cinnabons within city limits.  :( There are a few in the outer suburbs (Bellevue and Gretna).
Those little bite sized or two bite sized ones are absolutely delicious - anything bigger is just sugar overload.
Wish I knew how to make these. Can’t even do bread though. Haha!
I live in the UK and I had no idea we had Cinnabon over here. Massive surprise when I wandered into a supermarket I don't usually visit (Asda) and saw a Cinnabon! Did end up buying a couple as a treat to myself while S6 was on.   They are delicious. Expensive, but worth it. Feel like there are worse places to work!
 Dude i actually got hooked on cinnamon buns because of BCS, I saw how good they looked on the show so I went to my towns mall and devoured a 2 cinnamon buns in one sitting. I now cannot go to the mall without copping a couple of these bad boys. Bravo Vince
I always thought Cinnabun was at every mall not just in ABQ. It was not until I started watching Brb/BCS I discovered that many people have never heard of it or thought it was created for the show. I feel sorry for those who have yet to try a Cinnabun with that delicious cream cheese frosting.
Now read the calories and prepare to have your mind blown.
This is an airport staple for me. When I travelled to Vegas a few weeks ago, I made sure to get one of the ride to and the ride back.  Nothing like pretending you’re on the run from law enforcement under an assumed identity and having a Cinnabon to really hammer the fantasy home.
They made the restaurant from the show into a real thing?!!!!!1
Cinnabon had 1 single store in my country. They left almost 10 years ago.  That's my only mandatory stop whenever I travel to the US.   Yeah, we do have Cinnamon Rolls here, but they are nothing like Cinnabon.  Watching BCS was always a torture for whenever Gene was around.
BRING BACK CINNABON IN ALBANIA I MISS THE PECAN ROLL MORE THAN MY OWN FAMILY I know I was the only customer but still
I can't get Cinnabon in my country ;(
r/hailcorporate
Americans don't realize how spoiled they are when it comes to food. Cinnabon is a small yet significant part of it.
Caramel and pecans please!
Oh, I feel just so sad for you. I don't remember how young I was when I first enjoyed the magic that is Cinnabon. But it was certainly before I was old enough for Reddit or Better Call Saul. You need to make up for lost ground! Welcome to the club buddy!
Same way as u did. Its delicious!
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAA
I ate these all the time when wandering thru my digestion self destruction phase of teenagerdom. The amount of sugar in one is absolutely insane. Someday I'm gonna buy one more to split four ways with my family, but otherwise they're off the menu for me. Definitely good,.definitely addictive, definitely will leave me shitting my brains out later that night.
never had it but the stuff in the show had way too much icing
I can tear through some cinnabun cinnamon rolls. Those things are heaven in your mouth. Damn I want some now, I better call Saul.
I find it ironic that his ambitions in the mailroom of HHM ultimately lead him straight back to a menial job in a mall food court
How is it ironic when thats the definition of a sweet life
Cinnabon marketing team better be getting some good bonuses
If you like cinnabons, try the original Swedish kanelbulle. I'm very biased (and not used to the extreme sweetness of American food), but the Swedish version is IMO much better.
I stumbled across a Cinnabon in my country (Japan) and was surprised to try. I ate two bites and then brought home the rest of that Cinnabon for other family. It is just too sweet and rich for us though . . . we tried but that was enough for this life. 🤷‍♂️
Cinnabon is fantastic.  I live near a mall that isn't dying so we will get the occasional delicious cinnamon bun.
Dude, I hit Cinnabon whenever I'm at the airport, I can get through about a 3rd of one
Oh hello there, my it's been a long, long time...
really? the ones with cum on them??? sincerely, a swede
Why would you have to tell us you’re not going to lie about the tastiness of the treat? Why would you consider lying about this? What would you have to hide or gain?
R/shitpost
I had one after binge watching the season finale. I thought they tasted pretty gross, overly filling and the sugar is almost scratching your teeth. Really over the top sweet.   I had one years ago, but had forgotten how they tasted (remarkably exactly the same for the original ones, but they also had some updated flavors).
This thread gave me diabetes
I tried Cinnabon for the first time back in January in one of my trips and it was good, I wish there was a shop in my town.
The CORRECT amount of cheese
Hola Amigos, so today I’m gonna show you how to make a taco so savory, so spicy, so Salamanca.  You’ll drown your own brother just for a taste.  That of course was a joke
Cinnabon is criminally good. You take that first bite and you instantly realize it’s one of the best things you’ve had while simultaneously can just FEEL that your going to go into a diabetic coma if you ate too much. If you’ve had it you absolutely understand why it was used on the security guards because you know those guys wives probably forbade it.
outchicaneried once again, vravo Bince
The previous winner of the Breaking Kitchen!! Amazing!
Huh?
Is this really? I will try
wow i forgot about that. i wonder if he asked vacuum guy for this job specifically
Funny because he was actually upset when the vacuum cleaner guy told him he would be going to Nebraska lol
Kind of a dumb move to tell Walt of all people where you're going into hiding lol
Ooooh I love that
I could only manage the weekend after. I've never had such a cathartic treat.
I wonder if he kept hanging out with the security guys and bringing them cinnabon after he had completed his scheme with Jeff and the other dude.
Who's Frank?
They started selling small ones. The texture isn't quite right, but at least you don't need to bring a group with you to eat it
I had the cinnamon roll. It was very delicious
They have cinnamons in airports??! 🤩🤩
I haven't tried the six pack but I will and report back. I found the single cinnamon roll perfect 🥰🥰
Me too. I'm a terrible bakerrr
Rhodes makes pretty good frozen ones. They're actually yeasted and rise after you thaw them out so they taste pretty fresh compared to Pilsbury.  Not 100% as good, but they get the job done.
If I ate two in one sitting i think i would be like Fry after the 300th cup of coffee. Then I'd probably die of a heart attack right after that. Or at least have diabetes at the end of the day.
I love it sm 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Stfu it’s in basically every season of the show. It’s a major location and plot point. Blame the writers not OP.
?
I’m an American living in the UK and they opened up a Cinnabon in the Walmart equivalent about 2 years ago. Was a dream come true 😂😂
It's my new favorite🥰🥰🥰
Here you go ma’am 🥮
Irony yo!
:) You did well to keep some for the other life. You have to prepare provisions for the the eternity.
General Kenobi
...is as much as you'd like, because cheese sandwiches are always a treat! :)
A time machine?! A meaningless question. Look, time travel, the kind of time travel that you're thinking of, is a scientific impossibility. It would violate the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Oh, Christ. Are you kidding me?! Quantum mechanics? We're discussing that now?!  STAY IN YOUR LANE
If you haven’t seen How To Make a Pimento Cheese Sandwich with Mike Ehrmantraut you’re missing out
LMAO SHHH
haha no sorry, I was kidding. If I worked there then yes, but unfortunately I don't.
Tell them “I need a dust filter for a Hoover Max extract pressure pro model 60. Can you help me with that?” Then wink at them 3 times.  They will bring you to their basement with unlimited supply of Cinnabon.   This, this IS real. Try it
I'm guessing the vacuum guy told him that's what is available
It's better than New Hampshire lol
Frank was the mall security guard that Gene/Saul was bringing Cinnabon to every night.
Nice, last time I was there I got a free roll from a sleezy manager who looked awfully similar to some lawyer I've seen in commercials before
i’ve had Cinnabon many times in my life but only as of a few days ago did i know they have them in airports. I think it was LaGuardia where we saw one and of course i had to get a roll
They have one at the Vegas airport for sure
It's kinda their thing. They get customers by making the whole food court of airports and malls smell good.
r/bakingbad  Edit: dang I didn't think it would be a real sub.
Please mjaft pe çdo koment që bëj haha
Meanwhile they’re all closing in the states 😭
Congratulations!!! 🎉🎈🍾🎊
When BCS was still going I went to Asda in Bristol, bought a Cinnebon and watched an episode on my phone in the car. An immersive experience.
The good ending
Oh, you are not talking about a time machine, which would be a scientific impossibility. You’re asking about regrets. So if you want to ask about regrets, ask about regrets and put all this time traveling nonsense behind us.
Dang. I was excited 😭😭
Confirmed OP, I'm now in Florida with a beard. Poorer, but safer.
That's actually probably what did happen
Is it?
wtf? New Hampshire is a charming New England state with mountains, skiing, a coast, maple trees, etc.
you mean Jerry?
Ohh I forgot his name
Careful. He sounds like a sussy
Hahaha ok, no more bothering
I didn’t like that response from Walter because I know for a fact that time travel is scientifically possible. It’s not even a theory, if one was to travel at the speed of light, they would literally travel through time faster than someone walking down the street and that person is moving through time faster than someone sitting in a chair.   It’s actually really interesting to think about, like even if someone traveling in a car and a person walking are technically traveling through time at different speeds what does that mean tho? Sure it’s a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a millisecond, it’s hard to grasp.
Being around crackheads makes you feel safe?
When did Saul say that again? Vacuum guy would *NEVER* spill the deets of a life before the customer paid and was on their way. But I think perhaps it was once him and Walt were waiting for transpo to their new lives
In that moment, it probably made very little sense to tell Walter White where you might be headed, and therefore I consider that to be a bit of a plot hole.
nah
Isn't Garry?  Or Larry?  Aw geez...
But did you time yourself eating it? Did you finish it in under three minutes?! 🤣
Thought it was Larry or maybe Barry
Is it scientifically possible to travel at the speed of light?
That's why he says "the time traveling you're thinking of"
He said it to walt while they were in the vacuum guys basement, just moments before Saul was called away to never be seen again (in breaking bad)
More like a thematic nod. If you watch it in BB, it’s a throwaway comment intended to be an example of how his future life might be mundane and trivial. If you watch it in BCS, it’s that comment stretched out, fully realized and elaborated upon.   Artistic license, if you will. But, not in a blasé sense or an ironic statement, a real life walking, talking masterpiece.
No, Frank, the older guard that was always talking Nebraska football with Gene.  He was hilarious and has some great lines.
So it has been a while since I took astronomy in school but I know for a fact we had a whole chapter of hypothetically time travel and how things could be created as well as that speed thing I mentioned. I’m on my way to my office right now so I can’t find an article but I can try when I get there
INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR MEANINGFUL ANSWER.
Oh that’s true I forgot about that, but even then, doesn’t it seem off character for Walt to say something is outside the realms of science, I’m sure it was a purposeful writing choice to show how different Walt was by the time him and Saul where in the bunker.
Sorry, bhison and I were referencing the other role that the actor, Jim O'Heir, who plays Frank is probably best known for...Jerry (Larry or Garry) Gergich on Parks n Rec.
I didn’t see that show. Hence my ignorance.
yep
Someone's watching some 💦
yep
I knew it! They orchestrated it!
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGill\_University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGill_University)  The University of McGill, Canada ? online mind control courses ? what a sick joke !
I knew it
The CIA ! They will never change. They will never change !
**[McGill University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGill_University)**     >McGill University (French: Université McGill) is an English-language public research university located in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Founded in 1821 by royal charter granted by King George IV, the university bears the name of James McGill, a Scottish merchant whose bequest in 1813 formed the university's precursor, University of McGill College (or simply, McGill College); the name was officially changed to McGill University in 1885. McGill's main campus is on the slope of Mount Royal in downtown Montreal in the borough of Ville-Marie, with a second campus situated in Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, 30 kilometres (19 mi) west of the main campus on Montreal Island.   ^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/betterCallSaul/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)

Dang. April 18 is my birthday.  My birthday and you got to buy it.  What a sick joke.
tbf would look better without release date but its still awesome
I just saw this on TikTok, I don’t even know where this trend came from lol
This is the most uncanny valley a deep fake/ai generation has ever looked imo
The Chicanery
What the fuck is this
The cousins or just 2 handsome squidward
only the very best... with just the right amount of creepy
Why am I so uncomfortable
If David lynch had made breaking bad
When GUS said 'Did I do that?' I literally cried..
Saul and Gus already were fashion icons before it became Balenciaga
So uncanny!
Hank looked like Will Sasso 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I am too high for this
What the fuck this needs to disappear
What in the flaming hell is this horseshit
Hank looks exactly like Will Sasso
you think this deep fake is bad? He's done worse
Ok so when does the porn part start?
It looks like it was created with AI! Crazy!
u/savevideobot
LOL
What a bunch a freeks
I will now stay up all night for fear of seeing this in my sleep
Wtf did i just watch
I love how Krysten Ritter looks exactly like Krysten Ritter.
I don’t know what the hell this is, but i like it.
Is this a real ad?
This isn't even remotely related to Better Call Saul
This is mildly anxiety inducing
Omg this is amazing. But terrifying in the same way.
I can't lie this is the worst one. I like looking at the goofy outfits they churn out and all this one shows is the shoulders and up 😭
Since when did Walt start a sex ring
Monstrous!🥺
aw hell nah they whitewashed the $500 twin and the other one
Why does Walt look like bald Melon Man?
This look like a new trailer for a Wachowski movie + Breaking Bad lol
This is peak internet right here.
Salamnka did
This is off on so many levels
Why are people posting stuff that’s breaking bad related on the better call Saul sub
Lost it at Mike's last dialogue.
I hate the head tillllllllllt
Mike looking like a stretched out Alexander Volkanovski.
Omg what did they do to my boy Huel!!! T_T
Badass hahaha
A bunch of handsome squidwards.
I’m starting to think it’s their PR team trying to repair the damage done last year. That being said, the second Harry Potter one was hilarious.
I’m here for it. 💯
Yeah Is there an app I can use or site? I’d like to make my cats and friends Balenciaga. Not sure if that’s a real brand or what but they have done some successful marketing it’s on every subreddit.
Balenciaga bad
better buy balenciaga
Breaking Balenciaga
Breaking Bad
I’d watch that
you are dreaming, none of this is real

how is Breaking Bad not remotely related to BCS
What bad PR?
DemonFlyingFox uploaded a tutorial in his YouTube channel
Or it [could](https://youtu.be/Ltan0ocoDGg) be a guy messing around with AI?
How dare you ask that and upset the reddit police ^^^/s
🤦‍♀️this literally isn't the Breaking Bad sub. If the content you post here is only relevant to Breaking Bad, then by definition, it is only fit for the Breaking Bad sub, not the BCS sub. It doesn't matter that they're in the same universe. That's like going to r/Avengers and posting your review of the movie Iron Man 3. Yeah, sure, you can argue it's "remotely" related, but you're in the wrong damn subreddit.
The cp scandal
Conspiracy nutters went wild when they made an ad featuring kids as the models. The kids themselves weren’t dressed in a weird way, but the teddy bear handbags they were displaying were wearing leather harnesses, which gave bdsm vibes to people.  Then to top it all off, one of the documents used as a background prop, specifically in the pictures with the Adidas handbag, were pages from a US Supreme Court case concerning CP. Balenciga pulled the ad completely, and conservative talking heads wouldn’t stop talking about how the company was sexualizing children, grooming them, questioning if they were promoting pedophilia, overall a PR nightmare.  Personally, the whole thing seems overblown to me, are the kids with the bears weird, yeah, they’re like 6 y/o’s who have no business modeling. The bears themselves personally feel more goth/scene than straight bdsm, even if the those group and themes aren’t exactly opposites.   As for the cp Supreme Court case, either they just had really bad luck when someone called for public domain documents as part of the set dressing, or someone thought they were being funny on set and thought that no one would notice.
No it's definitely the pedo conspiracy thing
Umm I think you can do that   Edit: I literally found a daredevil post and a post about a new Disney show (your analogy sucks)
That seems like astronomical bad luck, and anybody who finds humour in real life court cases of that nature needs a bullet in the brain. Let's face it, they tried to push the boundaries of what they thought was edgy and it backfired. Who knows, maybe there is some ill intentions in the undertones there, seems equally as likely as your defense of the campaign to me.
Because PR firms can't hire people
Don’t get me wrong, I’m not trying to defend them too hard, they sell overpriced and largely impractical clothes and merch, but the bears really just feel like hot topic rather than anything immodest, and I understand  kinda what they were going with by using kids (your inner child wants this).  But as for the document, yeah, that’s a large fuckup, no defense for it if it was intentional, although edgy art usually is intentionally edgy and doesn’t try and hide it.
Yeah you're right, this is deffinitely a stealth meme PR campaign done by Balanciaga by paying a YouTuber to make Breaking Bad AI videos in order to cover up weird pedo ads from last year. This is the most logical conclusion.
Oh, so Werner thinks Mike was going to blow him up?  But then after he fixes the faulty wire, doesn't he then escape?  If he was afraid Mike was going to kill him before, he wasn't as afraid afterwards?
He was dealing with explosives. Werner's reaction is pretty normal if you ask me.
Yea seems like a stretch
That moment when Mike says to Werner "Aur wiedersehen your nazi balls" 💯
Dude.. he was scared of going boom. Yall crazy
When he first realized someone would have to go down, he made sure it was him, not Kai to go down. He believed he was protecting Kai by going down himself. If it was a setup for Kai, he could have been killed instead, depending on how the trap was setup. Mike even asks Kai: “I thought you were the demolition expert”.
Final season may spoil a lot  But yeah otherwise not too much of an issue
Not knowing what the hell is going.
If you go down that road, stop at “fun and games”
Watching BB first was a big reason why I binged BCS so fast once I got past the first couple of seasons, I just *had* to know what happened to Kim and why her name was never mentioned at all
Hank dying gets ruined, there are a few minor things here and there too but that’s the biggest it’s not really a spoilers thing for me, it’s that BCS hits harder when you’ve seen BB/El Camino first
Because one came before and the other came after.  And the one that came after was made with the assumption that you knew the characters.  I mean, you don't even exactly find out why Gus hates the cartel so much, save I guess a brief hinted mention in a Mexico scene, why? because you know from watching BB.  Also, just like watching the Star Wars prequels first spoils the very iconic "No, I am your father" quote (ok, it's so famous that everyone knows about it anyway), watching BCS first spoils the first iconic meeting of Walt and Gus.  The entire point of BCS is to expand the story of characters you already knew. It would just be weird to know those characters first and then experience them as background characters to a suddenly new protagonist (Walt).
Honestly I think it would spoil the experience, the quality jump from S6 BCS to BB S1 wouldn’t be so satisfying to watch
I feel like BCS would spoil a lot of breaking bad making the show not as impactful.
I don't know anyone who watched BCS but not BB so I can't speak for them, but there are so many references to BB and plotlines that only exist because of BB, that I think most of it would go over a new viewer's head.   In my opinion, to get the full effect you need to watch at least one of the two shows twice, because BB is much better after you've already seen BCS and BCS is much better if you've already seen BB. The difference is, BB without BCS will make so much more sense than BCS without BB  That being said, if you do choose to do BCS first, definitely save the final season or at least the 2nd half of it for after BB
>The only glaring issue that I can think of is the last few episodes of S6, which go into Post-BB. Other than that I see no reason why you couldnt get someone new to the universe watch BCS first then skip those last few episodes until after they finish BB.  This is what you must do if you go this route. Save the last 4 episodes until after Breaking Bad.
The reason is simple, she didn't exist in BB.
We all knew that. The excitement was about finding out the reason from a storytelling point of view.

Need a new den?  Better call Jen.
Slipping Jenny with a realtor's license is like a baboon with a taser!
Ha this is excellent!!!
Finding a new home? When to call Jen! (People love their rhymes)
Love it!
YES
Hahahahaha so accurate
Thank you!!
Thank you!
>his grandaughter won't get a single penny from him  Giving his daughter her money became the same excuse that Walt gave for his own activities.
I always thought Mike was sincere.
Mike likes to think he was sincere just like Walt liked to think so.
So you're Chuck Mcgill??
The scheme to out his condition as fake in front of the board would have been much more interesting.
Ok buddy, this is chicanery
Like Mike Pence?
“As to marriage or celibacy, let a man take which course he will, for he will be sure to repent.” — Socrates
I'm like that except for not being able to be around women, I can't be around humans in general... im allergic.
Guess I am Chuck McGill!
he just like me fr
"...per the Inverse Square law" 😂😂😂
So you're Chuck McGill?
call me chuck mcgill the way I'm mentally ill and want to kill myself
Chuck installs a microchip into everyone in Albuquerque so he can detect a woman from 100+ meters away and be able to evade with his life. then when Rebecca flew in during the chicanery rant she didn't have the microchip so chuck burst into flames. the end.
LMFAOOOOOOO
Incelectricity?
So you cover yourself with jizz or what?
Raj Koothrapalli?
Jimmy… do you have a woman in your pocket?
Damn if there were 3 more panels we’d have a good r/4panelcringe
Why
I don't think he has to worry lol
Are you crazy?
I love you.
I used to be a severe agoraphobic, I know exactly what chuck was struggling with (The whole electricity delusion wasn't part of my illness though, I wasn't denying reality, outside just really really sucks IMO. Maybe it was a way for chuck to have a rational "excuse" to justify a mental illness that isn't rational at all)
Gimmie Jimmy’s ass
Me irl
He's Jesse's real father according to Vince so why do people say that
HA
* Brings out the howiiiieeeeeee~ ladies from under his desk. *
Outchicaneried once again.
Exactly
He has femenine-hypersensitivity, it’s a real condition how many times must he show that he has pain from it.

Before showing it to your friend call Vince Gillian and ask him if he wants to shuffle it around.
I hear a lot that it's "not necessary ' but the entire show is based around the idea the viewer has seen Breaking Bad. I don't see how anyone could appreciate it fully without watching BB first. Showing a scene out of context seems like a bad idea.
> has in season 4 of breaking bad it's his entire motivation  There is an argument to be made that it wasn't Gus' sole motivation and perhaps not even his main motivation. More would be learned as you watch BCS. So no, it isn't necessarily a spoiler.
Yeah i didn't watched season 6 so maybe more is explained there, thanks
no chance
No, the latest project with Vince and Rhea isn’t related to BB/BCS.  I honestly don’t think they’d lie about that.
No. There is no spin-off in the works. The Vince Gilligan ABQ Universe of stories has come to an end. Fans will unfortunately have to learn to accept that.
What more is there to say about Kim Wexler and her story?
I want more goddamit!
BB and BCS had an amazing run. Why can't people let things be finished and have an end? No one wants any more spinoffs.
Her backstory is pretty much untouched apart from a couple flashbacks
I'm with you there Johnny
[removed]
She is from a small town and is just a lowly law student. Theres nothing to spin off
[removed]
There could be a sequel too, shut the absolute fuck up. Even Rae talks about how she believes she goes back into law, you are a moron

Only you want that you clown

It dug.
ever seen breaking bad, coz they show a lift down to the lab?
If you look closely, you can see traces of a tunnel that’s now been sealed up. Presumably they got the digger and building equipment in through there.
Yes
They assembled it down there.
But why did they seal up the tunnel instead of just using that to get in the whole time?
Probably because the tunnel was out in the open and the crew were at risk of being seen, so they didn’t want to use it more than they had to. Going through the laundry would’ve been safer because all the employees knew to not ask questions and look the other way.
Wow! We’re wearing the same outfit…I’m charmed.
The name's McGill. That's James McGill.
Super cool!
you apply watercolors so smoothly! do you use less water in your brush to get it to distribute like that? great work👍
love ur style
You have an amazing talent brother!
This is a cool style! Some constructive criticism though - to me his facial expression doesn’t look quite traumatized enough. This looks like “man, what a day at work!” rather than “I was just ambushed and nearly killed in the desert”
That's cool
Nice!!!!
amazing talent!!
That stain smells like pee, what gives?
So cool, you’re very talented
Nice work
Very nice! What I would add are some desert "pebbles", by flicking the brush at the paper, spraying it with little dots. I taught that to my kid and he decorated the bathroom mirror that way with toothpaste.
Caralho, parece o bolsonaro bicho kkkkkkk
coool looks great
Perfect!
I'll be honest. You lines and coloring and basically everything are insanely good. But that face doesn't look like saul at all. I'm not saying I can draw a better one, and making an accurate stylized version of someone's facial characteristics is probably very hard, so don't think I'm being judgy please, it's beautiful
Really cool style, looks great
Yo I love it
Great style!
With blood 🤨
Bro thinks he Saul 💀
Thanks
Yes...he also needs lots of dirt smeared on his cheeks and mouth.
Yeah its the nose
Yes, and overall I enjoyed BCS much more. I don't think i like any characters in BrB except for maybe Hank and sometimes Jesse
For me it was a very weird reversal.  In BrBa, I can't stand the cringe ass family shit with Skyler, Marie and Walt Jr. I always skip those scenes on my rewatches. The cartel drug stuff is just so much more interesting to me.  But in BCS, I just care so much more about Jimmy's family life and personal-professional life. The cartel stuff in BCS just doesn't hit for me, seems boring and forced half the time.  It was weird to me that I skip the family drama shit in BrBa in favor of the cartel stuff on rewatch, but on BCS rewatches I skip the cartel stuff in favor of the family+work drama.
I definitely find myself relating to someone like Kim or Jimmy or Howard way more than BrBa mains like Walt or Jesse. I think it’s because BCS is far more subtle in nature than BrBa. Jimmy’s arc in the show is something that I think a lot of people dead with in one way or another (perhaps not to the criminal levels). Neither are better than the other because of this. But BCS makes it easier for me to identify with them because it’s not so brash and crazy at times.
Yes, Walt was an inherently evil guy who was allowed to emerge from his shell.  Jimmy has a kind soul, but loses faith in himself and thinks all he is worth is the evil persona of Saul.  In the end, Walt secures the safety of his family, but its never about atonement, he just accepts that he is Heisenberg and embraces it.  Jimmy rejects Saul and decides to do the right thing.
I definitely relate more to Jimmy and Kim than Walt and Skyler for sure but I do relate more to Jessie than Nacho for instance.
That’s hardly surprising. It’s a much more down to Earth show.
I honestly feel like you're not supposed to like any of the characters in Breaking Bad. The way the show gets you to sympathise with Walt is by making everyone around him a jerk and while they're hardly evil people, you look at Skyler and Hank, Elliot and Gretchen, Mr eyebrows, and blame them for Walt being so beaten down. Even Walter Jr is a bit of a smartarse. After that you've got Jesse who's an idiot drug addict and the rest of the cartel people...   Having said that, all these characters undergo character development that makes them more relatable and sympathetic, while Walt gets more detestable throughout as not only does he get worse but you realise he's mostly to blame for his own shitty life at the start of the show.  However, if the cast of breaking bad was more likeable and relatable, the concept wouldn't work because to make you root for Walter, the world and people need to really suck. All these things together give him a moral right in the eyes of the audience to do all the terrible things he does and it's like a test to see how far you're willing to go with him. It straight up wouldn't work if the cast was mostly likeable and relatable.
BrBa characters were written to be hateable so we would be tricked to root for Walt IMO
I couldn't watch Breaking Bad to be honest. I saw a lot of it because my husband was watching it, and everything I saw was just like "oh these awful people again." That's not to say there weren't any exciting moments or redeeming qualities, I just don't like a show where people tend to dig themselves deeper and deeper into a hole of misery. BCS seemed to have a lot more levity which I need in my life. Sopranos was my favorite show  as a young adult, and the only way I made it through all the heavy stuff was the hilarious antics (Christopher and Paulie fighting over ketchup packets, Czechoslovakians line from Pine Barrens, Nostradamus line when Tony is talking to Bobby at the Diner etc.). Breaking Bad has a few funny moments sure, it just didn't do enough to lift the grimey depressing feel of the overall show. I didn't exactly root for Jimmy, but I understood his motivations and I definitely rooted for Kim, and Mike despite knowing his fate. I never understood Walter's motivations.
Idk. As an addict with some toxic family issues and me always being the scapegoat, I personally felt Jesse was very relatable. Pretty sure that's why he was my favorite character.
I think anyone that finished both would likely agree. Breaking Bad was like a writing class and BCS was the final exam. They’re similar but BCS was just better.
100% . I love this show so much
BrBa needs a Kim.
Oh absolutely. As much as I love Breaking Bad, the majority of the characters felt kind of cartoonish (including Marie, Walt Jr and Hank to an extent), and while they were undeniably well-written and I cared about them I didn't care even CLOSE To as much as I cared about Jim, Kim and Mike in BCS. That changed the whole ball game for me.  I think BCS had a lot more breathing room and time to let you go on a slow burn with each character.
if you're looking for really thrilling tense tv watch breaking bad, but if you want a much slower burn that focuses more on character growth and regression to provide entertainment, then go with bcs
BCS main cast are more relatable to me with their struggles but to me i will always prefer BrBa main cast for how entertaining and compelling they are.  I guess I'm still one of those people who prefer BrBa than BCS in almost every aspects.
How could you not like skylar and ted?
literally no characters in breaking bad outside the main cast have any substance
Same here! The family stuff was my least favorite aspect of BB, but it's my favorite of BCS.  Truly, I think BCS is just better written overall, and I say that as a massive BB fan.
>I never understood Walter’s motivations.  “I did it for me. I liked it. I was good at it. And I was really… I was alive.”
He did it for the family
Was Jesse not the Kim of BB? I mean, BCS >!even gave them a scene together at the end!<.
Fuck ted
Did anyone like Ted lol
I must say, during my last rewatch of breaking bad my hate for walt increased and in the case of Skylar it diminished, wasn’t that bad of a character as I initially thought, the worst she did was singing happy birthday and being cringey whilst doing it, also not reporting Walt to the authorities but nah, happy birthday was the worst part tbh.
I mean I didnt have a crush on Jesse!
Don't mind if i do.    🎶Happy birthday to you 🎶
I.F.T.
What's up with ted hate???? I loved Ted
Skylar is the worst. I hate that cheating bitch!!!!
NOOOOOOOO
Damn alright we found one. I thought you were being sarcastic in the earlier comment.  What's there to like? He's impulsive and dumb. Claims to care about his employees, and then puts all of them in danger by refusing to pay taxes on his business.
Skylar is the goat, Brock committed war crimes in Albania, is that your hero?
I would cheat on Walt too he's a scumbag
Ted is the best character in whole breaking bad universe.    Ted and Skylar > anyone else.
Brock is Brock
Fuck u
Waltuh cheated with finger first, it’s only fair
Noice
I thought their voices would crescendo
What country?
Seen it
She knows that Jimmy is connected to the cartels and is doing criminal activity for them. That knowledge alone makes her in the game.
Good post. Does the cartel have to know she is Jimmy's wife ? They don't until the middle of Bagman.
Mike knows and Gus knows that Kim is Jimmy's wife. Technically Gus is part of the cartel and hence cartel knows that she is Jimmy's wife.
I always forget that Gus knows who Jimmy is.  I guess he knows because Mike tells him.
Schnauz is right, Mike is absolutely not the kind of guy who uses "whom"
5x09 was my favorite episode of the season, so I was disappointed I couldn't get more out of the podcast.  &#x200B;  Also, this is the first time I also couldn't get more out of the podcast, for a finale, in 5x10, also.
:).  They would also fight over Mike's use of "Easy peasy" in 1x09, when Mike is telling Pryce what's going to happen when the pill swap occurs.  Mike doesn't think his character would say "easy peasy".  What do you think?  That continued the feud they have between them.  Schnauz would then say, "I'm going to write scenes for you where you're just sitting there eating a sandwich."  That kind of happened in 3x01, 3x02.
What episode from Breaking Bad has the Mike line "who going to kill who"?  Or maybe it's "who's going to kill who".
I agree with Schnauz on both counts. Banks might think his character is a little more suave than he really is. A huge part of Mike's appeal is that he's a grumpy boomer just as much as he's a dangerous assassin
This is so interesting, and must’ve taken quite some time! Thank you for this :)
Thank you! I’ll have to check out the podcast with my next rewatch. Now if only I could watch the series with fresh eyes 🥹
You're welcome.  I have notes for the other seasons.  I'm though 6x02 in my rewatch.  I'll have the season 6 notes when I'm done.
You're welcome.  I didn't discover the podcast until almost the end of season 5 in my original broadcast watch.  For the rewatch, I watch one episode, then listen to the podcast.  So when I listen to the podcast, the episode is fresh on my mind.  Then I go back and look for things I learned from the podcast that I might have missed.  Or if they talk about certain shots they filmed, and the cinematic challenges they had in filming those.
So like you thought it was going to be revealed that his name was actually finger?
Waltuh put your spoilers away Waltuh. I am not revealing my Name right now.
"I laid Finger on him"
You must've just missed it, I clearly remember when Mike revealed he was the kid named finger all along.
💀
This is incredible. 10/10, no notes.
This post should be marked as a spoiler for r/okbuddychicanery.
Lol this is awesome
[here’s](https://www.google.com/search?q=origin+of+kid+named+finger&rlz=1CDGOYI_enUS993US994&oq=origin+of+kid&aqs=chrome.2.0i512l8.6030j1j7&hl=en-US&sourceid=chrome-mobile&ie=UTF-8#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:784dd87e,vid:iHZp0oSqW5E) the video that cured my “kid named finger” confusion. Don’t feel bad, you’re not alone.
I thought there would be some cool backstory on how he came to be known as 'kid named finger' or something... or that there would be a character introduced as that and it would be revealed to have been mike all along or something i don't know man
For a long time, I actually thought that was the reference.
Best part is how the line isn't even 'I laid *a* finger', just 'finger'. Its like they knew.
There was a song and everything. "It was FingerMike all along...."🎶
🤣🤣🤣🤣  This is amazing!
Least clueless BCS fan:
It's mind-blowing that the meme appeared first and later people realized Saul says that and there's the finger over Mike shot, so good
I thought that scene was foreshadowing 😭
Jimmy's hair loss is an ongoing story point throughout the entire series.
We see in the season 6 cold open that Saul was taking  noxidil (a drug for hair loss treatment). And while it worked somewhat in giving him the longer mullet we saw in BB, we are shown later in the season that he still had a massive bald spot at the top, which he covered by sweeping his hair over it.  If he stopped buying those drugs when he went into hiding, then it makes sense that he’d start balding pretty quickly.
Tried my best to track what I think happens  Chicago Jimmy - Nice Mullet when he's with Marco  Pilot to "Fun and Games" - Jimmy's hair still existant but gradually balding   "Fun and Games" Flashforward 2005 - Bald patch with combover  "Better Call Saul" Breaking Bad 2009 - Barely any hair, same amount as Gene but combed over  At some point in Breaking Bad, starts taking noxidili (shown in 6x01 cold open) as hair gets noticebly less bald  2010 - Saul has to disappear and become Gene, no longer takes noxidili so is back to natural hair, now combed back and accompanied with moustache and glasses for disguise
Gene pulls his hair out from all the stress. Some people go bald that way.
Try it and you're spam.
Honestly Saul playing Irene was heartbreaking 😭 Why’d he have to do that to ol girl
Episode 2 “Mall Gone”
Irene can beat Don abuelita with one hand
Mess with Irene, get the Lazer beam!
Episode 3 "Felix finally cleans himself".
Episode 2: "Be Polite" Episode 3: "Be Efficient" Episode 4: "Have a plan to kill everyone you meet"
Season 1 episode 2 “gimmie jimmy”
i'd genuenly watch this show, i also think Mike ehrmentraut should get his own show, he was my favorite character
Biznatch
She's the best
Episode 5 "Bean Ice"
It’s not the potato’s it’s the leaks
Jimmy bullying Irene was worse than whatever that nasty lawyer who took all that meth and sent kim to doc review ever did
My heart broke for her, she's so adorable. I was mad a bit for Saul.
Keep sweet
Episode 2: "Not that nice"
Why did Hector leave irene in the altar like that?
Sequel to BCS should be called "Machine Gun Irene: You fucked with the wrong lady".
Haha this is hilarious 😂
Photoshop isn't working for me rn but I wanna make one called "Lalo and Snitch"
I told you, Be nice!
Just because the title to Better Call Saul rhymes doesn’t mean you have to feel the need to make these fake spin-offs the same way.
Technically, episode 1 would simply be called “Pilot”.
Better Sirene Irene
Depravity lol
Dude I'm in a restaurant right now and this literally made me bust up laughing
Wheres that Irene hater guy?
Was fighting for my life to defend Saul after this lol
Poor Irene, this made me hate Jimmy.
The fact this is a Netflix Kids account is what really seals the deal.
Made me feel so terrible for her. It made me question myself on my love for Jimmy
What Saul did was terrible but he sacrificed his own reputation and current career choice for her because he genuinely felt bad.
Ngl Irene was a monster.
Gotta say “Ramases II” was an absolute masterpiece of an episode
Jimmy is not a good guy
He deserved what he got in the end for what he did to Irene alone let alone all the other bad stuff lol
Oh I didn’t know he played as Irene. The acting was so good I didn’t even recognize him
I mean just look at her   /s
I felt so bad for poor Irene. I wanted to give her a hug so badly!
Worst part of Jimmy ever
Irene comes to terms with her friends not speaking to her. Meanwhile, one of her friends is dealing with a teenage grandson who seems to be suspiciously interested in her medicine cabinet...
Irene ain’t no bisnach!
She would prob be the villain of season 2
Same I beat it with one hand to Don abuelita at least daily
Saul: She’s right behind me: isn’t she.
Episode 4 "Missin' Kitten"
S4E12 "old fuck"
Was not expecting this reference
him and jimmy are basically co protagonists in better call saul
It would be fun to have a police show of his years working there, but he's too old for that
Just because you don’t get what a meme is, doesn’t mean you have to announce it to the world.
🤓
Imo no such things as good guys and bad guys. Just people who make good choices and bad choices.   Jimmy’s made some pretty fucked up choices but guess what? He realized it was fucked and took it back. Yeah he can’t take away the pain Irene felt from being ostracized but he showed true remorse and did what he could to repair the conflict at his own expense.
Yeah, that's why he's Jimmy McEvil (written as McGill), and he becomes a good person by becoming Saul Goodman. That's what the show is all about
I’ll never forget poor Irene’s face when all her friends were being mean to her
I just noticed as well. Are we stupid?
That teenage grandson’s name?? Jesse frickin’ Pinkman.
Episode 5 “Grand Theft Oscar”
i mostly like the way he works now. As a criminal.
Just borrow some of Netflix's The Irishman tech and baby you've got a stew going!
Then why did your parents announce you
really agree with this. you can make a horrible choices and still be a likable person.
Lmao he organized killing 10 people in prison
I've tried to have this conversation before and a lot of people just aren't into it. Black and white labels are still comforting.  Being able to point and say "that person is evil" makes the world easier to navigate.  But even the most "evil" people you can think of felt their actions were justified. Nobody wakes up and says I'm going to be evil just because I want to be evil. Even the people who wake up and decide to go do awful things have a reason why they've gotten to that point: abuse, mental illness, or both.
Idk man Putin and Kim are pretty evil.  You can't really lump them into saying they've just made bad choices in life without sounding like a complete lunatic. Saying there's no bad people in the world is an insane statement.
Yea you missed the point of the show lol
I don’t disagree with this take
Senator armstrong andy
“Whoa no way! This darvocet was discontinued in the 90s, yo!”
Episode 6: “Is That How These Things Normally Go?”
He was a criminal even back then
Wasn't very good, and sure they could even deepfake it but I don't think it's even worth. His way of talking is old they should also change his voice and at that point why not make another show altogether.
If I wanted a comeback I’d have scraped it off ya mums teeth
you're describing my beloved and precious king Walt
He is quite literally under duress in all of season 5. If he didn’t help Walter, Walter would have just killed him and still done what he wanted anyway. You can’t use BB s5 as examples for why Jimmy is a immoral human. He realized at the end of s4 that he was in too deep and wanted out. He even straight up says in s5 “let it be known that I’m doing this under duress”
Well some people do find pleasure in torturing other people and watching the world burn
And now I have the mental image of Kim Wexler invading Ukraine. Thanks.
Everything Putin did, he did for his family!
Dude you missed the point of the show if you disagree with that take. That’s literally what BCS is about. We see this sleazebag lawyer with seemingly zero morals who makes a living off of helping criminals continue doing crime. Then BCS starts and we see Jimmy McGill is actually a decent human being, and we want to know what went so wrong to cause him to go down the Saul Goodman path.  The whole show is about humanizing a villain and demonstrating how they are made
Episode 7: “The Hydrox“
Last time I heard that I fell of my dinosaur
Nahhhhh ive spoke about this in the sopranos or breaking bad sub before (I forget which one) for me walt isn’t necessarily a bad/good guy as we mentioned before nor is tony soprano but i cant stand the former and love the latter. Irregardless of his actions i dont think walt is a likeable character
Lmmmmmaaaaoooooooooo.
> Even the people who wake up and decide to go do awful things have a reason why they've gotten to that point: abuse, mental illness, or both.
Pony tail and all..
Episode 8: "Heil Hydra"
Ah so that’s how your brain got damaged
Walt is so overwhelmingly toxic and stupid, he makes it impossible to ever be on his side, from the very beginning. I think everybody in the community loves him because they see themselves in him, which is incredibly worrying.
Changing "evil" to "mentally ill" is just as much a black and white label that gives you comfort.  If anything you've only simplified it even more.
Episode 9: “act of god”
Nah it was interacting with you
I understand that view. I think theres two types of people who view these crime shows like the ones I mentioned. People who have never committed crime and cant relate and people who sort of almost can (obviously not on a huge scale like walt and tony) but you know what i mean. I think people who view breaking bad and like walt probably fit into the former category. I could be wrong though idk🤷🏻‍♂️
No. I don't even know how someone could get to that conclusion unless they think they're being clever and not even trying to read and process the comment.  The mindset that leads to causing another harm has to have a root cause. Whatever that root cause is is far more complex than some simple rooted-in-fundamentalism nonsense like "oh that person is just evil."  The root causes behind trauma and mental illness are anything but black and white.
Bruh
Yes, I agree that it is far too complex to put a label on. "Mentally ill" is just as lazy a categorization as "evil"   So what do Walt and Saul fall under? Mentally ill or abused?
A mentally ill narcissist can enjoy causing harm to others .. but in my opinion he’s still an evil person for it 🤔
I know right. Got em good
Neither.. just a bad egg 🥚
You know a show is good when the criticism is about an anachronistic font. Nice catch btw
Least overthinking better call saul fan
Obligatory “literally unwatchable” comment
Microsoft refused to reveal it in response to "the man" listening in on their correspondence after their anti-monopoly lawsuit. We are already saw the Cola wars, and Microsoft's direct action prevented the Font Wars (Serifs vs Sans Serifs)  Source: Kid Named Gates.
Most of the tech in the seires was way ahead than 2005. For example the laptops. When Jimmy and Kim were sharing an office, Jimmy had an HP EliteBook 8460p, which came out in 2012. The flip phones were using micro-USB which was almost impossible in 2000-2013. But these are just little things, which I don't really care about, but noticed.
yes!! i noticed these things too. also the interior design of a lot of the rooms and offices in the show look way more modern than the actual trends of the early 00s. it’s tough for me to consistently remember the time in which the series is supposed to take place while watching when i notice stuff like this.
I'm glad I'm not the only one.
I think it's more likely the Lucky Hank promo team than the BCS Emmy squad
Umm he's promoting lucky hank
I think you answered your own question.   Tyrus is loyal but he and Victor are purely muscle. They’re trustworthy but they can’t see moves ahead like Mike can. Mike’s got strategy for days.
Mike is competent, Tyrus was incompetent.  Gus wanted a competent soldier.
Tyrus had too bubbly a personality for the job.
Mike is racist
Of course both are better than just one. Lol he was in a war against a cartel he needed more men.
'cause Tyrus had to babysit Walt
Tyrus talks too much
I still find it weird whenever I see Tyrus and Victor in the same place at the same time lol
How was Tyrus incompetent?  I can't recall any instance on BCS.  Perhaps on BB, but I haven't seen it since 2013.
What are some examples?  In 3x06, 4x02, when the cartel are picking out keys, at the chicken farm?  And Nacho takes 6 keys?
There's never really showing of him being incompetent OR competent, so we can only assume he is mookish and is not capable of doing anything even close to what Mike can do
Tyrus and Victor are together in BCS all the time. I just mean that in Breaking Bad, Tyrus replaced Victor. They were never together.
That sniper is standing guard in case Lalo shows up.
This is fully explained a few minutes later in the episode.
Thanks.
Thanks for sharing.  Agree, it was sudden.
Nachos death was the most sad I’ve been for a character ever in a tv series
I thought it was actually pretty well telegraphed. Once they stated that they were going to try and ruin his reputation, it obviously had to go fantastically off the rails to justify Saul becoming Saul. It was just a matter of it was going to be Kim or Howard, and given Kims popularity, that didn't seem likely.
Love seeing Patrick, but I still can't watch that episode.
When I see Patrick Fabian’s posts I read them in my head like Howard would and laugh
I know how you feel, I started rewatching Breaking Bad after Better Call Saul and I just got to the lab. The whole time Walt and Gale are cooking im like omg Howard is buried there and they have no clue
Like this is a bit right? People don't go this hard about tv shows right? It's like everyone is adding unnecessary handicaps to their life
I just finished the series last Friday and saw that episode several days before. I was the same way- my hands were over my mouth for a solid 10 mins and was teary as well. It was so incredibly shocking and I have a feeling it’ll make me sad for months to come too!
It’s really well done when a death has real impact in dramatic storytelling. I know people whose entire lives became derailed after the death of a loved one. Jimmy blames himself for Chuck’s death and Kim blames himself for Howard’s.
One day you'll find something that makes you go this hard about TV and your life will be richer for it
It's like when people are surprised that Walt died, dispite that being stated plainly in the very first episode.
I genuinely felt extremely sad, even depressed for about a week after seeing this episode. I don't think it's wrong or anything. But now it's long after the premiere and I still think it's sad but it doesn't affect my daily mood anymore. Hope it will be the same for OP
Ok. But a TV show doesn't do that to someone in rl right
Lmmmmmmaaaaoooo. Obsessing about an AMC drama isn't going to make my life richer. It was a good show, I enjoyed it. That's as far as it goes.  I def don't have ptsd about Howard while sitting in traffic. How does that enrich your life lolol
It's actually not like that at all since Walt's death could be anticipated. Howard's was pretty much out of nowhere.
You sound boring as fuck
If you couldnt anticipate that their scheme was going to blow up to apocalyptic proportions, then I really don't know what to tell you.
Lmmmaaoo YOU sound boring af. People that make tv/movies their identify are the absolute fucking worst. How many pop icon toys do you have lol
So you knew it was going to end with Howard dead in their apartment huh? The only things that were meant to be anticipated was their plan succeeding or not. Their plan succeeded, but then a freak occurrence happened when Lalo and Howard both showed up to their apartment around the same time. Not nearly the same as being able to anticipate Walt dying in Breaking Bad lmao.
I knew Howard was going to die, yes. I got several of the details about HOW wrong, but I anticipated it. I actually thought that, when Howard was having Jimmy followed, he would stumble across his cartel connections and get murdered for that. So i was wrong that way.
Well damn I surely didn't anticipate his death. Actually I think I did for a second, but I thought he might have a heart attack or something after they drugged him.
And I realize that Howard dying ISNT what changed him, Kim leaving was... But I'm explaining my line of thought leading up to it.
I knew it was going to happen somehow. I mean, they were running out of time to explain what broke Jimmy to such a degree that he became who he became. Once they decided on this plot against Howard, I didn't see any other way it could go. Kim was too popular, they didnt have the balls to make it her that died, imo... And no other character mattered enough to Jimmy.
Fair enough
Literally perfect timing as I just got around to my first watchthrough.
I don’t think they were the same person. I think that Mike just related it to the Good Samaritan that Hector killed. He was moral at that point and wanted to find this person so that their family could have the closure that Anita didn’t have.
No. Anita's story about her long dead husband motivated Mike to step outside and call Dan so he he could find out from Nacho where the good Samaritan was buried.
No, Anita's husband disappeared eight years ago. Mike is just making the connection that he doesn't want the good Samaritan's family to have to go through the misery Anita went through.  Which set Mike's storyline in opposition to Jimmy's story in the same episode, where he starts wanting other people to be miserable because he's miserable—echoing his work detail supervisor's "we could make it zero" when he stiffs the delivery guy on his tip, and ultimately getting his brother's malpractice insurance canceled because he's getting stiffed on his own malpractice insurance.
The worst thing Nacho did is what we never saw prior to when he met Jimmy.  The numerous activities he did as Tuco's second in command.
Wrong. Stealing those baseball cards
Exactly.  If Nacho never introduced Jimmy to Lalo things would have turned out q a lot better for everyone.  Howard would still be alive, Jimmy wouldn't have gone full Saul, him and Kim would still be together, mightn't have met Walt and less people would have died at Walts hand both directly and indirectly.
Getting into the game
But would Nacho have approached Jimmy if he wasn’t Saul Goodman? If he was still a part of Davis and Maine, or working in Elder law, then Nacho would have little reason to bring him to Lalo.
I suppose back then he was already a shady lawyer who bended the rules but helping Lalo was like crossing a line.  Lost respect after that.  Might have actually thought about quitting until so many proper criminals came flocking to him and he just embraced it.
Seems like this post attracted the Chuck apologists. No point in trying to argue with him. The fact that even McKean didn't like Chuck should tell you all you need to know about hims as a character.
Chuck is not a reliable narrator. He lies multiple times in the show and almost always it's to keep himself positioned above Jimmy.
Most scam artists start with people they know. It is not unusual that Saul Goodman's first victims were his own family.   The fact that Jimmy is so cold about his family's business to Marco kind of tells the tale.
I think the honest answer is a little from column A, little from column B. Chuck saw Jimmy for who he was, but almost certainly exaggerated in his mind the extent to which this factored in their dad's failure. Their dad was a well-meaning but inept businessman, and though Jimmy didn't ruin him personally, the "Jimmys" of the world did in Chuck's mind.   He has a point, but it's not all on his brother, like he believes.  Rather, he sees his brother behaving like the people that took advantage of their dad and he puts the cart before the horse, so to speak.    Chuck can be a jerk about it, but it doesn't just automatically follow that Jimmy's a good man.   A stopped clock is right twice a day, and if the conclusions Chuck draws about his brother don't always come from a good place, they're not always wrong either.
Chuck did admit their father was a softie and a bad businessman. He said as much. But McGill Sr. had somehow, despite being a shmuck, managed to run his business for years if not decades until Jimmy came along.  The fact is, Jimmy stole some and his father donated some, and both those combined drove the store under eventually. Just one or the other would likely not be enough.
It wasn’t that Chuck just believed it. He was right on the money.   He said $14,000 was not accounted for. Assuming Jimmy worked at the store from age 8-17, that’s around 9 years. That would come out to him stealing about $30 a week. It’s not unrealistic for someone like Jimmy to steal that much money. And even if he didn’t steal the full $14,000, he was definitely responsible for a good chunk of it.   The thing is, Chuck is always the one person who can see right through Jimmy, even though he’s usually the one forcing him into doing deceitful things. It’s truly a tragic situation.
$14,000 short in inventory after many, many years in a retail environment is actually expected and pretty darn good
It's funny how so many people seem to project their own issues onto these characters. You're right, though. It's pointless to try reasoning with them.
>Seems like this post attracted the Chuck apologists.  I have to say it is one of the weirdest groups of people I have seen commenting anywhere on Reddit.
It seems to me that the scene with Marco and Jimmy returning to the store proves that Jimmy did NOT steal the money from his parents. If Jimmy was stealing wads of cash from the till on a regular basis, why in the world concern himself with a few measly coins, and even then, not actually steal them, just hide them in the store? Jimmy is "so cold about his family's business" because his father's ongoing victimization caused his son to lose all respect for his father.
There's no question about it that Jimmy wasn't a good man, but the point is, neither was Chuck. Nor was their father, for that matter. Chuck was a liar, a manipulator, and a hypocrite, and their father was a sanctimonious fool whose unwillingness to take into account the realities of this world drove his family into poverty and turned his son into a cynic at far too early an age.
Jimmy stole $8 from the till once, on the day he pleaded with his father to stop giving the store away to grifters only to be ignored by his father and mocked by the grifter. After that, he went through the tll for old coins every day, but didn't even remove them from the store; he only hid them there.
Chuck hated Jimmy and blamed him for the business failing when it was actually the result of their father's ongoing tendency to give money away to con artists. This is pretty clearly established in the flashbacks,
Dude, they could've had Jimmy throw a puppy into a woodchipper and a segment of the fanbase would still say, "Yah but Chuck was rude to Jimmy so he's the real scumbag."  The Chuck hatred is getting sillier than the Skyler hatred at this point, because while there were arguably some writing and pacing mistakes they made with Skyler while they were getting a feel for directing a show like this, I feel the Chuck and Jimmy relationship was very well-written, well-acted, and well-paced to make both characters and their whole dynamic incredibly nuanced.
In all seriousness, I really don't understand why people get on this sub trying to start conversations about Chuck when their mind is already 100% made up about Chuck.
You're delusional if you think Jimmy stealing being shown only once means it was the only time he he did it. Jimmy is a thief and has been for his entire life; he's admitted to stealing, was shown on screen stealing and Chuck, the person who knew Jimmy better than anyone, knew he was stealing. Jimmy was stealing from the store, dude.  >After that, he went through the tll for old coins every day, but didn't even remove them from the store; he only hid them there.  Lol, according to whom? Jimmy, a serial liar?
The flashback also shows Jimmy listening to the conman and swiping money from the register.
Totally agree. In Skyler's defense I think some of it just comes down to good old fashioned misogyny, along with writing and pacing issues like you mentioned, but the hate for Chuck comes purely from a lack of attention or understanding. The pieces are all there and a second watch puts everything in perspective.
I can't speak for other people, but I really wondered what other though about whether or not Chuck really believed that Jimmy stole the money or whether this was just more of his well established pattern of lying and manipulation.   I was rather disappointed that the overwhelming majority of responses were from Chuck apologists whose minds aren't open to considering alternatives to their  point of view.
>start conversations about Chuck when their mind is already 100% made up about Chuck.  They show you things about Chuck that are undeniable. He lies multiple times and they show it to you. It's in the script. People have "made up their minds" that Chuck is a liar because they show Chuck lying on the show. He's written to be a liar. That's not just people having some stubborn view of Chuck. It's people who have an informed opinion based on the facts of his character and what they actually show us, multiple times.
I swear, you Chuck apologists are even more obnoxious than the Skyler haters.
That scene shows that his father giving away money from the till was already an established pattern before little Jimmy tried to intervene. It shows Jimmy being ignored by his father and made a fool of by the grifter. And it shows Jimmy reacting to this by acting out and taking the grifter's money back out of the till. There is no reason to believe this ever happened again except for the story Chuck told Kim. But we know Chuck is a flagrant liar and manipulator when it comes to Jimmy and that he is incapable of seeing is father as anything but "the personification of good".  Furthermore, the only other evidence we are given about Jimmy taking anything from the till is his collection of old coins, which never even left the store. Why would Jimmy bother to go through the till for old coins every day if he was stealing wads of cash out of the till on a regular basis?
There's nothing to apologize for though. Jimmy was stealing from his father.
How are you not getting this? That scene was to show us the FIRST time Jimmy stole from the register. It's pretty much assumed that he would continue to do it after this because his father was too naive to suspect anything. Chuck doesn't see his father as "the personification of good," in fact he criticizes him multiple times for being too nice for his own good.   The collection of old coins are coins that he can sell for cash or use to rip off other people - you've seen him pull off the coin scam already. If you don't want to understand the nuances of Chuck's character and *why* he does the things he does, that's on you. You've clearly missed what the writers went to great lengths to try to explain - that none of the main characters (except the cartel I guess) are completely good or bad.
[a·pol·o·gist](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/apologist)
The reason I put "the personification of good" in quotes is because it is a direct quote of Chuck's words about his father.   We obviously interpret the purpose of the scenes differently. The reason we are not in agreement isn't that I'm "not getting it." It's because I have a different interpretation.
>How are you not getting this?  Chuck is to viewers who are mad at someone in their life who they disappointed as Skyler was to viewers who were mad at their ex-wives.   The irony is those characters never provoke those viewers to think, "Maybe it was me."
Then why did you frame your reddit post as a question? Were you just looking for people to agree with you?   And sure, I guess you are open to your own interpretation, even if it's the wrong one. BB and BCS aren't shows that leave the interpretation open-ended  - they're pretty clear on what they're trying to get across. B
I totally agree. The only explanation that I can come up with for why the Chuck apologists continue to defend his actions, when even Vince himself and other writers and cast members have gone on the record numerous times to say that Chuck is a villain, is that their own personal issues are getting in the way.   Perhaps they themselves have had a family member against whom they've held a lifelong resentment and instead of recognising their own flaws in Chuck, they choose to view Chuck is being in the right because they are unable or unwilling to look at themselves.  I had this same reaction to the Skyler haters, that they must be projecting their own anger issues onto her.
>Chuck is to viewers who are mad at someone in their life who they disappointed as Skyle  whut?  The people who hated Skyler are the people who loooove Chuck.
My question is about whether or not Chuck actually believed that Jimmy took the money or if that was just another of his lies.  It was not about whether or not Jimmy took the money. Any objective interpretation of the information imparted in the flashbacks should clearly indicate that he did not. You presume to say what the purpose of the scene is, but that is merely your interpretation, not objective fact.
Lol “Chuck apologists” — we just saw the character as more three dimensional than you did, it’s that simple.  Let go of your own anger and you might also notice stuff in the show you didn’t before.

My anger? LOL.  I have no anger toward Chuck; he's a character in a TV show. I was merely trying to discuss the subtleties of the character, and here you are making it about me personally. THAT IS PROJECTION.   Chuck is one of the major villains in this television show. This is a fact that has been corroborated by the show's creators.
