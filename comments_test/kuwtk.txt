Honestly yes omg. By separating herself from all other trans people, she can live in the delusion that her journey is oh-so-different from all of *those freaks’*.   We hate you as much as you hate us but you’re one of us boo!
Drake’s an attention whore: Do anything for clout
Y'all better give Drake his props. This is actually marketing genius. Everyone's talking about it. Kris Jenner taught him.
Wouldn’t they have had to agree to let him use it since it’s from the show?
I could be an absolute degenerate with that last statement but I'm gonna spare everyone my degeneracy and let it slide. That being said Drake's looking for hype and Kim's down if she's getting paid or a favor out of it especially with how things have gone with kanye. As much as I wouldn't be surprised if drake's actually been involved with kim, I'm not entirely sold on it being her vs another family member.
He’s just messy 😭 big agree that it got him a lot of attention, but he’s just being corny lowkey reshashing this feud like he can still win it after Story of Adidon
Absolutely! In what world would Kim disagree with this request?   The timing of it too? there’s a show to promote!
You were gonna say Kris taught him during pillow talk we'rent ya 💀
Drake is theeee definition of corny 😭
That’s an excellent point!   I was just driving while it came on and her voice was a jump scare, I didn’t expect it hahaha.
He’s more committed to the corny act than his exes were to him when he pulled out those engagement rings

Dream out here tired of working more than Rob does.
question…why do they always use Dream and True for these kinds of things?
True and dream are so freaking cute 😭
Most margarine is plant based butter😂😂😂 must be another paid ad. But the girls are adorable!
Such a strange ad campaign
Why is Trues skin lightened?
Dream’s feet way close to the food
they’re both such pretty girls
Ok, I'm just here to rep this butter. It's actually 10/10. 🤣
Khloe’s boob and shirt look sooo photoshopped
Dream has a lot of Rob. It’s so cute.   And true is really growing up. She’s perfect and glowing.
Dream & True are so beautiful! 🥰
True and Dream are absolutely beautiful. Just love them together, they’re like sisters
Love how these women have children with black men then lighten their kids skin it’s so foul and gross.
They are such cute little girls. I wonder if they make money off these ads and if it goes into a trust for them. I hope so.
Everytime I see see true I see Chrisean Rock and I cannot unsee it. Lil Chrisean
Dang those little girls are so cute
these girls are too cute omg!
It’s wild to me that Khloe photoshops her daughter like this
That color is truly Khloe’s color omg.
 Kris Jenner is looking AH-MAYZING!
The kids are cuties, but it does make me wonder how much they are edited and filtered. Obviously this picture has heavy editing on Kris and Khloe. Did the editors just not filter the children at all? I doubt it 🥴 It's really sad
Dream and True are such beautiful girls! 🥰
true and dream are absolutely beautiful! 🥹
Nasty how they lightened True’s skin for this.
Dream looks just like her beautiful mom <3
True is going to be soo tall, she’s growing so fast.
Dream is my favorite kid from their family. She's so adorable !!
Last week Kris was 20 years older than me. Today, she 20 years younger than me.
Kris is not a hands on granny baker, just her for the cash.
khloe looks good here omg
Those girls both look like their dads so much I can’t even see the moms!!
True could be a model, she has the look and will be hall. She is an incredibly beautiful child and it hurts that she is photoshopped
Dream is stunning. Am I crazy or have they lightened the children’s skin tone?
Let's hope this new generation will leave their natural noses and faces alone.
It’s a dream come true
Kris and Khloe look even more fake than usual compared to these two REAL humans that haven’t been photoshopped into aliens. My god! And why are they so small compared to the kids?  Who let this go out!
This is so lame. I’m not gonna but it ESPECIALLY after seeing these two consenting idiots advertising for them.
I think Trues little gap is adorable, I hope Khloe doesn't try to fix it with braces cuz her teeth are perfect. She has that Madonna and Lourdes Leon gap which gives her such character. And look at Dream so unbothered. She's such a beautiful child. But something tells me that Khloe did some editing I know she can't help herself. She needs to stop cuz True is naturally a stunning little girl.
is kris flipping off the camera? lol 🤣
I can’t imagine the conversations they have when negotiating these things, “Rob gets 10% cut since it’s his kid at the shoot, but he’ll just be back at home” it reminds me of many of my family members trading every year on which kids they’ll claim on their tax returns.
You know MaMa Kris is putting that money away for her in a trust. If there’s one thing I will respect Kris for, it’s that she will take care of her grandkids esp when their parents cough ROB AND CHYNA aren’t supporting them.
She was the star of that commercial she was in with Kris. Someone finally has talent!
Dream looks so much like Kim
Poor kids  I should add I mean that genuinely, it has to feel weird to have your life so publicized and you're just a kid.
Kylie is very particular on what she posts of her kids. Kim and Kourtney’s kids are old enough to say no. Rob and Khloe seem like the only ones who would sign off on this
i assume Khloe always has dream, then kris just comes over from next door
I thought I read Kris is Dream’s manager and lets her have these opportunities so that she is also building some wealth for the future. Rob doesn’t have much (in comparison to the rest of them), I don’t think.
I’d say they are earning money for Dream, Khloe happy to sell her kids, too
[removed]
If there’s one thing they do right, it’s make beautiful babies.
This was my exact first thought lol!!! It’s just a rebrand for margerine because after the 90s, everyone realized margerine wasn’t actually healthier than butter. 😂
A lot of margarine has dairy in it still, sadly as a vegan 😢 but country crock is by far my favorite vegan butter and is great for baking, so I oddly support this lol
I noticed that too and it’s such a shitty thing to do.poor true
At least her nose appears to be unedited this time 🙄
Because colorism. They don’t want her appear darker than Dream. It’s such bullshit. Like True will never notice when she grows up. She’s such a cute little kid already, it’s fkd up they do shit like this to her.
It enrages me
No way, did they really?! 😫
not like they are going to eat its
![gif](giphy|XQnvZWtCr1sWOvIu6P)
Sold! Getting it next time
And her under arm so clearly photoshopped
That’s exactly what I’m thinking. They look very similar. So adorable
Trues skin colour has obviously been lightened. I wouldn’t be surprised if they edited their facial features too
Yeah it's so gut wrenching and really Its an illness Khloe needs to get help with before True gets older and starts to understand what's really going on.
Hands-on the money💰💰💰
I mean didn’t she come out with a cookbook 😭
That color looks really good on all of them
No way Dream is all Angela White but just a lighter version. And she even has her mothers raspy voice, it's so cute.
You're right about True tho she's all Tristan. I wonder if their son will look more like Khloe
I get the feeling Rob is with Khloe a lot. He just doesn't like to be in pics that get posted. Or promos.
Why wouldn’t they just claim their own children…
[removed]
That's a really nice way of saying Kris is building up Dream as the next generation's Kim cause Dream has noone to protect her and both her parents need the money.

I love Earth Balance vegan butter! Country crock is a bit too soft for my liking, and I've also baked with Earth Balance. You should try it out sometime!
I agree. I think they'd just dismiss it as "oh it's not intentional, the filter just brightens everyone's face"... but even if that's true, maybe don't use that filter on your black child then? I don't know if Khloe in particular had power over that in this pic though because it's an ad, but it still applies.   Positive note: The girls are so adorable and this is a lovely ad, it makes me want to buy the product lol
Same
Bare feet on counter  ![gif](giphy|vyTnNTrs3wqQ0UIvwE|downsized)
Same. I have noticed Dream with khole a lot of the time.
Rob lives with Khloe so True and Dream grew up literally side by side since they were babies
Well some of the adults in my family don’t have legal residency/citizenship but the children do, so they can’t file taxes so they’ll let others claim their children and get a partial cut of the child tax refunds.
Because “el que no tranza, no avanza”

Yeah, feet on the counter really ick me out.
Oooooh
Drake is a such petty little zesty manchild, matched the criteria of a Kardashian boyfriend
Yea the eyes don’t look the same I don’t know how some people thought this was Kim
the way the more i look at the album cover, the more she dont even look like a Kim look alike
YOOOOO
He’s In his Aubrey era
kim invented dark eyes and hair apparently
looks like cindy wolfe
Men just like drama
i say it every time Caitlyn gets posted, she is literally a waking talking contradiction. And it’s so crazy to me how she never changed even when she transitioned. she’s still the same person internally.
it's literally because of "woke" people that she was finally able to become who she is and feel accepted by a mass majority of people. how she can now actively fight against that is really incomprehensible.
Caitlyn is literally having paid partnerships with brand too…so with her stupid logic…she shouldn’t ?   She clearly never really faced the violence trans people face daily otherwise she would understand. She think republicans like her…THEY DON’T
The self-loathing is real.
the call is coming from inside the house.. cant make this up haha
Was ESPN woke for giving you the ESPY Arthur Ashe Hero award Cait? I saw you giving a tearful speech and going on a media tour. But now a company is woke for honoring someone else? Please .. you're too much🤦🏻‍♀️🤬
“It is a shame to see such an iconic American company go so woke.”  So what about your Vanity Fair cover, your reality show, your time as a correspondent on Fox News (which is the least “woke” place on the planet.  How is what YOU do as a trans person acceptable but Dylan’s moves aren’t?  This is shameful, embarrassing, hypocritical, disgusting, every word in the book.
the real outrage is whatever is happening to caren’s hair in the photo being used  https://preview.redd.it/qo56j332dksa1.jpeg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=83225db888918c1cd41a6508fc75502b791c322f
Does Caitlyn not own a mirror? Does she not see what we all see? That she, like Dylan, is a trans woman?
Caitlyn has/will always be a pos but Dylan's sponsorships have gotten me really nervous.   Nike isnt exclusively for sports, many nonathletic celbs have had partnerships with them. But Budwiser??    No, it feels like companies are trying to use her for rage bait and it makes me scared. Ive seen the most disgusting posts all week about Dylan from people who *didn't even know she existed* before the deal. Shes a smart woman and Im sure she understands what she got herself into, but man, people go crazy.
Has Cait forgotten that she is trans too?
it makes no sense  “at the expense of” whom??? it literally is harmless. the problem is transphobes being offended that trans people exist. nobody is being harmed. nobody has any valid reason to be offended.  also i’m so tired of “woke” being a term thrown at people who (god forbid) aren’t homophobic, racist, transphobic etc. yes i’ll be fucking woke if that means not being associated with any of the prior things. why being a decent person is labelled as something people hold with negative connotations is beyond me.
ngl i always found dylan annoying? idk maybe her videos are just not for me and thats ok but caitlyn’s a piece of shit for this. i still can’t wrap my head around how she’s so transphobic while being openly out 😭 make it make sense
Why does Dylan bother Caitlyn so much?
![gif](giphy|DPqqOywshrOqQ|downsized)
She reeks of the white male privilege she enjoyed for 60+ years - which then enabled her to transition with all the money in the world and look exactly how she wanted to look, unlike the vast majority of others who transition later in life.
An outrage 💀 girl bye Caitlyn speaking on this is an outrage
Did she forget she is trans??? Confusing behavior from her
![gif](giphy|FcuiZUneg1YRAu1lH2|downsized)
Caitlyn Jenner hates trans people
does…does Cait know she’s trans?
Caitlyn thru and thru is the epitome of rich white woman privilege post transition. Zero self awareness or regard for others. Gross and painfully out of touch.
Caitlyn, “woke” is you transitioning but go off.  congrats to Dylan 🥳
I guess self hatred runs in the family
![gif](giphy|sclsG0zOvBEvYQIIph)
Pissed they didn't ask her.
i seriously don’t understand caitlyns issue. She seems to forget that she’s a trans woman.
I don’t understand ‘at the expense of the mass majority of people’, no one has been negatively affected here?!
the cognitive dissonance >>>>
What is her fucking problem
I think she forgets she’s trans. Idk how else to explain it.
This is the second the this week she’s gone off about Trans people. She’s an idiot!
She realizes she’s transgender right????  Or did she forget?
She literally hates trans people which is ironic isn't it. I wonder if she will ever come out saying she regrets getting surgery and transitioning.
SHE WON WOMAN OF THE YEAR WTFFFFFF
I just can’t understand the mental hoops she has to jump through to get to these conclusions… how can she be anti-trans when she IS trans?! Like does she think people shouldn’t accept her? Or does she see herself as above other trans people? Like she is somewhat different? I just don’t get it. Makes no sense!
Can someone explain to me why it’s ok for her to be trans and expect respect when she seems to hate trans people and their plight? Make it make sense.
Caitlyn is straight up a POS in every sense of the phrase.
Meanwhile, she’s trans herself?
Every time Caitlyn gives a statement it's so embarrassing
![gif](giphy|1lAOemoi0KhPMzxczT|downsized)
She can fuck all the way off
This reads like Caitlyn is having a stroke lol girl you need to just check out and go to a really nice nursing home. Your time has come.
Makes more sense than Fox having Cait on their network……..
![gif](giphy|B36VrlRleOQs5QfvbI)
Make it make sense.
why is she like this
She is crazy. 😂 This doesn’t even make sense.
The identity crisis is gobsmacking
She really needs to pick a lane
Someone’s upset she isn’t the face of trans activism….
Wait wasn’t she voted top women of the year for vanity fair? Why didn’t she complain then? She must not realize she used to be a he.
Y'all,  Caitlin just mad cuz Dylan cuter...🤣🤣
Does she forget she’s trans or?
How are you transphobic and trans 😂  ![gif](giphy|h4Z6RfuQycdiM)
Okay, Clayton Biggs 🙄
Does she know…she’s trans too?
He is right. The fetish shit show and medical industrial complex is fucking all of us  up and the patriarchy is appropriating our sanity.  Downvote me to confirm the brainwashing- I’m a woman and this Dylan dude is creepy  as hell. All trans folk and their sexual dysphoria need help and no one is speaking up that the emperor is not wearing any clothes
What the fuck is wrong with this bitch? Such a hater, still hates herself…
Cait has some *deep* self-hatred, guess it just runs in the Klan
Eli5 - why is she against trans people? I'm really at a loss
Shut up Caitlyn
I hate Cait.
This bitch and her dumbass thoughts can stfu and leave. I’m so tired
Does caitlyn forget she was not born female
Caitlyn Jenner is such a miserable self-hating person. I love Dylan! Her tiktok has been so inspiring. Maybe Caitlyn is jealous she didn’t have Dylan’s courage and acceptance at that age. But Cait is the definition of climbing the ladder and then pulling it up behind her instead of helping others. You’d think Cait would have appreciated someone like Dylan as a model and spokesperson as a child. And how is inclusion at the “expense” of the majority?? I’m a cis woman and I’m zero percent feeling excluded.
Love Dylan
Caitlyn looks great here
This is the biggest “not like other girls” in the worst way to the conservatives that hate trans. She thinks if she keeps saying this nonsense they will accept her. She’s just mad that SHE didn’t get that deal. Maybe if she wasn’t a POS she would. She was an Olympic winner and could do something positive instead of being a POS. The only reason she got any work after her Olympic days was because Kris was the manager.
[removed]
I wonder how she feels about HERSELF winning the Women of the Year award a few years back....???!!! She's such a delusional hypocrite it's laughable.
CAITLYN does know how it all started right?
I wonder if Kylie and Kendall speak to her
Wut
It's giving Blair White 🤢 ETA also uhm grl didn't you have a sports illustrated cover
What??? I’m speechless
What? This can’t be real.
[removed]
Does she hate herself? This actually makes me sad
What a miserable piece of shit
Caitlyn is a hypocrite but also she hates herself. A lot of internalized hate.
The fuck is there to even be outraged about calm tf down
Caitlyn is literally the biggest example of a trans person who refuses to acknowledge their own internalized misogyny and privileged male mindset, despite being a woman. Caitlyn does this to an extreme and needs to stfu. Dylan is perfectly fine.
Cait has been trying so damn hard to force that door closed after she got through. Asshole.
Damn. Never thought Caitlyn would be most asinine, out-of-touch KarJenner.
they call us snowflakes yet they crying over a brand
what is indecent about this to her i'd love to know
I’m confused… she’s trans but against trans people?
I never thought we’d have a TERF trans woman, but here we fucking are.
Caitlyn, you are a walking contradiction. It’s because of “woke” people that you were able to be on the cover of Vanity Fair, getting your own reality show from E!, receiving the ESPY Arthur Ashe Hero award from ESPN, and being a correspondent on Fox News (which is the least “woke” news network). Also, because of “woke” people, you were finally able to become who you wanted to be and be accepted by the mass majority of people. You are something else, and what you said is embarrassing, shameful, disgusting, and hypocritical. 🤬
[removed]
Did Caitlyn forget she’s also trans orrrrr
Soo she hates herself…?
I love Dylan, she's so wholesome! This isn't the first time cait has come for her, either :(
Oh fuck off, Caitlyn. You timed your public transition to distract from the woman you killed by being a shitty driver.
Can someone please explain what the fuck is wrong with her
Caitlyn was named glamour woman of the year back in 2015 or something…. That was ok but Dylan working for Nike crosses the line? Okay cait 🙄
i really want someone to sit down with her and ask her why she reacts this way towards other trans people. it doesn’t have to be recorded or anything i just really wanna hear her reasoning on why she acts this way as a trans woman herself. i know her political beliefs play a part, but does she not see the hypocrisy?
Acting like an ol white male repubelican, I see 🙄
The internalized transphobia … externalized
Caitlyn? More like Karen 🙄
What is she even on lmao
Out of all the things in the world I will never understand, Caitlin Jenner is way up there. Just a giant walking wtf.
The cognitive dissonance is strong in Cait.   Also, good in Nike!
Every time she opens her mouth, she makes it so obvious that she has spent most of her life in the body of a privileged white man, and transitioning has done nothing to inform her of anything otherwise.
She is a piece of shit human and everything I see about her reminds me of this fact
There is a serious case of self loathing going on with her
if anything’, she’s worse now than she was before!
The self hate is sad, but man, she’s insufferable.
Even what she said is completely contradictory! Like we can be inclusive without it being at the expense of the majority of people? How does that make sense? Are ALL their models trans from now on? No! Isn't the very concept of inclusivity including those from smaller subsets of the population?!
Cait should be banned from going anywhere or being on any social platform since she’s trans. After all, that’s how she feels about trans people right? What an idiot .
Of course. The doctors only removed her genitals, not her abhorrent personality.
She fucking crazy for how she treats the trans community, no one respects her at all.
This is like her coming out saying she disagreed with letting trans women compete in female sports categories, while Cait was literally competing in female golf competitions at her club.
Yeah, but she did the “decent” thing of keeping her transition private because she sees it as shameful. People being honest and educational about the process is the problem. Because Dylan has been open about her transition literally since day 1, we’ve seen her in every stage whereas Cait only debuted herself once she has achieved what she viewed as “passing.” Cait has every right to announce her transition as she wishes, but it’s clear to me she is still ashamed of her transition and it’s part of why Dylan scares her.
I commented something similar on her instagram post and literally got death threats from the maga dickholes.
Republicans make fun of her while they use her for their benefit
is it self loathing? or does she have sucha inflated ego that she just thinks she’s the exception
I said basically this in a comment somewhere lmao it’s insane
She got a woman of the year award and this chick can't wear a sports bra?? Make if make sense
💀💀💀
A wig.
And the bud lite can ISNT EVEN BEING SOLD it was sent to her as a gift from the company
On top of that, what even is so indecent about Dylan? All of the content of hers I’ve seen is pretty wholesome. Noooooo sense
Cannot STAND Dylan, not because she’s trans, but because she’s annoying as hell.
Agree
Because she hates herself and lashes out at others like her
Jealous that Dylan isn’t a self hating husk of a has been like she is
Because she didn’t get that Nike deal 😅🤣
Like she always attacking that girl  https://preview.redd.it/awjkdbyvbksa1.jpeg?width=192&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9d065f90e2a37dc1e1b1c6de72d8e23ca40b330e
Because she's getting more attention.
she’s so fucking dumb 😩 I can’t stand her
nature AND nurture
She has this weird vendetta with that poor girl Dylan and it's so strange fr
yeet her out of the solar system
And not kill them in that lane.
[removed]
She herself doesn’t know. The inner contradiction of being socialized as a white man for so much of her life + being a hardcore Republican + being trans and out and rich simultaneously. Caitlyn has zero empathy.

Absolutely. She thinks only she deserves privilege, respect, and acceptance.   She's pro trans for herself and anti trans for everyone else.   Even after the transition, she still acts like a total republican white male. I hope she has a very lonely, miserable life.
The way that she started families with three different people and abandoned the kids is so weird. Also she knew she wanted to transition the whole time but wanted the benefits of being a man.
She's both self-loathing and opportunistic. It's pathetic. Ladder-kickers like her are the worst.
I can’t tell if she regrets transitioning or not.    Also, does she not have a a PR person? Friends to gently question her statements / stance?
Kris doesn’t manage her career anymore and it shows
This.
I think this is closer to the truth. Caitlyn doesn’t strike me as self loathing, she seems like a typical conservative who wants all the rights and privileges in the world..just not for other people. Very “the only moral abortion is my abortion” of her…just with gender.
WHAT?! I didn't even know that!! The way people are reacting, you'd think they put a picture of her face on the cans or something
WAIT WHAT?!?!? I thought it was some limited edition can they were selling. It was just personalized PR?! That just makes all of the people throwing it out even more hilarious/sad.
The issues I’ve seen people talk about aren’t that it’s a trans person, it’s that it’s Dylan Mulvaney. I saw a compilation video of Dylan openly mocking women, and being insulting and demeaning using stereotypes and being generally offensive about women. Basically all of the above and now he’s profiting off it.

I don’t get it. She’s like my uncles who crossed the border to the US in the 60’s and then voted for trump.
Agreed. Desperate pick-me energy
Did you watch I am Cait? The trans women who spent a lot of time with her were always trying to get her to challenge her conservative stance by pointing out her full-on cognitive dissonance, and she was unrelenting in her stance. It was sad.
It’s the “fuck you, I got mine” way of thinking.
Yes 😭 it's just PR they sent her for her 365 days. It's so funny to see these people get so riled up over a gift. Pleaseeee
Dylan hasn't mocked anyone and you intentionally misgendered her. The people being nasty here are Caitlyn and you.
She is the absolute definition of a pick-me
I’m not being “nasty”, I responded to someone’s comment about what’s “indecent” about Dylan. Also, as a woman, I was offended by a lot of Dylan’s words and actions. I saw blatant mocking of women with my own eyes. That wasn’t intentional misgendering either.
Agreed, she’s just dying for validation from the very people who actually secretly hate her for her gender identity. Sad, but I do not feel bad for her!
Why don't you edit where you used the wrong pronoun then? The only people I've ever seen offended by Dylan's  existence are TERFs and conservative men.
Exactly! Like does she honestly think they won't come after her next? She's deluded
I am neither a TERF or conservative man. You should try having a mature and constructive discourse with someone before you start name calling and making assumptions.
Dylan Mulvaney is ridiculous I agree.  Her "girl" hood stuff is cringe and she's 100% a fame chaser. She's not offensive though I don't think.  Just ridiculous and desperate.
psalm just doesn’t age to me
Chicago in Tokyo
i forgot kim had 4 kids
psalm really looks like rob kardashian sr in his baby pics omg
Kim during these: smile! Smile marketing produ- i mean kids!
Lol what do you mean?
since he’s the youngest he’ll always be like 2 or 1 years old to me idk 💀
Lol I get it. My little sisters 21 this year and to me she’s still my baby sister not this grown woman😭
LOL yes! My little sister is turning 21 too, my brothers 19 (I’m 29) and I always call them ‘the kids’ 😆
they look like IMVU characters
She looks like Stassi
I’m on mobile and the pic literally became warmer when I clicked on it. Is this the same for anyone else?  https://preview.redd.it/bjzi8kuj0lsa1.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=43206f28cb037f31676beb3f4286661d2b0e0e03
It looks like she has an Emrata filter on
This sub and my thoughts are so contradicting....
Her hair looks better like this
YAAAAASSSS   Met gala prep i just know 😌
Didn't Chris get engaged recently?
Mario and Chris legit look related
Missed Mario so much! He’s such a gem
Holy photoshop.
They all look the same
Those are two good looking dudes ✨
this is what kylie thinks she looks like
Who is dis hunny
[removed]
Chris, Mario, and her photoshop artist
Her hair looks so good. And before y’all jump me with the “it’s a wig!!!111!!” comments…. We know. I don’t think a single person here believes a strand of those luscious locks belong to ol Kimbo
She looks like Huda
Kim looks really good here
… so this is how I found out that these are two entirely different people.
I hope they told her the dumb pout and lipliner was over
🤣 what a throwback! You’re so right!

Yes - most recent iPhone here
Reddit has been doing this to me whenever I’m on my phone lately. Idk why
Yes! I caught that to, iPhone 11 so I wonder what causes that
I couldn’t tell who she looked like here but you just got it!
I’m not even excited no more cause Mario was there last year….
No he’s dating Lukas Gage

faceapp
Same
They just got engaged
Oh wow didn’t they just announce they were together like last week
Lmfao yes, I’m extremely confused by their timeline 😭
Lol if she worked out half as much as she tries to convince us, she’d have some muscle definition…
Notice how you can’t see her clenching her glutes? How they don’t move? That’s because she has implants over top of the muscle. Case closed.
She hasn’t even bothered to put her hair in a ponytail. Cmon Kim
Deadlifting with 12lbs.
Real talk how often do we think she actually works out
All these private trainers and they can’t train her on mind muscle connection.. or at least try to fake it haha
she’s doing rdls and her chin isn’t talked.. omg her form is so bad LOL
Her form is improving
I wish I could park my face right in her rear
So I remember someone saying on here that Kim would be going the muscle body route. Which to me is starting to seem true because she’s not kept up the dramatic weight loss, which reminds me of cutting so you lose body fat to then build muscle by increasing activity and calories, but those calories will build muscle under the demand?   She may be working out genuinely but muscle and tone takes years, which might not be as instant as she wants. I dunno just a connection my tired brain made 😅
She had a full beat in her “fit in your jeans by Friday” work out video
That’s an rdl lol not a deadlift
I’m mostly surprised that they are parked outside and under trees. Even if it’s temporary, under trees is a quick way to get bird sh*t all over your car.
all these cars look the same to me
If I were that rich, I'd buy much more interesting cars
Interesting that they're all so new, do they just throw them out and get a new fleet every year lol
I just don’t understand the point of owning this many cars idc how rich you are
My personal opinion is that light gray is ugliest color for cars specially luxury cars  Edit: I’m so glad so many people agree 😂
This depresses me for some reason. The excess gives me an empty, sad feeling.
As expensive as they are I don’t understand why they aren’t garage kept. 🤷‍♀️
So does she just get new cars every year then? Does she lease them ? Don’t know why I think these things
The tree blocking the Rolls-Royce makes the back of it look like a [1993 Ford Tempo.](https://file.kelleybluebookimages.com/kbb/base/house/1993/1993-Ford-Tempo-Side_FOTMPSEDLX922_505x375.jpg)
Makes me feel real poor 😂 I just bought a 2007 VW golf for 500$ and it’s something I’ll never financially recover from lmao
She has such bad taste in things
Lack of imagination.
Where do her housekeepers and assistants park? Can they park in the driveway or do they have to park in the road and walk the whole way?
I just wanna know why so many. I would think 2 or 3 would be sufficient. Car, SUV and a truck.
2.5M in the most boring car color
This type of gluttony is sickening. Maybe take some of that money and help others?
Reminds me of how I used to play the sims as a kid
This is just so excessive and unnecessary. Imagine the money that could be donated to a few charities instead
They all look the same so she can drive around and blend in …. A red Ferrari would be too easy to be spotted o
Why can’t we tax them more? We’d have better infrastructure, better schools, could feed hungry children. It’s fucking disgusting.
Ima be real if I had her kind of money I’d have more cars than that lol. Maybe not as expensive, because that’s not what I really like, but I’d buy every dream car on my list for sure.
Leases
Kim get a garage
and they all look like shit cars from a 2005 video game
She puts the excess in excessiiiiiiive.  ![gif](giphy|fQoIDlLW6A6BAhyev8|downsized)
Yikes! I could never be seen with a 2022 model in my driveway!
This is so beyond obscene.
What does “custom” mean in this context? If someone adds the moonroof to a base model Honda Civic (idk man) is that “custom”? Ik that Rolls Royce is as custom as it gets, but I’m curious how that shakes out for the other cars
Why are they all outside? Was she cleaning out her garage?
All that house and no garage for such expensive cars? For shame.
Omg I thought those cars were the staff!
She has at least 2 of the same 3 cars (even the S580 & GLS 600 Maybachs). What a waste of money IMO. 🤷🏽‍♀️
As if she has cars from 2022 eww so old!! 💩
That is pure disgusting use of wealth . Why can they not see excess is a sign of vulgarity
Why would you own this many cars just to leave them in the sun all day? 😶
y’all gon get me buuuutt  i don’t care that she has a lot of cars and that she shouldn’t have that many  https://preview.redd.it/ziylq3u9pjsa1.jpeg?width=932&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d0f650d905314d99c71b3e06a80d918cb947c186
Remember when “100,000 dollar cars — erbody got ‘em” was the flex
Why are there multiples of the exact same car?
Sorry but that’s not normal. If you make your money legally, this isn’t normal.
Her inner inbred really does show.
Is Kris’s house bigger then Skims?
Be a shame if she had to drive a Toyota Corolla
Those cars are leased and maybe even loaned out to the Klan for exposure.
Why are they all the exact same colour? 🤣🤣. And judging by the years I guess we will never catch her driving anything that isn't the present year. What does she do?  Take all those vehicles at the start of a new year and trade them in for the same one in the same colour as long as it was just released ? Does she really ever drive all of them? So many questions 😩
Omg she's a hoarder lmfao. This reminds me of when people's backyards are.filled w random cars they own. It's giving high brow trailer trash, kim
Poor person question: how do you decide what car to drive? I understand 3 (kids driver, daily, fancy occasion) but what do you do with 8?
The fact that it’s all newer models, does she change it every year?? Oh to be that rich 😭
Well she said in her 2006 MySpace account that she liked cars. She’s just owning up to her words!!!
These assholes are ruining the earth!
She knew photos were being taken so she hired at least three of them😂  (As if she would have those nice cars out in the open like that for any other reason than to show off)
What did she do with the big fancy van she had personalized?  Also why would she want 2 - 2023 Cadillac Escalade's?
Me too! Why not build a 12+ car garage?
She has people for that.
Right?!  I've been to some very Lux, expensive homes, owned by multi-millionaires and at least 2 billionaires, and not ONE kept their expensive cars outside, under trees, or in the sun. Kim is just showing off.
They pay people to keep them clean
💀 exactly what I was thinking. All that gray is also way too much. It'd be nice to see a pop of color somewhere...anywhere lol.
This whole aesthetic is so exhausting
Kanye has infiltrated her brain with color boringness
[removed]
With varied colours
1988 Jeep Grand Wagoneer 🥰💯
Yeah, I'd have my everyday cute mid-size SUV similar to the one I have now, and a pink sports car that goes really fast, and some classic cars!
Yup lmao. My friends (who have $) are always trading out their cars for something newer 😭 I cannot relate
Leasing
I’m sure for them these are investments and can resell for a pretty penny. Not like those of us who buy a car and as soon as you drive it off the lot it’s worth 5K
What would you have to park in the massive drive way?
I had a multi millionaire ex. Didn’t come from money, had an accident and sued. Anyway, had 5 different vehicles in the garage and probably totaled 300-400k. They were nice cars but not Kim’s collection expensive. The wealthy like options lol
It’s a fun hobby. Sometimes you want to drive an older car. Sometimes you want to drive an obscure car. Driving the same car every days is pretty boring. Sometimes the fun just comes from getting one that has seen better days and bringing it back to glory.
Some people are very into cars. Just like some people are very into sneakers, guitars, or collecting art. And some people don’t care at all!
It’s also the most dangerous color because they’re oddly hard to see for other drivers in certain weather and lighting.
Soooo ugly!! Even an eggshell/white would be better
I second your opinion. It's ugly and I think it ages the cars and make them look cheap.
I looked up in distain at my neighbors Lexus immediately after reading this and have to agree. (Is Lexus considered luxury? I wouldn’t know. I drive a Kia.)
It looks like primer
Her too 😢
This is definitely temporary while the garage is being cleaned/renovated. They are not always parked out like this
I have a sneaky feeling Kim might have trouble backing out of a garage. Which isn’t a knock really, I’ve driven forward through a garage before, so if that’s the case, I get it.
500 bucks?! That's pretty good!
😂😂 don't feel so bad I just got delivery worth $38 and used the overdraft I already maxed out so now I'm in Minus 😩
I’d love a below deck style show about the Kardashian’s staff, at home and their businesses. Then I’d actually watch.
I remember the first time I visited Washington DC and saw the Pentagon and wondering the same. Seriously, look at the satellite view! Anyone who works there must walk a dozen miles on a lazy day.
My thought too. Or how does she decide on a new car? Like "I have 14 cars but I think I'll buy another one today". Must be a tax thing.
Same!!!!
Kimbecile is flexing. No sane ( or secure) person with real $ does this. The Kartrasians are all about showing off. New money hoes!
Yeah. It's an excessive amount, for sure. But She's not the only celebrity with 10/15 cars.  People should see Christiano Ronaldo's car collection. I was.....shook.   I just have an issue with it when they claim they are environmental queens and care about the environment when they have like 15 cars and own private planes lol. 😐   Very contradicting and it ultimately comes off as fake 🤥
https://preview.redd.it/5pnxw6yorjsa1.png?width=739&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0addc56c3ff0a9510e5487c6cf3ad4281e666760
My immediate guess was that she's renovating her garage in some way, but I have no idea
Her garage is for the dogs
My guess is they're out for easy access if she wants to drive them because she's home. There will be someone whose job it is to put them away.
Didn’t she recently paint them the exact same color so that they can match their house ? Rich people’s take on "minimalism" is always hilarious to me 😭 They really took the whole idea of minimalism, which is to believe that owning a lot less stuff is the key/a key to feel peaceful... and they went "I know what I’m gonna do !! NOT stop buying new luxury cars, but asking that they all be painted ALL IN BEIGE ! So that it can be all that much more puzzling that I have seven different luxury cars since they even all look the exact same now !"
kim’s ass too obsessed with her alien aesthetic to do that
like as a billionaire why aren’t at least one of her cars fully bedazzled? 🤔
same 😂

I don’t like colourful cars so I get her wanting muted colors but I still don’t understand why she needs that many 🙄
But most are custom? Can you lease a customized car?
Sure, but none of these cars are obscure or old or at all interesting.
I just don’t get it
I know everyone’s different, but isn’t upkeep part of the point of collecting cool cars in the first place?  Like the two friends I have who are into car collecting seem to actually like the hobby cause they get involved in some or most maintenance. Kim just buys the equipment and outsources everything about the hobby except driving to pick up the kids. It feels more hoardy than collection-y, but elevated cause she’s accumulating expensive stuff in a big space
I don’t think Kim is into cars, she is into the status she thinks these cars give her.
Yep, luxury toyota.
Yeah, that’s sad! I’ll stay with my one little mini van! Lol!
It was definitely a steal considering everything else was so much more expensive! There’s shit I need to fix but it could deffo be worse
I was able to buy fast food today because it was cash so it doesn’t count 😂 we’re together in being broke
Same. I’d love to know how far away they have to park their Honda civics from the houses and to hear more  about how cheap they are.
Ehhhh youd be surprised how many underground/hidden secure parking lots there are for such buildings. They dont want people to know where the employees park for several good reasons. DC and the surrounding areas are absolutely a parking clusterfuck in general though.
There are two massive parking lots on the south side and a couple smaller ones + a lot of people on per diem traveling stay in pentagon city which connects via pedestrian tunnels. Also the metro has a pentagon stop that a lot of people use and most people in distant suburbs just take shuttles because the drive is so long and the tolls are so high. Also a not insignificant amount of people bike to work there. The bike entrance is close to a gym where there are locker rooms and showers and stuff.
There’s literally a giant parking lot outside of the pentagon lmao
Right. They decided minimalism was an aesthetic and COMPLETELY missed the point!
Rich people use “minimalism” as a cover for having no style/taste.
Yes, she was bragging about how she has her own Kim grey color. I’m sure anyone could make a Pantone color, give it a new name, and have all their stuff painted that color
Way too obsessed. I don't see her budging anytime soon 🥲
YES! honestly. I also just would love to see at least 1 hot pink car or neon car somewhere. That seems more like Kim. Ever since her and Kanye went on this minimalistic wave, she hasn't used  color anywhere and now that's including her cars...💀
Because it’s been done before
But not even like different neutrals? Like beige, white, black? Doesnt silver get old and tbh silver is the least interesting to look at
Part of me wonders if they get special pricing/income to be seen driving certain prestige marques.
It might depend on what they consider “customized”. When I used to lease my car. I would order the new one when I was close to my lease ending and get only the features I wanted. I suppose that may be considered technically “customized”.
I get collecting vintage cars if that is what you are into, like i imagine those that do get really excited at a rare find or something like that. I don't get buying multiple modern cars that are similar. If i were rich i would get a chitty chitty bang bang replica and call it a day
Or the real real gossip. Like downton Abbey.  Is there an HBIC? what’s the relationship between staff members? Omg fun to imagine.
I figured there was probably shuttle service or something from the parking lots (lol), but even then, there's a great chance your desk is nowhere near an entrance of a building that size. It's just so spread out...!
Yep, metro and heli pads too.
It’s not overstimulating, which she said is what she wants
She’s such a fuckwit lol there is no other word for it
Vintage cars I can understand the passion for, but i have a feeling kim is doing it for purely materialistic reasons not from a place of passion, I guess that’s why I’m being judgey
The pentagon is designed in such a way to minimize walk times. Even though there is only one visitor’s entrance there are multiple staff entrances. I think it’s like no more than 15 minutes between any given office and entrance.
If she wants to be less stimulated she should get rid of like 6 cars. Decision fatigue is a real thing.
LOVE vintage cars. I'd only have one or two though if I was rich 🤑🤣
And the mansion and the jet and the dogs, she should just be a hermit
No one said for her to become a hermit. Where did you even get that?
>> If she wants to be less stimulated she should get rid of like 6 cars.   She could also go live under a rock but she’s Kim K… be fr
Don't know what your point is? That person's correct. Her getting rid of a couple of cars doesn't mean she's all of a sudden a hermit nor does it mean she has to live under a rock. Lol

Trebor, Robert backwards
I will die on this hill and comment it everywhere lol: Titan
tried & true
Timothy, for Timotheé Chalamet, the kids new uncle 😭☠️😭
True and Trauma
Trobert
Someone commented recently that they think the name is Trust and I 100% think that’s it.
Since Khloe named True after her maternal grandfather I believe her boy is named after someone on her dad's side of the family. My bet is on Tatos 'Thomas' Kardashian her great grandfather.
Other slightly chaotic options:  - Toblerone (listen, they’re delicious. Brand deal?)  - Tyga (lol)  - Tristen/Tristian/Triston because a slight misspelling would be hilarious  - Truman (a dig at Tristan, ofc)  - Theirry (which they would fully mispronounce as “theory”)
Tristan dad is deadbeat right ? Like not a good relationship at all…it would be weird to give het son that name
oh i thought you was thinking of Trevor Noah 💀
Time Thompson! It’s just unique enough and on the edge of super weird it may just work, lol.
tristan doesn’t have a good relationship with his father, and his father has threatened to leak information about khloe in the past  so i don’t think so
My guess is TRUST. Trust and True Thompson seems like a fit.
> also weird because it’s not Tristan’s oldest son   My dad was the 5th son, and he’s a junior (named after his dad). We joke that grandma and grandpa ran out of names, which is also entirely possible considering Tristan’s 3 baby mamas (that we know of)
my picks are still tiger, titan, tristan jr, theo, or trevor.
Does anyone even give a shit at this point what that kids name is?  I certainly don’t.    When Kylie released “Aire” I had forgotten that he wasn’t Wolf anymore.  It was all just so dumb that I just forgot about it.  It just shows how tone deaf they are thinking that the world is STILL a on the edge of their seats waiting for his name.  We’re not.
Thunder
Tryst Thompson. He can be just like dad!
It’s Tristan or Titan for sure
Its either Tristan Jr, or even Theo Thompson. I'm calling it.
I think since Kylie named her son Aire or whatever that Khloe is MOST def gonna name him Tristan Jr as he is his “heir”
third trimester thompson jr?
It’ll be something ridiculous like Thrice, Trident or TJ instead of Tristan III. Or Tourney bc they think he’ll be a basketball star.
I would be 100% set on it being Trey if it wasn’t so similar sounding to True
What about Tried? Tried and True lmfao
True and Time
Tried  For “Tried and True” and also Tristan tried….kind of
What if it’s “Truth” 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Teal
Tristan Jr
Taco
Teen Wolfe
Teddy
[removed]
True & Trust ❤️
My guesses -  Titus  Teo   Tristan Jr.   Tate (too normal I think but I love the name)   Trey
It would be hilarious if it's Travis
tamir or tamil
I'm going with Tyce. This week anyway! Ha
What about Tripp as he’s his third son now! It’s like naming him after his dad without being too obvious
Like the soft mints... dead.
“But we call him Trey”
Lmao stoppppp
😮
I actually know someone with this name 😂 so it’s kinda possivle
Or maybe even Titus?
I can see it!
yes! this is on my list too!
Kelly Rowlands son is called that
This one 😂
OMG the cackle I just let out 😂
💀
Awe, named after his daddy ❤️❤️
BYE
💀💀💀
Or Tears
🙊💀💀💀💀😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I LOLed at this
Trust?  How ironic.  🥴🥴🥴
Ooo I think this is a good guess
Placing my $1.50 on this one. Good guess.
Ooh this is the best guess so far
tommy thompson
Losing my mind laughing over “Toblerone”😭😭🤣🤣🤣
Brand deal 💀😂
I think she is just not sharing her son’s name so that people will speculate and talk about it and think that it is tristan jr and then come out with something boring like tony
I feel like you are definitely on to something here!
I agree these names do sound good together and fit the kardashian playbook well besides the fact that this kids father is the least trustworthy man on the planet
Yes i also know a family of 3 boys and they made the youngest the jr.
I think Theo is the name of his other son
No way it’s Theo, that’s what Maralee named her son.
Somebody said “she’s definitely using Theodore” 😂😂😂😂

Which was named because it was Robert backwards!
![gif](giphy|CfoiRXkfHSEEg|downsized)
Is she just trying to make Tristan feel bad with every kid name? 😂  Other options:   Honor  Respect   Loyal  Not A Cheater
Tony 😂😂😂😂
Same and she’d get grilled just as badly over Trust as she would Tristan Jr.
Imagine the drama of Khloe naming her son Theo so that nobody can say he’s not a father to Theo 💀
At this point, I wouldn't put it past Tristan to advocate for naming him Theo. That way, it would push the first Theo away from him even more. Theo Thompson wouldn't shock me.
😳🤣🤣🤣
Well TIL
![gif](giphy|1310PQeVtcUoJq)  Khloe reading this as she finds 4 more surrogates for trashcan, hoping he’ll finally change
I we really wanna send a message, I vote for Condom
LOL. “This is our son, IUD”
I feel like part of the reason her brand isn’t doing as well is bc she is only active in social media when she has a product coming out so then it just doesn’t feel as genuine. She needs to consistently promote her things not just when a new product is out.Her makeup looks good here too , she just needs to be more consistent.
The second photo is giving me filler stache
What's going on with her chest in Pic 4? It's like a skin table she is peeking over  Mods, can I get Skin Table as my flair?
Something about the look in her eyes these days is kind of scary… like she’s become so dead in the eyes…
The second photo is sending me 😭😭😭   People trashed her for originally posting the mascara tucked into her bikini bottoms so now she’s holding it just smack right against the forehead
She looks like she's in anaphylactic shock
At least we can see the product this time  https://preview.redd.it/443h33mcdjsa1.png?width=1169&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b0022dd9fa6588dbc5d4d9400427ec24f129c4bd
Low effort ad 🤔
lip gloss >>>>
These are really bad right? Like I'm not crazy, this campaign has been straight trash.
Her filler is aging her sooo bad. Wish she would dissolve but the face dysmorphia must be crazy
Selling skinny with photoshop in her flop era.
i don't know why i find it boring, she looks good, it's just that her photos are too similar
is she even wearing the mascara she’s holding? it looks like extensions and a tint job. what a horrible ad.
How long until Timothée starts taking pictures of her for her Instagram?   😅
Why her makeup eating….  https://preview.redd.it/n84dmbgmdjsa1.png?width=1169&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c7ceaf06c48aa48f51ad4d4648df04f76513d827
her makeup here looks sooo good
I like the 4th pic
Boringgg
SKIN TEXTURE
The first picture is very pretty!
So it’s basically rebranded maybelline sky high
can we have an open and honest assessment of pic 3?
1000%  She used to be goofy and post funny videos. Even if her mansion is not relatable, seeing her cook with Stassie was fun. Seeing her play with Stormi was cute. Now she just disappears and then asks us to buy her mascara.
Omg I thought you were being a little mean but you're SO right, it really does look like a table! I think because her implants are so big it's made them a bit saggy and hence looks like that?
omg i can’t unsee it 💀
I think you’re kind of right. Each photo now looks like they cut Ky at the bottom of the neck and pasted her on another body.
I think she’s had implants or something added into her collar bone to appear thinner.
yeah im sittin here thinkin it’s an ad for her lipgloss…when it’s for the kylash 🧍🏽‍♀️
yeah but you can’t admit it tho or you’ll get downvoted 😂
I'll be 34 on Sunday and I've been REALLY struggling with aging. Specifically the fat loss in my cheeks which has made my face look saggy. But seeing these photos, I feel like Kylie's cheeks are basically at the same level as mine. Except she's way younger. I feel bad for her :(
uhhh... lol
her kylashes are not kylashing in these photos
I think they are just kind of fizzling out. They will still be in the news cycle and all that but it will never be like it was for them. They had a good two decade run but I think their time in the crazy crazy spotlight has just run its course
I think the flop era started with Tristan and will only end once he’s gone. Except for Kendall, I think she’ll do better than the rest.
I think the next notable era will be the older kids (especially North and P) getting put more front and center with clear “brands” established, and partner deals that don’t feature their moms etc.
We’ve been force fed the Kardashians/Jenners for so long that people are sick of eating it.
Honestly every single thing in your list will make them interesting again because it's REAL. Like Kendrick Lamar once said "I am so fucking sick and tired of the Photoshop"... We need to see realness and not all the BS stories they've been doing lately
The "who are these people?" era
Critiquing the kjs on this sub?! Never thought I’d see the day
They are not capable of anything you just imagined lol
I think they’re done but they’ll always be visible. At some point someone will do an infomercial for us to make fun of, but that’s about it until the next generation is profitable.
You’re giving them a lot of credit in these predictions lol
Hopefully obscurity
The kids will be taking the reins. It will be all about them come 10 or 15 years.
I love how y’all say they been in a flop era for like over a year now, and yet here you are, still spending your day talking about them  so I guess y’all not spending your time on this sub is the next era?
Do you think they’re aware they’re in their flop era?
They aren’t flopping sadly
Kourtney has three kids and would be putting a child at risk due to her advanced maternal age. I really hope she doesn’t make the selfish choice to birth another child just because she can’t stand the idea of not having a baby with Travis.
This is Antisemye’s flop era
They just need to enjoy the wealth they have amassed and enjoy their lives… Khloe needs to go to therapy so she can get rid of Tristan
I don’t have the answer to this, but it prompted another few questions for me. How might each feel about losing their grip on the reality entertainment industry and subsequent ventures? Will they ever acknowledge any impact a loss in fame/infamy? If so, will they be genuine about their feelings?
I believe this but I also think they are not doing much now to be talked about. If another huge scandal happens with them again I think they will be pushed back in the spotlight. This is also true for all celebrities.
They’ll be relevant again once their kids are 17+
Some of the kids will definitely be in the spotlight. Kim will push for at least two. I also see Reign or Penelope trying to be influencers, P with like beauty and wellness and Reign being idk a streamer, gamer, prankster something like that. I'm not sure about True, Stormi, Aire, Tristan Jr and Dream. Maybe some athletes in the fam, especially if Kendall has kids with a player.
I think this but sometimes people make comebacks decades later. Like Pamela Andersons career was dead and then that Netflix special came out and it's given everyone a new respect for her. And now she's doing appearances again and looks very classy and content.   Or how Blac Chyna is rebranding herself. All her Instagram comments are super positive. And a year ago her Instagram was baaaad. It was all just people talking shit about her in the comments.
I actually think it would have started before Trashcan. Seriously think about the last few seasons of KUWTK and the Hulu show. The only really actual drama was Trashcan. He saved the show!!!!!
Exactly. I feel like when they say “flop” they mean their like-ability, which has never been great anyway. But in terms of being talked about/relevant it’s definitely not slowing down
Yes, definitely. That’s why Kylie & Kendall are rumored to be dating two really popular guys. They’re desperate to get their images more aligned with younger people. Millennials thought them dating black guys was cool & edgy but now they need a new image. They’re probably bribing these men btw.
Why do you want to see kids getting brand deals?
Will the kids really want to be in the spotlight though? Even North and Mason can’t stand it currently…
I think they’re already grooming north for this
See I agree! I just think their charm was the family. And seeing the Jordyn situation and how the rest of her own family cheer on Tristan. I think he saved the show, but at what cost.
it’ll be interesting for sure. I think North tho could really be something if she followed in her dad’s footsteps and did some form of art
I agree too because he was also the downfall of Khloe as the fan fav imho. People loved Khloe and thought she was the “relatable” one (I have reasons why i think this is but that’s for another convo) and she was always about being funny and tough and strong and still loving and empathetic. Tristan showed the world she truly is just a misogynistic pick me dick centered doormat. And not the person she was cosplaying.   I loved the charm of their family. Coming from a huge family (11 siblings) and we’re all very close and how close I am with my sisters , that was a huge appeal. Plus i love the escapism. Beautiful rich people. I don’t mind that they’re over the top or spend a ton of have a ton of money. This show is mindless escapism for me.
I totally agree, Tristan not only likely ruined her self esteem but like everybody’s opinion of her at this point
Japanese gardens are the best. I've always loved cherry blossoms etc but their gardens take it to a whole other level.
Psalm looks just like Rob Sr. My goodness.
Her oldest two give me more West vibes while the youngest two look slightly more Kardashian imo
These are actually cute pictures! They don't look overly curated. Wish they did more stuff like this.
I am curious and uncultured and mesmerized. What is the first picture of??
psalm is so adorable 🥺
The first one is the TeamPlanets exhibit. I wonder if they closed down the whole thing for her.
Slide 5, omg so cute
So do we really think she’s building a bunker?
Devin liked. Im so curious about him and Kendall and what Kendall thinks about his social media interactions.
It's an art installation in Japan
jellyfish  edit: wait nevermind cause ion even know now 💀
No. She’s building a house in Palm Springs.
I seriously cannot stop looking at them. I want my nails to be them. I want them in my home. I want them in my garden. I want to become them.   WHAT IS HAPPENING WHAT ARE THESE BEAUTIFUL BLOBS
Home couldn’t also be a bunker?
Not really. It literally just looked like a home she is building on the land that she owns in Palm Springs.
Aw is that kourtney? Cute sister moment
Psalm (?) looks so adorable poking his head out on pic 2 🥺the little smile omg
Psalm is Robert’s twin
They also interacted on Instagram after ages. Looks like things are calming down.
It looks like P joined the trip from the travel pics so probably dropping her off 💗
I feel I hadn’t seen them photographed together in forever. Glad they let still giving that sisterly love 💗
Yes that’s Kourtney. ❤️
Atrocity??? Like why are yall so dramatic 🤣
*sisterly photo op
I think there’s a lot going on behind the scenes with Chyna that probably makes Khloe act that way. There was domestic violence on both sides, substance abuse issues. At least two different women have accused Chyna of holding them captive and attempting to human traffic them. There’s probably even more we don’t know about her.
She honestly always acted like she was in love with him. It was definitely weird
But no one can also deny that among the siblings, Khloe has the worst track record of bullying other women.
Yes I agree she acts like she was replaced by Chyna?! I'm flabbergasted
She need to leave her cheeks and lips alone there’s no need to more fillers
Her face is 80% filler atp
She should definitely remove cheek fillers and reduce upper lip filler.
Whatever she did to her eyes wasn't good.
She was sooo much prettier before! She definitely got some surgery to make her eyes more open.
I thought she said she stopped the lip fillers but clearly not
Her eye surgery is horrific. She looks like she's twacked out if she's not wearing heavy makeup.   Her eyes were her most beautiful natural feature. Such a shame.
Her cheekbones remind me of the puppet from Saw
Oh my lord her cheeks.  Is her face melting off?
Not her changing her eye color so they finally become yellow 🥰
She’s lost her identity in her face. The smaller changes 4 years ago were perfect little improvements if she wanted to make them - she’s so young it’s sad to me she thinks she has to do this. Enjoy your 20 & 30 year old skin! You beautiful young creatures!
is she wearing colored contacts, or is it just lighting?
Does she have cheek fillers or implant? I can’t really tell the difference between the two
Her face must hurt
ugh i remember pic 1 kylie n thinking how pretty she was😭😭😭
https://preview.redd.it/yyevf7wgjhsa1.jpeg?width=615&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=699b79237eed15cf7ac86c3f05dd56675ac13160
To be fully honest, I think that she is still pretty. Obviously, she looks better when she didn’t break her face too much but I still think she looks beautiful in the second picture. In my opinion. Beauty is subjective after all.
frog eyes
Poor girl
Who told her she has yellow green eyes? Lmao
I actually think that her lips are a bit better on the second picture. There was a dent/fold on the bottom lip before (because of the fillers).
Her eyes scare me now
U can kinda see her old self in the first one but not at all in the second
Her forehead is bigger now…🤔🤔🤔
She's slowly morphing into a cartoonesque Disney villain. I wonder if she realizes how strange she looks or if she believes she looks how she does in her edits.
 *5 years
unpopular opinion but i think she looks really pretty
Forehead a lot bigger in second pic. I’m pretty sure I read that Kim had her hairline repurposed (first word that came to mind lol) and Kylie did too. God Kylie was so cute in pic one. She is still pretty but I really wish she would dissolve the fillers, especially in her cheeks.  I feel bad talking about every detail of her face bc I know I would feel horrible if someone did it to me. I guess bc she’s a celebrity we are able to distance ourselves from her like she’s almost not human. Deep down under all that plastic surgery I see a scared girl/young woman desperate for attention and trying to keep up with her sisters. I feel like I have been able to get to know all the sisters thru the tv show except Kylie. She’s always been mysterious to me.
When will these inflatable lips go out of style?
she was so beautiful :(
Why do ya'll do this lol
[removed]
[removed]
how did her eyes change like that
![gif](giphy|tXGgHju4xH8nm)
So she doesn’t naturally have sanpaku eyes and just edits her Instagram pics to have it LMAO
She is definitely on something
That’s wild. Literally looks a decade older  ![gif](giphy|eNMu8JD1dxYaNxOz7S|downsized)
She is in for it taking those benzos. Wait 'til she hits tolerance, then tolerance WD. I actually feel a bit sad for what she will be going through at some point
The filler just makes her face look long in an unflattering way
I see a beauty in the making in photo 1 and a 50 year old with a bad plastic surgeon in photo 2. I wish she'd grow some self confidence and leave her face alone. Unless it's removing fillers she should stop.
I think she lost weight and it’s showing the cheek implants more
Blepharoplasty
I don’t think she needed it, but I like it! It makes her eyes look extra open👁👁
I think tagt was right after having stormi. She went back into getting fillers done about 6-12 months after that
>twacked out   New fav phrase
Yessss
I’m trying to pin point the changes too lol something also different about the eyes
Nah that’s just her yellow eyes
Kataracts
I think it’s implants bc filler would migrate down eventually. And her head just sorta got like blocky and large one day
daddy chill
Thought this too! Ahhh 🥴
[removed]
Here's a [good video](https://youtu.be/JDgoMwc2mFA) on how Kim's hairline has evolved  >Forehead a lot bigger in second pic.  I think it could definitely be true that Kylie's gotten her hairline done especially considering she's expressed her short forehead being an insecurity for her. But I think it's also partially due to her bangs being styled differently - second pic she has upswept roots, first pic it's more pressed down and obscures the possibly higher points of her hairline
They like to shame and “humble” the karjenners for having insecurities for some reason idk

Buccal
You can see the bottom edge of the iris in pic 2 (not pic 2). I think both her and Kendall had there eye socket made larger. Now she is flexing it in photos (the weird eye thing) its just the new unattainable beauty moment now the whole world knows about BBLs
You been watching Lorry Hill I see 🙈
[removed]
I think she has filler underneath her eyes and did some eye procedure
Blepharoplasty
Eyelash extensions vs no eyelash extensions
Yes very similar to Liam Paine’s sudden and drastic transformation. Plus, those cheeks are SITTING!! I personally think cheek filler gives a more puffy look almost like an allergic reaction - Kylie’s cheeks look rigid.
💀💀💀
yeah same!

Cat Eye Surgery
😂 I’m stuck on this as well… 🤔
Lol I’m high and had to read that part 3 times to decide it was probably a mistake
I kept re-reading too and maybe you’re right! Lol
Yes, it’s real. There is no lawsuit yet but they are investigating. A lot of businesses do this not just skims. I just watched a small business on tiktok admit to it and how they watch people. Basically, when you visit websites they can tell every click you make and which pages on the site you visit. I wasn’t aware they could possibly see things outside of the site though.
Someone explained in a comment that they recorded the people going on the skims website ? I don’t know what that means ?
Yeah it’s called data analytics. And it’s only on the website, once you leave, they can’t see your activity
Wow that is so crazy!
Help me out, why would this be illegal?  Doesn’t a company have a right to note what you do on their site?
Here's a link to an article that I found really helpful:    https://www.duanemorris.com/articles/website_tracking_brings_class_action_risks_for_companies_1022.html    #Wiretap Statutes as a Class Action Tool    "A new wave of class actions filed in California, Pennsylvania and Florida assert that the use of tracking technologies on websites violates state wiretap and privacy laws.    These suits potentially expose businesses to substantial penalties, with fines ranging from $1,000 to $50,000 per violation, depending on the state.    Since a violation arguably occurs every time a user accesses a website in one of these states, the amount of penalties to which a business may be subject can rise rather quickly.    #The Tracking Technologies at Issue    The two technologies at issue include session replay software and coding tools embedded in chat features. Session replay software tracks a user's interactions with the website — their clicking, scrolling, swiping, hovering and typing — and creates a stylized recording of those interactions and inputs. Coding tools create and store transcripts of the conversations users have in a website's chat feature.    #State Wiretapping Statutes    Plaintiffs ground their claims in the electronic interception provisions of state laws — for example, the California Invasion of Privacy Act, or CIPA, and the Pennsylvania Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Act, or WESA.     Generally, these wiretap statutes prohibit the unauthorized interception or disclosure of communications transmitted electronically. Plaintiffs behind this new litigation trend allege that businesses have violated the law when they record or store the user's interactions with their website and send those recordings to a third party."   Like Temporary-Ebb said Skims is not the only website that does this. Every eComm based company I have personally worked for from small to Fortune 500 has used some type of session replay software.
No, it’s not illegal.   You realize that you have a phone right? That phone captures everything about you.
It’s not her but it’s supposed to look like her
he’s just trying to stir the pot, she has more kardashian lookalike than actual Kim vibes
That's definitely not her.
super tripping
I think it’s just supposed to make us all think that it’s her. Drake is so weird. Why is he doing this now? Is it only for attention? Also this song is awful lol
I think we’ve all seen Kim enough times to know it’s not her
i don’t think its her the nose bridge is too big and the eyebrows don’t look like kims
Tripped up
Trippin
U tripping
The eyes look like Alexa demie to me (not saying it’s her and I highly doubt it is, it just reminds me of her) it’s not giving kim IMO
Drake goofy 🤣 obvi kimmy ok w it bc she not only posted another song on her story awhile ago of his but also had to agree to her voice in the song
I don’t think it’s her because she’d get backlash for ‘instigating shit with Kanye’ but who knows
Kim would never have get black eyebrows. Like bffr
like is it her in the album artwork?
Messy lol
She wouldn’t have actually let him take a picture.
First the AI Kim talking now AI photos - what is even real anymore
Bc Drake is a nerd who can’t keep Womens names out his mouth and is grasping at anything to stay relevant.
agreed
drake wants kim and he's out here trying to manifest her. there's no other explanation.  also, i'm assuming kim cleared this sample because drake seems to business savvy to not get clearance. i hope she enjoys her 25% cut of royalties or whatever she negotiated.
It’s just Drake, pay him no mind 🥱
He sampled a line from the show it’s not like he got her to send him a voice memo.
Song is mid
Some people think she ad libbed for him bc they don’t know where the audio comes from lol
He a child
He’s lame. And she’s lame if she gets with him…publicly
i just hope they don’t end up together
Kris is cooking up something interesting 🤭
Corny
Nah Drake only likes girls ages 14-24
https://preview.redd.it/b1gcp6183hsa1.png?width=827&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c69377e191255b9d56dc040a6c394dd1c846203e  Kim is not on songs credits , that means she’s not getting a percentage unless it was a deal under the table
Didn’t Vogue sue him like 3 months ago for not getting clearance in using their image? I wouldn't call that business savvy.
I don’t think drake wants kim at this point he wants to be Kanye or wants to get under Kanye’s skin
Is she strapped for money or something ?
It's part of God's plan so we don't gotta hear it
If they can make AI generated tracks of Kanye singing Justin Bieber songs, an AI track of Kim talking about whatever Drake wants her to talk about doesn’t seem that far of a reach
Anyone is lame if they get with drake publicly or privately 😂
Oh please. I HOPE they do.  This is the kind of telenovela we deserve.  Lets manifest this shitshow into existence!!!  ![gif](giphy|l0NwNrl4BtDD7JCx2)
I would love the mess
Drake is such a dork he love that, nobody trying to claim him
Yeah I think just a way to fuck with Kanye.  Isn’t Drake half Jewish?
Kanye would lose his GD MIND 😮‍💨🥴…again
ME TOOOO Ive been wanting them to get together
I believe her. Tristan will always be single ❤️
![gif](giphy|eNMu8JD1dxYaNxOz7S|downsized)

Yeah she’s single…handedly choosing to make the same dumb mistakes again with Trashcan bc “hE’S  tRuE’s dAD!” 😒 girl please .
Didn’t she also say this back when she was secretly engaged & had a whole engagement ring on 🤔
Why does she look like a stepford wife here?  ![gif](giphy|YvVJATyEJ4tfW)

This reminds me of me, I was a total fool for this guy he’d convinced me he wasn’t ready to settle down and didn’t want any labels 🚩🚩so I’d say yeah I guess I’m single, whilst being essentially fully involved.   We can convince ourselves we’re totally happy with an arrangement, if she is with Tristan then this might be the deal she’s settled on, it will only make her miserable.
I wish I could post the video of Khloe screaming liar

I did not know this show existed. Jennifer Hudson has a talk show?
And I'm the queen of Sheba
“ Wait, we still fuckin, right?” - 🗑️
Then why has she been wearing that huge diamond around again?
Seriously who really cares
I love this hair color
I didn’t watch this anyone know why she’s randomly doing press?
BAHHHHHAHAHAAHHA OMG the SHADE at showing them canoodling each other on the beach the moment she asks "What are your options?!"  Kim "all up in the mix" is not the flex Khloe intended it to be 😑🤢😳🥴😬  ![gif](giphy|YvvmLB59iCXew)
“She’s nosy and I respect her for that” hahaha
Her poor face, it looks like it hurts to smile or even talk!
Jennifer Hudson looks so good
What I don’t get about this thread is ….haven’t any of y’all had divorced parents???? Mine divorced when I was 4 years old yet my entire life have had dinners together and attended family events together …..bringing their partners too. Like at the end of the day he’s the father of her kids and her spending time with him and being cordial is the best for the kids mental state.
Technically she is single because she is engaged to Tristan and not married yet 😌
okay maybe i’m just crazy but how is there an entire audience without a single person yelling “bullshit” or something 😭
☠️
She is dating him or I guess the run to Mickey D's  together was for True. They ARE coparenting, ya know. /s
I’d be so embarrassed that I’d have to stay in the house
Lmao this killed me
dawg 💀
Because she’s fake and calculated
Because Tristan’s incessant cheating has made her insecure to the point where she wants to emulate perfection all of the time. He’s really damaged her self esteem I reckon.
I will never get used to that hair on her !
https://i.redd.it/m10a3g8okhsa1.gif
🤣🤣🤣
Absolutely! What a huge difference to the way she presented herself when she was with Lamar. She was much more genuine, not afraid of looking goofy or silly, was able to joke about herself, wasn’t always perfectly “done up” and just seemed happy.(And yes I realize he was also toxic in many ways but I don’t believe he trashed her self esteem and I genuinely believe he was very attracted to her and made her feel good about herself-in the beginning. until he cheated on her if course lol)
I will never get used to that face on her
Touche!
i wonder if she has a salt water or chlorine pool
Kylie is like one of those paint colours that says it's a bold colour but actually functions as a neutral
Are the Gen Zers even into this kind of content? Like how many times can you post photos of your oddly posed body in front of a pool before it just seems kind of sad?
Guys I need the Kylie version of those untouched Kim thong pics that leaked years ago and she cried about. DYING to know what the BBL actually looks like tbh.
I like the product tag on the second photo is just straight up on her boob
But like.. where do their vag’s go? The kardashian/Jenner crew I don’t understand the science.
So, what are you guys having for dinner?  Since this is just so boring and the same to say anything else.
Like what is the point of this? Just start an only fans already!
Gotta be desperate for that male gaze
[removed]
I feel like the pics in water make it so easy to pick up the subtle FaceTune tweaks she’s made to her body
Is that a photoshop fail on pic #5? Look under her left ass cheek
Yawn.
What’s with her dead eyes ?  They’re always half open.  Reminds me of Travis Scott when his eyes are half open and his jaw is just hanging open
You can always tell by her posts when she’s broken up with Travis lol. Probably the most relatable thing about her tbh you can find my titties and ass out too when I’m on the fritz with my ex LMAOOOO
🎶life in plastic, it’s fantastic 🎶
Think I’m gonna buy a hot pink bathing suit, I do love that color
summer is approaching. outside is calling.
So am I the only one that notices the obvious  https://preview.redd.it/0msg01aqlgsa1.jpeg?width=852&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=731ec7c08308f65c501f2c72ea396af74e7e440e  distortion in the fifth picture
I am so sick of the dead eyes
How many times have we seen this pool, pose?
Look at the body I ✨paid✨for
So boring. What's the point?
She knows we just saw the vogue video right
I want to touch her hip and Butt so bad. I just wanna know what the feel is like. (Nothing about this comment is meant to sound sexual, just extremely curious)
Won’t lie… really wish I looked like this naked 😅
She looks great tbh
Is she smashing Timee or no
incoming complaints about male gaze, dead eyes, too sexy, etc……
Hmm where's the Kylash???? Can't find it 🤔
Honestly why even wear a bathing suit at this point? Just go skinny dipping.   I don’t understand the appeal of this type of swimwear.
Imagine how bored we are Kylie…*sighs*
Everytime I see a butt picture, I think about how devastating it is that boot isn't short for booty 😞 edit because I thought about it more: I didn't consider that booty/bootie is singular, so boot isn't actually the shortform, but like how funny would it be if ppl were like damn, that person has a nice boot.
This is silly but… does it bother anyone else that no one in this family has a safety fence around their pool? Maybe it’s the mom in me but it’s all I can see when I see pictures of their pools.
She looks sweaty rather than wet from the pool
Love pinks love neon. Cute bikini
Ok, obsessed with the swimsuit 🩱.
Is she okay????????????????
Did she get rid of her tattoos? I thought she had a bunch! Also she looks amazing haha and I need a hot pink bathing suit now
yawn
Love that the Brazilian bikini bottom is coming back in style. I hated the high waisted 60’s look!
These are cringe
😴
Boring
The wet on her body is very even. She looks good in these pics but that factis giving me rotisserie chicken vibes
i’m genuinely curious why everyone in this sub is so against women posting sexy photos of themselves?
we know she doesnt look like that. kylie hunni stop cosplaying as latina or (insert different race)
HOT! She looks good, don’t hate lol
She looks sweaty lol
Is that piece of shit suit for sale @Kylieswim ? 😂😂
Amazing how plastic makes as much mula as it does..I MEAN REALLY
Question: those bikini bottoms. How do they stay like that and not hike up the crack? Sorry, I don't get this style.
The last slide looks like Squidward in a bikini
she loves swim😍
New implants?
Who takes all these pics
[removed]
Not the plumbers crack in pic 4
The last pic is giving squidward bold and brash
The last pic — WHY IS THERE NO CREASE I *KNOW* YOUR DAMN THIGH ISN’T SMOOTH LIKE THAT ffs
Def salt
I bet it’s magnesium. All the rage nowadays.
[removed]
What an insult lol
![gif](giphy|YvvmLB59iCXew)
I love this
Omg what a read!
Sick burn 🫡
LOL, soooo, them new eyeshadows she pushing?
This is an insanely good diss lol
as a gen Zer…. most of us aren’t in to this content and a lot of the comments on tiktok seem to mirror that.
It’s so old to post stuff like this. They are all so out of touch
I imagine. I'm 33 now, but in 2013-2016, this was the kinda content I would post. Me posing slutty and super staged, at some nice house in the Hollywood Hills.   But now I feel like the new generation is nothing like that. It's more of a blurry photo/fake candid aesthetic.   Kylie is still pretty young, I'm surprised she hasn't adopted to the current trends.
as a millennial i’m bored
It’s been sad
Kylie is getting too old for this
I’m so over it personally. We’ve seen every part of these girls bodies. The thousands of selfies and body pics are just boring and predictable at this point.
Ass and being hot is never sad
Probably similar to stassie’s one ? Her unedited pics were leaked and posted on this sub.
samee lmao
They already exist and it looked the same. No way you’re this deluded
There is a weird dimple on her right boob that I can’t stop focusing on. Bad photoshop? Scarring?
VVLT vagina vulva lip transplant
I just cooked a big ol pot of beans. Looking to make some  enchiladas with them 😋
Honestly, she would make billions on OnlyFans
Makes me sad but I wonder if her being desperate for male attention is related to the fact that her dad is not a masculine influence? Like she never had a strong father figure and this is why? Idk
deffs should just do onlyfans at this point
The slut shaming is astronomical 😭
How?

She deleted that slide 💀
sure is
[removed]
This was my color last year! It was fierce
worth the investment lmao i wish i looked like this in a bikini 😭
Dude, I want to know what she had done so I can have it done. I'm built like a fucking fridge. No shame in your comment because high key same.
She probably does too
But… she doesn’t look like that in real life. What you’re appreciating is a filtered and photoshopped artificially created picture. That’s not actually her as she exists on this earth. And that’s sad for her, not even for us.
agreed. i’d never put on real clothes if i were her 😅 edit: spelling
right? we have to accept that every single think the Kardashians do is for male validation - there is no need for those specific comments because we already know what the girls' objective is
Mostly because these pictures make some girlies feel insecure lol
I think about that too but I’m assuming there’s 24/7 Nannie’s that make sure kiddos don’t get too close?
Because it's all she posts and it just seems sad and redundant at this point
I dont think its women, its just the Kardashians cause were bored and need better content.
They are miserable and want to hate on her to feel better about themselves
it’s giving rotisserie chicken

Hehehe thank you for your expert analysis! Yeah, that’s kind of the general sense I get from Gen Z, and I’m honestly happy to see that shift. And it’s not that I have an issue with people showing off their bodies. I’m all for that. It’s that these photos are all exactly the same and they clearly are incredibly altered that it’s almost like looking at AI art. The blank eyes are also unsettling to me.   I think women’s bodies are genuinely beautiful and I love that so many young people are more comfortable showing their authentic, imperfect bodies without shame. I honestly envy that kind of confidence because I’m still stuck in the early 200s mindset (for myself) as that’s when I came of age.
Dude she has two freaking kids. The chick is a mom with a face of a 40yr old. Kylie ain’t hip.  ![gif](giphy|wYyTHMm50f4Dm|downsized)
It is when that’s the only card a person knows how to play 🥴
Agree and disagree. I’m not against posting a good thirst trap, but at some point it’s worth thinking about our own internal male gaze and whatnot. Our choices don’t exist in a vacuum and aren’t inherently empowering just cause we technically had a say.   TLDR it’s ok to be a hoe but it’s even better to be a hoe who uses critical thinking
Okay but what if they were hot and had their ass near a hungry puppy??
I want to see
Are you actually Kylie or just a stan? Looking through your history it’s hard to tell.
I am not up on my plastic surgery… did you make this up or is this a legit procedure?
girl can you make me some
That would be an honest way of becoming a self made billionaire
Right! She's pretty much doing it already for free. I don't understand. It can't be about reputation because her family is known for Kim's sex tape. So what's the difference?!
I think it's more about growing up in a society where looks and wealth are prioritised over education and character growth. She just doesn't really know what else to do with herself.
Probably has more to do with being thrust into the spotlight at a very vulnerable age and having her looks picked apart by millions of people, don’t ya think?
Ass so fat it melts concrete
uff thats embarrassing
What am I looking at? Teach me 😅
Yeah then she posted a cropped version on her story, she’s hilarious

Sorry, I've never seen her in real life or naked so I can't logically sit on social media and tear her looks apart saying that's not what she looks like because I'm not unhinged.
Not really, any of us could Photoshop ourselves like she does to achieve the look.
that’s exactly what it is lool
no it’s not. if kendall or kourt were to post these exact same pics the comment section would look very different and you know that. it’s almost like everyone is mad at grown women for getting BBLs
Meaaaan energy!
Salt pools are for the rich lol
I can’t tell but most pools luxury pools are salt now. Not even luxury pools just most people prefer a salt pool over chlorine including myself 😝
Ugh I’m also stuck in the mindset, but only for my own self hatred. I see people of all body types and think they are beautiful. I do not lend myself that same grace, as I wasn’t raised with it. I’m short and chubby, I’m supposed to be skinny if I’m 5ft. The fashion industry doesn’t even make clothes for my body type because I’m not supposed to exist. You can be plus size if you’re tall, you can be short if you’re thin. You can’t apparently be short and plus or tall and thin, both things seem to be impossible to find clothes for.
As a young mom I feel this so hard. I’m only 33 but my kid is turning 11 on Monday and all my friends with kids the same age are well into their 40s. I try to keep up with trends and then they look at me like I have 3 heads because I like dua lipa lol   Why do so many moms lose themselves after kids? I also did and now that she’s getting older I’m trying to find myself again. It’s hard!
Women are multidimensional, we can love thirst traps and have more to offer. This isn't 1955 bby
You're arguing about this with the wrong person tbh. Agree to disagree
💀
I have no idea what this comment means 😭🥲
I can’t find the post cause I don’t remember the title but here’s a pic I screenshotted at the time  https://preview.redd.it/st1mvvh2fjsa1.png?width=749&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a6c8f7ce240f0010633e8a20c086e3d839eb7fef  I mean we don’t know what Kylie’s butt looks like unedited but stassie and Kylie’s butts look identical when they edit.
True that! I wish I had that much of a following to do it because I totally would!
*Travis scribbles new lyric
Look at the concrete not following a straight line.
It's not unhinged to acknowledge the level of filter used on a picture. It doesn't take a person seeing someone in real life to assess that.
I have a couple friends who always insist on taking all the pics during our get togethers, and then they won't send them out until they have photoshopped themselves. They are beautiful without it, but thier need to touch the pics up makes me refuse to Photoshop any of my pictures. I have many "flaws" but I feel like if I Photoshop myself, I will always compare myself to that version of me, and I think that is unhealthy. It's a slippery slope
![gif](giphy|1AIeYgwnqeBUxh6juu)
All Kylie gives is emotional boob grab and sexy face. So that's all she's getting. Kourt and Kendall give more but don't act like they don't get hate on too. They all get hate on. On anything. They're mad at these girls BBLs for lying about it and claiming they don't set u relastic beauty standards.
I’m a poor, please explain why rich peoples like salt water lol
I have a salt water pool. Sure ain’t rich. ;)  It’s actually less maintenance and cost.
LOL me and boo bout to get an above ground pool for like 400 and do salt water so luxury it is 🤣🤣
Nooo because why do I have this same problem. I'm 5'1 and 170 lbs and finding clothes is so upsetting. I have no clothes right now because I just can't put myself through that mentally.
35, no kids, still lost. Child, you just getting tired, enjoy your babies and relax and enjoy your life!! Let(s) go!!!
Honestly, you’re so right truly. But What else does she offer publicly???
I am a feminist and believe in women’s power to choose for themselves. I find these photographs awkward, I feel uncomfortable looking at them and I have this yearn to call out everything that’s « fake » here but at the same time I also think that it’s her life and she should be free to enjoy and celebrate if she feels happy with herself/her body. Actually, it’s quite backwards to think that she should meet the expectations of others. She shouldn’t feel ashamed of her body just because I feel uncomfortable.
Take me back to 95' lol
I wasn’t arguing with you, it’s called a conversation but go off
Hahaha if there was a hot person showing off their butt but they were right by some hungry puppies, would ass and being hot still never be sad??
Ew holy shit
Oh my FUCK. I literally audibly gasped
*omg*
Honestly, I would sell used panties to pay my student loans but my husband said no 😅
Oh wow!!! As soon as you say it it's so obvious... And we're sure it's not caused by some optical illusion because the water is moving? Truly fascinating stuff
Omg I just looked at the other pics where you can see the concrete and the curve isn’t there it’s only in that pic
I can't discuss how someone looks like with my whole chest when I haven't seen them irl, sorry.
Not damaging to skin & hair
Chlorine isn’t really good for your skin, turns ur hair green if ur a blondie, and has this weird smell that stays on u 😂 if I’m ever in a chlorine pool I shower right after or else I feel sticky
Lmao that’s actually such a good price for a pool tho 😫
The struggle is real! I love summer cause I don’t have to worry about pants length and can just line in shorts or dresses.
Literally thought this was a me problem only!
Who cares about the public? We don't live for other people, we live for ourselves. I don't know her, I'm sure people who do can answer what she has to offer lol someone's social media persona isn't the person they are, for better or for worse.
Completely agree. I think it's valid everyone has their own criteria, I personally don't post pictures like these at all, I used to when I was younger, but simply don't because I feel it doesn't fit the persona I want to present on social media anymore. My focus rn is my career, starting a family and being less interested on sharing my life online. That's empowering to me. But I also recognize what's important to me isn't important to other people, and I respect whatever others want to do. What I don't respect is those wanting to impose _their_ beliefs onto others. It's problematic, and it's literally the basis of everything that's wrong in society.
ar·gue /ˈärɡyo͞o/ give reasons or cite evidence in support of an idea, action, or theory, typically with the aim of persuading others to share one's view
Hahaha thank you for explaining that to me 😂 you’re right, hungry puppies automatically make anything sad!
But maybe Kylie has better plastic surgery ? Who knows ? Doubt it though.I highly doubt after Kim’s pics got leaked in Mexico they will ever let unedited pics get leaked again. We’ll probably never know what Kylie’s butt really looks like.
What he doesn't know won't hurt him 😂
Looks like she deleted specifically that photo from the post on Instagram - so I’m inclined to believe it was an oops!
You literally just did when you called her body “great”. A positive opinion is still an opinion, and you gave one without seeing her irl.
It also takes off spray tan too lol. If I swim in chlorine pools my tan looks like crap and they all have fake tans
Oh okay so the benefit is that it isn’t chlorine, got ya, thanks for the explanation ☺️
She’s a billionaire who made her billions from, say it with me, the PUBLIC and could and can do literally anything and I do mean ANYTHING and continues to give nothing but thirst traps over and over and over again for mids products. Seems pretty clear there’s not much else there. Nonetheless appreciate your POV!
Oh you’re one of those people 💀man I’m sorry your nervous system is this fired up but hope you get well soon  ![gif](giphy|mGDiZS7syaICrVoUDN)
OMG lmao!!   Babe. I'm basing my opinion off of what I can see. She looks good. It's literally what I'm seeing with my eyes. Me making up she looks any different than what she's posting isn't logical because how tf would I know? 😭
you are welcome 😘😘
Hard disagree. She can do anything but does what she wants to do. If you don't like thirst traps, news flash, don't post them. Women constantly posting thirst traps doesn't mean they have nothing to offer. _This isn't 1955._ But ok
Nervous system fired up for a sentence and a copy paste from google 💀💀💀
No one’s arguing that she doesn’t look good in the photos. She does. What is, however, being discussed is the obvious photo manipulation KarJenners use to create unrealistic beauty standards. One picture from Kylie’s post shows the cement suddenly curves near her body when it doesn’t in other photos, evidencing photoshop. There’s plenty more photoshop evidence in other KarJenners posts. One doesn’t need to physically see their bodies in real life to see that their photos have been edited to make themselves appear differently online. Should young girls see this and believe that only if they exercise enough, starve their bodies, and take the right supplements that they too can look just like Kylie? Because that’s what happens when society doesn’t stand up and say that these influencers are being dishonest. It’s not shaming Kylie’s body, but advocating the dangers of what she falsely presents herself as: completely natural.
Agreee to disagree m8 ☮️
I think you’re like one feminist wave behind. Nobody here cares that she’s posting thirst traps. The part that’s sad to me is the way this happy, confident little girl was exposed to a level of public scrutiny none of us will ever understand and she has literally molded herself into a hologram of the male gaze as a result.
We don't know what these people look like. For better or for worse. Bffr  I will **never** agree with the whole society natural bullshit narrative. _Stop comparing yourself to other people_. You knowing she has surgery or not and looks the way she looks won't make you feel better. Work on yourself fr
Have you read these comments? They're claiming she has nothing to offer because of the constant thirst traps and that it makes her sad lol for literally posting hot pictures of herself. Ya'll love to call the male gaze but forget who's their actual audience and who truly eats up their content... I'll answer for you, it's _women_.
We know they edit their photos to look better, yes. How do we know that? Unedited photos that have been leaked. Videos. Photos that present clear evidence of photoshop.
Not them kind of looking good together 🫠
I’ve been gone for too long why tf is this man being posted here 🧍🏽‍♀️
This is Kylie many faces ago.
People get extremely weird on TikTok
Love that it’s all old Kylie photos, when she may have actually been his type lol. She was so cute back then :(
those photos of kylie are cute tho
LMAO IM DEAD. They’re both hot obviously but the pairing makes no sense I’ll never buy it until I literally see him fxking her in a hot tub(iykyk )
Ppl are so chronically online 😩😭😂
He’s so handsome it hurts 😍. Please break my heart
I could see this Kylie with him but not the current overdone Kylie that hasn't got a personality anymore.
Wait this is kinda cute
I feel like they’re pushing this rumor for Kylash promo
https://youtu.be/fTgTC7fwhOo
Kylie could have gotten into Timothy’s pants but instead she settled for Travis….   Candle could have gotten into Timothy’s pants… But she settles for Benito…  These women….
Girl you should just stay away!!  (jk how can any of us resist??) Khloe has been spotted in the McDonald's drive through with Tristan as the passenger princess, Kim is publicly displaying her partnership with balanciaga (sp??) And they're putting out a Kravis love special that I am sure is gonna be full of feet 😂
Right, bc why is it almost all younger photos of them?
mine as well pls
As an elder millennial, Timothee looks like a child to me. Benito looks like a grown man. I wouldn’t consider that settling.
What’s wrong with bad bunny?
They’re so predictable 🤣🤣 they better not be on a Tristan redemption tour AGAIN!
Ik, with Kylie’s face from 7 years ago
They totally are. Apparently Tristan’s redemption arc is going to be a storyline of the new season (rumours of course but still)
I honestly believe it's the balance of having the tiny upper lip with the big lower one. She looks weird now because the upper lip is doing too much imo
She was so pretty during this era
She really did! And look how much smaller her boobs were!
I remember she was going through it with Tyga and was posting non stop on Snapchat this trip. lol. It was the first time there was break up rumors considering they only recently admitted to dating after she tuned 18.
She looked then what she should be looking like now. She aged herself too much too fast
When we return to this look>>>>
it’s giving female chuck bass
Did she has a nose job?
She also had a bigger nose here, and I think it suits her face much better. Also this was before she changed her eyelids or whatever the heck it’s called
I'll say it again and again, I blame all adults around Kylie for letting her start with plastic surgery this early. Human body stops developing around 23 yo, I was finally happy with the way I look when I turned 26. And it had little to do with self esteem, in photos it is clear the face evened out and just looks better. I wish someone close to Kylie, a parental figure would tell her that she's beautiful and there's absolutely no need to destroy that with plastic surgery. If she would just wait 🥺 Now it's too late to go back, I believe she knows that and probably regrets.
impossible lmao
Is it pronounced bass or bass
i think she has had one at least
Ya the medium sized nose suited her. This tiny nose she has now just makes her cheeks look even larger. And her top lip looks too fake. Everyone wants the same nose but people dont realize that facial harmony is more important than facial perfection meaning a small ski slope nose dont look good on everyoneee bc it could throw off their other features
I’m sure it’s pronounced bass
I love the idea of Deux being completely unhinged as usual and posting with this being the only proof, and i love the absolute chaos potential of this actually being true
ykw im just glad they’re giving ppl something to talk about
imma just see how this plays out cause i ain’t believe the Kendall and Bad Bunny rumors at first 💀
so weird but fuck i’m rooting for them if it’s true. timmy is a huge upgrade from travis. i just fear she’s gonna snap him in half 😭
Man Kylie has too much self awareness. Look how she is standing!! She looks amazing but everytime I see her in a 'cabdid' pic, she is always posing. My slouched ass could never
He used to give lowkey dorky vibes so I think they would be perfect together and probably more what Kylie needs.   I feel like he would fit in with her friend group too.
If this whole thing turnout to be true. Deuxmoi posts should be allowed in this sub
I think her and Kendall should swap. Kenny and Timmy and then a Kylie/Bad Bunny pairing
I don't really know him, but I really don't see what she's got going for her besides money, I'm not sure you could converse.
[removed]
is that kylie or kendall??!
Maybe this will manifest in them connecting on how funny it is then they’ll date
Wait that's Kylie?
That’s Kylie????
I mean even if not, we bored let us speculate as long as we being careful and not gullible
It is true. They are doing a soft launch. Gotta see how people react first.
He’s an amazing actor and very attractive guy 😍

Because Khloe is Tristan's retirement plan
because she literally takes care of him. he wants his cake and to eat it too.
Cause she’s a kardashian and that brings fame and money. That’s all
Why not? She forgives him everything, she's extremely wealthy, no matter how publicly derided he is for his escapades she in some way elevates and legitimizes him, and it's probably intensified since his recent loss, but she is ride or die and I'm sure very involved with his brother's care. Honestly, I think there's a lot of qualities to her, she's beautiful, kind, and generous, she might not be what he actually wants but she's good enough especially when he can get with any girl and still go home to her
She’s the ultimate form of narcissistic supply. She’s famous, rich, attractive, is a giver/caretaker and most importantly has no personal boundaries and will put up with his shit infinitely. Narcissists view “love” as what they can get out of the other person. I guarantee if she actually started asserting herself and putting in boundaries with him he’d be onto the next victim.
Trashy men love a woman with low standards
She's the only reason he's somewhat relevant. Have you seen him in the news for other things than Khloe?
He wants to have his cake and eat it too, and she lets him so seems like a no-brained for him 🤷🏼‍♀️
- because she’s a kardashian  - because she’s a safe and stable option that will always be there for him - because he actually might like her, he just also likes fr!cking othef girls  - because he knows he can - because they have a child together and he has this idealized version of a perfect family that he’s not actually ready to put the practical work to make happen yet  - because it boosts his ego
Clout and all the perks that come with it.
He clearly doesn’t want to be with her IMO  What makes you think he’s “with” her ? They don’t live together. His d*ck is community property. She takes care of his kids and he comes by once in a blue moon.   By all definitions except khloes they aren’t together lol
Because she comes from a rich family and is extremely famous. He’s a leech
Because she’s mother. She takes care of people to her detriment. Plus the financial security after his career inevitably fails and his savings is used up by baby mamas
Money and fame. I think that's the same reason that barker went after a Kardashian. First he was interested in Kim then Kourtney.
She pays him... at least that’s what the rumors in LA says. The consensus seems to be that they have an open relationship even though Khloe would want something more traditional, that she’s too ashamed to publicly admit it, that he told everyone she’s not his type but that he stays for money, fame, connections and opportunities, and that she pays him to not see his son and to hang out with her. Oh and that Kris told him that if he marries Khloe she will pay him for it but he refused. I personally have no doubt in my mind that this man spends much more than he earns on his own because he’s a bit (a lot !) of a luxury whore. And staying with Khloe is pretty easy money, right ? You can basically do whatever you want anyway. Dream job.
He’s a narcissist. This is what they do.
He likes the big bbl
She's too easily manipulated and taken advantage of.
Fame and money. He's not even into her physically, but she's a good retirement plan.
He probably needs her more than ever (financially) because he can't get back into the NBA.
Bc Misery loves company
Because he can… why not do what he wants AND be forgiven Everytime and taken care of. 🤷🏻‍♀️
Maybe he thinks women are Pokémon and he’s gotta catch ‘em all
She has money and fame, that’s it. He doesn’t love her, he loves the notoriety that being with her gets him. No one was checking for him before she came along.
Mom figure
YES ! It also brings all the 'fans' that want to hookup with him BECAUSE he's w Khloe 🤮
I don’t think he cares about her fame or money.
I agree that Khloe has many fantastic qualities, but I don’t think Tristan does or he wouldn’t repeatedly humiliate her. I just can’t see why he would put the amount of effort to get Khloe back that they claim he does
He doesn’t…but there’s fangirls that do, and will sleep with him because of khloe
Lol that’s the funny thing about girls, they will literally want you because of your girlfriend. I need this to scientifically studied
Guys are 100% the same. I’ve had guys who weren’t interested at all suddenly obsessed with me because I was dating someone they were competitive with. They just want to “win.”

Oh so Stormi’s mom is really dating the Frenchie…  https://preview.redd.it/rc8by4rjrdsa1.png?width=1169&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0944f3fc9174a5e9f62524c5986c6ece62d96c31
Her bffs always give Kylie clone vibes, but it seems she saw Stass’ bf and decided to uno reverse that shit for a change
cant umagine kylie with this skinny tiny man lolll
...Russell Westbrook???
Can someone explain to me what I happening in this picture? I only see a leg and an arm?!
Russ is so random 😭 like what is Brodie doing out with these people (assuming he wasn’t just at the same restaurant)
It’s not true 😭😭
Westbrook?! lol I feel like he’s trying to stay hip with the kids.
this photo reveals nothing. either that or I’m blind and I don’t see any clues, it just looks like one of the girls hiding
girl stop please i’m sick of it
Timothy is the same height as Travis (5'10) and 3" taller than Tyga lol. Travis is pretty small too. He's more fit, I'll give him that.
Uhhhhhhhhh Travis is a twig lol
WHY NOT?
They needed an old guy to play dad.
It’s just Kendall hiding from the paps in the back of a car  Edit: re reading this I sound like a smart as$ sorry didn’t mean to attend it that way
It’s the weirdest group of people😂
she likes them skinny lmao i remembered that video of travis walking on a runway im dyinggg
Girl the biggest D’s I’ve seen were on skinny guys. Deadass.
There’s a reason 😂 I’m a woman but I remember reading something when I was losing weight that when men lose a good amount amount of weight it can make it appear bigger. So they don’t necessarily have bigger ones, but the heavier you are the smaller it can look.
You ain’t lying about the last part    On the flip side, the fatter I get the fatter this p gets lmao
i know this is repeated so much but I MISS HER OLD STYLE 😩 and her longer hair
Kourtney is the most effortlessly sensual out of all of them and quite frankly has always been the most interesting to look at.
Kourtney has more sex appeal than Kim.
I’ll never get over that orange dress. Her legs! 😍
I feel like she dresses for her height a lot better than Kim
Okay imagine this, youre tied of carrying around your butt, so you prop it up on a railing and then someone goes and takes a pic
Soooo fine
Aaand it's time to work out...get that summer "bod."
Kourtney is by far the hottest and I’m sure that kills  Kim.
Her Younes era was UNMATCHED 💔
Literally the most interesting to look at  ![gif](giphy|Fr2i2wxTxA2DS)
She has the best proportion I have ever seen in my life
I had that exact *NSYNC shirt, bought it at their concert in 2001 I think. Man I wish I still had it
DEFINITELY the most exciting to look at 😍 Kourt is literally so beautiful and I think that’s why Kim is always so mean to her. Especially telling her she’s the “least exciting to look at” it enrages Kim that Kourt is prettier than her and more authentic and Kim knows this. That’s why she tries to put Kourtney down and make her self conscious
I thought Kourtney was Kim in photos 2 & 11😅
Omg 1 & 9
Her style was best with Younes
Ive always been weirdly attracted to her saddlebags. Like they are just so cute lol her body is banging
Meh not very interesting to look at
Filtered.
I think pic 1 is Kim
Where is that orange dress from? It looks amazing so cute.
I wonder if Kourt has ever been with a woman 🤔
Gurl same
it’s the aries in her 🔥
Than anyone in the family. She’s the only one with any sex appeal. Her natural confidence is very attractive
wym? she’s the least interesting to look at 🤪
I’m a short petite gal like Kourtney… someone tell me how she rocks a dress with sneakers bc that shit makes me look like a hobbit. Her legs look so long 😭 someone explain that kind of sorcery to me I am begging
I feel like she dresses a lot better than Kim in general
But somehow it looks so gooood like effortlessly sexy if this was Kim's BBL I'd be laughing crying
YES!!! Exactly! Kourtney is just so gorgeous and always has been. Kim could never compare. She was her prettiest as a child.
what’s a saddlebag?
I just plucked these from the internet, I can assure you I have not filtered any lol
Her body proportion is so good, that’s why. Not only the proportion but she has legs shape that can rock any pants or skirts. I’m short too and I couldn’t wear that dress because of my legs.
Kim’s maxi skirt/Naoimi hair and fur coat era was my fav
Another way to shame women for their bodies! I believe it’s the widest “point” (for lack of a better word) of the hip/thigh region if that makes sense
My legs are indeed a bit on the thick side due to sports in high school, think you’re probably exactly right. My legs end up looking stumpy 😂   My legs are also the reason I refuse to give up my skinny jeans, so this all adds up in my head
just looked it up. so disturbing that there is a demeaning name for literally everything on a woman’s body. ugh, something i could’ve definitely gone without ever hearing of
Yes the term isnt great but i like them! My intent was not to shame at all my b
Wasn’t having a go at you at all! Just society in general
Kanye rn:  https://preview.redd.it/lglkjj2fidsa1.jpeg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e294339dabac8993f40655665a31b31feb42c375
It’s already back up
Some of the videos are North that films without any "adult" supervision and she got banned due to bring underage most likely
Good!  The child deserves a little bit of privacy  https://preview.redd.it/3uww1eayldsa1.png?width=1169&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=561b1986c05fe116aa140eafa9c26becc8c3c7e8
They took the PR post to heart obvs
I hope it stays banned
thank god. that child is growing up wayyy too fast
Kimberly just be taking L after L  https://preview.redd.it/eojegoftldsa1.png?width=1169&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4fca5c6fda22c507d9e3aa32e6d7fed9e18758e5
This happens all the time and then it comes back
Kanye mass reported the page because he was pissed 😂
Probably temporary lol
They just got fined £12 million for not protecting children's data so it might be to do with that.
I wanna know more, there is absolutely no way TT would delete someone that high profile who brings so much ad friendly traffic but also idk why North or Kim would wanna delete it?
There's just no reason for anyone under the age of 13* to have a public social media account, or be a part of their parents. It's too dangerous, and kids have zero understanding of how permanent the internet is. I honestly think it should be illegal.  *and I think that's also too young
Very good. At least someone stepped up to protect that child.
![gif](giphy|WeaIjMN9QUrsI)
Recently a 9 years old girl who was quite moderately famous in my country for Instagram reel, passed away because of suicide.  Kids this young should not be monetized or used for creating a brand. They deserve a childhood that's normal. If they want to have fun create a private account with only friends and family! ffs
Glad I was on the winning team with this one 😌
I used to pray for times like this
~for now~
https://www.tmz.com/2023/04/06/kim-kardashian-north-west-tiktok-account-disappears/ here’s a tmz article 💀 this is a damn lie
Should never have been on in the first place
GOOD.
This account has been out for over a year and now it’s down 🤔
Good
God stepped in
Good!!
Ye got his way lol. He must have bought staff a Birken each for this favor
Thank goodness.
![gif](giphy|8y37L91bd8Uda)  North rn
Yayyyyyyy !
I bet some people are losing their minds over this account getting banned. 🤣🤣
Ye W
Kim is in Japan with North, promoting Balenciaga. Hopefully that is the reason it was banned.
Honestly, it’s probably not a bad thing 🤷🏻‍♀️

Lmaoo first thing that came to mind was “Kanye did it!” 😂
Ironic how The New Workout Plan just started playing through my AirPods
LMFAOO
They must be going tit for tat
You are everywhere with this meme and I feel it everytime! 😂
😂😂
Omg
It’s back up
Seriously . I feel so bad. She’ll never get that time back to be a child. I’m so glad I didn’t have access to social media till I was 16. Life was so much more simple and pleasant. When I look back on those times of reading books and riding bikes it brings me so much joy. Even still I regret not being able to be a child anymore doing childish things. After social media came it was all about external validation. Which is why I deleted my accounts. I’m only on Reddit now
 How is she growing up too fast? I don’t know anything that would indicate this besides being exposed to paps. It seems like she is experiencing normal childhood things right now (team sports, slumber parties, hobbies) and she’s mostly protected from her father’s erratic behavior.
I didn’t even think about it that way 😭 damn.
You be comin' THROUGH with the gifs and I am here for it! 🤣🤣
Flop era
The Antisemye
But it doesn't say the acoount is deleted; it says it's banned. A person could most likely delete their account but an account ban probably comes from TT itself. Just my opinion though....
She’s 9. She should not be on TT and there shouldn’t be an outlet for adults to follow a 9 year old.
It was subject of their divorce and custody battle. Kanye didn't want the kids on social media, Kim said she was monitoring it. Maybe he found evidence she wasn't.
Tiktok would delete it . They delete a lot of high profile accounts if go against guidelines
The only way I can see Kanye actually getting North off tiktok is if he badgered her about it and she deleted it because she loves her dad. Like, does he even have a lawyer rn? I guess his wife might be onto this stuff (oh god did he even get a prenup)
I would be sooo embarrassed if the entire world saw me dressed up as Brittany spears at age 9 and singing I’m a slave for you. That is what the ice spice thing is essentially. I cannot imagine any sane mother letting their 9 year old wear an outfit that said JUICY on their ass plus posting it online. The whole situation is so far removed from reality. “When the lyrics talk about a rough sex (blowing her back out), just step outta frame northie! Everything else is appropriate though “ -Kim k
Oh you KNOW it's a damn lie! THE ACCOUNT WAS BANNED, not deleted!  Edited- According to TMZ, it's back up but why did they use that lame excuse of North not feeling it? North is clear across on the other side of the world doing stuff with her mom. TMZ really needs to get it together 'cause the math's not mathing. What HAPPENED was...measures were probably taken to remove the account and it just so happened while they were away. Someone on their team probably noticed it and called Kim. Kim then probably called her mom CRYING- "Mom, you've GOT to do something! This can't be happening right now! Get them to reactivate the account and call TMZ and tell them SOMETHING positive to print so it doesn't look like my fault! Please?!"  Pathetic. 🤣🤣
I think it’s because tiktok is fighting to stay available in the US rn with child protection laws.
Wait what would it be banned because of that ? Or am I missing something ?

Or tik for tok
Girl be for REALLLL!! A normal childhood?? As a child of divorce I don’t remember strangers coming up to me yelling at me and asking about my dads mental health because my mom called these strangers to take a pics of us walking from my basketball game to prove she’s a real mom who cares.   My mom also never paid Britney Spears to come hang out with me and my friends
💀💀💀
Oh 🤦🏽my bad idk how I read banned and it went straight over my head lol. The only thing that has changed since the account started is the whole congress mess about banning TT so I guess it could be some sort of move to save face on the company’s part?   All for the best, but it’s curious they singled them out when they should also delete those creepy ass toddler-centered accounts
i wanna say he did get a prenup?? i mean these are his own lyrics:  If you ain't no punk holla, "We want prenup"  “We want prenup!", yeah  It's something that you need to have  Cus when she leave yo ass she gone leave with half

Those kids were doomed from the beginning with both parents and her family.
I said besides the paps… so there’s bo reason to go off lol and yeah, North has has access to celebrity kid shit but I’m still confused as to how she’s growing up too fast… nobody provided any concrete examples of this girl not having a childhood and acting grown.
Ye is friends with politicians I'm sure he used the talk of banning TT to his advantage and got it banned. He probably said he would donate a shit ton of money to a cause and they went for it.
That’s not how any of that works
Y’all already writing think pieces about couples that arent even official . People can just hang out or have flings, everything is not that deep.It could all just be made up too .Y’all think everything is for PR too when if it was for PR they would be in our face not trying to hide.
o we’re believing deux moi again  https://preview.redd.it/193oxaqehdsa1.jpeg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9786b1c57cf18119ca0844bb5b7c0abd153ff959
Honestly I hope it’s true lol   Timothee seems like a good guy and as long as Kylie keeps dating trash rappers, she’ll be being treated bad
Timothee Chalamet??
Its not just a kardashian’s flop era, it’s both lol
i don’t think ppl understand what PR means 😕
they thinks it’s PR when they don’t like it 🌚
I kind of agree except  A) pr can be subtle and specifically made to spark discussion about whether it’s true or not. That makes people pay way more attention because they’re trying to solve something and have something to gossip about. More effective than just coming out and saying it. And they can just plant stories and such.  B) they really are just the PERFECT guys to be chosen for Kendall and Kylie rn. Kendal and Kylie are struggling to appeal to the new generation; they’re sorta stuck in the Kardashian model which worked ten years ago but doesn’t really anymore. Timothee is like the epitome of everything that Kylie is lacking in her appeal to the younger gen. And all this applies in a less stark way to Kendall and bad bunny
She back it up hard and she got Bad Bunny and Kendall right
exactly lol , people calling Kendall and Bad Bunny or Kylie and Timothee (if true) PR is funny bc we’ve yet to see them actually acknowledge each other or even like/follow each other on Instagram . It’s all just been crumbs and blurry pap pics . For it to be PR they would need to be public about it which they clearly aren’t . It’s more likely that these are just famous young people having fun together than it is anything serious ( again that’s if there’s any truth to it bc deuxmoi is not a reliable source)
Exactly. Like when kendall was photographed with the nba players before at the early stage and nobody ever claimed PR now all of a sudden it’s PR lol
If you get 99% wrong, the 1% that you happen to hit really doesn’t mean anything.
why i thought that was actually her 💀

It’s misnomer to say “it’s not Kim”… regardless she lended / approved her likeness for all of this, and that’s enough for me KRAKE it is!
“I am shocked,” said nobody, probably.
To clarify, the suit isn’t from some dumb rich parent shocked the cult school was bad:  >Ye and his Donda Academy are being sued by two Black women who say they were fired from teaching positions at the school for two reasons -- retaliation for sounding the alarm on alleged education, health and safety code violations -- and for their race.  >According to the lawsuit, obtained by TMZ, the women say they were the only Black teachers employed by Donda Academy when they were hired full-time earlier this year ... and they say it didn't take long for them to notice numerous health and safety violations, unlawful educational practices and extremely unusual rules at Kanye's school.
  Kanye West's private Christian school only feeds students one thing for lunch, sushi, and they apparently have to eat it on the floor without tables or chairs ... this according to a new lawsuit.  Ye and his Donda Academy are being sued by two Black women who say they were fired from teaching positions at the school for two reasons -- retaliation for sounding the alarm on alleged education, health and safety code violations -- and for their race.  According to the lawsuit, obtained by TMZ, the women say they were the only Black teachers employed by Donda Academy when they were hired full-time earlier this year ... and they say it didn't take long for them to notice numerous health and safety violations, unlawful educational practices and extremely unusual rules at Kanye's school.  Among the alleged issues ... the women say the only lunch option available for students is sushi, every single day, and students are not allowed to bring any outside food or drink, except for water. The suit claims Kanye spends $10,000 a week on sushi.  What's more, the teachers claim Kanye did not allow crossword puzzles or coloring sheets at Donda Academy, classes could not take place on the second floor because Kanye is "afraid of stairs," and Ye didn't want children using forks or utensils.  The suit alleges Kanye did not allow artwork to be hung on walls, and no one was allowed to wear jewelry ... simply because he "did not like jewelry."  The teachers even claim Kanye didn't allow chairs, forcing children to sit on foam cushions or stand, while teachers were relegated to standing or using a stool.  Donda Academy, the suit says, required everyone to wear all black from head-to-toe ... and Nike and Adidas brands were forbidden.  The teachers claim the school doors were physically locked from the outside during the school day, and students weren't allowed to go outside until they went home ... with the entire school, pre-kindergarten through 12th grade, taking lunch and recess at the same time indoors.  And, get this ... the teachers claim there are no lesson plans or proper disciplinary procedures in place, resulting in students going undisciplined for multiple instances of bullying and physical assaults against peers and teachers.  The teachers claim when they tried to run the alleged issues up the flagpole, they were threatened not to reach out to Kanye.  The women say they were ultimately fired ... and they're blaming their termination on retaliation and racial discrimination. They also claim their paychecks were often short up to $2,700 per pay period ... so they're suing Kanye and Donda Academy for money.  We reached out to Kanye's camp ... so far no word back.
That’s why these pop-up unaccredited schools are all way too risky, especially when the school is ran by Kanye tho lol
It's an unaccredited "school" that parents have to sign NDA's just for their kids to join. Who is actually surprised? It's a cult, man.
That's expensive kid lunch food
I mean what do you expect sending your kinds to Kanye’s school though lol
Eating sushi in a warehouse in their Yeezy uniforms 🫣 is this real life
Kanye is afraid of stairs

outta your mind for sending your kids there and people were hating on Kim for not doing this at first lol
I feel like focusing on the sushi which is probably not even what happened just takes away from and diminishes the truly fucked up things about the school like the alleged health and safety code violations, unlawful educational practices and the fact that the teachers who spoke out were fired likely in retaliation?
When you try to make education an aesthetic. Dumbass.
Damn I wish I was fed sushi at school 🤤
I could see Kanye only serving Nobu for lunch at his school/cult
whatchu expect when you send your kid to his school?
who expected anything other than this when signing their kid up for this "school". I really am baffled at the parents who wanted their kids attending this place
Didn’t his church get shut down too?
I wonder if TMZ is gonna report on the Kimkardashionruinedmylife.com guy that’s going viral right now and wants to sue her
I forgot about this school
I’m confused on who would send their children to a school started by Kanye West…….
Much better than the majority of shit children in America are being fed
Kids are gonna get mercury poisoning.
Does anybody even care about Kanye anymore lol
i support these women in their suit and i’m not surprised that it was an awful environment to be in.   however one point about the suit that i’m slightly confused why it’s included is about the locked doors—school doors *should* be locked from the outside at all times, whether students are inside or not, it’s a safety precaution. idk what kind of previous teaching experience these women had but locking doors is a standard.
whats wrong with sushi? that sushi platter that guys eating looks delicious
I mean, I do love sushi.
Everybody need to leave that man alone
This is actually sending me cause what happens if the kids have a seafood or shellfish allergy lmao.
I know nothing about lawsuits, but how could you ever get up in court and seriously defend sending your kids there. He'd already said slavery was a choice! He had north around marilyn manson!
HOW WAS THIS LEGAL IN THE FIRST PLACE?!?! Celebrities shouldn’t be allowed to open schools
How much were these teachers getting paid that their paychecks were SHORT $2,700?! I’m a teacher and my paychecks (biweekly) are barely $1600
who needs a school to prison pipeline when your school is already designed like a prison, jesus fucking christ
They were looking for clout and the opportunity for Kanye to turn their child into a star.
And hates jewelry. 💀
Dang, all of Kanye’s money and the cafeteria for his school is basically a dirty storage unit.
They’re eating off those plates from Target that are like 20 cents each…
[removed]
Dude when people were mad at Kim for not moving her kids to his “school” I felt like I was losing my mind lol like how is *this* in their best interest???
I don’t think his school was anywhere near a Nobu
Dude is the one that fucked up. Lost in court. He needs to move on. People cant just fuck with contracts and think they’ll be okay.
I haven’t heard anything about that and the website is just like an empty domain with an ad for plastic surgery. Did KJ shut that down already?? And can you elaborate?
I just feel bad for the selfish allergy people! But if he got my kid to eat sushi I would be so happy lol I can’t afford that shit!
Doors shouldn't be locked from the outside that's a major safety hazard what if there was a fire and the person with the keys wasn't on-site people could die waiting for them to show up. Adults that work there like teachers maybe office staff etc. Might want to go sit in their car for break or lunch or get fresh air that's their choice nobody should be locked in. The doors should be all locked from the inside and hopefully someone monitoring them.
"Code 10! Code 10! Get those chains off the doors! The enemy is here! The enemy is here!" - Joe Clark in Lean On Me.🤣🤣
If you eat fish everyday it can cause heavy metal poisoning, which for children can be even more harmful.
have you read the article?  Also it’s not the parents suing it’s two black women that were teachers who are alleging they were fired for trying to report these issues
>how could you ever get up in court and seriously defend sending your kids there. He'd already said slavery was a choice!  Rich people hear that shit and probably want their kids picking up the rhetoric early so they can keep the trust fund going after daddies ticker gives out.
Because he did what every other for profit education service does is set up a corporation and buy out a school, it's not him personally owning a school so much as him owning the company that owns the school.   There's no non discriminatory way to say that "celebrities" can't own assets like that.
Wasn’t his church just a tent?

I don’t think you need to be near a nobu if you’re Kanye,  Nobu will come to you.
"According to this TikTok, David Liebensohn- the man behind the signs in the video- is allegedly the original creator of Kimoji. Kimoji was an app with Kim Kardashian-themed emojis users could use.  As outlined in the video, Kim Kardashian is being accused of committing fraud to get Kimoji trademarked. Apparently, Kardashian and Kris Jenner had reached out to Liebensohn’s company to set up a meeting with him around 2013/2014. Liebensohn met with the duo in Calabasas to discuss a brand. Once their chat about the brand concluded, Liebensohn reportedly pitched the idea of Kimoji to the pair.  They all allegedly had a verbal agreement aligning on the idea and agreeing to look into it together.  Liebensohn also reportedly showed Kim some concept art of the idea. After a few days, Liebensohn got a call from Kardashian’s team who asked him if he had filed a trademark for Kimoji yet, to which he responded, “No.” They then reportedly told him they would do it for him to “help with the process.”  Shortly after the team did trademark Kimoji- but without Liebensohn’s name attached to the trademark.  Liebensohn had text and paper trail proof that the pair stole his concept art/ideas and ended up suing Kim for $100 million. This caused Kim to counter-sue for over $300 million dollars- an amount Liebensohn could not afford, causing him to back down from the lawsuit.  Although the lawsuit was thrown out, Kardashian and Jenner reportedly told Liebensohn he had to pay them back $400,000 for lawyers, their time,  and financial compensation.  The video ends by stating that Liebensohn lost his family, his wife divorced him and he now lives in his car. He is also working 2 jobs to pay back the $400,000 he owes Kim and Kris. Kimkardashianruinedmylife.com is now trending on social media after Liebensohn outlined his recent hardships in having dealt with Kardashian and Jenner."   https://holrmagazine.com/kim-kardashian-ruined-my-life-kimoji-tiktok-what-happened/   She’s the one that did something wrong and amoral, the only "contract" he broke is a NDA so that he could actually share what happened to him. But I guess in your warped sense of justice, you think it means he deserves to live in his car while working two jobs to pay back a billionaire 400 000 dollars for the money she had to "waste on lawyers and all her precious time she lost during the case"

Kimkardashianruinedmylife.com is now trending on social media after Liebensohn outlined his recent hardships in having dealt with Kardashian and Jenner."   https://holrmagazine.com/kim-kardashian-ruined-my-life-kimoji-tiktok-what-happened/
Not sure what you mean because people with the keys — administrators, teachers, and SROs — are at the school
That’s insane. Who would want to send their kid to this school
If those kids don’t have tables and chairs and he can’t pay the teachers, I’m gonna also assume he doesn’t have school lunch Nobu money 😂
That is fucking disgusting 🤮 what selfish, greedy, vile excuse for human beings. Trump’s finally being held accountable for his behaviour, and he was once the most powerful person on earth. I think in the next 10 years they will get what’s coming to them
Or, he didn't have proof and it was a shakedown.  If the suit had merit he would have go through with it, and gotten some of the money like the Winklevoss twins.
Thank you for filling me in! I hope you (or everyone else) didn’t think I was trying to be rude or an ass. I truly didn’t know and weirdly early the website didn’t work for me, but it does now.   That is fucking wild and I hope something actually comes from this. Thank you again :)
He would get Nobu and never pay and then trash Nobu on twitter for not getting the vision
he's designing a house for her. she spoke about it in the past. it's suppose to be like a spaceship. those were her words, not mine.
https://preview.redd.it/ou5lzwfixcsa1.png?width=1152&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c171ac7da353d5d48ab78c88263f73f78ab65345  Okay but this is the best part 😂😂
she’s building a ~~house~~ compound in palm springs and ando is her architect
[here is an article from a year ago on this house](https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/4286450/kim-kardashian-palm-springs-six-million-home-divorce-kanye/)
Does Kim have any (public) personal taste besides what Kanye likes ? He was the one that was a huge fan of Tadao Ando (he’s his favorite architect) and bought one of the house he designed. Kim has no personal taste or aesthetic, or if shes does she’s too scared that it will ruin her personal brand if she show us... Kim, you’re not forced to be a minimalist, concrete-loving, neutrals-obsessed, self-proclaimed genius like Kanye. You can actually show a little bit of yourself, wtf. Especially since this whole minimalist aesthetic is a bit outdated right now and that the maximalist trend started as a reaction in the 2020s... not that it should matter in general but Kim’s business model is to be ultra trendy and super relevant so that a lot of people can find her aspiring and keep talking about her... so why is she stuck in this place like that ? Find your own brand Kim, for the love of god ! If she truly wants to be an icon so bad, she has to have her own "thing" that make her easily recognizable as Kim Kardashian... this is so boring
Anyone else notice the blatant photoshop in the b&w photo compared to the color photo?  https://preview.redd.it/t2kbma4tbdsa1.jpeg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a419d3051dd171dd2f2212bb090ab42f6e01fe4d
I swear once people become a certain level of rich they do dumbest shit. Build a school, Kim. Open up a women’s and children’s shelter. Do something positive with your ability and privilege.
she’s just building her several million dollar under ground bunker while the rest of us should be worrying about securing our future she’s using her wealth to save herself as us commoners struggle to put three meals on the table-you know the usual
This broad needs to stop acting like she’s passionate about architecture and design. It’s ok to just like fashion and be a bimbo lol!
looked up tadao ando and he’s an architect. it has something to do with Palm Springs.  hmmm what could kim possibly know about architecture? 🤔 very interested in finding out tho!
Oh she’s building a space ship mansion in Palm Springs? Cool cool. We shouldn’t eat the rich or anything.
It’s for her bunker of course
*Gonna throw my money at something else for the clout*
i think it’s cute
The work of a master 🤣😭🤣
Her poor neighbors
oh wow this sounds so incredibly stupid
Tbh I imagine his taste may have grown on her, she did say she liked their house because the rest of her life is super busy and the minimalist style calms her down. Considering how insanity-inducing fame is, I’m not surprised she’d actually enjoy psych ward-core 🫠
She’s never had good style on her own 😂
Lol the table sign on the bottom right was ruining her aesthetic
Geez, I wish I had so little concerns in my life that an item on a table in a picture displaying my unimaginable to 99% of the world wealthy lifestyle was something I just couldn't "deal with".
If anything shines brighter than Kim than poof she will make it be gone!
I don’t play the lotto but when I daydream about winning one billie I always think about paying off my moms house and buying my sister and her kids a house. Then buying an apartment building near a major cancer hospital to house cancer patients that need to travel from far away for treatment. Oh and a dog shelter farm. Oh and a woman’s shelter. Oh and a food pantry. Oh and start a fund to help woman that need to travel for abortions. Oh and I would also get myself a little apartment in nyc lol. But yeah….these people using their millions/billions to make huge ugly mansion after huge ugly mansion just make me sick.
He’s Kanye favorite architect and designed his Malibu home , so that’s the connection , Kim liked Kanye taste in homes even though most people didn’t want to believe so , that’s why she Kept the house in hidden hills the same despite the pair not being together anymore
Palm Springs or Idaho? I know in a previous interview Kim mentioned a vacation house designed by Tadao and another house designed by a different Japanese architect.
I'm OBSESSED. Her lil head copy and pasted onto that beautiful draft of the property!? 🫶🙏
Welp that makes it on par for her then
i only think it’s palm springs bc that’s what it says on the paper
Didn’t even notice that, you’re totally right!
picture 1 is lovely. 2 and 3 she looks high/drunk out of her mind.
I love the style to be honest but her top lip is looking crazy!
I’m not trying to be mean but the way these pictures were taken... it honestly looks like an ad on an escort website. Idk why they didn’t change something about the light, or the poses or anything... and I’m not saying it’s because the clothes are too revealing, half of the time the women in fashion ads for huge brand names are in revealing outfits, it’s just the picture themselves... they feel so cheap and they make her look cheap
![gif](giphy|neo2zaIPZ59K0KbrYH)
Pic 1 is FIRE.   Pics 2 & 3 are the same dead eyes/lazy pose she's doing for everything lately.
whats with the karjen-d&g cash grab?  kourtney and travis have a d&g sponsored wedding  kim does a fashion week collection/campaign with d&g  kylie for the latest eyewear and purse collection?  kris must have cut A MAJOR CHECK.....bet someones wearing d&g to met next month
She's been eating lately, I'm convinced
What has she done to her nose?
I think she looks phenomenal.  She’s been looking more confident and comfortable in her latest pics. Like she’s grown into her own skin or something.   Save all the surgery jokes, we knooooooooooow.
The lips are no bueno
I think she looks pretty here
So bored of her. The whole look, vibe, everything.
her eyes are so dead 🥺
These r some of her best pics imo
There's something about Kylie that I've been loving recently!
she looks like a pretty Indian girl here ♥️
That first picture is gorgeous
Happy she kept her baby hairs. They are so cute!   Bet Kim regrets lasering to the extent of her receding hairline look.
Thank you! Especially #2 she looks f\*\*\*ed up!
Even with the lip injections, she still over lines her cupids bow- every time. It drives me nuts.  Otherwise- very cute campaign.
I mean, D&G has always had bit of a “cheap” quality in that very sense
The pics looks cheap because there’s not a lot of dimension to make it look more 3D. No hair light to separate her from the background and the background is dark like her hair so she doesn’t pop out as much. Just feels cramped
Pic 2 next to Pic 1 looks like she blinked during the shot lmao. Or like she’s rly drunk lol, I can always tell I was drunk in an old photo because my eyes are half closed
Yeah, she actually looks more beautiful with her eyes open and not half closed as she always has them when trying to pose sexy.
Kris is very close friend with one lf the executives at D&G, and since nobody wants to publicly associates themselves with D&G since they made comments and created racists that were deeply racists etc... They have to settle for the Kardashians to be the face of their brand. That’s kinda how Kris moves through the celebrity world in general: Ellen Degeneres and James Corden agreed to star in the Kardashian show only AFTER they were "cancelled" (I’m not saying they were not friendly before, or maybe even friends, but they would have never publicly associated themselves with the Kardashian brand like that), and there are a lot of other examples of this...
Me too! Like whyyyyy?!
I kinda disagree ! I hate the brands and I actually never like their clothes because it was never my vibe, but their ads always looked good and pretty interesting to me (although it’s a tad repetitive), they were not even extremely sexual compared to other’s brands ad and aesthetic, and they never seemed cheap like that. These pictures look like amateur work, on Kylie’s end but even more so on the photograph’s end
Felt!! 😂 It just drives me crazy that she does ~this~ and calls it a marketing campaign. She was like "how can I not leave my house and get paid?"   And people buy this shit!!!!?
Yessss
Yes, also: thanks for bringing to my attention that there is a pattern here, it all just clicked here lol
I want to take my fake pinky nail and just  ![gif](giphy|l1EsZ3evUEy7eLg76)
It’s lame because I like the fit and the styling and her hair and make up look great. It’s just the face she’s giving…. Why
Yes to the fake pinky nail 💅😂
Kylie actually looks like the actual Barbie here!
I genuinely thought the pic of Kim was of Chrishell Stause from Selling Sunset lol
Kylie’s looks so good 😭✋
Wait this is actually amazing
[removed]
Is this legit or just an edit…
I am not going to lie, you had me with that first picture
this was her Halloween costume from 2018
Kylie to Kendall "I see your BB and raise you a Timothee Chalamet" KJCU dropping some blockbusters for the summer...
He married tho….  Edit nvm wrong Timmy C  https://preview.redd.it/3f2rl2ooccsa1.png?width=1165&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=96e15f88ee33c055d953e96f56ff4e0d273f8abd

Number one guess is that it’s TJ - Tristan Junior
I hope she named him Trust. Because you can't Trust his daddy to ever tell the Truth.
Probs Tristan Jr
Tinky winky  ![gif](giphy|w8f9g2x44aGI)
How is she “screwed” it’s an effing name
OMG who actually cares this much about this baby's name at this point
If it’s a Jr. I will seriously be done with everything khloe. I swear to god that will be my straw
Hey quick question... who tf cares? Like "If my daughter outs me, I'm screwed". WHAT?  It's a baby's name. We all get one.  ![gif](giphy|fQoIDlLW6A6BAhyev8|downsized)
It’s Tristan and I won’t hear otherwise.  Her reasoning is probably: iT’s TrUe’S dAd 🤪
And here we go again. There is like no end with Tristan. The circle will close when some of them two dies. Like what the fuck, how many times she can handle the betrayals from him?
Trojan Thompson
T names… Tried, Tryst, Tyga, Tom
this whole name business is so odd. they pretend it’s for privacy but you know they’re only holding out in hopes of getting something out of the announcement (like people watching their show). maybe stop exploiting your kids and their identities then pretend you value privacy?
Why do they share the girls’ names and pretend they care about secrecy with the boys’ names?
Titan
It’s going to be so dumb if she’s been holding out all this time for it just to be Tristan. I’m going to go on a slight limb and think it’s going to be Trevor (Tristan’s middle name)
True and trust issues 💕 love that for her
Am I dumb in believing she wouldn’t actually name him Tristan?
Just keep it now ✋🏻 I ain’t buying
Literally no one gives a fuck, no one. Name him dandelion for all we give a fuck. Man people really have these women believing we care.
i was gonna say we’re all gonna start making unflattering names with a T if she doesnt spill but all of us saying “tristan jr” is clownish enough
![gif](giphy|l3q2uvcxdk1pDLzGM|downsized)
Girl we know it’s Tristian Jr and we know you’re embarrassed as you should be.
What. Does. It. Matter. ???  Ain’t no drama here. You name your baby whatever TF you wanna name your baby.   But this stretching it out like it is a State Secret is beyond.
I get she's doing it to try and help ratings but how many people are going to turn the show off when she says it's Tristan Jr...
Hot take: people aren’t tuning in to hear a baby name…especially if it’s Tristan Jr.
Tristan Junior….   ![img](jjgjzp5jfcsa1)
I actually think it’s going to be something really left field. Trudy. Toast. Trevor
It’s Triston Jr. But they call him Trey
If it's not Tristan, I still think it's Twelve!
Trust
that photo of her is so wildly different to how she looks in my head  edit: typo
His name is Trust I’m calling it
Probably something terribly ironic like Trust.
Tedward Thompson
It’s Teak or something on-brand like that
Thyme
I don’t even care anymore. At least Kylie had a reason - she couldn’t decide what her kid’s name was. Khloe is just doing it because she’s embarrassed she named her kid after Trashton 🤡
at this point idc anymore lol
tiger. titan. tristan jr. theo. trevor.
Teal Thompson
Trip Thompson. You heard it here first
Awww little Tryagain Thompson.
What's the point of hiding it this long? No one even cares anymore
I think the name Trevyn would be cute! It goes with True and plays off Tristans' first and middle names. Just my wildcard guess, though. Might be too normal for their taste. If it's Tristan Jr and she's hiding it, that's just dumb as hell.
I’m going with Triton…to be released on the date the Little Mermaid drops ..
I guess this is the switch from selling babies first photos to waiting to reveal their names. Any way they can to keep people interested and prolong the inevitable if she named him Tristan Jr. Incidentally, I always thought the Jr., III and IV went in order of birth. How can he be a junior if there are two sons ahead of him or (Lawwwwwd forbid) she names him Tristan Jr. the III. 🤣🤣
This is so f-ing weird to me. What’s with the secrecy when you weren’t secretive about your first child’s name?
Khloe is the queen of the soft launch to dilute any backlash. Utterly exhausting pick me existence.
On top of the absolutely unnecessary grace she gives Tristan, the thing that embarrasses me about Khloe is that nothing she does is original compared to Kim or Kylie. She literally just copies them to death from her style, to her baby naming secrecy, to her surrogacy, to everything. Every time I watch Khloe I feel like I’m getting the rejected choices of the others and the price she pays for getting them is splashing her heartbreak across every episode and headline.   And it sucks so much because at the beginning of this show I think Khloe had the most personality and spark to offer. I know she is having a hard life right now, I just wish she’s go explore a private life for a while and figure out who she is absent of all this outward opinion so she can realize that naming your child shouldn’t be this anxiety inducing thing.
Tyson
Twelve Thompson. I own that.
Jesus Christ.
If its Tristan, I’m throwing myself off a building in frustration.
Tommy Thompson I guess
*"...with names like Tristen falling out of fashion. Tristian (#884) is the most chic baby name in this list"*  We got our answer.
Hermes
Khloe you're screwed as it is, having Trashcan back in your bed 🙄 get your priorities straight girl
*JFC* it’s Tristan Jr.
Can someone let this lady know that NO ONE GIVES A F*** what her baby’s name is
I’m over this whole storyline like he with him or don’t. Tell us the name or don’t. Literally who cares at this point
calling a five-year-old ‘maternal’ 🥴🤢
I feel like she did this, so no other baby mama of Tristan's can have a Tristan Thompson Jr.   I bet she thought it was a real power move on her end.   I just feel like that's her thinking, idk.
Yep, and I think that's why she's hiding it. She knows it makes her look like a fool.
Yep .she said previously in an interview that she would name a boy Tristan jr   She gets more embarrassing by the day
Imagine her explaining that to her son.  “Mommy. Who am I named after?”  “You’re named after a serial cheater - your dad.”
God 🙄🥴 she’s so deeply DEEPLY in denial about trashcan it would be sad if it wasn’t such a repeat I’ve sob story for her.
It’s too bad Tristan is a piece of garbage bc objectively TJ Thompson is a cute name. But I’m sad for Khloe if she’s so insecure she stays with a man who betrays her AND THEN NAMES THE BABY AFTER HIM.
Wasn’t Tristan in another country and holding hands with other women when the baby was born?  I really hope she didn’t name it Tristan Jr., but you’re probably right.
Someone else said Tryst, and both had me rolling. 🤣
I’m dying.
If this is true - which it prob is - jfc. Like if you wanna saddle yourself to a trashcan for the rest of your life that's your sad decision. But why link a fucking son in name to his shit father who will leave before the going even gets tough. The goof has two other sons, one he pretends doesn't exist. Her only hope for him to stay is her celebrity status and that sure didn't stop him 4x before.  She literally has this "man" on the highest pedestal ever and I. Don't. Get. It.
I just spit my pasta out, thank you for making me get passata on my phone screen
She will get sued by KUWTK producers, 🤪 it’s a storyline at this point, this is mid season finale stuff
Cause it’s Tristan and she knows people are gonna drag her to and back from hell for that
Also no one cares
At this point the name reveal would make clickbait headlines on the daily Mail for half a day and everyone would move on
He crushed her soul and self esteem the first time round, the second time she accepted that was her life now and is probably dead inside and takes the bare minimum as being a good partner… speaking from experience
More like “should have worn a Trojan” Thompson
💀
Tired Ass Showgirl
tbf kylie announced aire’s former name wolf the day he was born (or close) and then couldn’t decide on a new one
I’m pretty sure she said it will be revealed on the opening of the new season but she didn’t anticipate the new season taking this long to be released.
I think they’re starting to hold off to generate hype and interest. If she really did name that baby Tristan, it is going to blow up in the tabloids once released.
That's a good guess.  I agree.
Ooh good guess
Lmaooo 😭😭
Exactly what I thought. She’s known for ironic names like that. Cute kids though.
Yes.  ![gif](giphy|Lb3vIJjaSIQWA)
I feel the same. I just can’t choose to believe she would have that little respect for herself. I’m holding out hope for an unrelated T name.
Unfortunately, yes.   But, then again, I believed after the side baby that she’d never take him back. It’s starting to look like she did. 🫣
I feel like she would especially since two other women have sons with him. This would separate *her* son from the others being his only namesake.
Thank you. I’ve said it since the baby shower show. All this number talking plus he is Kris’s twelft grandchild.
But what power, bestie ? Y’all are STILL *hermanas de leche*. Y’all rode the village broomstick. Your still part of his  Baby Mama Club, Khlo-Khlo and not even the founding member. Not even the first to give him a son.   So what powers you hold ???

>trashcan  lol
Tryst is sooo good!
🏅Take my poor man’s gold.
Somebody else said it before - she most likely wanted to claim the name before one of the other women he keeps getting pregnant does. And to add to that, that way she can probably claim in her mind  he's the 'heir', he's connected to his father always through his name. That guy isn't a father to his other kids so anything that backs up that he's a great dad to True and TJ will do.
Passata is excellent
Go back to party city where you belong!
That’s honestly so gross to me. Like I can maybe understand trying to make a profit off your child if you’re really hard up for money (still not great, but we all have to make less than ideal decisions to get by sometimes). But when your family’s net worth is probably higher than the GDP of some countries, why on earth would you still exploit your kids for financial gain? Especially Khloe, who has spoken about how much the public scrutiny has negatively impacted her. She has basically surgically removed her entire face, and I don’t even blame her because she was picked apart so cruelly by the media and public for so much of her life.  But how can she expose her children to the wolves in the same way she was when she knows the harm?  I’ve honestly always defended them from a weird feminist angle. I don’t know if they meant to do it but I think what they ultimately did was pretty socially transgressive. I think a lot of the hate they get is rooted in misogyny and they basically used that to build a multi-billion dollar empire that will ensure generations of their children will be set. I always thought the faces of their public personas gave off a little knowing wink because they always had the long game in mind. You don’t create an empire on accident.   I know I sound overly invested when I say I’m “disappointed” in them now, but like what are they doing?! Instead of evolving into new directions as they age, and using their massive influence in ways that bring some benefit to the world (which seemed like the direction they were taking for a bit), they’ve instead devolved into this sad caricature of middle-aged women desperately clinging to their youth and living vicariously through their daughters while coddling their sons. Seeing them and Madonna is so depressing to me.   And yes, I know I should probably touch grass and take a nap, so that’s what I’ll do!
😭
Exactly, it's not, but she probably thinks it is, which is sad ×1000
“Hermanas de leche” and “Rode the village broomstick” are possibly the funniest things I’ve read this year, thank you.
You ate with "Hermanas de leche" and "Rode the village broomstick"  https://preview.redd.it/jlb91c5npfsa1.png?width=1150&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9e418c5c267a33d76a16d25d611aa7ec2b04d705
It’s just baby trapping at this point. One baby didn’t work, so the logical (*/s*) next step is to add a second and make #2 his namesake.
oml one of the best comments I’ve ever read ☠️
Just to name your child after someone who is publicly referred to as ‘trashcan’….. like, she really cares more about how Tristan, a man who constantly is publicly humiliating her, feels than her own children, who are innocent in all this. She just disregards them just like her mom did to her.   Cycle of abuse kontinues
![gif](giphy|5nFShZWwq3fdm)
Amen sister. You said it so well. I really share your frustrations and disappointment in the family’s whole vibe recently.
I would feel so weird and uncomfortable if I found out my parents waited for a television premiere to announce my name to the world for more ratings? Or I guess that’s normalised for them.
I aim to please.
It’s like she thinks she’s special.   Girl he left good first gf in her third trimester for you. Then left you in your third trimester for someone else. You’re not even the exception, like he can’t get along with his other baby mamas and your the only one he can chill with nah you begged for his DNA to make a second baby.
Omg yes let’s talk about THAT 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 I’m dying to know more about the surrogacy arrangement. Like is he actually playing a father role for #2? I thought it was more like a sperm donor situation but I don’t see how he could limit involvement with #2 while parenting #1…
Well I honestly think she wanted another but she didn’t want to be pregnant. Idk why if because she didn’t want to have to hide away to avoid public humiliation or maybe her pregnancy with True was traumatic for her, who knows.   And in typical Dickwhipped fashion, *only TRISTAN* can be the father. So her kids can be **full** siblings (never mind she has two half sisters that she loves)
Would love to be getting out of my Ferrari to go to a spa day…
I’m more interested in pictures of the car she is driving, honestly.
I’m glad she got that spa day, she’s such a hard worker and her life must be so stressful.
Must be nice.
Must be nice.
Her life seems very relaxing. Manifesting this for myself.
Would love to be able to afford a spa day lol
YES I would love to see the car collections more
LOL
…
would love to afford living in LA lol
she is workin hard for this Kylash promo huh? 🧍🏽‍♀️
I honestly feel sorry for her because she clearly has BD and I can’t believe no one is kind enough to tell her she looks absolutely ridiculous. What doctor is even doing this work??
I really wonder how her lips would look if they were underlined?
![gif](giphy|XZS5fWhIoJoEo)  im sorry but this is what i saw at the end when she put extra blush on
Is it just me or does every celebrity and influencers plastic surgery make them look like the alien emoji 👽
Instead of Kylash mascara, I can buy two maybelline skyline mascara which is better than kylash. And who the fuck releases mascara after years and years owning makeup brand, and not having foundation?
she’s looking more and more like a tim burton character
I've said this under another post too but I'm afraid i might have to reiterate: Poor girl, all she knows is the left side of her face.
She can’t move her face whatsoever. It’s disturbing to see as someone the same age as her
I’m not a fan of the makeup look in this video, it looks kinda sloppy and muddled, I liked her other vogue video though!
her eyes do look yellow kinda 🙈
her eyes are hugeee
I like the makeup. Perhaps a little less blush but that top lip is sending me.
And it’s going nowhere I fear  https://preview.redd.it/0hoezfutfcsa1.png?width=1169&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0b614f7b5bddc2a0aa7f8337e35cc8c81b48ac1d
What is BD
She has to line them because of the migration. Lining the lips hides it and makes them look somewhat more normal.
*maybelline sky high
Celebs they're just like us

I wouldn’t never gave them my ideas for free on the internet where any one from their PR team can find them. Not today, Kris, not today
I would demand to style kim
Kylie: actually have a legitimate sit down about her life
I would start their "natural" era.  Ditching all the photoshop and heavy makeup and being open about plastic surgery and all of that stuff.
I think Kylie should open up about her life as a mom. She got a lot of support when she talked a bit about her postpartum experience, and that would make her more relatable. She has the luxuries of nannies and all the help she can afford, but the stress and emotional turmoil of parenting I'm (99%) sure still exist for her. Humanizing herself would help her public image.
I would like to see Kylie start a legitimate charity and use some of her massive wealth for something decent instead of 10 minute flights or whatever. Maybe something to help other young moms that dont have the same privileges as her
Honestly I would audience test more projects- so many of the “yikes” PR moments happened because the right type of audience testing never happened.   Eg Kimono becoming Skims, Kendall’s Pepsi ad, Kylie Swim etc   Avoiding these moments might garner less publicity but would also help build stronger brands.   I would work on transitioning Kim in particular to the level of celebrity she should be operating at- she doesn’t need to say yes to nearly everything anymore- even if it’s a big company. Each time she agrees to something it should be whether this enhances her personal brand. Her current strategy just gives desperation which is only contributing to her flop era.
Everything else seems good except why does Khloe have to acknowledge Tristan's other baby mamas? That's not on her, it's on him.
oo i love this! i work in PR so my coworkers always discuss what we would do for celebs. from my experience working with crazy ass tech, consumer and lifestyle CEOs, i'd say the following:  **Kourt:** Agree on stopping the Lemme stuff! What's crazy is that her being behind a brand like Safely would make more sense to me. or even SKKN, but body products since she's the only sister who seems to be accepting of her body. Would be cool if her and Trav started a vegan restaurant chain - like a Veggie Grill but more chic!  **Kim**: 100% agree to stop exposing North. No more Tiktoks, let her be 10 years old! Kim is at a phase in her life where people don’t look to her for fashion inspo anymore but people are still into who she is as a person so I feel like she should write a book about her rise to fame. Let’s think, Evelyn Hugo vibes. She also needs to acknowledge every ruthless thing she’s done and admit to all the surgeries instead of saying she has a drop of mascara only. People would be empathetic if she also acknowledged how beauty standards made her that way in the first place. Even if she ended a chapter with "I understand my insecurities have led to me changing my body which led to other women's, etc." I think people would really respect that!  **Khloe:** Just drop Trashcan please! Drop the long nails too. Date a real estate magnate. Love yourself again - we want Khlomoney back. I feel like she has good hot take so maybe trying the talk show / hosting gig again.   **Kendall**: Admit how your name HAS helped your modeling career. When you say you worked harder because of it, it sounds so tone-deaf. Look at Gigi and Bella as a good example. Also if you’re passionate about a certain cause, be fully in it. Not just post because it gets you off frim people sying you don't care about X cause. Distance yourself from 818 and highlight the Mexican workers who make your brand. Start a horse girl / granola girl / crunch girl line. We all know at this point she is straight but if she came out Bi as a PR tactic (which is f'd but Kris doesn't care), Gen Z would go nuts hah.  **Kylie:** Could be same approach as Kim - admit to what you've done but instead of book form, maybe an interview where she is 100% honest. I liked Life of Kylie for that reason. Agree with what someone said about stopping being the face of KC and bring in notable ambassadors. No more dumb collabs with sisters or Stassie or weird licensing like Grinch. Announce that Kylie Swim is going through a rehaul and apologize about quality of suits - say you're doing better and will do when it launches next time (A lot of people respected when Kim admitted to formerly naming Skims, Kimono). I think kylie baby should fade to the background. Keep doing the pressworthy fashion moments during fashion weeks. Show your funny personality more on socials!  Overall, they all need to be more authentic. I've seen lately that many of the brands that are successful with the younger crowd are brands that accept flaws, mistakes and allow humans to be imperfect.
kylie: become friends with jordyn publicly again  idk if it would improve anyone’s public image but it would cause ppl to talk about them and get them viewers on that boring ass show
Not necessarily improve their image... but you know, switch things up a little lol  Khloe: Join Selling Sunset.  Kendall: Start dating Hailey Bieber.   Kourtney: Become a volunteer firefighter.   Kylie: Hang out with Paris Jackson in her van and travel.   Kim: Open up a Vinyard (Kris you owe me $$$ for this one)  Kris: Date Richard Branson.
Make them donate more of their damn money
Stop right there Kris Jenner, I'm not giving you my knowledge and skills for free, you're rich so pay for that
Good one Kris, if you want my ideas, pay me!  ![gif](giphy|bC9czlgCMtw4cj8RgH|downsized)
Kylie= big charity and philanthropic campaigns
A lot of the comments here regard charity, but I think they do do charity, it’s just private.  They donated to open an esophageal cancer research centre, which was public. But Khloe has posted that she doesn’t think charity should be publicized and Kylie’s doctor has come forth saying “Kylie wouldn’t say anything but she bought and donated lots of medical equipment” during COVID. Wasn’t Kylie also helping babies and children with facial deformities?
Kylie should leave Travis behind and get together with someone who is age appropriate and publicly acknowledges her and dotes on her. I don’t believe she’s ever really been in a relationship she can or feels comfortable flaunting and I think a. That would be good for her (she seems to have a lot of love to give and wants to be loved) and b. She could really capitalize on the young, hot mom with cute kids and a handsome bf public image thing.
Kourtney rebrands Lemme as a weed company - CBD/THC gummies and vitamin combos designed to have different effects on health & mind.   Kim just stops. Just stop it. Girl please. Just put on some sweatpants (WITHOUT STILETTO BOOTS), go to your kids football games and stop using every outing as a pap shoot. You can relax, you made your money, you built your weird ass concrete bunker house, you showed everyone you know who Rick Owens is now please stop wearing Blade sunglasses and awkward pleather ensembles and just chill tf out.  Go further with your prison reform thing, just put your actual self into some stuff instead of just planning what you'll look like doing stuff. Nobody cares.  Kylie does something. Anything. Just please show there is some vague depth there that goes beyond what looks pretty and commands the male gaze. Open a soup kitchen, support trafficked women, actually listen and involve yourself with something. Advocate for something, anything. Just commit to being more than a blowup shrine to consumerism.   Khloe & Kendall are beyond PR help unless they start bringing in some radical honesty.
Kourtney/Travis - start a scholarship fund at kourtney’s alma matter   Kim - start a full blown charity to help fund legal fees for those inmates in similar situations to those she has already helped  Khloe - dump Tristan, publicly admonish him and ACTUALLY stay away from him  Kendall - genuinely apologize for all the racist, tone deaf shit she’s done/said, otherwise she’s relatively harmless compared to the others   Kylie - get a focus group together of her target demographic and come up with an actually cool set of makeup for Kylie cosmetics, make sure it’s well made so it sells well, and donate a portion of it to homeless shelters in LA/elsewhere around
Kim, Kylie, and Khloe: give a little more personality, like she originally had instead of relying solely on sex appeal  Kourtney: Rebrand Lemme under Poosh and launch any further ventures under that label. Idk about Meet the Barkers since some of the kids dont seem to be ok with being on camera, but an advice podcast with travis or one of her kids guesting?  Kendall: start a lifestyle blog but dont monetize it at first. Use it to recommend music, art, food, books etc. but also interview people prominent in various industries.
I’d tell Kim to give up on the law degree and recognize that she can make enough of an impact with a nonprofit - love that for her! Idk why she feels the need to be a real lawyer.
The way the media and public openly degraded Britney and Paris and Lohan, constantly criticizing their weight and slut shaming them. That behavior by the public being accepted and encouraged is disgusting and it seems that these days it’s recognized as wrong to do so to the average woman, but is still fair game to do to celebrity women, especially the Kardashians.   There are celebrities that the public thrives on hating and they do so until they mentally break down like Britney Spears, among others. Causing eating disorders, PTSD, and mental trauma lasting a lifetime. Changing PR and all these solutions aren’t going to make people like the Kardashians. The public needs to stop being toxic AF. If you don’t like the family stop participating, stop engaging and move on. If tearing down others until they have a mental breakdown is your entertainment and what makes you feel superior, then look inward. People feel removed because they’re celebrities but it doesn’t make the behavior any less toxic.
The main thing they all need to do is: - stop flaunting the wealth - start their own charity organizations in line with their brands - stop the show or give it more substance or depth   Kourtney: agree with stopping Lemme. Or rebrand it to make it less jarring, more natural and age appropriate. Do a home improvement show where she helps renovate and design people's homes.  Kim: finish the law degree, start the non profit, pause on the filler and botox, open up about the Kanye drama in a podcast (push the strong woman narrative rather than crazy man).  Khloe: start dating someone hot af who treats her well, publicly renounce Tristan, take a break from social media and go on holiday with her two kids and nobody else.  Kendall: idk she seems to be doing fine. Her Jay Shetty podcast was really good and she seems to be working in her self-awareness.  Kylie: learn to use tik tok properly, stop posting cars and bikinis, stop being the face of the Kylie brands and bring ambassadors and models in, start a non profit that empowers young female entrepreneurs with training and funds.
Kim: embrace single mom life and pivot as an advocate for women in similar situations as her and how to coparent. Somehow incorporate her not-law degree or whatever.   Kourtney: honestly she’s pretty harmless rn. Keep pushing the snake oil.   Khloe: apologize to jordyn, drop trash can, that’s about it.   Kendall: embrace your sexuality with a real relationship (woman or man). Even if you’re a mean girl at least you don’t seem like a piece of plastic.   Kylie: idk really. Maybe date jaden smith again.
I'd tell them to sell their PJs and plant some fucking trees and partner up with Leo DiCaprio and take environmentalism seriously. I'd also tell them to start advocating for the mental health of young women with body dysmorphia by admitting their own struggles and actively step away from the knife and finally I'd like to see some hardcore philanthropy that doesn't just involve charities that they've set up themselves or selling clothing they've worn to auction. Ugh writing that made me tired and sad cause it's NEVER going to happen but, a girl can dream.
I'd get Kendall to give more people rides on horses. The press loves a one trick pony!
Kendall should open or be on the board of a horse therapy center or equestrian school. Go from being the model to fashion photographer which she has casually done before which should hopefully help her in having more control of her schedule while still being in industry.  Kylie - Rename Kylie Baby to something without her name. The line is cute but the name feels wrong. You can base it off your kids names even. Make x% of profits of it go to a charity with single mothers. Take over those Mommy galas, you should start bein perceived like the boss woman you are. Kylie cosmetics feels dated tbh but she has her hands likely tied with Coty so keep hetting that bag sis. Do more normal, easy-going content. Who cares if you are critiqued for being yourself? Love the way she has introduced Stormi. We see her but it still feel very controlled.   Kim - Focus on law school, your businesses, and investment company. Open nonprofit to help pay or find legal counsel. Generally, try to be more relaxed. Try out a jean and tshirt look, basically take a page of Kendall’s casual style. We literally dont know you.  Khloe - Tristan has done and continues to do too much harm to your image. Regardless if you are with him or not, dont bring attention to it (no more, you’re the best dad bday posts). Any questions just admit it’s complicated with him and you wont talk about it because it’s no one’s business and leave it that. Abandoning children or even the illusion of that is widely considered negative, honestly even more so than the cheating. Advise Tristan to slowly incorporate Theo publicly as another child and dont forget he exists in interviews. —- If you are not, go to therapy, embrace it. Allow yourself to be more casual and open. Imo, the public perceives lack of confidence and you being much more closed off and always overly glammed. Be yourself more, show more vulnerability. Please stop with the toxic positivity. And please, like most rational people, do not say again that in your pre-revenge body you were “fat” or unhealthy or hint you didnt loook good. That was the narrative but most rational people would say it wasnt the reality. Calling out that you had a beautiful body but the media and public didnt see it is a much better narrative. —- Spend more time publicly with Kourtney, especially without Kim as she generally doesnt have controversy, there is nostalgia around seeing you too together, and your family closeness is admired — Oh, and promoting Nurtec (or any drug) is a no moving forward and things like Candy Crush is giving 2007 vibes. Endorsements only on social and try to make them as seamless as possible. If it’s a rowing machine, casually show yourself rowing over time and then plug the brand.   Kourt - poosh in-person festival open to the public is next! Virtual version for those that cant make it. Collagen powder for lemme, we cant just have gummies. Enjoy your marriage. Consider adoption. Let the hair grow, sorry. We are all in a nostalgia kick.
I’d like to see all of them move past the need to present themselves as soooooo sexy and gorgeous and little else —- and on to something MEANINGFUL. Anything. Their schtick is just so tired at this point - the pouty lips and vapid photos one after another after another. But they have so much influence. Would be amazing to see them get real, be authentic, and take big swings at changing the world for the better.
1st up someone needs to knock some sense into Khloe & get her to throw Trashcan right in the bin where he belongs
I’d suggest they focus group/stat out the first season, and go back to that equation retooled for todays audience.  My freelance CD rate is $900/day, Kris Jenner 💵
Kylie- show us anything other than kylie cosmetics 🫠. Stop pushing 🫸 just  the product.  Love it when she does her fashion  week stuff and mom things
Hold a food drive for lower income communities and get their rich friends involved in donating  Ask them to stop over filtering their photos
Genuinely I don’t think podcasts and hosting are right for them right now because they’re all committed to dull, lifeless conversational styles. They need to overhaul their public personalities before they start expressing opinions
Nice try, Kris Jenner.
I think Kendall should start a non-profit horse rescue.
have kylie stop pushing out shit with her name on it just because
Tell them to stop fucking being so goddamn try hard. NO ONE CARES. just be genuine, be yourself. You should have been better with your money to not have to rely on being a damn sell out and be able to retire at 35.
I would tell all of them to go start living their authentic lives and stop living for social media.
I would tell them all to hide away from the spotlight. Enjoy their money, their children and their success.
They've already managed to steal that man's idea so there is no way I'm putting my ideas out here for free! Kris- run me a few coins then, we'll talk! 🤣🤣
Y’all are horrible to Khloe I’m sorry. I see it over and over. She don’t owe shit to any baby mama or their kids and no one should use that excuse to think any less of her. I don’t see Maralee making any moves to make amends for hooking up with a taken man on his birthday. Khloe needs to focus on herself in therapy and figure out why she keeps jumping back into toxic relationships before giving other people therapy on tv. And don’t tell me you wouldn’t immediately start dumping on her for trying to be anything like Dr. Phil who gets a ton of hate…girl please.  The people with the most positive PR are the ones that lay relatively low in the media when it comes to their personal life and involve themselves in charities.
They need to actually share their real lives - tell us what happened with Ray J, Kanye. Tristan, Travis etc and show everything - but they can’t. It paints them so ugly. Which is why it’s over for them.
Delete their social media 💀💀
Kim- either get the law degree or open a non profit and hire lawyers. It could be to help low income people with legal assistance.   Khloe- ditch Tristan and therapy. Actually see her pick me misogynistic ways are exactly why her life is the way it is. she gives the BEST interviews out of the girls, so she could actually pull this off and come off funny and relatable, while talking about fixing herself and her internalized misogyny. Some sort of empowering movement for girls and women too.  Kylie- keep Travis away. I actually like Kylie’s personality. I think she’s a lot happier and freer without him. More mom stuff. And her also some non profit work. Something with kids and parenting. Helping young moms with necessities or some shit.   Kendall - dunno she’s a bore and I actually like her that way. She gives us nothing  Kourtney- no clue. She’s simply not likable to me in any way, except during the black chyna saga. I’ve always said people like her because she talks to Kim how people want to talk to her. But her whole thing is she’s a foil for Kim and without that, I have no clue. Her personality is rude and stuck up and lazy. I do like her better with Travis, so probably a reality show with them and the kids or some shit.
Literally just tell them to shut up for a year. Cancel the show and have them focus on something else for 12 months. Kim actually starts putting effort into her law degree. Khloe goes to a new therapist who finally convinces her to have boundaries, which helps her reconnect with Rob. Courtney struggles being a new step mom, and balancing time with the kids between Travis and Scott. Kylie rediscovers herself outside of being in a relationship. Kendall fully embraces being rich af and lives out her best life. After a year of quietness from the family (no Met Gala, no constant instagramming, no paid paps walks), people start asking what happened to them, and then BAM you drop a 2hr doc on Hulu. You’ve actually been filming all along (bc let’s be real, they can’t NOT have cameras around them 24/7), but this time it’s *real*. A whole year condensed into 2hrs, so there’s no time for stages storylines, just pure raw emotions. After the doc they’re back in the public’s favor (at least more than they were before), and now they can go back to their old life, without seeming so desperate for fame. And if they do it well, they could even possibly have a Paris Hilton style popularity resurgence
My advice would be to invest their remaining millions, downsize, and sell whatever excess luxury they do not need and fade into private life.
Step one: negotiate a higher salary.

The Khloe one is genius she could rebrand entirely and do some good (and some cash)
[removed]
You're getting therapy, you're getting therapy, you're all getting therapy!!!!
All I can think of is remove the lip fillers and the big butts
I want them all to empower other single moms but also help them financially!!! That’s the hardest part about getting away from a deadbeat
Yes to all, especially Khloe!
Top tier post right here
All of them need therapy… But can you imagine a Karjenners Kome Klean series….
Surgery docs for Kylie Khloe and Kim.  Family show for Kourt.
![gif](giphy|a4XFfRTa0KTra)
It’s needed indeed  https://preview.redd.it/hivwhef72csa1.jpeg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7bf0e2945ef4cebd5e0deb725b583bcc4972db9c
I think her doing more “raw” vlogs of her nights out with her friends etc would pull big numbers
Ooo yes with a focus on her first relationship with Tyga and how that set her up a transformation for her IG fame but also how she really felt about her family in regards to the situation …. And then be asked “how would you feel if you daughter came up to you and said they were dating a 25 year old man?” 🤔  (Tbh this what I’d want as a viewer lmao)
She needs intensive therapy - not just talk therapy
Raw interview spilling everything about her surgeries etc and how her upbringing has affected her. Have a clean slate!
Yes, they confess all the plastic surgeries they have had and maybe have another sit down episode with a therapist
Yes!!! When I saw black Chyna was removing her fillers and being really honest about all her work I thought this is what the kardashians should do
Angela white themselves
This! I don’t doubt she had some postpartum but acknowledge that she has a million advantages that 99.9% of moms don’t. Nannies, a personal chef so you don’t have to think about what to feed yourself and your family all day, people who clean, do laundry, grocery shop, gardening etc.   Also I think that any money they make from the kardashian kloset sales should be given to charity.
Yess they could raise awareness on issues or smh
idk why kendall gets more hate then the brand pepsi, she was just a hired model
She’s known for being the biggest bully to other women. I think she owe it to Jordan and that could be a good redemption arc of “girl power”. Maralee is not needed indeed
How can you respect a man who(forgetting everything else)ignores and doesn't see his own child? That would do it for me
I guess they listened to you about the tik tok thing
They need to hire you ASAP. Also I laughed so hard at Kendall coming out as Bi for the publicity!
i would honestly kill for a memoir from kim
Good point !!
She’s so boring though
https://i.redd.it/kozt7ul24csa1.gif
Idk People will just say they are being performative
https://i.redd.it/2f3y6f614csa1.gif
https://i.redd.it/6iwwr2bq3csa1.gif
Podcast question: who would actually listen to Kourt's awful droning voice on purpose? PR tip: teach that woman how to speak without the nasally "valley girl" whine she has perfected.
YES YES YES!!!! THANK YOU 👏🙏🏼
>Learn to use tik tok properly   😂  Kylie used to be so funny, she could nail tik tok if she wasn’t using it as a instagram/only fans substitute
I think if Kendall started a blog about her taste ie the music she listens to, art she likes, maybe even books she reads (idk if she reads for pleasure), more along the lines of the tig rather than goop, I think it would do well? I started listening to a spotify playlist of the songs she played on her short lived podcast and theyre really varied and not what I wouldve expected from her.
Would be amazing.
Leo? Lmao he's having his own pr problems
The equestrian centre/school is such on brand for Kendall and a really good idea. I think its a valuable business too. You should copyright it lol
![gif](giphy|5QO6sm30AKCuUPZpfT|downsized)  Let’s sign you !
https://i.redd.it/938db5xc3csa1.gif
She 10000% owe it to Jordan Craig the pregnant girlfriend of Tristan.   The pictures of Khloe and Tristan in vacation caused so much stress she had a difficult end to her pregnancy.  She don’t owe much to Maralee but she does to Theo, calling Tristan an amazing dad everywhere when he act like his son don’t exist

Use a Kendall gif instead sweetie ! ✌️
She said that outfit was one Kanye had picked out for her idk.
They would 100% get some kind of comeback from doing this.
Yes I love what she is doing with her life!
Tbh im tired of them just raising awareness by posting shit, kims the only one that ive seen put her money where her mouth is and put serious money and time into a cause (prison reform). Itd be nice for kylies public perception to do something similar for a cause she cares ab, since right now i only view her as materialistic and a bit vapid
Totally fair! It is a risk when you become the face of a brand, people will criticize the face over the company.
She doesn’t owe it to Jordyn. Sorry but if someone who was close to me/in my home kissed my man or whatever happened, both of them could go kick rocks.
Even if it is performative, the money would still be going to some kind of good cause.
Travis, clearly.
I love her personality and humour. The prank one she's filmed are so good and the drunk make ups. But the tok is not ticking there. They need to get rid of their millenial advisors (I'm a millenial so no offense lol)
Oooh good one! Yes you're so right. She had a podcast?? What?! I had no idea. But yeah I'd love to hear about her life and times (minus the in your face privilege)
Who doesn't these days? So he serially dates younger women 🤷🏼‍♀️ At the end of the day absolutely nobody is talking about how Leo trashes the planet and hoards his money. The man has funded over 200 projects that have accumulated over a hundred million for environmentalism. He's been doing this philanthropy work since he was 24 years old.

🤣🤣🤣🤣
![gif](giphy|F577eDWCLKJY4)
And she chose to wear it
Of course it was.
It’s very inspiring I hope they take heed.
Yes they have been too self-centred and dishonest to create anything that is actually genuine
pretty sure that was referring to trashcan's first babymomma - jordan craig.
Seriously if you kissed my (nonexistent ) baby daddy and youre my friend ITS OVER FOR YOU
That’s true but the question was asking how they could improve their public image :)
Zaza World Radio on apple music!
.....leo does trash the planet. He's hopping everywhere on a private jet, spending all his time on super yachts and has been criticised for it for years. He famously travelled 8000 miles on a private jet to pick up an environmentalism award??? Like?? I don't think especially specifically right now, he can do much for their pr - probably both would get negative pr blowback from it.  anyone planting trees while travelling on a private jet is just greenwashing their lifestyle. Plus tree planting programmes have the potential to be really harmful if not done carefully. "Plant some fucking trees" can actually be really bad advice.  https://e360.yale.edu/features/are-huge-tree-planting-projects-more-hype-than-solution  I will concede that I will probably forgive Leo if he dates Kim as a PR relationship and, crucially, appears on the show.

True!!!!!🤣🤣🤣
Oops. Haha You’re right! I’ll take my leave  ![gif](giphy|48FhEMYGWji8)
Oh… well I still hold my opinion cause people be defending the other jordyn too much loll
Absolutely I can't believe that's even a debate
Okay ok valid points and I'll admit that. So maybe not Leo but they could at least feign giving a shit and you're right, they probably would choose the least serviceable and irresponsible option if it meant they could capitalize on as little involvement as possible. I think planting trees is more of a metaphor for doing anything at all that offsets the way they LIVE. Celebrities like Leo are going to be hypocrites but they literally make no apologies and give the finger to the Earth almost daily.
i think i might be the only person who has never watched spongebob. i keep thinking i'm gonna get around to it, but never do. i don't know what the hell i'm waiting for. lol
I genuinely prefer it, it's harder to have conversations about the actual structural changes that need to occur when greenwashing of brands or people happens. Same with the inextricably linked inequality issues. You're mad at the Kardashians right? So you're less likely to support the wealthy and powerful doing whatever they want because they've manipulated you into thinking they're actually helping. You're more likely to want them taxed and regulated. Most truly wealthy people are fucking the earth over just as much if not way more, and I personally think they lose points for trying to trick us about it. The Kardashians make wealth and excess that's normally hidden from us visible -they're raising awareness for the 'eat the rich' cause, you could say.
Lol there are many moments I quote, then have to explain to fellow adults, then those adults end up watching it with their kids 😂
Well look at you just blowing my arguments to smithereens. Learning things and discussing this shit is important and I appreciate the cold hats facts you've dropped here today. I tip my hat to you.
there are actually quite a few shows i've never seen that i know everyone loves. futurama is one of them. but i've seen so many references over the years on reddit about there being an incredibly heartbreaking scene regarding a dog and that's kept me away. i don't even know what happened (and DON'T WANT to know) but i've read so many comments over the years of people saying it was horribly traumatizing & i am a prime candidate for that: anything sad concerning animals always leaves me a total mess. many years ago my husband & i watched some animated special regarding dinosaurs, and when one of them died i cried all night.  my husband was flabbergasted: 'you're crying about the death of a animated dinosaur who didn't even exist!'   well ... um, yeah! i don't know why he was so shocked. i weep every xmas when frosty the snowman melts.
This never happens on reddit 😭 thanks for listening and taking me seriously when I started this conversation with a sarcastic lmao 💚
I watched futurama for a hot minute and then something (that I can’t remember) turned me off. But now I am unfortunately curious.   Unfortunate because while I laughed at you crying at the dead animosaur, I’m not too far behind you… horses in particular getting hurt in movie scenes has me in a river of tears. ….and frosty is the saddest Christmas story.
Look we can all be better humans every day of our lives even here on Reddit. Having a growth mindset really matters and looking into the heart of what's really being said is valuable no matter who you're having a conversation with online or in real life. There is always room to learn! ❤️
omg a horse getting hurt will send me into hysterics. actually pretty much any animal getting hurt - whether physically or emotionally - will make me crazy. meanwhile i can sit thru incredibly gory stuff happening to humans - even real stuff caught on video - and remain totally unmoved. but if someone so much as hurts a dog's feelings, i'm a complete mess.  and yes, frosty has been messing with my head ever since i was a little girl. as i got older i always thought: oh i'm sure THIS year i won't cry because it's so ridiculous. and yet every year there i was: sobbing.
😭 actually that is too thoughtful and positive for reddit
Well well well 👀 who is REALLY the least interesting to look at?
Old Khloe or Kylie take the cake honestly
Old Khloe was definitely my favorite. The new Khloe is incredibly irritating and I can’t even watch her scenes anymore, she’s a bitter condescending hateful person... So probably Kourtney or Kendall. Maybe more Kourtney because Kendall is a coward and a sheep everytime something happens in the family and Kourtney is much more brave about all of this... so yeah probably Kourt
kourt for me. i rlly appreciate that she rlly dgaf what anyone else thinks & just does whatever makes her happy, which is more than what the other can say. khloe is pathetic so not her. kim is irritating so not her either. kendall & kylie don’t have enough substance for me to have any opinion on them.
Kendall, because I’d want to have her life. The other 4 have been giving me the ick.
Old Khloe > Kylie > Kim > Kourtney > Kendall  Although style wise, Kendall is my favorite
Corey.

Damn I voted for Kim and she has the least amount of votes! And she's the one they created the brand.   I guess I like her because she's funny, doesn't get enough credit but she has good jokes sometimes. She's made a name for herself for having basically no talent. I think she's a good mama, despite the help she gets. She's super nostalgic and sentimental, which shows she has a big heart.   I think if she grew up without wealth, Kim would be a good person. I also feel the same about Kylie. Kylie is funny, positive, and has a good heart.
Kris.
Kylie > old Khloe > Kim > Kourt > new Khloe > Candle
💀💀
Just curious. What makes you think she’d be a good person? She seems like a major bully in most clips I see of her.
If kris was added I’d really be sitting here for 10 minutes trying to decide
The fact that she helped out her entire family and friends with careers. All of her friends she's had for a long time, so she must be a pretty loyal friend. The way she starts to cry when she's defending Khloe from bullies. The way she speaks about her late date and honors him in many ways (bringing awareness to esophagus cancer). She was the only sister present during her mom's hip surgery. How she keeps all her family traditions going. How she helps incarcerated people. She speaks highly of Kanye, for her children's sake, even though she didn't have it easy with him.   I think her bullying comes from a mix of her having a bit of narcissism, as well as the toll it takes from being talked shit about daily on social media. But I feel deep down, she's a good person.
To each their own of course but respectfully and strongly disagree.   I don’t think she helped her family with their careers because she’s a good person. I think she got famous and her family benefitting was a by product. Keeping your childhood friends doesn’t imply you’re a good person especially when there is evidence of her doing the opposite to other people in her life.   Agree to disagree though! That’s ok.
I can’t get over this it literally looks like it could a picture on some random British girl’s instagram
>British council estate bathroom   Got that vibe too! Why is that wall so British?!
Omg I recognize it!! Stassie posted a warped photo in it lmao  https://preview.redd.it/fj04khdqwbsa1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a095f252a34883514b9cc921d34d4ffbee0df349
Malika's birthday was held at The Nice Guy so this must be somewhere in there (bathrooms?) but Googles not helping my insomnia-at-4am ass
Everytime Khloe poses with a girl, it looks like she secretly hates and despises her and wants to get away from her as soon as possible 😭 I always get the feeling that she’s irritated with everyone right now
the only way is essex realness
Khloe wore this outfit to the birthday party of the Malika's
Rocking that ring on that finger
Did they go to the same surgeon?! They look so similar!!
I can’t look past the shoddy wallpaper job.
Who is this please ?
Tristan disguised his bathroom
my exact thoughts hahahaha
Sooo much makeup!
Doesn’t look like a bathroom to me, it looks like a shower curtain but it’s just wallpaper
I thought this was Becca from the bachelor with the farmer.
Is she in Romford?
It’s the nice guy br
Why is this picture so British? 💀
Looks like the bathrooms in some clubs or restaurants be been in lol sometimes they think thisndecore in edgy lol
True but at the same time I’m kind of living for a normal photo for once lol
Literally I’m waiting for her to delete like why would u post this
OMG where tf is this fugly wallpaper
https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagramreality/comments/zysya1/pinched_in_her_waist_notice_the_missing_patterns/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
OMG mystery solved from Insta location tags 😂 the nice guy it is
It issss I went last time I was in la hadda see what the hype was about lmao

B&M core 💀
Good catch
my eyes went right to the top. awful work.
It looks like when people buy notebook contact paper and cover their own walls or benchtops.
Like what’s wrong with it?
Okay wait that is Kim??? That looks nothing like her
⛷️
It has to be at one of their hair/makeup stylists houses or a restaurant?!
Wa-hey! Estate chic must be very exotic in LA 😂
Could’ve gone to wilko at least
I don’t think anything is wrong with it I just find it funny lol
I love Wilkos more than I really wanna admit..
Idgi lol
Am I tripping or does the first picture kind of  look like her old face, in a good way like Lamar wedding era
She needs to be more personable than having a clothing line. What ever happened to being the funny one? The one with a radio station. Why is Kim trying to have a podcast, when only Khloe could make bank with that?
Her face looks like it hurts to smile
Her top lip 😬
her nose looks like her old nose ?? i’m so confused  eta: she looks good though, i don’t like this colour on her but besides that her hair looks gorgeous
what in the fuck is going on with that top lip…chile
Imagine if she dissolved all that filler. She’d look so refreshed and youthful.
![gif](giphy|AgkxzEYM4BB1m)
I love Khloe but she looks scary
She's gotta quit the heavy facetune. Here i was thinking her nose was on the verge of collapse but it looks normal here?
She needs to stop the facetunes and filters.
Good Lord what did she do to herself?!
Nice to see her without extreme filters
That color is great on her
That dress is chefs kiss!
Her face looks like her older face! Like 2014-2015 ish
how does she not think those nails are hideous ughhhh
The work she had done has aged her
My eyes😃
I think khloe is going to regret all the work she’s had done . I think she’s going to age terribly now .
She looks an absolute mess. Love that she got trashed by Chyna, for lying about looking after Dream.
In the last picture, what is GOING ON with her middle finger on her hand that’s raised and waving??? Am I crazy or does it look VERY strange?
I’m confused on how y’all think she looks good. She’s in cat lady territory.
So looking different from her IG posts than regular photos taken by others.
Banana slug lips. Yikes. When will this trend die?
I actually think overall she looks great and I like this color on her (I know it's not everyone's fav tho). The only thing is I will forever believe the too small nose was a mistake, it doesn't fit her face. But I think Kim/Kris got onto her for having a nose and personality and she internalized it.
She is gorgeous. She seems to have relaxed a little bit with herself but you can tell that like anyone in the family, she also likes fillers and botox. But she is pretty!
Whatever she’s so annoying at this point. I would almost respect her if she said “I love tristan he is my baby daddy and we’re gonna stick together no matter what and fuck what anyone thinks about it”, but all this beating around the bush trying to act like she’s not with him anymore is so annoying.
She looks happy, like she’s got her boo back 😂
In her Aaah Real Monsters era
Love this makeup on her
If i was her I'd dissolve all that filler. Besides, I don't understand why the kar/jenner women do botox ? Stem cell therapy treatment is way better.
She looks good here! I love her hair and the coral looks gorgeous on her.
Last night I saw a post comparing old Khloe’s face to Elvis’ and now I cannot unsee it
All I can see in pic 3 is drunk draws drawings
[removed]
She would look so much better toned down
I just feel sorry for her.
After seeing this and thinking about how they have access to the best surgeons in the world… I don’t feel so bad about my rhino lol
It looks like it hurts her to smile
Noooo. She was sooo pretty when she was doing that Revenge Body show. Should have stopped there :/
So sad she ruined her face, she always was the prettiest Kardashian imo
Unpopular opinion but I like this face better than her Khlozempic face.
She’s beautiful! I’m happy to see that she still looks like herself once you get rid of the filters and photoshop.
her new face
WOOF
She was so pretty before. All this was unnecessary. She is still pretty but not uniquely pretty.
Pic #2 actually scared me.
[removed]
Once in a while when they do interviews like these, we get to see their real faces.
I don’t get why she over filters/over photoshops her pictures; she really looks so beautiful without all of that
She looks horrific
Her face looks painful
The f
![gif](giphy|JdUp121wvvZMQ)  If she doesn’t stop with the fillers and surgeries this is who she’ll look like (Big Ang)
Ouf the filler
I think she looks lovely here
I wish they would have just let themselves age naturally. They would still be beautiful. They are turning into caricatures of themselves with all that filler, and you can only hide behind filters half the time.
Khloe looks cute
Her hair and that outfit! Stunning!!
As a person with long gangly alien fingers and big hands like Khloe .. I can honestly say long pointy nails look atrocious on us 😂
New cheek fillers I see…
![gif](giphy|c3g5Unash5vl6|downsized)
I feel like she’s aged herself tremendously. She’s only 38.
Is she Asian now?
Khloe finally has her “dream body” and THIS is the face attached to it. Tragic.
It looks like she’s wearing a face on top of her face
I love this woman ,  idc about all the other stuff , the fact she’s strong enough to SHOW UP and put herself out there !!!! Put a smile on her face on television!!
I think she’s always looked like that. We’re just used to seeing her with filters.
Are these from today? If they are, it honestly looks like very slight weight gain. It’s a positive difference though. She looks happy and fuller in her face/healthier.
MY EXACT THOUGHTS. Doing a re-run of season 4 and I see the similarities
She has her nose back again wth?
But then I see the second pic and I’m like who is that
My first thought, she looks like herself again.
I think it looks crazy
it does!!!
You are tripping
I thought the same!
I think her face is pretty much the same because there’s only so much you can change with the help of a plastic surgeon. But the thing different with this picture is that there aren’t 1000’s of filters slapped on her face.
Khloe should do a podcast answering peoples online questions. Not about her, but like askreddit and AITA and giving her takes.
This makes it sound like Khloe is Barbie with multiple careers and her latest edition is boring lol.
Right! She used to be so funny and real.
[removed]
Her whole smile upside down 🙃
She needs to stop. It’s too much.
Yikes
Her & Kylie decided to get the same upper cocktail sausage lip.
Y’all realize she photoshops right? That’s why they look different in public
To me it doesn’t, the bridge has been made super thin, and the nostrils look like they were left alone.  Looks like an upside down T :/
Maybe she got some filler in it because it’s definitely looking less up turned
It’s 2023 why don’t you guys understand filters/facetune/photoshop?
She said to the doc “gimme the upside down smile look” 😂
Totally agree
![gif](giphy|q8rNFfA0JIrja)
Some Klowns are scary
I think she also used facial fillers coz of her drastic weight loss. Just like Kim
Yeah unpopular opinion but I like it too! It’s cheerful
Yeah I love the colour. I think it may actually be a separate skirt and top.
She hyper extends her fingers when she has high emotions…I have the same nervous tic no matter the medication you can see just how emotional I am by my fingers. In the scene where she’s screaming at the phone LIIIIIIIIIIAAAAAAR her fingers are hyper extended and curving upward as well. I got mine from CPTSD and high functioning depression though. 🙃
That was all I could see too! The whole hand looks like a chickens foot but the middle finger 😬

I think it’s a makeup thing
I agree. She looks much healthier here.
I think the harsh nose contour is doing a reverse and making her nose seem bigger/more harsh. I have to be very careful with nose contour too or it just has the reverse effect and ends up making my nose look bigger. I learned less is more with nose contour, too harsh and it just defines it and brings peoples attention to your nose more than having none
I don't know if she should be giving relationship advice
😂😂😂
I think fame/constantly being picked apart from society and toxic men have dulled her vibrant personality. I hope she comes back soon. She is my favorite.

elon musk typa smile
yeah i commented this to another reply on this thread saying the same thing. i know we don’t know what she actually looks like but i didn’t think her nose still looked like this
![gif](giphy|hx36lnZ70iSVDghcSy)  lol
T for Trashcan!
gadamn how unnecessarily bitchy of you 💀 it’s no secret khloe facetunes everything so we don’t actually know what she looks like but i had no idea her nose still actually looked like the original nose, i wasn’t expecting it. i thought it was way more slimmer/smaller, like an obvious nose job nose
you are so right on this
https://preview.redd.it/tfu5kauwhcsa1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=77f020aad39a8e361e165697d65d8b57d85b6d3a
This sub be dramatic. I swear they be paying y’all to come on here and have their back. Do you think they would go hard for YOU 🤡
Not even close, she looks like she’s 10 years older than kim.   The fact khloe is the same age as aubrey plaza and scarlett johansson is wild to me.
Wow, I didn’t even know that was a thing! Thanks for letting us know! I feel bad she is constantly so stressed at these media events feels like she has to do them anyways.
Yea! It’s like twice as wide as the other fingers and also very crooked at the top knuckle?? This isn’t even talking shit, I’m just very confused 😂
Same here, I assumed this was old.
Honestly I didn’t realize so many people photoshopped until it was pointed out. It’s the reason I stopped feeling so self conscious
Calm down babe. I’m not having anyones back by saying someone is being dramatic
WHAT STOP
![gif](giphy|t1HJXy5Q5NKA8)  Right?! Like I do a lot of photoshopping/digital art for fun (snarky photoshopping is like my fav) BUT a lot of people/celebs do it on the regular, and w/ editing software coming out these days it's becoming A LOT harder to tell what's real and what's edited! No one should ever compare themselves to these celeb/influencer photos and feel bad about themselves, cuz these people don't look like that either!!!! You're beautiful just they way u are!!!!
I’m sorry but there’s absolutely no way her nose is that small! The unedited pics of her show a different nose!
this comment??😭  https://preview.redd.it/txc4qy3m97sa1.jpeg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7affde9e89b38e77bb5c2ab56b2126505ada5b0a
[removed]
It just feels like she’s trying too hard.
ugh no now she is starting to look like kim’s most recent plastic surgery
I don’t think she knows what golden hour is lol
Surprise surprise. Another seductive-eye photo.
Is this some kind of tiny nose filter?!? What on earth
Kylie and Kim have finally become one person
I can’t focus on her nose like y’all because that top lip is too distracting
I absolutely love this peachy soft dewy makeup look on her!
The glazed eyes are getting to me - sad
One thing about Ky, she’s never gonna miss the opportunity to drop a thirst trap to promote a new product>>> I love her sm.
She’s giving honestly 💅🏼
Her butt looks so much smaller
She’s advertising herself for Dubai
I think she’s cute
Do Hailey and Kylie see the same plastic surgeon?
Can’t believe she’s 25, she’ll be Jocelyn wildenstein by the time she’s 40
This doesn’t even look like golden hour at all?
Watch in a few months Kylie and her sisters are going to go ✨natural✨ and let some of the injectables and whatever else dissolve to follow suit with Angela White formerly known as Black Chyna and all the magazines and pop culture blogs are going to praise and claim Kylie and the rest of the Kardashians are trendsetters in going back the “natural” look.
I want to sniff that Adirondack cushion
It’s giving sadness and lost.
Maybe it’s just the gay in me but interesting her short nails … following her Travis break up … hmmmm
whatever work she had done made her cheeks look bigger and it's making her nose look smaller. her nose looks off in [this post](https://www.instagram.com/p/CqqoZtiJ6ar/) too. the proportions are a mess and i can't believe a professional didn't tell her this.
What adult would actually want such a small nose? It doesn’t even fit her face, looks like my 5 year old’s nose, which is perfect for his tiny little face, but will grow, as it is supposed to!
That's what was bothering me so much in 1st pic!
Is it me, or does she look like Caitlyn in the last pic cos of her tiny pointy- looking nose?
It’s called photoshop. Stop believing everything you see.
Ya'll so weird
that comment kinda ate…  https://preview.redd.it/orsufib2a7sa1.jpeg?width=885&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=89fa6a7ac0b26e46508ea1bc724faf1c1517c2c8
I don’t know why you got downvoted she looks different here
![gif](giphy|3o9bJX4O9ShW1L32eY)  Girl stays looking like this
Yes! She looks good!! People can never find anything positive to say. Love the natural makeup on her, suits her sooo much better!
I love it, too! Looks great on her
So glad to see this one positive comment! Like she looks good, photo looks good and yet people just always want to critique every little thing.
Black Chyna is just as bad as them.  I don’t buy the “I am changed” persona by any of the celebrities, tbh.   It is always a good pr when trying to change/add new audience to your market.
Agreed. Something does look off proportionally. Just can’t figure out what. Maybe it is the cheeks as you said but over here her nose is practically invisible! Lol!
You are right it does look like a kid’s nose! The proportion just doesn’t sit right
until u remember khloe is the co founder  https://i.redd.it/47u8vd8ta7sa1.gif
Because it's rude and so weird to analyze every single picture a woman posts? lol
Right? People on this thread are saying she has a child's nose 😭 like y'all will really say anything. I'm not a huge fan of her fillers but I think we get it at this point. We can stop beating a dead horse. She looks cute and I like her bikini.
She’s definitely gotten some help but the religious part is deffo sus
part of why this sub exists is to literally do exactly what you just said lmfao

Can we go back to this timeline
The more things change, the more they stay the same.
God remember the stress that was top friends
Kristen Cavillari being in her top friends is interesting
BLOW being one of her fav movies lol
I miss those days lmao MySpace was amazingly cringe-y. Loved it. God I'm old
omg pls do khloe next
smoochkids did not age well...
I think MySpace told friends is about the same time my anxiety skyrocketed and never returned lol. Tom really had us out here *ranking our friends* 😂
You probably know this, but she dated Brody, who is their stepbrother. I had to think for a minute about how they were connected.
yes, i did hear they used to be close. ugh i think kristin said it in a podcast but i dont remember which one 🥲
It’s actually a really good movie. I had it listed in my top movies on MySpace too, unironically.
Yes, totally remember this! But I think they’re probably 10 years age difference? I’m sure Kristen was probably around 20 in this MySpace profile.
A little less than 10 years apart. So Kourtney probably met Kristen through Brody and formed somewhat of a friendship.
Documentry or Reality is something I would NEVER use to describe The Kardashians
Lmao docu...... mmmkay. It's like calling jersey shore a documentary.  There's crafted storylines and barely any of what's actually going on in real life in the show
Wtf they bought that nomination cuz that show was mediocre
I think it should be Mockumentary.
there’s no way 💀
I feel like this was last week! Time is going too fast lol
Kourts look is tragic.
None of them ate. But I think it’s particularly embarrassing and cringe worthy knowing that Kim put herself through that much suffering and effort to look average 💀
i love kylie and kendall’s look i like when ppl take risks!   kim’s styling is terrible and it would’ve been better if… umm….  khloe looks like she should be at the 2019 met gala   kourtney should be banned  kris devoured and i love how corey’s suit compliments kris’ dress
I don’t like any of their looks except Kendall
These looks were awful honestly
is that katy Perry fixing kendall’s train?? Lmao
I hate Khloe’s hair and sunglasses, the combo is so harsh
It’s like not one single person got it right last year 😅 those outfits were cursed
Say what u want about Kim’s dress but that hair was the real travesty
God none of them ate last year …
Bad bunny and Kendall def going together
The difference with the cleavage when Kim wore Marilyn’s dress and then changed into the other one…
Honestly, they're all gorgeous. But Kim's orrrange spraytan with what is supposed to be a nude dress is sending me 💀 Marilyn drama aside. Like just..
When Kris is best dressed
last year was a flop
WTF was Kourtney really wearing?  And not one of them went with the damn theme!!!
The fact that Kim did all that work to bleach her hair but didn’t even put it in a Marilyn Monroe style is the BIGGEST atrocity from that year. Like, you’re literally wearing her dress! Do a Marilyn Monroe curly hair moment! It was such an obvious choice!
Kourtneys worst look to date
The idea for Kourtney’s look is great, but seems like it was made for someone taller, like the top part of the skirt throws off all proportion
Gwen stefanis lips 🫣
i can’t believe kim brought pete i hope she’s embarrassed
I’m convinced she kept Pete so she’s have a date bc she had an idea of JFK/MM idk idk  ![gif](giphy|auhHp7Btj6iU8)
I hope E channel will have Met gala again this year, that was fun to see it on tv.
Mid
Kylie looked stupid, Kourtney looked like a hot mess, Kim was disgusting
They all missed the mark except for Kendall as far as I’m concerned.
Of all trends I wish I could kill it’s the bleached eyebrows. It never looks good.
i love kris’s look!!
Off topic but is that seb stan??
I miss Pete!
All I’m going to say after seeing that bathroom photo is the NERVE they had to talk about eyebrows in any capacity is astonishing absolutely astonishing
Khloe’s fit ended up being the best overall imo 😳 her styling is just off as usual. The slicked down hair looks so odd with the rest of the outfit   Kendall would have been gorgeous without the bleached brows I think. It’s just a really unflattering look on her  I understand the idea behind Kourtney’s but unfortunately it’s a total miss. Extremely unflattering  If Kylie had have worn literally anything or nothing on her head that would have been a step up from a snapback with a veil 🤦🏻‍♀️  And I’ll forever believe that Kim should have done a Kim K homage to Marilyn Monroe, with her own iconic dark hair styling and personalized “naked” dress, etc
Damn what a flop era for Kimmy. What a terrible blip in her previous archive of amazing met looks!  This is what happens when you let a kardashian run riot. *They commodify, they do not create.*  She should have gone to Balenciaga or another fashion house to create a look using Marilyn’s happy birthday mr president as the *inspiration*, as the starting point for a creative collaboration with DESIGNERS!   I would have even preferred to have seen an embezzled naked body sock with built in boots a la Balenciaga 2022; than watch her take such an obtuse approach to the met gala theme. It would have been very on brand for her at the time.    That’s what the met is about. Sarah Jessica Parker is the best guest for a reason! She treats it like a collaborative design project throughout the year.
Will never forgive Kourtney for being the fashion girly of the family and then showing up looking like THAT to her FIRST met gala.   At that point just decline to go cuz I’d be surprised if they have her back 😭
Why does Kim's replica dress fit her so poorly?! 😩
Observations…. It’s like khloes become Kris’ emotional support animal.? And the way Elon musk is looking at Kim’s earnest attempts to be intelligent and engaging…. It’s too funny!!!!
Looks like this is why they’re not getting invited back
Also convinced Kim did final approvals of khloes hair and accepted it so it wouldnt be better than hers idk idk  ![gif](giphy|auhHp7Btj6iU8)
Pete and Kourtney both look so dumb 😅
Are they invited this year?
Not having Pete is the best look  ![gif](giphy|YpuNFtj5gbpq8)
They give absolutely nothing every single time.
The appearance of The Kardashians at the met has lowered the profile of the overall event. That goes for any and all influencers, but particularly them.
Spotted on the steps of the met… not the kardashians
I feel like one of them is going to show up practically nude one of these years
Who is the blonde that Kendall and Hailey are chatting to in the bathroom? Kendall’s body language is majorly off
I hate Khloes hair and Kim’s tan! I wonder if they were both raging when they seen how they photographed!
literally none of them looked good. ugly outfits or ugly makeup or ugly hair (or all 3)
No one looked bad except in Kim in retrospect.  Also in retrospect Kylie looked cute. At the time I didn't even want to see her but she wore that nicely and always upstages her supermodel sister.
Sebastian Stan looked so good in his look.
I live for these bts bits
What's the theme for this year's Met Gala? I'm not sure I've read it anywhere.
It's wild how Gwen Stefani just looks 27 again in the photos I've seen from that night
Kris' dress reminds me of the one JLo wore many years ago to an awards show. I remember how iconic and beautiful she looks. Kris looks beautiful too .
Gosh they're really all bad. I think kendall's is closest to the best. Khloe's looks too much like Kim's and her sunglasses are stupid. Kim...just...it just fell SO flat. Kylie too. The dress is pretty but I really expect Blake Lively level stuff from them. They just can't pull it off though.   Kourtney's is freaking terrible.  I am so disappointed in how her and Travis have embraced/created their "couple style." You have all this money and access and this is what you have done? I read her wedding dress was inspired by the November Rain video.  They could've copied that look to a t and it would've been significantly better than what they did.  Sigh.
Pic 6. Emma having her IT girl moment before she gets backstabbed😭
Ok guys don’t come for me but I secretly really want Kim and Pete to get back together lol
kris is serving queen clarice from princess diaries
Travis baker is where make up in the one picture where you can only see the side of his face
Are they still invited
Omg, such an iconic momento for Kim (idc) !!! Kylie and kris looked fab (specifically Kylie honouring her friend 🥲) and liked the idea on kourtney but i don’t think it was met enough
[removed]
I feel like this was last week but at the same time I feel like this was a hundred years ago
Same I can’t believe this was nearly a year ago
It looks like she has an ace bandage wrapped around her hips.
Kourtney’s dress is ugly.
I like the concept behind her and Travis’ looks, but yeah she’s not pulling it off
I kinda of get where they were going with this look - but unfortunately somethings don't work if you're not a 6 foot tall/thin model. This is one of those looks.
At least she didn’t wear a dead woman’s dress
These looks are all tragic.
She’s trying to be Jackie O
Kim tried so fucking hard to be iconic and this look flopped so hard. It’s definitely embarrassing. At least the others didn’t seem to take it as seriously
And that she went with Pete Davidson. It was all bad.
Looking at Kylie's dress again, it's actually gorgeous! I just can't get behind the hat? I guess I'm just old and behind the times lol. The dress really is stunning, though.  I actually like Kourtney's about 5% more after hearing the explanation for it. But considering I was at a 0% before, that's not saying much.
I like Kourtney’s. Like I’m not delusional and I def get why everyone thinks it’s atrocious 💀but I love the concept behind it!
Kris is the only one I like of them all. I can’t believe they were known to be fashion queens and then came out with this hot garbage.
See I dont even like hers lol
Kendall’s black satin skirt was 🖤
Also is that Olivia rodrigo talking to Sabrina carpenter in the last pic bc I’ve never seen a picture of them together before
Wow great spot
This is pretty much true!
I hope they go as a horse
See, the cream color of the top of the skirt is what threw me. I think it would have been cool otherwise
he's embarrassed for sure
I bet he is too!
e shows it live every year
I use to hate it but recently found an appreciation for it somehow ..
Because it’s not a replica..
Except Kendall …she’s still a real model!

The only correct answer for everything in life.
I know but that’s because times are weird
What is the concept? Genuinely asking.
Would it be considered a flop since it was hands down the most talked about look? I mean I agree that she didn't look glamorous or anything but all the talk about the dress got exactly what she wanted.
kim’s look was literally the only one talked about and people are still bitter about it lmao
You’re not behind the times the hat is awful…reminds me of when I was a little kid and those horrid trucker hats were in 😂
I like the concept but it could have been designed better.
I think I was in denial that they were all bad at the time and convinced myself I liked Kendall’s. Looking back it’s really bad. Her hair is always so boring at these events, the bleached brows are yellow, the dress is wearing her, etc.
I don’t like it either, but I like it in comparison to the rest of them
It just looks nice compared to what the other sisters looked like. Otherwise yea still very meh. It’s pretty much Kylie’s but black.
I like the concept, like we’re wearing the same but at different times of the process… idk it’s hard to be short haha
I hope he’s extra embarrassed he obeyed Kim and got a spray tan. You just know she didn’t want his natural paleness to clash with her artificial orange
Oh I thought she only wore the real one going up the stairs! I was specifically referring to the pic where she's talking to Elon Musk
Hmmmmmm… disagree
Thank you! This could be beautiful. Fingers crossed
Her outfit is a “deconstructed” version of Travis’s suit.   Absolute failure. She looks tragic.
Yes. There’s a difference between being praised for one’s fashion sense and getting attention for having a bad look. Iconic vs infamous
I think the reasoning behind the hat was to make it look less bridal?
I love her dress, but I will NEVER understand bleached brows.
You're right, she only wore the original for the red carpet and switched to a replica after. Literally only on the carpet. She changed into it there, in front of the theater.
Oh sorry I thought she wore the Marilyn dress for the entire event. I might be wrong.
She’s been doing stunt looks for a couple of years now. It’s a way to get attention without actually competing in the fashion arena. I wonder if she’ll sincerely participate this year.
i feel like there’s 20 other things you can do to make it look less bridal and none of them involved a snapback with a veil💀
To me it just looks boring like Kendall could’ve easily ate them all up the dress does nothing for her except take up space. Kourtney and Kylie looks are by far the worse IMO, and I’m with you on the bleached brows
They make her look SO strange and not like herself. Whatever she wears this year, if she has her normal eyebrows it will be an improvement!
Lmao fr it’s such a strange choice
I just can’t even bring myself to watch their show anymore the first two seasons of the Hulu show were so boring. I know they really hyped up drama in the recent promo for the new season but I’m just buying it. The only semi interesting thing happening is Kendall dating bad bunny but I know they’re not gonna show that this season, they’ve got nothing but kourts wedding and Khloe and trashcan drama and I’m so fucking over them and the same cheating scandal every season.
u know they’re boring when kendall is the most interesting 😭
What you don’t want to watch another skims ad? I mean season of the Kardashian’s??
Like it’s been almost two years of continuous flops….DO A BETTER JOB KRIS  https://preview.redd.it/kiry9c3g96sa1.png?width=1169&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bd6bb3175c40bf0c34bc7890eba0c8640cb67cc3
Literally, we are BORED
And then they pull the wedding out of the show and give it a spin off. SMH. Why would anyone watch?
![gif](giphy|biOF1Hiz8rgcZ7Z6Ap|downsized)  We need this energy in the next season.
PLEASE i’m so bored 😭😭😭😭😭 it’s so lame but i need the drama
So boring. Kris needs to let Kendall be her true self 💅🏼
Who is this person anyway way?🤔
Kim is just living her life and her haters are seething because they need to make fun of her on a daily basis
We've already seen what's worth seeing of the wedding tho I don't get itttt 😭 what else could there be that's not just 30mins of them slobbering over each other 💀
unfortunately 💀
honestly I think this is a very intentional low key era
Now who is this 😭
GET YOUR ASS UP AND WORK
They would need a real talent
P sure Kendall is enjoying her private life with her gorgeous house, solid friend group, hobbies, millions, traveling the world, etc lol she literally lives a dream life

And also Kendall is ✨️private✨️ so she won't share anything. (Which is 100% fair but like... you're getting paid so much to be on a reality show)
That’s what I’m saying even the wedding is boring at this point it’s been a whole year, they should have wrapped that up last season when it was relevant. Nothing they have for this season will be worth watching it’s gonna flop like the last few seasons.
Well it was a bad idea, need better content
i feel this way about kylie cause i wanna know what’s going on in her life more than anyone. like give us details on travis breakup, what makes this time different, how are you guys raising your kids together or even just yourself etc., what do you actually do over at kylie cosmetics
She is sooo talented…love her!!!
This is awesome 🐰🐇
hahahahahaha,🤣🤣🤣 that was hilarious , thankyou 😀
Didn’t they just get together ??  https://preview.redd.it/nwr35w1pu5sa1.jpeg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d5f42c2b4a083795562cc72d5bb20e586b9dac45
They just started dating last week…  https://preview.redd.it/k3vpp8ioz5sa1.png?width=1166&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cb20cbb5af01fee99b7e8ad6a3ea643b7cc2e675

Is that the guy from You….
Damn that was fast
They look like uncle and nephew or something
Serious question, is Chris bi or was he in the closet? I know he has an ex-wife and kids
Lukas gage is gay/bi?
Speed reading I thought he was engaged to lady Gaga 🤦🏻‍♀️
Chris is fine as hell 🥵 idc that he paid for the entire face and body. That surgeon did an incredible job
Man they’re good looking 😭
I never understand when people rush into big events like this. Whats the hurry?
Omg I thought this was Luke from Summer House
Life as a couple of hot, rich gay guys must be incredible lol I’m jealous
There’s like 50 abs in that photo whew
Something interesting about these older n younger gay Hollywood couples..  Tom Daley & Dustin Lance  Colton Hayes & Jeff Leathan (div)  Lukas Gage & Chris Appleton
I am in mourning... he is too young for him but it sounded like Chris fell hard
Chris has such serious daddy vibes
The age difference concerns me 🤨  Eta: I thought he was 20, 😬
[removed]
💀
And, white lotus. 💀
Yes
[removed]
I guess when you know you know 🤷🏼‍♀️
💀
Yes. This couple grosses me out because of this.
I think he’s talked about it pretty openly, I remember reading him discussing his sexuality/ex-wife in an interview…I’ll try to link it if I can find it
💀
I was speed reading and I thought it said King’s hairstylist 😂
Love?...or someone wants to lock the other down for whatever reason
luke is a grown ass man
What’s the age difference between them?

Thank you! I literally had no idea so I was extremely confused lol
Love isnt a reason to rush into marriage, thats why it doesnt make sense to me. The reasons to rush are green card/visa, terminal illness etc... for regular folks in love theres literally no reason to rush into marriage. Each to their own tho i guess
A whole ass adult  https://preview.redd.it/58sd9qdq06sa1.png?width=1169&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a42c156189908c37e69cd9f95850d9cc27d6385c
liiiike 12 years?  Chris is 39 Luke is 27
Lol fr he's one of those people where it's hard to divide the character from the person 💀
https://preview.redd.it/3f8d088ap7sa1.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f9a5fcf8feba06ad12c73f398c5eac93bdf1e43b  I don’t recall if this is exactly what I’d read previously (he may talk about it more in a diff interview) but this is what I found with a quick google  Link: [https://www.gaytimes.co.uk/culture/kim-kardashian-west-interviews-beauty-expert-chris-appleton/amp/](https://www.gaytimes.co.uk/culture/kim-kardashian-west-interviews-beauty-expert-chris-appleton/amp/)
Lol i wasn't claiming that marrying quickly for love is a good reason, but it is definitely the primary motivation for some. For others, yes, they might want to quickly lock their partner down due to serious illness or to secure their visa or to raise their public profile...the possibilities are endless
Ok thanks. I mean there’s a bit of a difference but Luke is almost 30, he’s a grown man. I thought you were gonna say he’s early 20s or something .
That’s actually quite a sweet spot 🤭 and Chris is a whole daddy
Good for him!
Idk why you’re being downvoted lol you’re not wrong 💅🏼
Lmao ikr. I’d love to fall into such a situation with such a daddy 😝😍🥰 (I’m 26)
Hahahaha I’ve been dating 40+ year olds since I turned 19, obviously that wasn’t ideal but I just turned 28 so it doesn’t really matter anymore. I truly don’t get the hype with guys our age, or when people thirst over celebrities like Brad Pitt when he was younger. Men look so much better in their 40s, that’s truly the sweet spot 🤤
I have also wondered the same thing but haven’t been able to find out an answer yet!
every month’s 15th day!!! that is why the new s coming april 15th
she’s really never letting go of this man 😂
LMFAOOOOOO   y’all gon tell me they were gettin McDonald’s for the kids in the back or sum???
![gif](giphy|DPqqOywshrOqQ|downsized)  I feel like this gif works in almost any situation… especially with khloe and 🗑
Triston is sending me
I guess Khloe never hear me that you should believe people when they show you who they are the first time. We were rooting for you 💀  ![gif](giphy|tLRifcvQNJIic)
of course khloe is driving and ordering for him. and they dare not get his order wrong or Khlo Money will come out!!
They're just ✨coparenting✨ guys
Me pretending to be shocked.....  ![gif](giphy|tfUW8mhiFk8NlJhgEh)  Who are they kidding? 😂We all saw this coming
I wonder what Khloe’s McDonalds order is
please Jesus, tell this woman that healthy coparenting is not this
So they are back together and he’s probably already cheating on her 🤡
Tristan was so right when he said she is never leaving him, and it is embarrassing.
imagine him holding a chicken nugget and sauce lmaoo
https://preview.redd.it/kzhxdyb2g5sa1.jpeg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1dd354436f612634d727d7b9fc92cce441826317
Khloe the dick can’t be that good.
Why did this instantly make me think of TLC no scrub lyrics 😂 “…sitting on the passengers side of his *“best friends”* ride….” 😂
water seeks its own level. khloe is perfectly fine being with him because she's also a ~~former~~ cheater and has self esteem issues herself.  this is why you stay away from toxic men because they just lock you into that cycle.
so how do y’all think she’ll come clean? bc after the opening of last season how can you be back with trash can!!!
WhoEVER said she was doing the soft rollout with him this time…. I cannot stop laughing.
Getting his childish ass a happy meal
Seems like Khloe and Tristan have more of a Kylie and Travis “relationship” now. He gets to do whatever he wants and then come home to a faithful baby mama slave who makes him a sandwich and pays for McDonald’s.
I’m waiting for people to say: this is soooo normal my parents have been divorced since I was 6 and they always get me McDonald’s together. Ya ok🤡
Khloe is so pathetic . Idk how anyone could defend her this time .
![gif](giphy|ypHVUhC2UmqoU)
She’s so embarrassing. I would smack my sister fr. She would thank me too after
Remember she used to shit on Kourtney when Kourt got back together with Scott in the early season? Joke's on her now. THIS IS WAY MORE WORST.
Tmz just ran it as an exclusive lol. The only info is that they bought a ton of food and included happy meals 😂
Wow. He can really do anything and she’ll take him back. This is sad
At this point, I’m happy for Tristan.
Khloe, they never change!! Tried w/ my ex husband for 10+ yrs.! After many affairs and love child later, I took my two babies and left, and never looked back. I don’t regret it for even a moment. You will be so much happier w/o him. Love really does come when you’re not looking. Currently engaged to the love of my life who I trust w/ everything.
ATP, I’m praying for Tristan to be free
2 things are for sure.   1- She will never leave this man and 2. He will cheat on her at every opportunity.    It's really quite sad and she deserved someone nicer but here we are.
She is as comitted to him as Kris has been to her hairstyle for 3 decades
she deserves to be treated like a doormat by him at this point. what a loser
He looks miserable
The fact that shes driving makes this funnier
Should have hit him with we got food at home.   Alternative - we got McDonald’s at home, bc you know whatever their chefs make it 10x better lol
no way in hell the dick is that good 🫡
I just want to know what they’re doing in Rialto
Who wants someone who just wants you in a pandemic or after their mom died
God that’s so embarrassing
![gif](giphy|8vUEXZA2me7vnuUvrs)
One day they will end for good (even if it’s in 10 years) and Tristan will probably settle down with someone else. Khloe will never find a good relationship after this. Every man on earth knows she will accept ANY bad behavior in a relationship and take them back.
Nothing would make me feel more of a lowly peasant than waiting on a Kardashian in a drive thru window.
![gif](giphy|WSO1ZT9sug15C)
I would have guessed he prefered In-N-Out 😂
There was no need for a clown at True's party since Khloe was there.
Of COURSE Tristan is a passenger princess 🙄
Ugh the way Khlo is cheesin we know she’s down bad
How and why ? This is getting embarassing now ! Do they have a fatwa against them that no decent men are available for them to date? What does she expect now ? Legally bind him into not cheating !?
Why did I ever defend her with the Jordyn situation why whyyyyy
Of course she’s the one driving and ordering
This seems like behavior an addict would exhibit. I personally would never be able to break bread with someone who betrayed me in the ways that Tristan betrayed her, but I am not a codependent, ocd, body dysmorphic person.   I don’t need to be a psychiatrist or a therapist to clearly see, light as day- that this woman has some serious emotional issues. Her money and success mask her deep emotional deficiencies and that’s why people allow her to behave like this. She will never, ever have a healthy, normal relationship, if she continues to be THIS close and friendly with a man who literally traumatized / publicly humiliated her and destroyed her reputation.
🤡 🤡 🤡
How is it that she is all smiles and he looks embarrassed to be seen? Sad.
Sad. What a sad pathetic woman she is.
BLECCCHHH 🤮🤮🤮
She’s bold that’s for sure.
no cos it's lowkey spiritual bondage at this point.
Why in the world would they be in Rialto. That’s the real question
I came here as soon as I saw this…fucking pathetic. I don’t know what else to even say.
I think we as a collective need to let this go. I’ve clearly cared more about Tristan’s treatment of Khloe than she has (haha I kid kind of). But at this point it’s a lost cause. I’m not wasting anymore energy on it. I at least hope he making her c*m 😂😭
What, you guys don't go through the McDonald's drive-through with your exes? They're just coparenting! 💀   Honestly, though, she most likely knows that the public is onto them. This is probably their soft launch for those who still had doubts after Malika's birthday party or PR drama for the upcoming season. She's not dumb enough to just go through a McDonalds drive-thru with him without knowing this would end up *everywhere*.
She must be there to apply to be their new mascot cause she a bigger clown than Ronald McDonald
Why are they in Rialto?? Lol!
Beyond pathetic. Not even just sad anymore.
GROSS 🤮
Someone pls forward this to.Comments by celebs. I need Emma and Julie to rage about this on their.pod.
🤦‍♀️
Awh I didn’t know the circus was in town, looks like there’s room for a couple more clowns in the car though.
I’m more surprised she’s at a McDonald’s
she is pathetic
🤡 🤡 just a couple clowns out in town
Klown
she is a clown
Craving fries, "craving change"....same thing I guess in her mind * shrugs *
Ughhhh
This is a level of stupidity I never thought was possible.  Does she really think she is "proving" something to these other women that hook up with him, or anyone else?   She is pathetic.
Khloe!! You do realize other men exist.. Right??
Of course she’s the one driving him around..
She’s really hiding in Rialto to be with her man. 😂
I knew his ass is a passenger princess  ![gif](giphy|uizkUT3jl96wCG2VxV|downsized)
oh for the love of GOD KHLOE GET TO TOGETHER
![gif](giphy|Hsjxoi5WcJl4Sj90WT|downsized)
honestly at this point she deserves all the stress she gets from him
Guys, he's Trooz dad ok 😔
She's always just gonna use the rise above trope. She chooses love. 2. 3. 4. time, doesn't matter, she's all about forgivness u guys. And that makes her a better person. In god's eyes n shit. BFFR. If god were real he'd be pissed LOL
The fact he’s playing passenger princess just grinds my gears. Let him go khloe 😅
I wonder what they were doing in Rialto of all places! That’s crazy
I think if they want to be together then good on them, go for it. But make it clear to each other what it is and isn’t. She needs to accept that he’s going to have sex with other women, and if she can’t then don’t be with him. Don’t do the whole shocked Pikachu face when he’s with other women. Have an open relationship
I know it probably sounds over dramatic, but the Khloe/Tristan arc has been the nail in coffin of me bailing on the show. I just cant care anymore about a woman that makes such poor decisions over and over again. I used to love her, now she infuriates me. I feel for the kids growing up in this weird co-dependant household.
mannnn dont even feel sad/bad for her anymore  she is doing it to herself!!!!  that guy is literally making different girls pregnant every 6-7 months  come on
Who caressssssss it’s so boring at this stage
Kloe and Triston.   Kardashion.   Lol.
He was HIDING 😂😂😂
I mean it makes sense. Clowns love eating the fast food clown food.
She’s trying so hard to get her own McDonalds meal like offset and cardi B I swear
🤮
“Kloe Kardashion.”  “Triston.”
my first thought was RIALTO?!? surprised khloe and trashton would even touch that city! 😭
I feel like she’s staying with him for the kids but omfg imagine growing up and realising how your dad treated/repeatedly cheated on your mother. I’d be mortified
just because they were spotted together doesn't mean theyre dating, they could be trying to rebuild a friendship type relationship and not have any bad blood considering they do have kids together so it's important for them to be on good terms
I wanna know what they ordered lmaooooo
Yep, she’s a female simp and this proves it . Don’t say anything to me unless it’s in agreement .
I might get downvoted for this. I think it’s absolutely ridiculous if she’s actually back with this man, she should not give him any time of day. But honestly, do you think we are all too quick to judge? He is True’s dad at the end of the day, what if she’s just cool and friends with him just to keep peace? Btw I’m just saying maybe we are jumping the gun too far and too fast without knowing her actual thought process. My main problem with khloe is the fact that she threw Jordyn under the bus so hard yet forgave AND defended trashton a gazillion times. To conclude I defo feel a bit conflicted with her being close to him in ANY kind of way but I just feel like maybe I’m not one to judge cos I have questionable dynamics too. E.g. I’m friendly and cool with an ex who once did me dirty, now imagine if I had a baby with him 💀 I’d have to be more than cool for the sake of the child. Does anyone feel me?
Sorry I feel like I’m the only one who doesn’t think this means they’re back together?! I’m assuming they go to things like True’s dance classes/recitals together sometimes, and I don’t think it would be weird for them to share a lift and grab some food on the way back home; especially if Tristan is spending the afternoon with True after.   I don’t doubt they could be back together, this just isn’t proof for me ahaha
I hope they are filming a YMH Drive-Thru Challenge. Imagine Khlo Money saying, “Hey Hitler! I need two Oreo McFlurries! Thanks Mommie! I love you!”
Eh, who cares? That's her man & she gone stick beside him 🤷🏽‍♀️   ETA: y’all can’t be fr downvoting me because I said the obvious Lmaoo like what? Or maybe y’all haven’t seen the video I’m referencing. Ugh. This sub sucks sometimes.

I mean, that dick must be really good to keep going back lol

🤦‍♀️
Her nose is tiny!!
Damn she really can’t let him go, dude Eve had a whole kid behind her back😵‍💫
Those glasses are not it Khlo
What’s wrong with her 🙄
i hope at the very least it’s a mutual open relationship
[removed]
Taking back useless baby daddies and eating calories?!? She’s just like us.

Rialto is the ghetooooo
🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Wondering why they are in the inland empire which is mostly just warehouses and DCs haha
I’m so disappointed by this.
The Kardashians really love them some McDonalds. Lol
They are definitely back together! And there’s no denying it
she never gonna learn is she 😭
Could they just be in an open relationship?  We all know KOKO likes them hoodrats…
I knew his mom's death with bring him sympathy from khloe.
🤡🤡
Clowns flock together
Wait till she knows we don’t give a fuck about her sons name
FREE TRISTAN AT THIS POINT. RELEASE HIM KHLOE🗣️🗣️🗣️
[removed]
[removed]
Wait… do we think they actually ended things… because I think she made it appear that way to get her family off her backs and give us a whole story line- but - that man could run her over and she would still say he may change and would help him through the trauma of trying to kill her
They’ve gotta be filming lol I feel like the only time they get fast food is if they’re shooting
It’s the only interesting story line that the KarJenners have at this point.
I know it’s likely true and I am in denial, but I have watched KUWTK since the beginning and now the new show, and I swear that if she announces they are back together I completely give up on the whole thing and will never watch a single episode again.   She’s my favourite sister, and watching her go back to this ass clown feels almost like having a friend you watch make the same stupid mistakes with an idiot man over and over and over again…
I feel like she fell hard and fast for Lamar and really was happy until that fell apart. Once it feel apart, it really messed her up, understandably. I don’t they she ever fully healed from that heartbreak.
The second photo looks like she just got a fresh line-up from the barber shop…
Of course she’s driving lol
Gurl, he’s not even that cute
Honestly how is she not embarrassed at this point
[removed]
[removed]
This is embarassing af 🙄
[removed]
This woman has no thoughts of the future for her child. Her daughter will grow up to learn that what her dad does  is an acceptable way to be treated and she will end up like a doormat to some trash man too.
She could meet someone so genuinely lovely that would treat her well, and she isn’t even bothering to try.
Can't wait to hear about the next baby mama. It's coming sooner or later.
Girrrrl
I’m so embarrassed for her…does she not have any self respect? 😭
I’m more surprised Khloe is at Mac Donald’s…
At this point, she deserves whatever she gets 🤷🏼‍♀️ which is probably gonna be more paternity suits, cheating stories from strippers & IG heaux, and maybe a STD
He has no shame in his game all the damages he’s Done
They r so pase !!! Over that circus FAMILY CORNY BORRRRRI
It's called trauma bonding.
Well this basically confirms they’re back together
It still makes me so mad thinking back to how they treated Jordyn and the way they bullied her online (and in private 10x worse i’m sure too) but for Tristan they continue to literally enable his behaviour and let him do literally what he wants but Ms. Jordyn Woods made ONE mistake and they ripped her to shreds for it ☹️
[removed]
Those of you saying she deserves this, shame on you! Khloe is extremely mentally ill on many levels and absolutely doesn't deserve this. She is probably mind fucked to the point of no return. Yes it is crazy that she continues to go down this path with him but girl is so broken from a lifetime of fuckery. Have some sympathy. This is so sad.  I think the reason I indulge in the KarJennersnis they have real life problems despite all the wealth. It's wild to me.
God, every time I think Khloe’s going to start FINALLY moving on from this clown he pops back up like:  ![gif](giphy|74yD9EZ3dMQFi)  How pathetic
[removed]
genuinely. she’ll buy this man any houses or cars he wants, she’ll go to fucking war for him, she’ll support him to the ends of the earth, she doesn’t care. I wish someone in her life would sit her down and ask what the hell she’s doing
But that’s #truesdad
Ok I hate to say it but at this point her insanity has me convinced this man’s penis is pure magic. Like this is the textbook example of life-ruining sex.
She’s holding him hostage 😭
she already got the engagement ring back on for next season 😮‍💨
They are 💯 together, well i mean she is, he's still fuckin about like the hoe he is, but she is definitely back with him & has been for months
He was right when he said to her “more like you’re never leaving me”
My stomachs queazy and it’s NOT from the McDoubles 🤮🙄 There’s literally NADA happy about this meal!
It's quite tragic at this point
“ I just went with true’s dad to get her McDonald’s , this such a monumental moment he just had to be in the passenger seat” 😭  Khloe’s delusional af, we been knew they were back together lmao
It was True’s LUNCH okay and he’s her DAD he has to BE THERE
“He’s Trues dad so of course I’m going to get McDonald’s with him. It’s for true”
Right 😂😂😂Literally ANY!
I love her. She made TV fun.

What about Tristian

What do you mean the 1st time isn't this like the 1,000 time?
Am I the only one who think they did it on purpose ? They need to keep people interested especially now that a new season is coming and that no one wants to watch. Khloe is the new Kourtney, she’s the one that exposes her relationship/cheating drama and keeps people speculating  on her being back together or not with her scandalous baby daddy to bring in the audience (now that Kourtney refuse to do it.)   Anyone who think all of their boyfriends didn’t cheat on them (Travis Scott, Younes, Kanye, Devin...) is delusional. But it’s never addressed and will never be, not even a little bit, not even to deny it, not even when a lot of people talk about it like Travis Scott and this girl from insta, and rumors about him having a baby, or Kanye more or less admitting to having cheated on Kim.   Kris knows full well what she is doing, and that she needs a scapegoat that sacrifices her dignity to keep the Kardashian name in people’s mouth because the whole reason people watch reality TV is to criticize and mock the people on them.  The only times people are talking about the Kardashians now (not this sub obviously) is when there is a scandal with Tristan cheating on her and/or her getting back with him. People loves this shit. No one wants to talk about Kim going to Harvard or her new podcast or other business ventures, the other girls give us no informations about their lives... Khloe is carrying the whole show on her back right now. Even on this sub, this post was made 5 hours ago and has 175 comments on it calling her dumb and that she deserves it at this point... the others post made 5 hours ago have like 5-15 comments on them 😬
Khloe showed who she was, going after other women's men.
[removed]
He's a passenger princess ✨💅
he’s a scrub! sitting on the passenger side of his baby mama’s ride!  ![gif](giphy|qJZuFa45GJl0k)
I'm sure she is paying too...this pic alone could sum up their whole relationship.   He really prefers the drive thru situation with no responsibility.
It’s giving teenage son asking his mom to take him to McDonald’s for lunch
Can’t have his toy till he eats his happy meal.
This is the most embarrassed I have ever been for her.
She always drove Lamar too. I’ve watched their spinoff waaaaaay too many times and don’t think there was a single scene of him driving them.
It’s the way he talks and acts like a 13 year old boy, concerning
She'll order whatever Tristan is ordering
YES. This is what's important. Did Tristan get a Happy Meal?
Seems like the type to get three different burgers, eat half of one, 3-4 nuggets that she asked for a few different sauces but only opened one, and a handful of fries then toss the rest  Maybe Kim would be the one to do this but idk they’re all the same to some extent
A cup of ice
Probably?
100% That’s why he knew he could cheat!
Hhaahah i love this visceral hate + annoyance towards him
Same!!
we can only hope his happy meal 'toy' is a condom. LOL  truthfully, i've been saying for quite some time now that he should be doing commercials for condoms. i'm not even kidding. with some clever copywriting he could be the best spokesperson.
It's not normal.. My brother who is back and forth with his baby mama does things likes this. So something brewing...
My parents would do shit like this all the time. It’s not normal and feels like your third wheeling because you know their intentions. True maybe too young to understand it now, but she will one day
This also makes me think the baby is 100% named after him 😭
Get that coin sis 🤣
Lmfao
The discipline and strength that you had to walk away was what earned you the love you have now. She does not have that strength or discipline. She was saying on the show how she is so resilient and I was blown away that after her consistent poor outcomes, she still views herself as resilient.   Resilient is not simply being alive after you suffer something negative.   Resiliency is not creating bad situations for yourself and then surviving them.   Resilience is seeing that something is wrong, bouncing back and living happily in a DIFFERENT reality. CHANGING your circumstances. OVERCOMING your circumstances. Overcoming is NOT getting back together or forgiving. Overcoming is finding the love of your life and moving the fuck on.
At this point she doesn’t deserve it. She’s a walking red flag. It takes a lot of discipline and inner work to be a great partner/ spouse. She is unwilling to do that work. She thinks being a doormat and being loving and forgiving is being a great spouse, and it’s not. Being a great spouse means having self respect and dignity.
As committed as Corey is to silk suits, and Kim is too posing in every picture with the kissy pout 😂😂😂
Probably on the way to Palm Springs
Probably the one on La Sierra off the 210. I know it well, lmao. They're on their way for a romantic vacay!
this is so true
Yes and they will feel turned off. I would say she has a VERY small window left before she’s completely romantically unmarketable.
i feel like this has to be some publicity stunt to get people talking.   do you think kardashians/celebrities really go to mcdonalds? serious question, i don't know if they do lol
![gif](giphy|l1J9Hrmwbynb9EdcQ|downsized)
They'll call it the Khloe and Offcheating meal.
what in the tiktok hell is happening with the spellings here
She took him back after he had a whole child with someone else and denied it until the paternity test😂 she’s way past simp, whatever that would be
LMAO found one
Regardless, it takes a woman with very low self worth to spend more time than absolutely necessary with your ex when he has treated her as abhorrently as he’s treated Khloe.   It’s possible to be amicable coparents while also spending as little time as possible together. Especially for two rich people, there is zero reason to be going to their daughters recitals together, unless they are back together. Sit in a car and get a friendly meal with this man on my child’s wedding day? Ok. For a little recital? Please. They are absolutely back together.

If she’s never going to let him go, they might as well just have an open relationship. He ain’t gonna stop cheating and she ain’t ever gonna stop taking him back. They may as well accept this dynamic.
The complacency of her family is really infuriating. I know they can’t make her leave him or move on, but the amount of pampering and kissing up they do for Tristan is genuinely upsetting because I really think it only serves to enable Khloe. It’s not even like he’s a particularly interesting or valuable person either way, he’s not that great an athlete and he’s dumb as a bag of rocks on top of the cheating. Only famous for how much misery he brings Khloe Kardashian otherwise nobody would talk about him. And it’s like nobody in her family cares. Khloe desperately needs a Solange in her life
I meannnn her mom is Kris “ugh guys u can’t do that to the father of ur kids” Jenner
I just feel bad for her. What she thinks is good enough for her is such a low low bar.
I would think that also if most of the Kardasian/Jenner clan do the same
They prob had period sex 😭😂😂😭😭😭😂😂
at this point … free tristan 😭
🤣🤣🤣🤣💯💯💯💯💀💀💀💀
*never leaving me *alone*

Lol it is but it should've never escalated to 1000 times and 800 children 💀
Definitely everything they do in public has a purpose. I've seen so many YT videos and tiktoks about how this is the end of the Kardashian era and how they're not relative anymore. So everything they do seems so desperate lately
Ehh that's true maybe they do deserve each other

Crying at Tristan and I having something in common 😭
Considering he’s from Brampton, I wouldn’t want him behind the wheel.  The Ontarians of this sub know why.
...trying to holler at me
“WHy doES He neEd heR $ wHEN he’S rich?” -Said by her slow on the draw fans. 😬
He’s definitely broke
Don't want him getting lost on the way to maccy d's and creating another child!
In retrospect he was probably always under the influence of something or coming down
I think everyone does . He’s a POS
I can imagine this is very confusing to children.
couldn’t have said it better!
You’re absolutely correct. For Easter.
Where they’ll go to a club and trashcan will cheat ang get someone else pregnant again, ofc.
Is McD’s sponsoring the return of Jesus?
Lol I just looked it up and I realized that I’ve been to the del taco off of riverside to fuel up before a trip to Palm Springs.
You got downvoted but it’s a valid question. They have $$$&& but they don’t have DoorDash?
My thoughts exactly. Khloe is the new Kourtney, she sacrifices her dignity to bring in the audience. She just need to do things that keep people guessing about them being together or not and twitter explodes. Nobody else in this family give us anything interesting
I think they do, partially for brand deals and partially because of their diet. We always see them eating salads and working out, but there are also lots of references to secret binges happening behind the scene. Kim specifically would talk about binging on Krispy Kreme donuts and McDonald’s after starving herself for photoshoots. McDo is an easy way to consume a lot of calories at once if you’ve been underfed for a few days. It’s not healthy at all, but it will fill you up.  I personally love the episode where they go to Japan and have to get McDo because the small plates served at the fancy, high-end restaurants they’re getting paid to appear at on the show aren’t enough. Totally relatable to any American who has been abroad and finally “cracked” after a couple of days.
Kylie went to a drive through (don’t remember if it was McDonald’s though) when pregnant in the video she made for Stormi. The others I don’t know.
Lololol
Don’t forget, offset cheated too😂
Ahaha was waiting for this. It’s cool, just as someone who grew up with parents who weren’t together but would attend things together for us, this doesn’t seem abnormal to me.
Yeah okay, fair point.
She does have an open relationship with. She also knew about Maralee living with Tristan in Boston. Tristan has never cheated on her, because they are not exclusive.
It’s not about complacency it’s about keeping the peace. My brother literally had the worst fiancé that every single one of family members hated. Even his friends hated them. We voiced our opinions and it created issues within our family. To my brother that was the most important person in his life and if you had anything negative to say, he didn’t wanna hear it. It got to the point where we had to say either we treat this person as our family and welcome them and be cordial or lose my brothers involvement with our family. Eventually he saw the light on his own. From personal experience, no one can cut the cord but the people involved and you will make yourself sick trying to get a loved one to leave the one that love 🤷🏽‍♀️
Exactly! Kris is the reason that her daughters hold on tight to these toxic men. She has such a warped sense of reality that she passed right on down to her kids. Their family culture is so engrained in them that I don’t see any of them being able to learn or grow and break the cycle.
She chased after him knowing he had a pregnant girlfriend. Don't feel bad for her.
Oh you are so wrong for that 😂😂😭😭😭
FREE TRISTAN 2023💀
I’m dying 🤣🤣🤣

Now this, I can get behind!
Hahahaha
truez dad regards every vagina as a drive-thru.

🤣🤣🤣 yup!
As a certified Brampton girlie and a passenger princess this is the correct take 😭  Frankly you could tell me this is the MountainAsh and Bovaird McDonalds and I’d believe you (my Brampton girlies know)
Dead 😂😂😂
Nah he isn't broke.
I've been there lol.
They also have all sorts of assistants they could send to pick up their food. I’d say it’s definitely a publicity stunt. Haven’t seen this TikTok but the 2 pictures posted here looks like Khloe is definitely trying to make herself noticeable
Wait what!?! Living with him in Boston?!
It’s allllll Kris’ fault!!! Idc what anyone says she’s so toxic when it comes to men. I get wanting to have the father around but when he’s cheated on you TWICE while you’re pregnant/expecting *AND* has a baby on you why tf is he everrrrr invited anywhere he doesn’t *need* to be?? Malikas birthday? Like what the actual fck, goodbye! And when Kris told khloe to let him pay for the bday party. (I only would bc F u) but no! Trashcan would hold that over her head forever. If it was my idea, at my house, you’re not taking credit for anything; throw her (True) your own party

Isn't it ironic that even though Caitlyn transitioned, inside she's still an ignorant, boomer, white rich man. And didn't even take time to acknowledge what it's really like to be a woman, like since the day you're born, meaning the discrimination and sexism you face every day. She has no idea about that and isn't even willing to learn about it. She doesn't care about minorities, like she doesn't even think of herself as a minority. Really, Caitlyn Jenner is a mistery to me.
She really fucking forgets she’s trans and what the right think of trans people in America. This dumb bitch is the Olympic gold medalist of pulling the ladder up.
Lacks soo much self awareness😭

When I saw this, I screamed “OH MY GOD, JUST SHUT UP, CAITLYN”.
Wealth really insulates people from reality!
Caitlyn, his camp wants you and people like you dead
I can’t stand Caitlyn. It’s one thing to be a white boomer male voting for this guy because that’s his base but to be trans and vote for this guy. That’s wild man. Fuck Caitlyn Jenner.
Ewww....embarrassing for your life and soul! They both suck!!!!
Did I miss the part where Kaitlyn was a trump supporter? Because wow!
[removed]
She's gotten on and off the Trump train multiple times now. At this point, we all know it has nothing to do with politics or morals and EVERYTHING to do with what she can gain from it. If it gets a headline and some clicks, she'll say it 🙄 I'd have a lot more respect and patience for a unique perspective like hers (conservative trans woman) if she weren't so full of shit
![gif](giphy|7CXd7UeRxLsgU)
Yet he probably still refers to you as b****. But that's your man 🫡
There is only one way a woman can gloss over “Grab em by the pussy” and that’s internalized misogyny, through and through.

![gif](giphy|ItM3AhhM0rj57w1JxF)  just wanted an opportunity to use this gif
![gif](giphy|xT9IguxOugw6KwaANy)  I remember when Caitlyn first introduced herself after transitioning, I had hopes that she would be a catalyst FOR the LGBTQ+ community....now seeing how she consistently favors and supports conservatives who are AGAINST LGBTQ+ rights and continue to strip them of their freedoms because them identifying as the opposite gender makes them 'uncomfy'. The future for America is looking bleaker every damn day.
Not only is she a woman, she’s a trans woman.   Why does Cait hate herself ?
I wish nothing good for Caitlyn. My daughter is trans snd this misogynistic twunt pushes the cause back so far.
Well both of them hate gay and trans people 🤷🏻‍♀️
How is she not embarrassed?
Caitlyn is so delusional.
I bet you a dollar trump doesn't get found guilty on any charge
![gif](giphy|dPkQk7aiwL8DC)
Oh the privilege of living life as a white man for decades only to transition into a rich white woman.
All of these people voted for Trump and would do it again, you cannot convince me otherwise. Okay, maybe not Kendall and maybeeeee not Kourtney but the rest of them... 😒
🤢 🤮
Caitlyn be trying so hard to not be like the other trans girls
and are “The American People” in the room with us right now?
Like this is such a joke at this point. How does she not see it
orange recognises orange
Does Trump even like trans people? I feel like he probably makes fun of her behind closed doors
I had to unfollow her after this.
Wut.
And she complains the LGBTQ+ community don't want anything to do with her? I wonder why 🙄
This is horrible, for sure. But for the love of God, DO NOT read the comments on her post, because the amount of blatant transphobia is despicable.
The self- loathing transphobia is strong with this one.
Y’all really need to check yourselves with “inside Caitlyn is still a republican man”. There are fucking awful republican cis women out there, would you say the same about them? She is a woman, regardless of how awful she is, and it’s really disheartening to see the transphobia, however unintentional it may be, in these comments. Caitlyn is a nasty, selfish, misogynistic, racist, homophobic, transphobic WOMAN. Period.

She is so so toxic
No one respects you Caitlyn.
Caitlin Jenner was an asshole as Bruce Jenner and stayed an asshole after transitioning.  She’s completely blind to the real world for trans people.  To support those that want to take away all of your rights as a human being is beyond me.
It would make more sense to me if she did this kinda shit on purpose for attention…because Caitlyn lives for publicity same as any of the KJ’s. Like I’m more willing to assume that other than she’s just this stupid. Otherwise I don’t understand how she isn’t constantly exhausted from the mental gymnastics she performs everyday
“Manly” shake
Are you being transphobic?
My first comment was removed because I referred to Caitlin as her previous name. I was stating that as Caitlin she’s an asshole and before Caitlin was an asshole. To openly support those that want to remove your rights as a human being doesn’t make sense to me.  I don’t think she understands or cares what issues other transgender people have to deal with.
I don't understand Caitlyn.
you dumb fucking idiot
Vomit
[removed]
They both suck so bad
Oh…gross.
This is fucking embarrassing for her. She has NO connection to or appreciation for the POC trans women who paved the way for queer people. She has no respect for any queer people that aren’t white and conservative.  I am really hoping the family distances themselves, from her, if not already.
FFS, caitlyn! jesus! glad to see she’s still a POS
So fkn weird bc she’s anti- LGTBQ too like… homegirl you’re the T in that acronym? Wtf?
LOL I loved reading this- it’s been awhile since someone mentioned how messed up the whole thing is. Caitlyn invited Scott, after he lost both his parents, to come hang with women who have had “real problems” and ignores Scott the whole damn trip! Even one of the ladies was more concerned and loving towards Scott 😭 She is so in her own world and has always been. Remember when Caitlyn didn’t want to get the dog NEUTERED after it’s been humping every other dog in the whole damn district? Something about “leaving what god gave him” 😓 The older seasons are so much nostalgia.
It’s not ironic at all. I know quite a few trans folks who are hardcore Republican. They’re all over 40 at this point but I don’t care who you are, losing your white male privilege is something a lot of people aren’t comfortable doing so they hold onto it. You can change who you want to be, but you can’t change lived experiences and the things that define our identities as we grow up.
She’s able to avoid discrimination and transphobia by sitting on her giant pile of money. She didn’t have to face a lot of the adversity that “regular” trans folks have to face- she was absolutely celebrated by the media for coming out, was able to hide during the more “awkward” parts of her transition and show up in public as socially acceptably good looking woman, and had immediate access to any gender affirming care she wanted with no worry as to cost.   It’s no wonder her experience as a trans woman hasn’t actually changed her conservative bigoted viewpoints.  Edit: spelling
They really need to study her brain. Beyond comprehension how that thing works
this is the one thing. People assume because you’re trans/gay/even a woman you have to also be progressive… nah ANYONE can be misogynistic asshole. No more free pass to be a shitty human.
Absolutely agree. It’s like she’s so stuck in her old fashioned mindset, she doesn’t even see herself as the same as other trans people. Like she’s above that or something. Just gross to me. Of course what does one expect when one can literally kill someone and get away with it Scott free. The entitlement.
YES THIS. I've held my tongue about this particular topic because I don't know how to articulate some of my opinions without sounding transphobic but isn't it interesting that trans men don't seem to have this issue?
It’s what living in a bubble of privilege does to people. Caitlyn is “F u, I got mine” impersonated.
🎯
No matter what she dresses like, she’s still who and what she is as a person. An ignorant misogynist.
She thinks that the world revolves around her and that she’s the only person who can be trans like she gets some special Republican pass or something
I think she’s legitimately crazy, like definite personality disorder and probably some dementia as well
I think it’s a closeted thing. When you’re in the closet for long enough and deny and deny it you start to be like I’m not like other trans or gay people I’m not like them I’m not even gay or trans I don’t agree with their views and the  rainbow flags are too much!  My ex was like this 🤡then he blind sided me and came out you wouldn’t have really known the way he put up those walls. he felt passionately that trans women shouldn’t play cis women in sports. I was like ok random thing to feel passionate about . Meanwhile he fcked a trans woman
The ironic misspelling of mystery is hilarious.
Despite all her surgeries, she still acts like a man. Because she lived 60+ years of her life as one. She’ll never know what it’s like to have lived longer as a woman than as anything else. She will never truly pass and experience life as a female identified person.
I think it has a lot to do with the privilege of being a rich white woman.
When you say “what it’s really like to be a woman” you imply that caitlyn is not really a woman. Trans inclusive language would correct your initial comment to say “what it’s like to be a cisgendered woman”.
yasss 👏
This comment is giving terf. I agree Caitlyn ain’t shit but this isn’t the take you think it is.
Please check the transphobic language in your comment. Caitlyn is a woman. Would you say a cis woman is a “rich white man” on the inside? There are plenty of awful republican cis women out there. Caitlyn being trash doesn’t make her “still a man”. And like another person said, she doesn’t know what it’s like to be a *cis* woman. I’m really disappointed in the fact that this is the top comment and only 1 person sees the issue with how you phrased this. Trans women as a whole deserve better. And this cuntbag shouldn’t be an excuse for being transphobic.
She may have transitioned her appearance but she is who she is at heart. The only thing that changed is her appearance not her values as Bruce Jenner.
She's the absolute definition of a pick-me
She’s busy getting pilled up and killing innocent people with her car, cut her some slack.
came here to post this gif  💕
Caitlyn is insulated by her wealth and fame. A lot of the negative impact Trump has on trans people doesn't extend to her.
Yeah she cancelled her Piers Morgan appearance because he criticised Trump lol
Caitlyn is a republican and ran 2021 California gubernatorial recall election  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlyn_Jenner?wprov=sfti1  In her pitch to voters, Jenner has likened herself to Donald Trump, calling herself a "disrupter" like Trump.  During the campaign, Jenner left the United States, going to Australia in order to compete on that country's television series Big Brother VIP. Although invited to take part in candidate debates, she did not participate. Jenner fought Governor Gavin Newsom in court to prevent the California Secretary of State from placing Newsom's party affiliation on the ballot, and won the legal battle.  Jenner ended up in 13th place with 75,215 votes, which was one percent of the votes cast for replacement candidates.
u missed a lot
Yes
An insult to cunts. She doesn’t have the depth or warmth.
You nailed it; she just wants the attention. Remember when she bragged to Kim that she collected the most amount of Twitter followers in the fastest amount of time?
oh yeah that is why it is even worse, she posted it in support of his felonies 😭
Like I can’t deal with this bitch in the slightest. She’s selfish and greedy and just such a waste of space
Omg I am actually crying laughing at this bc my friend said those exact words to me the other day, like word for word. I’m 100% w both of you
She loves her money more.
Kim deffo did, she has said before she is fiscally conservative, and she is privileged enough that the social issues she supposedly cares about don't really affect her
This made me lol
Thank you. I love how all moral failings of a trans woman can be neatily explained by "male socialization" as if equally shitty conservative cishet women don't exist. They don't give a fuck about what made Caitlin into the person she is, they just want to remind us we were raised as men, we are biologically male, we will never be cis as if we can ever forget any of those things.
I agree with you. I just want to add that her public transition doesn’t erase all her prior experiences in the world when she presented as cis, even though she wasn’t ever cis.   It’s important that we can discuss that cis-presenting people often move through the world totally differently than they might post-transition without accusations of transphobia just because the wording wasn’t perfect. I don’t think anyone here thus far is being transphobic, they are perhaps not communicating their points as you’d prefer/as is ideal.   Caitlin was socialized and grew up presenting as a man, and that led her to certain mindsets and privileges that she might not have ever experienced had she transitioned early or been born a cis woman.
It’s also super easy to just say “she shares the same values as a republican man” or even just “her values didn’t change”.  To the people being offended when this gets called out, those types of comments make transphobic people feel justified in their hate. They see those comments and read “yes this person agrees with me” and it makes them feel like their hate is being supported.
I thought that too.
me?

Just a ridiculous human being.
Interesting point - I hadn't thought of it like that.  She definitely exhibits wealthy/white/male level of privilege and doesn't have the intellect to explore anything different.  So true.
wow , this right here
"Good looking woman" uhm not sure who can 100% agree with that. You are correct about everything else.  I truly do not understand how she can be part of the LGBQT+ community & yet be against it. She truly has no idea what it is like to be trans. I mean neither do I but I am assuming it is definately not easy.  I know a gay man from Texas who was hard core Trump as well as Republican. I never understood how he could follow someone who was so against the LGBQT+ community.
She has lived her entire life as one of the highest level of privilege. A wealthy, celebrated athlete. She has no sense of reality or humility.
Let's not pin this one on being a woman. The ingrained misogyny is real if we're blaming women for this
Okay, Caitlyn doesn't know what it's really like to be a cisgendered woman.
Not to mention “inside she’s a man”. No, inside she is a woman. Period. I hate her as much as anyone else but the transphobia in these comments is not cool.
Nah, this isn’t about being trans. It’s about Caitlyn being a misogynist. That isn’t transphobic.
I am so sick of this shit, can't even turn my brain off to read some gossip without seeing a bunch of transphobic bulshit being highly upvoted.
Come on man, you know that’s not what they meant.
Is it controversial to acknowledge that Caitlyn was raised and socialized as a rich white man? I thought that was the point of the comment.
>Please check the transphobic language in your comment. Caitlyn is a woman. Would you say a cis woman is a “rich white man” on the inside? There are plenty of awful republican cis women out there.

And this cuntbag shouldn’t be an excuse for being transphobic.   You can't use the word "cuntbag" as a slur and then tell everyone to check *their* language.
I dont even know what cis mean but you didnt get the point babe
Why be transphobic though? All that does is make transphobs reading the comments feel justified in their hate.   Your personal views aren’t tied to a name given to you at birth, they are tied to the person. She transitioned and her views stayed the same. Which makes sense because transitioning doesn’t change who you are inside.
No. Caitlyn is a piece of shit, but that is not a reason to discredit her as a trans woman and deadname her. Her values have nothing to do with her name. Just like there are cis women who are misogynists, gay people who are homophobic, and POC who are racist. Caitlyn is a trans woman who is transphobic (and everything else mentioned tbh). No reason to stoop to her level.

The values and ideas of what matters in this family are so fucked up.
Kim has rubbish politics....but she almost certainly did not vote for Trump  https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2016/09/kim-kardashian-voting-for-hillary-clinton  https://www.buzzfeed.com/elliewoodward/kim-kardashian-confirm-voted-biden-after-trump-speculation
She’s literally a terrible human
She is a horrible person but that doesn't justify misgendering her.
????
I mean passing socially as a woman. I think Caitlyn is an evil asshole but I can’t deny that she transitioned well and looks decent for a 73 year old woman.
I'm not exactly pinning it on being just being a woman. The reality of the situation is that she is a privileged rich white woman who has really not faced much prejudice as if she would if she was a regular--not famous Olympic Winner and Reality TV star--person of color.   To deny that she has White Privilege, which white woman do have, especially rich ones, is ridiculous. That's where my commentary is coming from.
I'm not transphobic okay, I fully support everyone struggling with their identity and other things, I believe we all deserve to be happy and loved.
Caitlyn is here showing exactly who Caitlyn is inside - tell me what makes her a woman inside. Serious question
As a trans person I can make that decision for myself and the language used is major terf  territory. Being transphobic toward people you don’t like doesn’t make it not transphobic. And I don’t think oc is a transphobe but their comments are not progressive.
Its dumb tho plenty of cis white dudes are liberals and plenty of poc are conservatives lol this is getting old
No not at all but there is a difference between sex and gender so using the appropriate terminology is important for trans people.
>Your personal views aren’t tied to a name given to you at birth, they are tied to the person. She transitioned and her views stayed the same. Which makes sense because transitioning doesn’t change who you are inside.  That's literally what they said? That her values are still the same lol y'all are really reaching here
I don’t think they’re deadnaming her. They’re pointing out that her values have not changed from the person she presented as pre-transition.
Pack it up and go home with your misguided virtue signaling. Dead naming refers to the practice of denying trans ppl's chosen identity, to taunt, attack, and bully them by using their former name. That intention is not apparent in the previous comment in referring to Bruce Jenner. Dead naming doesn't just simply mean mentioning the former name--it's not a 'banned' name to never ever be uttered like Voldemort ok. Context matters. Being trigger happy and assuming bad intentions in others is easy but slowing down and thinking things through critically is harder.
So fucked up. I can’t even wrap my brain around giving a fuck about most things they care about.
Ah cool, thanks for the source!
So much of her fanbase and customers are black people (I would honestly guess they take a lot more than 50%)... and you think Kim, whose entire money comes from her public image, would say publicly that she voted for Trump ? Like what ? Also she’s extremely close with Ivanka and Trump called her her friend and helped her on her prison reform PR journey... I have a hunch he wouldn’t do that if she didn’t support him, since he’s a big manchild and all that. Half of the people on this sub needs to learn to be a little more suspicious and lot less naive in my humble opinion but 🤷‍♀️
Oops - that definitely was just an accident.  I'll fix now.
Agree she has white privilege and wealth - didn't deny that
I didn’t think you were, just wanted to offer info. The way that info is getting downvoted, however, tells me a lot about this sub.
I’m not trying to make the decision for you. I’m pointing out my perspective.   Being rabidly anti-TER myself (I drop the F because they are not feminists) none of this sounds like Terf shit to me. It sounds like people who don’t know the proper way to discuss the issue.  Like all of us, Caitlyn is the sum of her experiences. In her particular situation, she didn’t come out as trans until she had lived quite a long life being perceived as cis. She doesn’t seem to have the interest in getting past the many issues she has as woman who was socialized as a man. I can see how that would be incredibly damaging to a woman and it seems like her emotional IQ is too low to understand she probably has been deeply harmed by transphobia and is exacting that harm on others. She’s clearly got some deep issues and I don’t see it as transphobic to point out that her experiences being seen/perceived as male before she came out are a big contributing factor.
Why does their comment have to be progressive?
I was clarifying my initial comment, seeing as you thought I was blaming it solely on her being woman, which is not the case.    She wouldn't garner so much support from the Right if she wasn't an outspoken Right-Winged Republican who is Anti-LGBTQ+ community. They tolerate her because she has the same ideology as them, I highly doubt they would if she was a Leftist or a Liberal. And for those very reasons, she does not garner so much prejudice against her because she is a rich, Right-Winged white woman.
"The most"... 😭 Posting a picture. Sorry to break it to you but she’s doing what her audience wants her to do and that’s what she always do: her husband publicly praised Trump and they were all speculating about Kim’s politic views after that and her fanbase wasn’t happy at all, what choice did she have except saying that she didn’t share his opinions. Even Kanye said it, when he said shit like that his wife called him crying and saying that they were "going to lose it all". She knows perfectly well what her audience expects of her.    She doesn’t "know" Ivanka, she invited her and her husband at her house multiple time for holidays and intimate dinners when there’s only the three of them when Kanye and her were not together anymore. She went to have private dinners at her house and go to the restaurant with her. They’re friends. When was Kim ever friends with Hillary and Chelsea ? She went on her show once because the Disney executives arranged it. It’s not at all the same thing  Anyone who don’t realize that she didn’t vote for Trump, knowing what she stood for this past decade, knowing the smaller-scale politicians she publicly supported, knowing her husband and every single one of her best friend’s views... is delusional. It’s honestly scary that people can be so naive and duped because she posted a picture and a statement about "Kanye’s views causing issues in the marriage". Especially since they lied to the public an astronomical amount of times before. But sure, trust them
Okay, if you say so... she would have no reason to lie about not voting for Trump, none. Therefore we should believe whatever she said when everything she says and do points out to the fact that she shares the same values and opinion as Ivanka and Donald Trump... sure sure sure. Believe whatever you want, I don’t care if you want to refuse to see things for what they are even if it’s right in front for your eyes and if you want to trust everything anyone, even known liars, says like a 12 years old. It’s kinda scary for you, but that’s definitely not my problem. I already responded to your comments and I don’t have the energy to keep going in circles about this particular issue. I have not a doubt in my mind she supported Trump this whole time, but you do you
Literally, no ? It’s based ln everything we know about her from the last 10 years. You know full well that I never said "boohoo she was photographed with Ivanka so she must vote Trump". Like I said, it doesn’t matter. I already said everything there was to say about that, I’m tired about this little exchange that is obviously running in circles but you keep asking me the same questions that you already asked and that I already responded to... 🤷‍♀️
ughh i miss the realness of e!, disney owns them now so all their swearing episodes are probably wiped from the face of the earth and 👹🐭pUt iN tHe vAuLt🐭👹
The main difference from the Hulu show n e show that on e they bleeped out the word shit but it’s not bleeped out on Hulu. They bleep out fuck. On e, they didn’t bleep out the r word or the word pussy n dick. But they bleeped out cock. They keep in words like damn, bitch, ass etc.
Anytime I ever watched reality TV on E here in the states they always bleeped the swear words. I’ve been watching the channel off and on since it began. I’m 43.
Doesn’t NBCUniversal own the episodes from the original show & disney/hulu just has the new ones? All the old episodes are on peacock. Also, they curse on hulu.
So on Hulu do they bleep the word Fuck or no?
yeah on cable they definitely censored it but the episodes were released uncensored how they were originally recorded elsewhere. now that its up to disney, they only publicly release the fully censored and edited episodes.
On Hulu, they bleep the word fuck
Ugh!  Is there anywhere it’s aired that they don’t bleep it?
Idk
It’s crazy that America censors so much.
So they sold us a “lol we eloped in Vegas last minute drunk decision”…but they had the Hulu team filming…
why’s she kneeling in the car
Long hair Kourtney>>>>>>  https://i.redd.it/i618jwnth2sa1.gif
Hahahaha is he just tapping her head while she's vomiting in the back of a car 🤣 if this ain't the 'there there' tap your partner gives you after you made every wrong decision they told you not to make I don't know what else is 🤣   Also kind of want travis' jacked would go well with my fuck off t shirt
Hot slob kebab! Lmao  Also I’ve never thought she and Kendall resembled each other, but I fully thought that third pic was Kendall.
I love how much fun she seems to have w him!
When we get this footage on Hulu>>>>  https://i.redd.it/jj90tgezh2sa1.gif
I love seeing Kourtney happy.
Kourtney has a beautiful and genuine smile
Wow 3 is a normal photo!!!
They’re so cute in these photos  https://i.redd.it/l06k3e4qh2sa1.gif
she looks gorgeous
Refreshing to not see his hands all over her ass
He just seems sooo..  I don't know 🤔  no personality ?
Why does she become her current man?
Imagine being in your 40s and changing your whole wardrobe to match your husbands. Soooo embarrassing.
I love them. Kourt will forever be my fave and I love seeing her happy and thriving
God I just don’t care about these two anymore. It’s the same shit different day
I‘m starting to find this weddings annoying.
Is she wearing a wig? I thought she was rocking the shirt blonde hair right now.
Being sh\*tfaced drunk while getting married in Vegas in your 40s <<<<
Commas are our friends. Please add one, Travis. This is driving me nuts.
She got her ass up and worked 👏
Did she have them filming? On the last season the producers said “wait you got married and didn’t tell us?”
In the caption she says she’s about to vomit
i feel like she was either hiding from paparazzi or just in a silly goofy mood and wanted to sit on the floor of the car
Pretty sure all my husband did for me when I was dry heaving in Vegas was a suck it up buttercup.. definitely been there
Flare checking in
Agreed, I usually find them a bit over the top but these are adorable
Men need to be accessories that’s why we love Corey.
What’s everyone problem with this😭 she’s still kourtney
These are old photos from their wedding in Vegas ~last year
I do lowkey find it hilarious she’s getting a special/her own show out of it. Especially after all the fighting between her and Kim about not filming.
I mean the footages from the trailer seems high quality…
If you’re about to hurl, then sitting backwards in a moving vehicle ain’t the way to go! Lol
I haven’t seen the caption, but that was my initial interpretation
Her caption says she was trying not to throw up lol
Right like maybe she’s always wanted this look but wasn’t comfortable enough to pull it off until she had a guy who compliments her style. Negative people will always be negative.
She threw away her whole identity to be an aging rockstars wife for a couple years. Guarantee when they break up that all the leather and black will go.
Ahhhh makes way more sense. Thank you.
Wait what?  She is getting her own special/series?  When did this happen?  I am sad I do not have Hulu anymore so I cannot wven watch the new season 😔
I wonder if she had her own team perhaps because they’d want it filmed no matter what
Oh! I didn’t even remember about the trailer 💀
I don’t think clothes are what makes up a person’s identity. I can’t hate her for raiding his wardrobe for comfy t shirts. I do the same with my man when I want to be extra cozy. I also don’t think there’s anything wrong with experimenting with different styles, no matter the age.
I agree it's silly to give up an identity for a partner, but let's not pretend this is the first time she's done this. She dressed just as much to match Scott and Younes. The only reason people are mad about this one is because they don't like it personally.
Yea maybe we just see her in different lights but she’s the same girl to me, her aesthetic is just different
She’s releasing something with Hulu for her 3 weddings she had to Travis, idk if it’s a short limited one off series (seems most likely will be this) or if she might try and spin it into a show.
Interesting I had no idea about this. I am guessing they already had previews of it?
[I believe so, here’s more info](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2023/04/04/entertainment/kourtney-kardashian-travis-barker-wedding-special/index.html)
Ah ok thanks for the link!  I had not heard about any of this.
Her mouth and the way she talks reminds me of an elder woman
The fact she’s bad-mouthing Kourtney to Mason is shitty. I had an aunt who did that to her sister ( my other aunt) and spoke badly about her sister all the time infront of her kid, even though my other aunt was never there to defend herself. Do you know what happened? My cousin, the daughter of the sister who had been disrespected many times, started calling her mum's name and disrespecting her mum.   To this day, even at an older age, that cousin still disrespects her mum. It’s sad asf. Don’t do this if you have something to say, Kim; tell it to your sister, not her kids.
Alright, vent to Khloe but don’t slag off a kids mum to their face, Kim is something else… no wonder Kourt has gone full idgaf
I dont blame kourtney for wanting to get off the phone lol
I can't hear anything she's saying because she's smacking her lips! I hate that sound 🤦🏻‍♀️ Is she even eating?
I’m confused. She said she “called mom” but then at the end she said “that’s my sister Kim.” So was she talking to Kris or kourtney?
That’s one thing I’m glad the adults in my family never did, is involve the children in their petty little squabbles. Granted, this is super petty and could be worse but why even put your nephew in the position of feeling like he had to defend his mother? Kids are naturally protective of their moms and hearing anyone say anything negative about them is probably not a good feeling
Bruh my mom has a lot of mental illnesses people used to do this to me about her all the time. So immature
Kim is such a mean girl. I love how most people are taking kourtneys side over this
I mean she is also being a hypocrite and talking bad about family and even worse, about Kourtney to her own kids. Ask them to leave and vent to your sidekick
I truly think this was the start of the era where Kourts whole existence just pissed Kim off and it only got worse, she could breathe and Kim would be like ‘omg Kourt is acting like a total psychopath’. Then that fist fight kinda sealed the deal on them never getting close again.
What a nasty human. It's bad enough these kids' lives are public and have major scrutiny at all time, and now their own aunt badmouths their Mum to them. Can't be the first time this has happened, and Khloe seems totally okay with it too.
Who does that lmao ? She’s literally a crazy person. The only reason it’s not obvious to all the viewers is because she disguise herself as this ultra rich super successful person, so people think she must be doing something right and that she’s somehow an aspiring girl boss, but she’s literally just a crazy person with a TV show and a mom that makes her mom come true. Also it reminds me of that time in season 1 of the new show where she tells Reign "Don’t tell your dad we had a family gathering without him". Like I said, insane behavior
Entering my Kourtney Stan era because of this  https://i.redd.it/i9ozf547g2sa1.gif
🗑️ 🗑️ 🗑️
It irks me when she does that thing where she keeps licking her teeth geez  Also she said she called her mother but then said the person said that’s my sister?? Definitely a made up story lmao 😂 the math ain’t mathing.
Off topic but I’ve always thought her hair looked so cute here… how do I get my messy bun like this lmao
Yes triangulation with a literal child is so healthy. Guess Kim doesn’t need therapy like the rest of us
That was horrible of Kourtney but Kim telling this to Mason is so wrong!
maybe my family’s just dysfunctional as hell cause all my aunts and my mom did this to each other all the time and we never gave af 💀
Idk I think kourtney kind of deserved this lol
Agree, I just watched it without sound and all I saw was…  ![gif](giphy|MBmmg8fjYi5omZn1FQ)
It was bugging me watching her mouth move 😂
It’s the upper lift lip
It’s not shitty, it’s jaw-droppingly insane. Kim is literally acting like a crazy person
My dad’s side of the family growing up did that about my mom. They hated my mom so much…like, on some jealousy shit. Between my brother, sister, and I—my brother and I were a lot closer to our mom than our sister (understandably, mind you, my sister and my mom didn’t get along) and for that reason, my aunts and uncles were quite cold to my brother and I. I also look like my mom a lot which lead to a lot of body shaming (namely by my aunts). Now that I’m typing this out, I’m really seeing how much this fucked with me emotionally. They would call me stupid and say that I only like my mom because she “buys me things.” Like, imagine being a kid and thinking that you’re not good enough because you have a relationship with your mom? They also put my sister on a pedestal because she and my mom didn’t get along. Needless to say, all 3 of us stopped communicating with them when we got older.
[removed]
Also what was she supposed to say. Sorry Kim was sharing something deeply personal so she wouldn’t get off. It’s the best way to avoid extra questions to act like it was a phone call about nothing after she heard her say she wanted to be private
Hate when people do that. It’s like nails on chalkboard
She’s saying she “called mom” to mason, (Kim called Kourtney, Masons mother) and “that’s my sister Kim” was said by Kourtney
Yessssssss!!!!
![gif](giphy|73Lz4TMG39m2e5yshT|downsized)
![gif](giphy|3ohjVazBFR12PCzk3e|downsized)
She’s talking to Mason. Her sister is Masons mother.
Agree. Not sure why people aren’t seeing it from Kim’s POV also lol

I’m really sorry you went through that. It’s beyond fucked up of family to do that, especially to speak so ill of your mother.

That’s I really good point! I didn’t even think of that, kourtney could have been trying to kind of protect kim’s privacy.
Ohhh I see, didn’t realize she was talking to Mason.
The excuses for Kourtney are something else. They all can be mean but she is definitely the meanest at this point in their lives.
Me too. I was super confused. What gives her the right to bad mouth Kourtney in front of Mason?
Yeah…Kourt’s said some mean shit herself. None of them are innocent, but not holding her accountable just because they think she’s funny is ridic
Yeah so inappropriate.
If she wants to cause a stir, Anti-Hero by Taylor Swift lol
If she does Jam I will actually be so happy!! That would be hilarious and iconic

She’ll lip sync her rap from her SNL skit
Maybe something from Jennifer Lopez because they've done cross promotion before? There's also the new Megan Trainor song that has the video with Kris in it, which would make sense (I am your mother).
More M's drake 21 savage ( she is mentioned song)  Bound 2 ( for Bianca)
The thong song
Jam for sure
Maybe a Brandy song 💀
Forgot the name but paris Hilton's song about her ass lol
Pete Davidson - Ariana Grande
Innocent by Taylor Swift  Bad Blood by Taylor Swift  Vigilante Shit by Taylor Swift   Closest she's getting to the eras tour
Vigilante sh*t
Conceited- Remy Ma
She posted a pic of a car radio playing Celine Dion the day they filmed it, can’t remember exactly which song it was posted here
THIS GIF LMAOsnkajsjsjs
I want to take my horse to the old town road
This is definitely one of the oddest couples right now, it’s up there with Kim and Pete.
They are serious! He's riding Arizona. Her horse!!      I only allowed my ex bf to keep my dog ​​on a leash after months of dating.   I'm kidding... No, not really.
Maybe she’s actually his trainer for his leading role in the upcoming Marvel “El Muerto”
I wonder what she calls him lol BEn Benitoooo ?
This is very cute and it’s making me feel so single 😭
Arizona on old town road
Is it just me or is his sitting posture off in the first photo? Looks like his legs are super far forward or something.
Aaaaaa so that's their mutual passion
If this was an actual pr stunt theyd get better pics than this
Ok. This is cute.
That’s so exciting! To share something you love so deeply with someone is big 🥹
Go Benny Go! You are doing amazing sweetie
He is holding those reins entirely too tight.
Awe, he's sprung  ![gif](giphy|EFX1CBN5vCJ1K)
WOW! This is adorable. They really are dating. The tea sites said they are a PR stunt. Looks real to me. Spending time with her horses!
Bad bunny could do better than a pencil. She looks like one and has a personality of one. She so yawn 🥱
riiiiiiide till i can’t no more
Id like to think if Kendall had children Bad Bunny wouldnt tattoo her kids names on himself like that other dumbass
And she's filming it.
I don't just introduce anyone to my cat! (More-so because she is judgy AF, not that I think she'll form emotional bonds with the dudes)
People swear this is a PR relationship but I don’t think it is tbh
benny and kenny
I think it’s an optical illusion with the TMZ watermark, but his posture is definitely not great.

It’s funny when men always call the women a hoe when they stan rappers and ballers who pride themselves in sleeping with multiple women while they have girlfriends/wives  like … it’s only okay when men want to be “hoes” to them
They hated her when she was w Booker, they hate her when she moves on. Kinda seems like they might just hate women
Lol ya an adult single woman on a date = hoe to them
https://preview.redd.it/ieid2vxy5yra1.jpeg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=115564a3c12bd470826a601581169a4d57db36c3
Bad Bunny has cheated in all of his previous relationships, has a song saying he has multiple girlfriends, he even diss their favorite player Devon Booker saying he’s the hottest Kendall has been with. But these dummies only come at Kendall? Misogyny has always been so loud
As if this sub is any better
Lol they hated her for affecting his performance while they dated now they hate her because they're no longer dating and she's single going out with another guy
People use the term "hoe" to loosely
I know lori Harvey been in their ears for sure lol
So dating someone else after you break up with your first partner *still* makes you a hoe? There’s no winning.
They are the last fan base that needs to call anyone a hoe with the stories out there about Chris Paul, durant and booker. On another note, both sides of this are hilarious, booker stans swear Kendall is trying to make him jealous and he moved on to some one better in that IG model Jamila whilst Kendall stans are bragging about her moving on and bagging the most famous star out right now. It’s gonna be hilarious when her and booker get back in the summer, especially if the suns win a chip and he gets a signature shoe from Nike.
they’re just mad they can’t have her
Not y’all gatekeeping hating the Kardashians
This is literally how everyone outside of fans (which isn’t many people) see all of the Kardashians.
He's riding bitch 😂
This is the dom and sub in them coming to fruition
Candle is a shovel
Yeah especially with the stories out there about Booker.
A hoe is a woman a man is mad he can't have access to nor afford. Dassit. Notice how it's never their mothers even if she meets their definition. Hypocritical sexually frustrated idiots.
/r/nba fans are laughably naive. they legitimately believe players like lebron and curry have never stepped out on their wives lol
Move over, *Everybody Hates Chris*.  It’s time for, *Everybody Hates Kendall*.
That sub is flooded with incels. So yes I agree and this doesn’t surprise me at all
Yep, Barrett Pall did a TikTok about this subject. Most “straight” men are just attracted to female anatomy. However if they could, they’d just date and marry other men.   He even had a stitched video where this one old white man was asking for another man to marry him just so they could get the benefits of being a couple but the guy could “have sex with as many women as he wanted”, but he wanted two incomes and two men providing for the house.   Sounds about right. These men seek validation from other men so bad.
“How dare she not be miserably waiting for my goat while he gets with every women possible” - some insecure male fan.  We talk alot about parasocial relationships of stans in other fields, but sport fan act super weird with their athletes idoles or the ones they hate. Every ex is a hoe, they using wags as accolades to compare players etc
I forgot about this tweet…… 😭
this tweet always cracks me up. good for her.
Period
Lol honestly. Like I’ve seen a lot of slut shaming remarks about her and yet when other celebs do it ppl are like “good for her”. Case in point emrata.
Fr the high horse and double standards 🙄 like bitch be fucking for real
Right they should be using “ho”
Lori probably studied by many Hollywood women haha
I mean i honestly believe Benito is her rebound and a “fuck you for forgetting I’m THAT GIRL” to Booker who probably got too comfortable/lazy in the relationship. She’s probably livid that she was all over him during the last months of the relationship and it didn’t led to anything more serious. So she’s like “look who i can bag, have after you”. I mean she’s the one still liking stuff about him and she didn’t tell her family or friends to cut him off (like she did for Ben)  We don’t know if he’s actually seeing that Jamilla although in her likes. I saw that DeuxMoi said Ashley Moore was at his game (embarrassing for him with the way she acting for Ben Simmons after him).  I don’t think they’ll get back together tho. He has an ego and her being out there with Benito definitely would not sit right with his Athlete ego
What?! Pleeeeease don’t tell me Chris Paul is terrible. I don’t want to believe it 😩
So its ok to slut shame because its Kardashians ?
Everytime you comment its to shit on Booker.  If you are a Mavs fans you should focus on the collapse of your whack ass team that will not even make the Play In as we speak.  Suns are favourite to win. I’m saving this comment because you will look extremely dumb pass first round.   You clearly have the basketball take level of some 12yo
Lol whenever I see the term "goat" now I always think of a tt I saw saying that it's the straight guy version of "mother"😂
I hate the term wag
Your flair 🤌
Right but they are basically in the same age group and  cliques. They take notes from everyone.
[removed]
I never said that. It’s not but that’s the reputation they’ve built.
Swag was straight for “work!”
This is extremely accurate ! And “tough 😤” is just the straight “Slay 💅”

It’s called dating as an adult my dear. Sorry you can’t pull
Would that make rizz straight for serving cunt
Yes omfg 😭
Omg this feels like forever ago
Feel like this could have been the season finale for the previous season instead.
Say what you want. But Im happy for Kourt. After all her tumultuous and abusive years with Scott, I've been hoping Kourt found some love and happiness. Scott drained the life out of her.   She has also never been married before in her life, and this makes it extra special. Those that know, know.
I’m honestly just glad they’re doing this as a separate special instead of dragging it out through 4 episodes of the next season like they did with their wedding outfit fittings
Honestly, I am so happy for her. It was crazy that she was the firstborn and hadn’t ever got married.    Not that marriage is everything, but I am seriously happy for her. Considering she experienced the breakdown of her parents and I also believe that’s one of the reasons why she’s always been hesitant about marriage. I am glad she’s happy to look at her smile. Travis, at least is making her smile and that’s all that matters.
Our wedding felt like time didn't exist🥺
The timing and rollout of this in connection with the new season is weird
honestly excited idk  https://preview.redd.it/4nubetgv4yra1.jpeg?width=554&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=367cc2b95a00430f746d87b042978507a668db46
Gahhhh I'm so torn. I fast forward through the Kourt and Trav parts of the Hulu show due to the ick and the bore of it all, but I am so happy she's finally happy.   Who am I kidding, I watched the entire bit of Kylie and Kris going to a fucking car wash Im going to watch this stupid wedding special with her multiple ugly (imo) dresses. 😭
Happy for her but this feels like old news at this point lol
Such a weird couple
Was the timing so off in the older seasons/previous show too ? I feel like they didn’t use to address storylines so long after the fact. This wedding seems so long ago to me, I literally could not care less to watch this.
Kourtney and Scott’s tumultuous relationship was the main storyline for so many seasons, so I’m happy to see them actually focus on her healthy relationship
Aaaaaah I feel so happy for Kourt. She did not deserve being cheated on by a raging Scott so many times
Ngl I was tearing up but then they reminded me Dominico Dolce was involved and it threw me off 🫠
this is sweet. their wedding planning episode bored me off completing season 2 of the hulu show but i’m definitely interested to see this special, i hope it’s actually more behind the scenes stuff and not just them in bed talking about it
Happy for Kourtney but I have to say this: This family is built so different. You won't write a book detailing how much you found my sister Kim so sexually attractive years ago then turn around and now I'm the love of your life. I'd have to literally be a crackhead 😭
Omggg her boobs,,,;,Kourtney looks AMAZING. I’m truly happy for her. We SAW her arc in real time and it gives me a lot of hope for myself (also the scapegoat first daughter of a psycho narcissist).
Still in love with kourts wedding look. The hair looked so stunning on her and I love the short dress with the long veil.
This trailer is so sweet. It’s so nice to see Kourtney so happy and giddy
I am going to get downvoted but i LOVED the derss.It was perfect 80’s rock guns’n roses dress and the corset part actually fit with the theme.Here on reddit we support everyone and everyone’s style even if it is a costume wedding,but when a celebrity does it no one likes it.I always thought Kourtney had that rock chic vibe,she started ti dress like that before kim,i know because i followed and loved her style but soon after kim got with kanye and it became a thkng like kanye changed the fashion..
Honestly, this is cute. I don't care if it's mildly boring. I will watch.  Love their love.❤️‍🔥
i bet it’s just gonna be like that one video called  [you](https://youtu.be/eoCam-Us_pg)
Yknow what…the wedding look is growing on me, like with the veil, it’s kinda stunning, ik i was a hater at first but i can admit it’s kinda cute now I guess
Omg yay 45 mins + of watching them make out and say sexual innuendo
I’m happy for them but I don’t think I could sit through them slobbing each other down for an entire special. That table scene in D&G is permanently etched into my memory
Kourt deserves her happy ending and I’m truly so so happy for her.   On the contrary, her dress fucking kills me. It is *so goddamn ugly*
Awww, so sweet! I will be watching
This is weird tbh. They got married almost a year ago. To have us wait ALMOST a year to see the wedding is crazy. No one even cares about the it anymore.. and I don't mean this in a bad way. Just that they got married so long ago, we're not even that interested in the BTS or wedding stuff anymore. This should've been the finale for season 2. To air the wedding episode a year after the wedding is just bizarre.
I just don't want to watch a recap of things we've already seen on every single platform
I’m soooooo happy they’re doing this little special for them! Kourtney deserves this moment 🥹☺️
it happened 11 months ago. We've moved on.
Why do we care now???????
Yay I’m so excited, with all the trash we talk here I still like the show and I’ve been in a tv rut these days
Didn’t we already see this? Hulu needs to get its shit together, this was over a year ago and we already followed them around Italy.
Wasn't til death do us part a reality show on MTV in the 90s with like Chris what's his name and and what's her face
The whole aesthetic is corny as fuck 😭
I thought this was a parody voiceover 😭😭😭😭 ‘it was like picking a favourite child’ 😂😂😂😂
It’s been so long…. And looks boring. Somehow I don’t give a shit to watch now.
They make me want to gag
Ehhhh I always fast forward their parts on the show
![gif](giphy|l3q2Hy66w1hpDSWUE|downsized)  I'm already falling asleep
Him rubbing her tummy is so gross.
Where do I even find Hulu? I haven't watched anything they put out since they went to that platform cuz I'm not going to pay just to watch them and it not have any other good shows. Is it worth purchasing?
All right I wanna watch this. (Sigh) Time to get hulu again
i would have been excited to watch but it happened almost a year ago... the momentum is gone
They’re so boring idk  https://i.redd.it/zab40tikzxra1.gif
I personally want to see a special on KimYe, Travis and Kylie, Khloe going back with Tristan and Kendall’s BF drama. Had enough of Kravis making out on the show.
That dress🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢
I’m actually so happy for her , she deserves a bit of happiness and attention to herself without sharing it with her sisters and family 💖  ![gif](giphy|eM16dA4eiatuyUs3rA|downsized)
They better not show Booker’s face on this shit show. Hope the cameras avoid him or the prod blurry his face

God I’m bored already
OK but did mgk perform? I'll have to watch just to see that.
I’ll never get over how disappointing the Italy wedding dress was. The Santa Barbara dress was better
i was wondering the same and looked it up. they got married (italy ceremony) may 22, 2022, so they’re just now releasing this after almost a year; the other ceremonies were before italy. this should’ve been last season.
Dude I was a huge participant on this sub, then got bored of the Kardashians once the season ended and hardly any gossip came out. I switched my unhealthy redditing to the Idaho murders in November, carried through until the gag order a couple of months ago, and then Tom cheated on Ariana. Scandoval took over every thought I had for a month straight. Now everyone on Bravo is on their own hush-hush gag order, so I checked this sub for a little sample of the old drama gossip I crave.  Except apparently this storyline is two years behind. I’m in my own personal limbo.
I know right? I was just thinking the same thing
Yes, this is so boring to now be seeing
It does! I hope we get to see them exchange their vows in their entirety 💕
Yeah but I think this is a good play because they know not everyone is really into the whole Kourtney barker thing
I’d straight up forgotten she wasn’t married before Travis til I saw this vid for some reason. PDA and all, they are insanely fucking cute together
There’s always someone who’s going to say some shit. One thing about marriage is that I cherish them, and it took her ages and the person she thought was right for her to get here.
Same :) I love those two together, and just happy at least one of the sisters seems to have found a good guy
I echo your sentiments. I always root for her happiness ❤️
Honestly when it's right it's just right and it's so different to anything else
Same and I have always loved Travis
I think we all are happy for her, and their making out was cute in the beginning, before it became uncomfortable and plain rude to others. It’s disrespectful when you are having a conversation and these two start sticking their tongue and touching private parts.
![gif](giphy|RhS093lJ62ayjrP8nn|downsized)
Having three weddings in 2022 was pretty fucking tone deaf. Just shows how out of touch these people are with reality. But I agree that Scott was horrible and am happy that Kourtney found someone who treats her right. Their constant pda grossed me out though especially all the foot stuff. Imagine being one of their kids and seeing that stuff online? I would be mortified.
That just made me realize that until this wedding, there had been 4 weddings between the 6 karjenner kids, 3 of which were Kim's. And despite those 4 weddings, plus Kris' two, at the time of this wedding, none of them were married. That kinda makes mee root for the barkers even more.  ETA that ALL of them had children out of wedlock (except Kendall... For now), and Kim is the only one who had any while married. Out of the 12 grandkids, only 3 were born to married parents! Not that I give a shit, but that's not very super christian of them.
Right! Especially as they showed the run up to the wedding & kourt getting fitted for her dress sooooo long ago in the previous season. Would have made sense for the wedding to be the big season finale.
💀 the Kevin Hart pics always fit exactly what you say so effortlessly lol
I’m gonna watch this shit out of this joyfully
i was wondering the same thing cause the new show seems so behind in timing
The whole entire family now works with Dolce. 😖🥲 We better get used to it.
Yeah. But they don't seem fazed and disturbed by that kind of stuff as much as we are lol.   Remember that song Kanye did about all of the sisters ??  " You got a sister in law you would smash? I got four of them" ...... 🤢  I wouldn't have felt right knowing my whole husband just admitted that  😭
I liked it too. Would I have picked it? No, but I think her veil was genuinely so beautiful, and she definitely gave us most interesting to look at.
Imho the guns n roses dress was iconic and doesn’t really look that similar to kourt’s. Gwen Stefani’s wedding dress resembled it more closely. The only similarity is length and even then the November rain dress is a mullet dress and not tight fitting
Agreed
I didn’t know I needed that in my life today, but I did. And thank you.
Holy shit, that was funny..
I mean cringey to some and happy moments for others.
Carmen Electra and Dave Navarro
I feel like I vaguely remember this as well lol
Fits the wedding lol
Ps- I’m not hatin I actually love Kravis as a couple ❤️❤️+ idc what anyone says that wedding dress in Italy was 😍😍
Yes definitely worth it. So many great things to watch on hulu
Then ask Kimmy or whomever you need to fill the void to give content 😂😅
But we will be watching  https://i.redd.it/pvd6253ozxra1.gif

Nothing like going to streaming platforms to make things come out faster 🤔
I'm now in a cloverfield arg and figuring out if there is actually going to be a new film and the online campaign has started now ooooor if it's just all weird coincidence 😂 a 15 year film feels like there's more movement then this reality show 😂
Are we twins?!! If you tell me you had followed the Petito case and have ever followed the Chris/Shanann Watts murder..I’m moving in bc we’ll truly be sisters at this point! 😂💕  I’m stuck on the Stephen Smith case too no thanks to the Murdaugh trial.
just curious, what do you mean by gag order? like legally or did everyone in the community decide to stop talking about what happened?
Lol are you me? Im disturbed by how similar my recent reddit history/things occupying my brain is to yours based on this description
I could see Kourtney saying yes to this so she could be in the actual season a lot less lol
On the flip side, I'm a Kourtney fan who could do without the others, so I'm excited for this.
It’s honey moon stages everyone goes hard at first and then it quiets down.
I AGREE!! I am very happy for them but it just gets to be too much after a while. And I guess I'm not the romantic type so this doesn't really get me excited. I feel like I can already imagine what we are going to see because they have been showing us the whole time.    On the other hand I'm in FULL BLOWN menopause so everything drives me nuts and irritates me to no end 🤣
if this is going to be them making out most of the time then no thanks
😂 Nah, I'm just happy for her after all those garbage years with Scott . Kim has been married a trillion times. Kylie and Kendall....We might to have to wait a few more years for that.   Khloe, only once.   Now it's Kourts turn.🙌💞
North was born when she was married or before?
Lmao I love this
What was the season finale? Was it the Met? I remember it was dragged out over 3 or more episodes and I got bored by the end lol
I wonder if we’ve just gotten used to instant turnarounds with social media..
Didn't he do a women of the month for Kim and Kourtney too 😩🥲
Would have to divorce my sister if her husband was going around saying that kind of stuff and she was still hyping him up.
Thanks!!  I'll check it out. 🤗
Friend it’s not that deep  https://i.redd.it/eeshulqk1yra1.gif
😹😹😹
Actually I don’t normally care for true crime and the only other case I’ve sleuthed in obsessively is JonBenet. I think because I remember it happening as a kid and I still can’t make my mind up on a theory so I’ll go back to it occasionally. I don’t know why the Moscow one got me so hooked! Though I haven’t heard of most of those cases you mentioned, so maybe I’d be interested by them too. Which is your “favorite” for lack of a better word?
I was deep into the Watts murders and Gannon Stauch. Those cases stuck with me. I just could not wrap my head around the fact that two different parents just decided to murder their children seemingly out of nowhere. Wtf is going on in Colorado?
There’s a gag order in place for the Idaho murders so that no info is released from the court and the family, police, attorneys etc can’t do interviews or anything until the trial.   As for Vanderpump, I couldn’t think of what other word to use at that moment lol so it’s not really a gag order, but their contracts stop them from spilling too much about the scandal until the reunion episode airs.
Well quick glimpse at your Reddit profile and I think we could be related. I live in the Midwest, I used to watch the bachelor but haven’t since Clare/Tayshia season, and I don’t have a Great Pyrenees but I have a Newfoundland so close enough!   Now tell me, what should our brains tune to next?
Kim was still married to Humphries until just before north was born, freshly divorced at the time of arrival. So I guess to Kim's credit, all her kids were conceived while she was married - just not always with her husband.
nah, Kim wasn't married when she had North
It was an absolute snoozefest much like that entire season - Kim went to Paris to walk in the balenciaga show, Kravis had a blending family dinner and Kylie went to support Travis at a vegas awards show.
it seems to be slower than when they were E and social media was just as prevalent. maybe they just did more in those seasons?
Omg I remember that lol. He was posting nonstop Kourt pics back when he had his IG,  for that specific month 😭
![gif](giphy|l3vRi8W6uaUiDxOgM|downsized)  Also, no one said it was deep, so don't make it deep. No one else is giving.
JonBenet has me in a chokehold esp bc the perp could now be discovered thanks to the leaps and bounds scientists have made in DNA, family tree sleuthing, etc. Her father begging for gov of CO to give the OK to have the male DNA found on her jammy waistband tested but LE continues to hold reign tightly. Boggles my mind! True crime has become a passion of mine and truly began with the Chris&Shanann Watts case. How a seemingly “normal” and loving family man became a family annihilator ?! It’s a case that’s kept me up at night and pushed me to join Reddit/FB groups, follow YT creators, etc. That case, Summer Wells and Mekayla Bali are my top 3. Mekayla Bali is another one that’s kept me up late at night. Again a seemingly “normal” teenager goes missing from her Canadian province. They think she met someone online bc she spent that early morning ditching school and attempting to travel to a neighboring town. Her gma, none the wiser, arrived to pick her up from school that afternoon but Mekayla was never heard from again. There’s a large community on here that contributes to her case.
OH haha thank you! that makes sense. idk why i assumed people in those subs decided to gag order themselves lmao
Women of the month 😅
why did they use pictures of her clearly wearing makeup that doesn’t make any sense
Which is your favorite: "Like totally they are all my fav, you should defo buy them all".
I get this is how marketing works. but the idea of someone in some office getting paid to imagine a whole ass convo with Kim about moisturizer so she can keep paying for that private jet has me like  ![gif](giphy|61lMnpz0sKkpi)
Skincare can’t do what laser facials do which is what Kim and every other rich woman with perfect skin gets regularly. I wish they would stop lying.
This interview is brought to u by. ChatGPT
Just a drop of mascara you guys
This. Is. Not. Her. Face. My GOD
is this a new face or do the bangs make that big of a difference
Can so clearly see the blepharoplasty here
Didn’t she previously say she sleeps in her makeup? 😭
![gif](giphy|DPqqOywshrOqQ|downsized)
Secret #1: Be wealthy.
Whose face is this?!
This doesn’t even look like her!  ![gif](giphy|xT9KVJZFvCYEWGKHGU)
i don’t understand these campaign photos, is it supposed to be obvious that she’s wearing makeup in these pics or
Just a drop of mascara!
Pic 4 - who tf is that??
Kimberly, we know that’s not your face.  ![gif](giphy|MXoC6HvToDWLirNxBT)
I’m sorry…. Why is no one talking about her mf lips and how obvious these photos look nothing like her…..
I hate her new face
does she think customers are stupid? “barely there?” she’s wearing a full face of makeup and has photoshopped her face and there’s a blurry filter to make it look perfect
That fringe does not suit her AT. ALL.
She is literally caked in makeup what is this
Why her eyes look so different 🤨
This is bs
wow i genuinely thought this was one of those kim k lookalikes not actually her😨😨
When has Kimothy ever had a soft minimal glam day🤨
Money
That looks like one of those influencers who got fillers and whatever, and does their makeup to look like a Kardashian.
Her “barely there” make up day is like my wedding day make up.
It's giving uncanny valley
She spelled Photoshop wrong.
Wtf are these answers?? It’s like she’s repeating the question in an essay to get to 100 words
She looks completely and totally different. Like I honestly thought this was Lady Gaga with dark hair in the first pic.
That last photo 😂😂😂
Does she think we're stupid enough to not notice the obvious airbrushing + grain filter?...🤦🏻‍♀️ it's like they're doing everything to NOT be liked by the public.
Sweetie, your skin is the farthest thing from “normal”
She kind of looks like Kourtney here? That picture looks nothing like Kim lol
We literally don’t know what this woman look like. Every picture is a new person
She’s Asian now?
Okay but does anyone know what kinda of falsies I could get to get this similar look?
She actually looks pretty her g but seriously girl, seriously
I know that they’re photoshopped but even the non shopped ones she looks really good. I’ve seen skin like that on people in their late 20s. It’s prob not the skincare but she’s killing it. I’d love to see her at 60-80 she’s probably gonna be like Raquel Welch
She's looking more like her mom here. I think it's the bangs.
It looks like someone put "Kim Kardashian with minimal makeup and perfect skin" into an AI prompt. I can't put my finger on it, but this doesn't look like her at all.
She really looks like Larsa in that last pic 😬
Picture 4 really really highlights all the work she has had done. All of her features look like they don’t belong together.
I love Kim and she looks stunning, but  she forgot the Botox, lasers, ultherapy, profilho/skin booster injections, and everything else we all know she does. If regular people like us do all these things, why does she think we’re dumb enough to believe she doesn’t?   As an esthetician I believe in skincare and the science behind it, but there’s only so much topicals can do. Retinol can do a lot and sunscreen is preventative, but the smoothness you get from Botox and poreless effect it gives is something no topical ingredients can do.  I don’t get why she won’t just admit to it. The authenticity angle would give her so much more credibility with her audience.  They should’ve also used photos of her with more natural makeup on, this isn’t the vibe for a skincare photo shoot.
A full face of make up with contouring and airbrushing at that.
I was literally laughing at that so much and thinking “Kim loves to play” while reading these.
It does say it’s “how Kim’s skincare inspires a barely there makeup moment”
She considers that the "natural" look. To me natural is absolutely no make up & this would be considered light make-up.
It’s giving Chris Pratt saying you should go see the Mario movie twice before deciding how to feel about it
& Kim is who pays them too
She also forgot about that time we all saw CeraVe in her travel bag. She probably doesn't even use her own stuff 😂
Yeah my facetune subscription expired yesterday so I’m just bitter, trolling 🥲
The last picture omg idk why but she kind of looks like Megan fox now??
She looks like lady Gaga to me in pic 2!
Maybe it’s maybelline, maybe it’s photoshop lol
right?? #4 is an uncanny resemblance to kylie
can you explain how you see it? i’m curious
Just zoomed into the first photo, and you're right, I can see what looks like a scar near her eyelid crease.
And the lip lift
That was when she was promoting her make up. Now she needs a new angle 😂
I thought that was Paris?
[removed]
You do realise she’s actually half Asian?
I think the word your searching for is lie
No one needs facetune. Everyone is beautiful /s  ![gif](giphy|yNibaJbCHYV7FIF7PU|downsized)
I think she looks more like her (ex?) assistant….Tracey? I forget her name. Very pretty woman, and now Kim’s twin lol.
Bleph eyelids just look kind of half shut, as they’re designed to give more lid space it can give the appearance of tired eyes. There is also less hood so it makes them look older. Textbook bleph is Nina Dobrev. Look at her before and after. When I saw these pics of Kim I immediately thought of Nina’s eyes, to me they look strikingly similar.
No it was kim, around last summer I think? She said she gets her face done the night before and sleeps flat on her back when she has an appearance or early morning activity

Let's  not act like Kim hasn't changed her eyes....  https://preview.redd.it/wnat0zwtp2sa1.jpeg?width=2896&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8cfbcc556bb7477405bcd6d6c78d5f5e7e1cb6f3
Not sure why I’m getting downvoted for stating something that is fact.
Tracy Romulus, stop manipulating Kim to be this way!!!!!!
I’m not acting like anything. I’m the first to say Kim has changed her face. And I’m not fan of hers. Doesn’t stop the previous commenter being wrong saying “she’s Asian now?” about a person who is in fact half Asian.
Yeah... but your comment has nothing to do with how her eyes work because we all know that her eyes didn't "look Asian" before all the surgeries.   Btw, I hate saying "look Asian" because you brought it up. I'm aware that not all asians have that thin almond-shaped look.
im cryin that was all the way back in June 💀  i do not want them to reconcile
i feel so bad for scottie pippen jr
I think they support each other’s kids
If I was Kim I’d be freaked out by Larsa wanting to Single White Female me.
How ironic would it be if Kim Started dating her son. Remember Larsa said it wouldn’t really bother her when justifying her age gap with her current man
Maybe Kim looking for a date..
I guess Kanye definitely was the problem. I don’t think she hooked up with Travis or Tristan
Larsa 🤔
![gif](giphy|BW1RDc3pqXk59NDyzO|downsized)
The NBA player who used to date Larsa is now teammates with him, technically Scottie isn’t part of the team as of now, but still gotta be terrible.
This
They still aren’t close , and they fell out because Travis said she was flirting with him not that they hooked up
I think the only reason she tried hooking up with Travis was to piss them off or something but now since kylie and Travis aren’t together it doesn’t matter
this video has me in tears
i hope so!! My two worlds would collide once again (Kim at Wrestlemania 24)
People on twitter captioned it “justice for Devin Booker” 😂
Omg me too! WWE is pure camp. “You don’t wanna do this, priest!!!!!”
I think she did know how pretty she is (cause she started out super confident) but years of people absolutely shitting on you will F you up.
She really is and she has always been gorgeous but it was the public who were bad commenting about her looks.
she looked good and she was also so much fun, doing a rewatch and i’m currently on season 12 and i really miss her personality. she’s like a self conscious ball of anxiety these days
Agree, gorgeous here❤️
Slay Koko
This was her peak! Just enough work to enhance her features not destroy them. My favorite Khloe was always her transitioning to blonde era circa 2015-2016?
I can’t imagine it helps your opinion of your self to be constantly told by the people closest to you that you should lose weight or that something looks terrible on you. Or when you go to a photo shoot and the clothes either don’t fit or are way out of style because your manager WHO’S YOUR MOM didn’t even care to make sure they had appropriate, flattering clothes for you. Or that for years your referred to as the “fat one” or the “fat Kardashian sister”.  People attack Khloe constantly for changing her face and having procedures as if we didn’t watch her get treated like shit for years because of how she looks.   (Not specifically you or this post just in general).
Her best era for me i think was a little before that. I prefer her with darker hair and she was cool. I feel bad that it was a stressful time for her but she was radiant at that time (2013-2014).  https://preview.redd.it/2e5kdtdfs2sa1.jpeg?width=2896&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0cccbae73eb90d78bf268e1c8e3c69623d96e2a4  She was mostly natural too. She was gradually losing weight which made her happy. She didn't need to have anything done
I literally mourn this Khloe girls gone it’s so sad
She looks tf good 😍
Honestly I think Khloe is one of those people that simply don’t look good in photographs at all unless it’s pictures like this taken from her in movement in everyday life. When I see event pictures of Khloe she almost never looks good but when I watch videos of her she actually looks great! Some people look really good almost perfect in pictures but in real life they are just so-so. Whereas others look horrible in pictures but drop dead gorgeous in real life. Also one thing that doesn’t help Khloe is that whoever is doing her makeup for events SUCKS. Khloe looks so good when she or like Kylie does her makeup but when she has it don’t professionally for events it makes her look so much worse than she actually looks, Same with Kylie which happened as soon as she hired Ariel. Khloe looks incredible with just light makeup on but really bad with heavy makeup, because her facial structure is very strong and the heavy just does not go with it.
I know it makes me so sad 😞 she used to be so carefree but under her circumstances now, I don’t blame her
Loveeee her! Def my fave. My cancer twin ♋️
Yesss this was 2016! She looked fire
Totally agree. It's so annoying that everyone expects Khloe to be some self-love self-acceptance kween as if her appearance hasn't been under violent attack since childhood. She didn't ask to be leader of the underdogs and it's very telling that people try so hard to give her that title. (not this post in particular, but in general)
You hear me!!!!
YES! I can’t STAND HER EVENT MAKEUP they never do her justice. I feel like I’d be in shock if I saw her in real life she’s probably so pretty
yeah agreed. it’s unfortunate, i think tristan cheating while she was pregnant with true was really the straw that broke the camels back for her because she just wasn’t the same after that
Not to mention he cheated twice and had a baby on her. I’m loyal to a fault too but sometimes you have to draw a line somewhere
Kourt is literally glowing in the 10th slide
i do not remember kim looking like pics 1-5
Personally the only pic I like in all of these is the one of Kourtney. Kims body shape is so artificial it taints the shoots
I thought the sweatsuit one with Paris was clever
No Kourtney & Megan??
It’s crazy how a majority of the campaigns are just shot around her house
Out of all of these pictures, Kourtney was the most interesting to look at
It’s insane how filtered and edited the first beginning picture are. The static in certain pictures makes them almost look cartoon.
Not Kim lifelessly holding beads in 11 and 12 😂
Pretty obsessed with the fuzzy car ngl
Back when skims was apparently worth buying 😭😭😭
I bought a lot of this campaign. The robe is amazing and soft…I kinda hate that I love it haha. I think Kim is a good business woman
I was watching darcey & Stacey (tlc) last week and one of them was wearing fendixskims. Kind of forgot about the collab until then 😭
Anyone tried a SKIMS swimwear?
I hate that I have given into the (inflated) Skims hype a few times but damn if the bathin suits aren’t good shit
[removed]
Weird thought but I wonder what happened to their navel piercings
The poolside hot 80s mom one (not shown) and the dinner table one (pic 10) are so so good
She actually looked really good around this time, it’s the last year she’s got overboard with her face.
Damn, I really wish the cozy collection held up well. I still remember the feeling of taking it out of the packaging 🥰
[removed]
Pic 7 the editors were predicting the future 😂
I love this pic of her I remember seeing it and thinking wow she’s gorgeous.
She looks *so* good, and it's like she's not even trying to look good. Kim could never.
And so is Kim❤️
it’s been so long  https://preview.redd.it/yj5xh30o4xra1.jpeg?width=932&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ed662a963353fa3ba0f3d764357d30bcd73c40ed
She was an entire different race and face there
Lmfao! 2019 was an era too
https://preview.redd.it/skcj6k2tvzra1.jpeg?width=346&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fe0c746153c5754d0ffece174196067290b9669d
I hate it so much. It's so difficult to not notice the elongated bum and weird hips once you've noticed it and it tends to take away from the overall photo.  I used to love Kylie and Stassie doing bestie shoots but since noticing the BBLs and long bums, the photos don't hit the same.
That's how she saves $$$
 the grainy texture😬
Yep! Love it! I have some things I don’t like but overall, a better quality suit.

Did they have them? I thought the one Kim wore back in the day was fake. And I never knew of Kourt, Khloe, Kendall or Kylie having one?

it really was 😩
Yea 100% it’s the crazy hips for me. Can’t stop seeing wisdom tooth 🦷 body
I think it was Kim and kourt that had it but I didn’t know they were fake
The freshest part 😂
definitely not the adjective I was expecting
Lmfao this is the only time she has been dressed appropriately for an event in years
https://preview.redd.it/c2ueuqn8oxra1.jpeg?width=822&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d5a82d40c87a6fbbc5ae49fbdeac985a93432375  Kim the only person that will go kart in heels
Out for a fun day with the kids on vacation, let me slip a couple body checks in there first!
Go have fun with your kids riding go karts! Why try to make it into a sexy photo shoot?! I just imagine her kids off to the side waiting while mommy takes pictures of herself.
Beat u/somegirlontheinter AGAIN  https://i.redd.it/umblyyqjswra1.gif
I’m so goddamn tired of her Instagram posts like can she please stop posting????
I almost obsessively follow Formula 1 and thought this was posted there… I did not know it but I am so unprepared if those two worlds were to actually collide.   [Also, Lewis and Kimberly… Just decided, I ship them so hard.](https://www.instagram.com/p/CVx5k1mpH1Z/?igshid=YjNmNGQ3MDY=)
I'm really sick of her ATV/NASCAR gear aesthetic.
She always covers her butt
Her undereyes are so overfilled.
She’s looks good, I’m glad she and her kids seems to be having such a great time on vacation 😊
She dresses like this 24/7 now, so she was bound to hit a bullseye eventually.
>298 comments  I think they spend 90% of their life waiting for mommy to get her picture taken.
I’m sorry bad bunny looks so funny in that first photo with his legs hanging down lmaooo
Omg she showed him her horse. Things are getting wilddddddt
I just KNOW she's on Duolingo spanish
Lmao oh the comments are gonna be good for this one...🍿🍿🍿
The shit Arizona has heard and seen
That’s the horse she named Arizona. He will probably use it as some dumb bar in his next song
Lol why do I feel like bad bunny is pretending to care about horses so he can date kendall💀😂
The crazy horse lady in me wants to say Kenny needs to move up a bit more towards the withers because BB is sat on the horses kidneys 😳😂
What did they do, take a photo with a polaroid and take a photo of the polaroid??
![gif](giphy|Uopcf4EWixoW3QIAE6)
here before the PR relationship comments
Photos obtained by TMZ - aka PMK
I feel like this sub is comprised of either late teens or 20 something’s who have never dated someone romantically. Because the comments on this being a publicity stunt are hilarious! You know, when people like each other, they like to show and share the things they like with each other. K is showing BB her love of equestrianism. To me this is normal dating practices. Celebrities can ACTUALLY like each other.. 💀💀
Lmfao! Why is this so funny!
Honestly love how Kendall handles relationships. Gives just enough to keep us curious, but not absolutely weird about hiding it or over sharing.
Just here to watch the crazy fans melt down.
You know what? No me molesta tanto, they look happy
Such a random pairing lol but good for them🥹
“Omg he’s on a horse… with HER?! 😖 But she’s so boring and basic. Obviously a PR relationship. He could do much better than her.” - his fans right now probably
Okay but was Devin ever on her horse?
She looks genuinely happy! Never saw Devin make the effort like this
Omg some of yall are so upset about them 😭..my guess she will stay with him until coachella.   Let them have fun 🫠.
It’s giving “ I’m going to see a man about a horse “ vibes
If you grow up in Puerto Rico, you know how to ride a horse.
They’re so cute idc 🥰
Don't horses have a weight limit of like 250 pounds? This is a cute date idea, but idk I don't want any horses getting hurt
this is so cute to me lol
I wonder how the conversations between them are since he barely knows any English still. He knows it but it’s very broken so I wonder lol
Him riding horsing w candle while his ex is suing him for 40M lol, if unbothered was a person lol.
She's taking pics of them together in that second pic plus in the other pics on tmz she's doing that as well. Dare I say Kenny is a lil sprung. This might be more serious than I thought. Hope they're good for and to each other 😍
I don’t know about paps being called here, I feel like if they were there would be more pics and they would be better. These are pretty blurry
This is so quirky of him
Im guessing he was at trues birthday party ? Bc that’s the same outfit Kendall was wearing on Kylie’s TikTok or ig story whatever 👀
THIS IS SO CUTE   i love it i ship them. i dont care. also my favorite thing about the kardashians is that no matter what they will always be related somehow to other random famous people. "do you know bad bunny? oh yes, he's with kendall jenner now, right?"
So... Did y'all see that WWE slam on the table....
He looks out of place lol
He's giving ✨️Kramer✨️
I’m sorry but Bad bunny looks foolish on a horse
PR is PRing
ughhhh
Their body language says a lot I feel like they might be more than just a fling atp
Idk what’s weirder him and Kendall or Pete and Kim dating 🤣
He looks ridiculous
Who the hell wants to double up bareback. Not me and I don’t have balls to worry about.
How low of an IQ do you have to have to buy them as a couple.
I dont really know who Bad Bunny is (like I know he’s an artist and I’ve heard maybe one of his songs but didn’t really know what he looked like, his name or face whatever until recently) - with that said, for some reason this relationship just screams PR relationship to me and this comes from someone who usually don’t believe it’s a common thing in Hollywood
Him riding bitch 💀
mean nepo horse girl behavior
They're both eachother's beards. It's so obvious.
Run Benito while you still can
[removed]
Get her away from my man 🥲
Y’all no this is embarrassing
Staged.. he don’t even like coochie 😂😂😂
Of coz it’s TMZ..
Why does this look funny to me?! 😂😂
Can you imagine benito mixing with the crowd at the next karjenner kids birthday party
LOL
Wow I expected to see a lot more comments about the cell phone. IYKYK.
Right.. his feet look so tiny lol
It’s giving “I wanna goooo home”
yes & it’s so funny that he’s in back 😂
Why is this such a cute date idea though?! Not saying Devin didn’t go horse riding with her but to saddle the same horse?!! Baybayyy 😍🔥
Como se dice “horse girl”
"I'll sneak into your bed like La Llorona Take you for a ride, forget bout Arizona"... lol also haven't slept
*'Gotta new persona on my girl's horse Arizona, giddy up, giddy up'*...lol Sorry y'all, lack of sleep does some shit to your brain lol
Ey ey ey mi nueva chica la rica me llevo con la Arizonaaa después de la ronaa 🦠
She's a trophy 🏆 for him. Like winning a grammy... a long list of accomplishments he wants to check ☑️ Just like Jhay Cortez with Mia Khalifa. He said he was fulfilling the dreams of his 13 yr old self. He left the mother of his 2 boys to date Mia and show her off. His girlfriend is a really low key person that never wanted any clout, just to have her family together. They had recently bought a home, but he kicked her out. She's beautiful too.  But these idiots don't see women as humans.
Puerto Rican here. Horses and horse riding are still very much a thing in PR. You’ll see them everywhere and a lot of people still use them as means to get around. I wouldn’t be surprised if they are bonding over this and it’s actually kind of cute considering that Kendall said she should be living on a ranch somewhere and Puerto Rico is very much still “campo” in alot of areas (ranch land). They might actually have more in common that I first anticipated.
I wanna know why they’re making this PR move? I mean what for?
Ugh my thought too! Too much weight for its poor back.
I don’t know much about horses but felt bad for this horse
Omg glad I’m not the only one! Lol
Yeah, poor horse lol
![gif](giphy|PoHW4ys7G5f86UNOG2)
I mean I wouldn’t be surprised at all if it’s PR but who knows
Its obvious tho.   Kendall rides her horse every weekend and somehow now we having pictures
Whats a PMK
The twitter peeps have invaded us here
And why are we getting pics then ? I mean i think my post history speaks for itself, followed Kendall for years  , she takes her horse out all the time but now we getting pictures of it
Bold of u to call what Candle does “equestrianism”
legit so funny to me 😂
I just came to say happy cake day. I don’t care about bad bunny baby or Kenny.
Lol, don’t say that too loud or they’ll come and yell at you that she is so basic and where is Gabriela 💀💀
Almost everyone on this thread thinks it’s PR. I’m confused now 😭😭
Well, you’re right about everything, even the horse riding seems boring af
Literally yes, the horse is named Arizona.
How is this relevant ?
I forgot he was headlining! This is a huge 🏆for Kendall. Think they’ll be over before April ends as well, but hoping they prove me wrong
Horses can carry 20% of their own weight, but it also depends on the horse’s age, size, and fitness level. Not sure how much this horse weighs or anything else, so I’m not defending them or anything, but hopefully the horse’s safety & comfort was all taken into consideration first!
Not the same  https://preview.redd.it/mmal8n65rvra1.jpeg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=01959c04c10e930f9108dc64659f8c2848350c87
yeah usually when i first start dating someone i go to all their nieces birthday parties
Why is this comment so fucking funny to me I’m laughing out loud
I guess we read body language different 😭
They look awkward as fuck to me
Ok and u think you’re smarter than everyone else?
Why would they be PR tho? Like what for? If the KJs want noise, Kendall could’ve gone for another athlete
Thank you for contributing to r/KUWTK. Unfortunately your post/comment was removed for speculating on someone's sexuality.
It does look funny he’s in the back tbh. With those long legs
It's so sweet, I don't know this guy but I didn't imagine him on horseback with our gal.
I literally just picture 90 day fiance where they talk through shitty google translate and get into fights when it translates stuff wrong
LOLLL not me cracking up on the train 😭
Caballera!  She’s a fucken cowgirl, it’s those “Olympiad genes”. 😂
when i say i fucking hollered…… oh my god 😂
I’m screaming 🤣🤣
LMAOOAAOA💀💀💀
I wanna think she’s not dumb enough to not see him as a trophy too. He’s still the one out of the two that grossed me out the most (between a brat and a douche, I will always pick the brat) but part of me wonders if the last breakup was way nastier than we know and this is her going full scorched earth while having fun
This! A lot of celebrity men, mostly the ones that came from normal backgrounds see dating a Karjenner as “i made it”
It’s the other way around. He’s a trophy for her lol
Dude horses are not a method of transportation in Puerto Rico. People ride horses drunk at “el monte” on weekends and stuff like that Puerto Rico is super crowded with cars. Someone may have horses but de 💯 have a car anywhere on the Island. PS I’m a boricua living on the island.
I don't think it's a PR move (theres way too few pictures for that). I think theyre just two hot famous people hanging out and the paps keep trying to get as many photos of them as they can because bad bunny is a rising artist and kendall is one of the biggest names in fashion. Its weird, along the lines of tom hiddleston and taylor swift.
Do you think? Cause let’s be honest; Kendall is barely 100lbs. And Benito is like 150
![gif](giphy|yNibaJbCHYV7FIF7PU|downsized)
This may sound weird but I just realised how whitewashed she is in fashion editorials. Like they make her skin so much paler/whiter than it actually is irl
At this point I just assume *everything* they do on camera is PR. The make-up they “use,” the clothes they wear, the salads they shake… all working towards some sort of gain, monetary or otherwise. Nothing they do is authentic or genuine anymore.
there have been pictures of her riding her horse from paparazzi before tho
Pimp mama kris
…we are getting pictures of them because they are both very popular celebrities and they are linked platonically, romantically, maybe , perhaps they are fucking? I don’t know. Or maybe they like each other and people like you and I like to speculate and gossip about it. But it doesn’t mean that they are not dating. 🤦🏻‍♀️
because why would they take pictures of her alone with horses ? lmao now her WITH bad bunny is a different story
Oth don't let them shut you. Speak our truth
You should look up the definition. It’s not a bold assertion.
I didn’t even realize LOL thank you!!!
Lmfao it honestly could be both. There’s a good chance that they’re both aware that being seen together gives them a boost in attention. But also it’s not crazy for me to believe that they’re also just two hot single people who wanna hang out for a lil fling.   I really don’t think it’s as complicated as people want it to be lol.  They’re both hot and single so they’re down to hang out (maybe hook up) while also getting a lot of press. It’s a win win situation for everyone except his stans having a conniption over it lmfaoooo
I mean if I was having the parties they were I’m sure I’d invite my bae?!? But ain’t nobody trying to eat store bought cupcakes and watch my niece cry when we sing her happy birthday
Glad I could brighten your day 😂😅
I wanna know why they’re making this PR move? I mean what for?
Really? They look comfortable with each other to me. I thought it was cute. Y’all don’t come for me 😩
if you believe this then yes lol
But who says it’s the KJs that want noise? PR can be done for different reasons and as far as I know, could be also for Bad Bunny and not for Kendall’s team
Me either!! That’s what makes it all the more sweet bc for all we know he’s afraid of horses or not one to go riding…but that he knows HOW IMPORTANT of a hobby this is to Kendall and not only wants to join her but ride skin to skin. Love! ❤️
If they made even a single episode of that on the new Hulu season I’ll tattoo an 818 tequila bottle on my left ass cheek
The translator for Jihoon did him so dirty lol  ![gif](giphy|fSjcpjridy98hzeSyz)
There was April 1st joke advert with Duolingo
That’s my theory. I think he’s her ego boost. A “i can bag the biggest star in the world right now” type of move. I have the feeling Booker took her for granted and she didn’t like it. Benito is her power move. Her “i can have any man i want” dig to her ex
If your using a horse to get somewhere it’s considered transportation lol. My entire family lives on the island and I’m considered a part time resident. Grew up watching my neighbors taking the horses to the panaderia every morning and they still do sometimes. While I agree mostly everyone has a car, horses are still a part of Puerto Rican culture. That was my point.
Exactly. I don’t understand why EVERY couple has to be PR?! It gets so annoying
Well..someone posted that they were at the same sushi restaurant where BB and Kendall ate at..they arrived separately and had dinner like friends but witnessed no kissing. The next day tabloids put out Kendall and BB “seen kissing each other on sushi date”..it can be PR/contractual agreement
? How do you whitewash a white woman
💀💀💀
just throwing this out there. kendall rides her horses in a GATED community and is very rarely photographed. it is a little fishy that these photos came out and it’s tmz who released them (karjenner mouthpiece)
They take 60000 pictures of her in the same outfit everyday going to the same gym. They don’t cherry pic they took pics whenever the can/get called.  They got called
Yeah I’m aware of what it means, that’sthejoke.jpeg
Your welcomed. Don’t know why I’m getting down voted for not wanting to be in the drama
Nobody should come for you for a innocent opinion ❤️  I’m probably biais cause this relationship don’t make sense to me
My whole family anal so clean 🚽💦
"I will spend all your money"
You’re spot on. I know everyone is like “the Kardashians are living PR!” But idk why Kendall would stop being anxious about overexposure overnight for clout. Unless she’s in “fuck it, we ball” mode to get past the breakup funk.   Obv they know it’s good promo and all, but like, cmon, people see two hot people hanging out and a contract is more likely than a hookup?
I think its BC PR relationship discussion has crossed from hardcore celebrity blinds people to a more general celebrity gossip group. It gets really racist and sexist really fast tho see priyanka chopra and nick jonas
I usually don’t believe in the whole PR bullshit but the lack of chemistry in this is giving me PR relationship tho
I mean...the tabloids could also be making stuff up because it sells like crazy. The reason I believe this isnt PR is because its negatively affecting both their reputations? Its not like theyre gonna collaborate on anything. For bad bunny, hes getting called out like crazy and losing fans. For kendall, its not like bad bunny can help her in the fashion world, as for 818, kendall doesnt really star in their ads anyways so Idk if bringing bad bunny would help with their sales (of if they even need help with that).
No, I know she’s white but I just mean her naturally olive/darker skin is so bleached out in all the fashion editorials I’ve seen her in. I’ve rarely seen screenshots of videos of her, I get all my KarJenner content from this sub
Fair enough. I know a lot of you like to repeat the same thing perhaps, I’m not clear in what I’m saying. The relationship can be fake and it can also be romantic. These two are not mutually exclusive. Both parties have lots to gain by inviting paparazzi, and onlookers to take pictures of them. If I was rich and I was dating the NUMBER 1 Latin star in the WORLD, you better believe, I would want to be seen with him. The same goes for Bad Bunny. Kendall ain’t just run off the mill white girl from Ohio. Some of us may perceive her as “just a basic white girl”, but the endorsements, contracts and fame she has objectively illustrates the opposite. I am not even a Kendall fan.. Why are people arguing this? It doesn’t have to be black or white. It can be in the middle… 🤦🏻‍♀️
🤷🏻‍♀️
Oh I see now because I said it was lame. Lol wild
You’re getting downvoted because Bad Bunny fans are insane and you’re not allowed to say you don’t give a fuck about him, they take it personally lol
Its both. I totally believe they are hooking up. But i totally see her using it as PR/Power move more than anything serious.  A win-win
How on earth do you know their chemistry?
Lol she’s naturally pale
Yeah I completely agree with you lol I was just pointing out that these photos specifically are probably PR. It’s not that hard to believe that a supermodel and famous musician are attracted to each other lol
![gif](giphy|1r91ZwKcE2J7WhUqrh)
I am basing it on what I see, to me they look like they have zero chemistry with each other. Same way I thought for example that Selena and Abel had zero chemistry together but Abel and Bella looked like they were made for each other
You must be looking at different screenshots than I am then
There were way more close up and personal pics of Abel and Selena. Bad bunny and Kendall have hardly any pics together but ok lol
I'm so used to her derriere it doesn't even look disproportionate to me,at least in these pics lol
Especially considering I think the edit in removing her butt was very generous, they still left a booty. Her body fat is so low, it would likely be tiny too.
Her ass is still huge without it. She looks way better
Well she probably has very low body fat aside from the BBL. She’s 5’10”, so she’s long and lean now.
Stop
I wonder how Kim feels about her sisters copying her plastic surgery procedures
She looks good w an ass 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️
Because all OP did was reshape to the right, however getting a bbl also brings the butt lower onto the thighs which is why they always look so wrong and disproportionate.
It’s real weirdo behavior innit?
I never said she didn’t. I said she looks small without it
Yeah honestly I have no idea what her actual ass looks like. I just did my best to shave it down
Lolz I didn’t say you did either :-)
I know Chicago is thrilled to be rid of the beige/black clothes.
Hedgehog cafes stress out the naturally nocturnal, wild animals.  They aren’t domesticated like puppies or kittens and the light and activity is very troublesome to them.
They just be wearing clothes from the lost and found bin
How is Psalm so big but still so little? He's so cute with his little ✌️ lol
Her face looks so different in the first pic!
Did she steal kourt’s clothes?
Sometimes I forget Psalm even exists. Cute kiddos though.
this is a terrible idea and, honestly, a hedgehog’s worst nightmare. they are shy, nocturnal animals.   they also shouldn't be housed together. they are solitary.
Chicago’s Epcot Center sweater 💖
Last pic - that little hand on her shoulder is really sweet.
Goddammit does she have some beautiful kids!!
Awe loook at psalm with the Phillies hat .
chicago is so beautiful
North is rocking the Bratz look.
The last pic is so sweet
This is my favorite hair on Kim
Poor hedgehogs :(
Her hair looks SO good. Like the best I’ve personally seen it in like… years lol even before she had the blonde, which I hated tbh, she wore those long dark extensions/wigs that looked so ratty or she had the Lord Farquad bob. Her hair looks very much like peak Kim K here— sleek, shiny, and with some really nice volume. Not too long and not too short.
Oh gosh, North is dressed how I dressed in the 90’s (but cooler- how I wanted to dress). Has it come full circle? I’m old!
I wanna play!
These are sooooooo cute
Cute! Good for them lol this is adorable idc
Love the two younger ones wearing crocs lol!
Now Kim **and** Kourt are raiding Travis's closet 😂
Oh man Kim is just straight up kopying kourtneys style now eh? Had to get in on the punk rock chic trend
So much grain lately lol
For a fleeting moment it looked like she was kissing Kanye in that last slide
Those animals cafe are so unethical, but I’m not surprised Kim went there.
Kim wins the award for worst fashion sense. 4th year in a row. What an accomplishment.
Poor animals
Kim doesn’t look like kim in the first photo and it’s freaking me out 😅😭
Loving her makeup and the eyeliner!!!
I love Kim’s outfit😩
Aww her kids are all sooo cute. Can’t believe how Psalm has got, feels like he was a baby yesterday 🥺😭
Chicago looks like Dream here
North is making me sad . She is literally a small child , but she already acts like and looks like she is older with at least 5 years. Giving me Kylie vibes .
Brought to you by face tune and “trying to be relatable to stay relevant”
Is this a lewk? Expensive but tasteless
[removed]
[removed]
She's so gross. Editing her kids face a lighter colour and putting a makeup filter on them. So embarrassing
Chicago is such a doll 💞💓👼🏼
First of all, hedgehogs suppose to be sleeping at daytime. They are night animals. And the second of all im disgusted how all of the people are allowed to lift the animals 😥 it’s really stressful for them! What if some kid drops the hedgehod? I hate Kim for sharing this.
Right!!!! And always wearing crocs with tons of charms! And all pink!
I know I’m THRILLED to see the kiddos wearing ANYTHING but Yeezy’s! Crocs are easy, age appropriate and fun.
I actually didn’t know this. I went to one in Japan because I thought it would be super cute to go see them. Will keep that in mind for the future. Thanks for sharing :)  On another note, I’m actually surprised to see Kim holding one. I know she’s always been pretty terrified around small animals like North’s hamster and some of her other pets.
I was wondering if it was good for them. From what I understand, they’re very sensitive creatures.
Thank you, this was my first thought too.
didn’t know this :( i’ve been to one in the past, this should be highlighted more
Do you eat animals?
Thank you for bringing this up! It's really bad for them and they can suffer from the most horrible psychological symptoms because of the stress and unnatural environment. This, in turn, can lead to physiological problems too. I used to work with local animal rescues and hedgehogs shouldn't even be pets, nevermind in a cafe. The amount that die prematurely or end up in rescues because of health and behavioural issues is shocking.

Im just relieved there's no more alien poots aesthetic. Kim looks like an actual human being and my butthole finally unclenched since seeing her last Skims photoshoot
the kids crocs 😂 they really dress themselves
Most kiddos I know dress like this! 😂
He’s got miniature parents so I bet he’ll stay little for a while. So cuteee
[removed]
Her lips are huge!
She cant even filter it away!
It’s Facetune and it’s obvious as well :(
Thank you! Came here to say this
Totally - I hate that she took the kids here :(((((
this is 10000% a wig. north posted a video of kim back in like december/january? and her hair was literally see through and barely shoulder length. the blonde absolutely destroyed it, it was horrible to see she should’ve fired chris.
She probably just upgraded her wig
It is not her real hair.
I agree it looks really healthy too and her hair always looks the best when it has some volume.
She kan't let Kourt outshine her! Edit spelling
It's cute but this kind of cafe is incredibly stressful and harmful to the animals   Hedgehogs are nocturnal naturally and shouldn't be handled like this
What shirt is that? Is it a metal band T?
North is nearly 10 and is experimenting with her own fashion like most other 10 year olds. She's wearing bright purple and pink braids and an appropriate outfit. None of us know this child at all to speak on how she acts. What about this could make you sad?

She looks like she’s hating it lmao
She looks like she’s hating it lmao
You went to Japan just for these cafes??
As a member of an omnivorous species, yes I do, but I don’t torture them first.  I do my best to choose ethically sourced meat when I can.

Oh of course lol I don’t think its her real hair
Never said it was haha it looks good whether it’s a wig or not
It’s not her hair.
(literally all animals and the whole animal exploitation industry). if u just assume that, you'll be right 99% of the time, lol.    also i cringe at how many cute animal videos are actually a distressed animal or an otherwise fucked-up situation
Wow , i didn’t think that my opinion is so unpopular haha . No , it’s not about her looks , I mean her dresses or hair . I have little nieces , so I know that this style is not uncommon in her age . I meant her body language , and maybe it’s just me but , I see the pressure on her like on Kylie on her early days .
no, they went to japan and on their trip went to the cafe
Whether it’s her natural hair, wig, extensions whatever, it belongs to her so it’s her hair and I agree with the person I replied too that it looks great.
Whoops, I read it as “I went to Japan because..”  I missed, “I went to *one* in Japan.”  Thanks!
She may own it but that does not mean it is her own hair. Its a wig ON her head nothing more. She contributed nothing
I mean you don’t actually know it’s a wig. You weren’t there when it was applied. It could just as easily big her hair mixed with extensions. Either way she contributed money to purchase whatever it is therefore it’s hers.   I really can’t believe this is actually a topic that warrants discussion 😭🤣
>You weren’t there when it was applied.  Neither were you, so don't claim to know with certainty about these murderers  >I really can’t believe this is actually a topic that warrants discussion 😭🤣  Yet here you are, simping needlessly
Which is why I’m not claiming it’s anything other than simply agreeing with the original poster that her hair looks nice. Unlike you who stated unequivocally that it is a wig when actually you have no idea.  Also murderers? Wth are you talking about?

My guess is Tristan, Jr, and I think Khloé is not sharing is because she doesn’t want to face backlash. She’s always going to be in love with Tristan, and will always go back to him no matter what.
I'm convinced the name is TJ (Tristan jr ) and she knows SM will have a Feild day with her if she tells anyone. But I wonder how long she's expecting to keep it from the world 🤔
you’re crazy!
I think it’s Tristan jr and she’s not sharing it out of fear of backlash. She never fell out of love with this man
Teak is also a real thing (“durable wood” according to google) so I honestly could see it. Fits the same vibe of River, Aspen, etc.
Bruh you high as fuck
Tater
Toronto Thompson-  Tristan’s hometown(ish), plus it sounds silly enough to be a Kardashian family name
Teak is a type of wood. Used for furniture and boat life. Not that crazy!
You had time today friend
Teak is too close to tweak
I have a friend named Teax he was named after his grandfather who was an antiquer :)
teak-a-leak, monique christina yolanda
TK sounds very plausible, so maybe she just used TK.
We'll see it hidden on some Easter basket in palm springs this weekend along w the insane excess we always see. 🐰🐣
I guessed Taj but I don’t remember why 🙃
Titan, I will die on this hill.
My guess is Titan
if it’s not tristan jr, trust!!
Trea, Tyler, tank, taylor, trudy…. Trustable. To name a few.
Try, as in nice try believing the guy is yours.
Asa fellow stoner this is the weed talking lol
I’m super stoned but I just thought imagine if she had True and * que drunk Khloe screaming on the phone after the Jordyn news * LIARRRRR
Tex? Idk I really think it’s TJ 😴
Also- why don't they just say. Why do they keep it a mystery? For the Hulu show?
I think it’s Trey
I love you🤣
I think Tre or Tristain Jr.
I think it’s Kete but since Kim & Pete broke up, she won’t let Khloe tell everyone! 🥰 /s
Very good guess, could be possible. Teak and True goes well together. But I do think it’s Tristan jr. also another to add to the equation. He has all these babies and baby mammas, Khloe wants Tristan to have the best relationship with HER kids. When calling her son Tristan Jr. is just right slap in the other baby mammas faces.
Nah, might be Kristian. Since T is for True, and K is for Khloe.
You crazy Kool? You crazy Tool? You crazy Kuel? Kiel? Kole? Kohl? Toke? Time? Tome? Thyme? TiKloe?
Ty? As in he ties them back together?
did anyone see it on the backpack wall for true’s birthday? lmao
My guess is Thor
I think False. True & False. Only joking.

Omg ..
Yes, you’re crazy 🤣

My money is on Trinity Thompson.
I think you’re right, because I think it’ll also make her feel more “legitimate” if it’s HER kid that is named after Tristan, rather than the other baby mommas’ kids. BUT she did look so done w Trashcan in the episode where the surrogate gave birth. Like she really did look truly done & angry with him for once (not even by what she said, but the footage of her holding her son and just general expressions). You never really know tho.
Same if i was gonna guess any name - it feels like she would want to "claim" that name before the next woman he gets pregnant uses it
Agree. But why wait because the whole internet thinks she is a klown for going back to him. You know what I mean? She’s already shattered her reputation and standards and morals, may as well tell us what we already know, not going to change anything. People still think she’s a 🤡
I know. 🤪. Thank you for validating. Showing my psych doc now.
I’ve said this before but I feel like it’s a mix of her still loving him and her feeling pressure to use it or his next baby mama will…………
I think it's Kristan. A mix of Kris and Tristan. I want to add I didn't come up with this I saw a TikTok saying that Kristan was copyrighted or something like that and they were saying it was Kylie's baby but I think Khloe makes more sense. I don't know how valid that TikTok even is but I think it's a *very* Khloe name.
I don't think its love its a misguided infatuation, a wronged entanglement if you will
Especially since it’s his 3rd son (but he doesn’t acknowledge Theo)
Teak is my favourite wood for flooring lol
on god
Middle name is Tot
I actually laughed
‘tato would be believable
Yeah but then she could be criticised for Kopying Kimberly after Chicago.
And they’d call him Toro for short
This could be it, middle name Robert.
For some reason the sound of this name is just sending me
So the kid IS named after Trashcan 😆
🤣
Good point, I need to start gearing up for my outrage at the amount of expendable items for one holiday.
As an Indian person, I forbid it 🙈
You know damn well there is now way in hell she's naming that baby Trustable after his daddy dicked down the trainer and made him an Irish twin to a brother he'll never know.
I doubt it because it’s her ex’s name
Didn’t she want T names tho? I don’t see her deviating on this
Isn't Theo his other kid that he doesn't see lol
Theo is the other son's name he has with Maralago or some shit

Do you have a link to this by any chance?
Exactly! It’s very misguided.
Damn. Strong theory
Oh no not Kris or Kriste?christian? TK? KY? TKK?
Kristen is Kris Jenner’s first name (and Kylie’s middle name) so I feel like that’s kinda weird
Seems like some kinda karmic connection if you believe in that stuff. Idk why she’s so HOOKED on this man
Love a good outdoor Teak furniture piece🤣
🤣🤣🤣 Tater Tot Thompson
Thank you for the unexpected snort ☠️
Brooooo 🤣💀
![gif](giphy|w89ak63KNl0nJl80ig|downsized)  Lmao Byeeeee 😂😂
She named the first one True after going into early labor from the stress of Tristan making out with girls in the club, and they were actually in a relationship then.   The reason she wouldn’t name the baby Trustable is because it sounds too much like an uncrustable sandwich. She would probably just use Trust.
I think so. I was just going against the grain
Yup
You can look up the scene on YT... Khlo was at the hospital and Tristan came to see her and the baby. Or watch the first episode of season 2.
No, it’s early episodes of the second season of The Kardashians.
Yeah that would make sense. I was thinking I would never name my kid after someone that did all that to me but then this reminded me we’re talking about Khloe here 😬  Edit: typo
Second this.
What about “Kristian” or “Khristian”
Why is it weird? It's an incredibly normal thing for millenia of humans on this earth to name someone after a relative.
I’m laughing at this 😂😂😂
TTT
🤣🤣🤣
Anytime. Happy Cake Day! 🍰
Great points! All for baby Crustable say AY!
I wouldn’t give my son my mother’s name, especially if it was the feminine version of a traditional male name already. Like naming your boy Gabriella when Gabriel is right there. I could see Khloe calling her son Christian before Kristen. But Khadijah already has a Christian so I don’t see her using that either.
But it isn't her mother's name? It's a meshed with Tristan. And these are the same people who named their kids all sorts of silly stuff. A google search reveals the name is masculine or gender neutral. https://nameberry.com/babyname/kristan/boy
It is her mother’s name just a different spelling. She would still be “calling” her son with her mom’s name since they are pronounced the same. I think that would be odd enough for me, even if the name rhymes with his dad’s name.   Though Kim was able to marry another Kris so maybe they don’t care
True was named after a man. They don't care.
Someone on here thought it was shade, posted it and had people in the comments agreeing. There is a good chance they ripped that story from here. The mess is coming from inside this house lol.
Like where did they even get that she wanted to be invited to true’s party???
Lol that picture, okurr facetune.
The fitness enthusiast. I have no words.
Why would she be invited to her birthday party???
Sorry but baby + child support = set for life. In her case, which she wanted
[removed]
lol exactly what I’m thinking
You must not know the standard for living as a IG model.  She’s done this whole thing to be kardashian adjacent.
I mean ideally her son would be invited since he’s True’s brother. I can understand why she doesn’t want to have anything to do with Maralee, but it’s ultimately hurting the baby most.
i wouldn’t say she’s set for life but an extra 10k a month on top of whatever her income is sounds nice
Let’s not call children illegitimate. By that logic so are Khloe’s kids, but I think it’s a pretty cruel thing to call a child regardless.
Prince is at all of the kids parties.
If I was a celebrity I wouldn't invite a complete stranger who cheated with my partner to my child's birthday. Even if they didn't cheat I wouldn't that's not my circus
That’s… dumb as hell I’m sorry. Why would khloe invite these women who she doesn’t know, who true doesn’t know, who Tristan doesn’t claim, to her young daughter’s bday party 🤦🏻‍♀️ Think logically here. Baby mamas don’t typically celebrate their kids bdays together like some sister wives situation irl.
Is there any indication that literally anyone wants that to happen lmao
Honestly I think it’s best she keeps him away. Why show him a world he will never have. He’s a baby now but as he gets older I’m sure the extravagant parties, gifts, and overall presence of his dad being a dad to someone other than him isn’t going to feel good.
Yeah she's not struggling
Let’s not get overly sensitive about a joke. 🙄 If you don’t like my comment, keep scrolling.
Tristan could have brought his son. That’s what should have happened.
Yea ppl are buggin..if your husband had a side kid, you’re not inviting them to the next bday party. Just not happening. Not in real life.
Sorry, but what’s the joke with that?
But it’s not really real life when they put this out for public consumption for 100s of millions of people to see. If it were a private birthday party, yeah, whatever. But the way they so publicly exclude this child feels very cruel to me.
I mean it's nice you think that way but I would protect myself, who knows what photos she would post, if she would sell stories, if she respects the privacy of her friends
I have been in attendance at functions where the side baby was invited to the get together. It’s just rare, I’m sure. I will say that years had passed, so the kid was a bit older and was not accompanied by the side woman.
Lol I don’t have kids or a man either but it just feels like common sense 💀 but I do kinda see what you’re saying, it would just never work out in reality.  Even in a perfect world, he wouldn’t have cheated around and had all the kids with different women at the same time in the first place.
As the mother of one such "illegitimate child,"  I would like to point out that your username says you're a slut for dogs lol!   Sorry, I find this argument very amusing. Carry on...
Honey, look at all your comments. You just like to shame people for shit. “He should have brought his son..” “It’s True’s brother…” “I understand Khloe’s side but she’s hurting the baby…”   Sorry but get off your high horse. It’s off-putting. There are real causes you could spend your energy on.
I’m of the belief that children are the responsibility of their parents, period. She is but theo’s mother, she did not get with Tristan after Theo was born, and if the actual parent doesn’t claim him, that’s between that baby’s mother and father. Those were decisions they made, regardless of and despite Khloe’s input or wishes. We are human beings and our flawed humanity is often what drives us. It isn’t instinctual for humans to immediately embrace your partners affair child.
I just don’t get what the punchline is to this “joke”?  Where’s the humor in it? Plus it’s against the sub rules to talk negatively or judgmentally about children.
Yes, because snarking on adult choices is the same as snarking on the circumstances of a child’s birth. You’re shaming a child. I just don’t ever think it’s appropriate to call a human being illegitimate or illegal or other dehumanizing terms, even as a “joke.” Whatever, I reported your comment, so the mods can decide if that kind of discourse is appropriate here.
Lol “illegitimate” is literally a legal term. Look it up. Or don’t, I don’t really care. You’re a lot…
I can see your side and I can see u/Slut4Mutts side bc the term illegitimate has often been synonymous with bastard child BUT illegitimate child by definition means a child born to parents who aren’t wed at the time of birth. It might’ve been your tone came off a certain way…lk “they might as well invite the mistress and illegitimate child over” sounds a bit snarky. If we can’t sort these exchanges out at the end of the day then let’s respectfully agree to disagree ❤️
The other user told me to look up the definition so here it is:   “not authorized by the law; not in accordance with accepted standards or rules”  To me it’s a bit demeaning to say that a baby is “not authorized by law.”   Anyway, they probably didn’t mean it that deeply, but they doubled down it, which I don’t really get but whatever 🤷🏼‍♀️
umm if i had to guess it’s bc she recently traveled to Japan based on the emojis 🙈  i would say it’s brown to match her theme but it doesn’t so maybe she’s gonna change it
It resembles James turrell art which the family likes and it goes with her ig colors
I thought something bad happened in Japan (hence the dark colors) and she was showing solidarity 😭 I even took to google to confirm lmao
Skims new period panties
‘Kimono’ comeback
Aesthetic for insta
It must a exciting new project she’s been working on and she CANNOT wait to share with us 🙄
Cause she loves Japan, duhhh/s lol
Is she…. In china?
It’s a James turrell in Japan that looks like the Japanese flag
Matches her *aesthetic* 🙄
Agreed, looks like a new feed aesthetic is coming up
This was my guess. Looks like a photo of a skyspace installation
She’s OBSSESED
It'll be I C O N I C, surely
ew on the shade combo
That family chat is weird af
I don’t think sitting on each other’s laps or hugging is weird. I also don’t think changing in front of each other is weird. The Rob stuff is weird lol I only have sisters, so I guess some could say I just don’t have brothers so I’m not used to it, but… no. I think their boundaries as a family in general are pretty wonky though
me personally… i would never ever do this with my siblings.
Family chat is weird. And I always thought the first pic (i think it’s the Snapchat of Kylie running her hand down the front of Kendall’s pants) was super weird and uncomfortable.
Weird.  ![gif](giphy|urOM1aDOKB92E)  I feel like the general closeness is one thing but intentionally making it sexual like they do is what throws it over the edge.
Anyone who says this is normal sibling stuff either doesn’t have a sibling or is someone who’s family I would never want to meet.
![gif](giphy|DjVCpTvzAKLaE)  They remind me of another famous family with their “closeness”.
That video I watched of Khloe running her fingers all over Kourtney's ass and vag in an extremely sexual way bothered me the most of all. The other stuff pales in comparison to that.
The Rob stuff is weird and you can tell there is poor boundaries between siblings and Kris was basically turning a blind eye. I think the interactions between the girls is a bit over the top but not really predatory especially when they are probably being encouraged to be overly sexual for attention. I think Kris realized that some guys get turned on by that stuff so they were kind of acting out for the audience on the show
I’m extremely close to my siblings. My little brother is my best friend and we literally do everything together. 90% of This shit is weird.
I think some of it is sisters just acting like they would w/ any other best friend, but the family group chat creeped me out. What’s more bothersome is Kris obliviously saying “crazy kids.”
I think Rob and Khloe cross the line a lot, and honestly it makes me sad because that's pretty typically a sign of childhood SA. I know Khloe talked about being with a much older man when she wasn't even 18 :/
I grew up with nothing but sisters and I only think the ones where they explicitly talk about having sex like the group chat is weird. I’ll never understand that lol however I don’t think sexy dancing between sisters or comfortable with nakedness is weird.
i mean they all bang the same men so 👀  ![gif](giphy|EZGmC8rAY7z6U)
Does anyone remember when they were on the episode of MTV cribs and Kim walked into the living room and Kourtney and Khloe were literally straddling and grinding into each other on the couch? I knew right then and there something was off. Kidding or not, it’s not normal
I don’t think that 10 is weird imo. Just depends on how close you are with your sis. Waxing isn’t inherently sexual, I see that more of like upkeep. I called my sister and asked if she’d wax my vag if I couldn’t get an appointment and she said she would. She’s also about to be a doctor so she sees snatches all day.  12 also isn’t terrible—same reason. Being present when your sis is getting her coocharilla lasered isn’t inherently sexual. I also remember that ep, Kim wasn’t staring at it like it was a steak. She just caught a glance and made a little joke. I don’t think it’s that deep.  The others…17/10 weird as shit
I mean it’s a little much, but I had to be all up in my sisters vag after she had her first baby and it was an emergency c-section. So after that I guess u have to like a pee a certain amount and they have this thing in the toilet that catches ur pee n has measurements on it. She needed to pee a certain amount n didn’t want to get off the toilet unless it was at that amount because she was in so much pain. Her hubby wasn’t there and I sure gotchu sister. I don’t know why they make the numbers the same color basically and it’s so hard to tell wtf it says unless u’re all the way in there! I was so close and it was a lot! We laughed so hard and that hurt her even more!   And there’s other things too. I had both of my bio sisters and mom with my hubby in the delivery room while I vaginally birthed all 3 of my kids. Anything nasty that any of us girls had going on we always share.. I don’t know, we were super close up until recently with my mom passing unexpectedly- I don’t rly like them rn so I wouldn’t so shit for them rn! Lol. (If u got this far, ty. We haven’t had power since Saturday morning and just got it back a lil bit ago and I have my phone charged n been missing being on Reddit, lol)  Edit: a word- “captures” pee… no, it catches pee though lol.
The most me and brothers share is a joint 😂😂😂
Veerrrrry weird and I’d never do that with my siblings lol
I don’t think they genuinely have weird sexual relationships with each other (except with boundaries with Rob back in the day).  I think they’ve just been sexualising themselves for decades. It began with underwear photoshoots together which Kendall and Kylie were exposed to from a young age.  Performing sexuality for the male gaze is basically their brand, and they push it so hard that they dont seem like genuinely sexual beings at all
![gif](giphy|fqhLlVfYb0CQhpLLpG)  I ain’t gone say it….
You think this is weird? Watch an ep of extreme sisters on TLC
I have two brothers not far off in age. And ya . I wouldn’t even joke about them popping my cherry. Maybe it’s a sister thing
I have a feeling one of them have watched Kim’s sex tape and I fear it was Kris who did 😭
When your mom is PMK over sexualized family life is normal I guess...I would never act this way with family, just ew 😣
It’s super weird. Gross.
I don’t think any of this is weird besides the Rob stuff. But I don’t have a brother so I have no idea what’s normal with a brother.
Some things are a little much
Everyone knows it’s weird
I’m uncomfy
I have 3 brothers and 3 sisters and it’s weird.
No they’re just weird
Is all kind of weird vibes
I kept looking through these like, "IS there one that isn't THAT weird?? Like the hugging ones?" But no, it's weird. It's all weird.
I'm an only child but this is fucking weird
Kylie is basically kissing her sister Kendall in that slide 🤢🤢🤢
![gif](giphy|403NRxgdScOUQjiQEh|downsized)
It’s gross. I know a fam like this IRL. Beautiful girls, but also so in appropriate with each other. It’s gross and other people talk about how uncomfortable they make them as well. I think they thinks cute or something. Idk. It’s freaking weird. My sis and I are NOT like this and we are close.
I’ve definitely sat in bed and my brother has come in and sat down and we talked or watched a movie or something though, maybe we’re also weird 😂 everything else is absolutely uncomfortable to me
that recent photo set of kim and khloe is sooo bizarre
They are weird. But they can hardly be considered a normal family. We can’t compare this to normal families. They don’t really have any proper best friends. They have each other and they remain popular by posting pics they think are sexy. Hence why they sexualise everything including their relationships with each other
I see almost everything here as normal or acceptable besides those texts??
Some of the stuff they do is super weird, some is not. I guess.
There’s some things that are weird but honestly some things aren’t, and I guess it depends on family closeness!  I would never let my family put their hands down my pants or text me like that, but I always chill with my siblings in bed (esp my little sisters), and they’ve touched my boobs when I panicked about a weird dimple before and needed someone to immediately double check while I was on the phone w my doctor lol.  Some things they do are inappropriate but some things are pretty normal.
I’m sorry but this shit is so, so weird to me. Cannot fathom acting like this with my brother OR sister
very weird.
Ive said it once on here I’ll say it again.. REMEMBER THAT EP OF KUWTK WHEN KOURTNEY WAS PREGNANT AMD KHLOE WAS TICKLING HER VAG WITH A RIDING CROP?!?!? ITS NOT FUCKING NORMAL AND ITS NOT CUTE nor sexy
This shit is weird as fuck. This is what happens when you aren’t raised with boundaries. I’m a middle child and I’m very close with my brother and sister, but you couldn’t PAY me to do any of this shit.
I love my sister, I have never done any of this stuff with my sister. Strange people.
🤢
I have an identical twin sister whose my best friend. I would NEVER wax her vagina ew.
this is disturbing as hell… like do they think this is normal
the last slide .. lmao kim girl why are you thinking about how her vagina (which is actually vulva u idiot) looks?
That suck tongue was accidental. And it wasn’t even a literal sucking. I remember seeing that clip. Kylie was posing to kiss Kendall and Kendall decides to stick her tongue out as the pose and that was that.
Its normal with sisters to be extremely close. Ive seen my sister naked 100 times. Ive helped her put in tampons. Ive cupped her boobs. All platonic. Sisters are best friends but closer, Its weird if you’re not close with your siblings to me.  A lot of this is them just joking around.
I guess I’m in the minority but I’m like this with my closest girlfriends lol we’ll grind on each other and slap each others asses but it’s usually when we are drunk and in party mode.   Idk it doesn’t come off especially strange… like I don’t think they all secretly want to bang each other if that’s what you mean lbvs.
it’s weird but i definitely know other nonfamous families that act like this too
Some of it is normal siblings stuff, but some of it is weird and inappropriate. But I’ve seen flashes of weird sibling dynamics throughout my life with my friends. I’ve brushed it off as weird sibling shit.
The fact that Khloe’s motto is “incest is best” is seriously disturbing man
I think the dancing is normal. Even if it’s suggestive twerking. Sucking your sisters tongue or sticking your hands down her pants is not. Laying in bed together is normal. Saying you want your brothers eggplant is not.
It’s just how their family is not every family is the same, my family isn’t like that but i wouldn’t say it’s weird because I don’t care… that’s their normal
I’m a girl and I have two sisters and I couldn’t even tell you the last we touched let alone hugged
I'm like this with my friends who I'm really close to so I don't find it weird at all. We get drunk and act like this. And it's not for "the male gaze" because we do it when it's just us jamming around at home pretending we're on stage at a concert. I don't think it's weird.
Uuummmm no this is beyond weird...my family structure is very similar to theirs minus a brother and we are very comfortable and close to eachother.but we would never dare do this type of inbred activity.this family is weird and will do anything for attention.lets not talk about their questionable photoshoots with each other
The weirdest thing that I can thing of is being on FaceTime with my twin and him deciding to show me that he accidentally shit in a shape of smiley face 🤣  Yes most of it is fucking weird lmao dancing goofy like that and being in the room during laser is funny and okay lol
I have 3 brothers, and the closest we’ve ever got besides hugging is the eldest of my brothers holding my hand for support at my grandfathers funeral.  I’ve never been tempted in a million years to stick my hand down his pants.  I’ve given my bros piggy back rides, occasionally shot a nerf gun at their butts to be a pest, but nothing like what these weirdos got goin on. The girls I think do it for the male gaze ™️, but rob and khloe and rob and Kim? Susssss asf
They’re a really weird family. Idk if it’s because they’re so insular and stick to themselves. But, they lack boundaries.
I have 5 siblings and this is weird AF.
They’re this close but they’re one of the few public families that haven’t come out with pedo allegations against one another.
What is happening I that first picture?!?
I do this with my cousin and best friend. It depends on your relationship!
Nah it’s incest. What sister (Khloe) asks their brother (Rob) “do want to marry me do you want to f#ck me” 🤢🤮
they can do this all they want I know they're all in secret competition with one another and get secret joy when something bad happens to one another. Kim especially is a big hater
Where theres smoke theres fire.... I think at the very least rob and khloe have definitely hooked up at some point 🤢
Eh I know families that are very open and “explicit” or “crude” in general. Not directed at one another though, as in “brother, pop my cherry, haha”. But I don’t think its indicative of something dark.
me and my sister are super close like this too, it’s definitely normal
Some of it is innocent I’m sure, but you can’t deny there’s something a little off putting about them…
I personally don’t think it’s that strange ASIDE from the pop my cherry text. Also, there is a lot of grinding going on, beyond the level that I think is comfortable for the average family. I think their level of affection is  above the norm, but I don’t necessarily think anything  seriously wrong is going on here.   I will say, I have 6 siblings and my 2 sisters and I are all in our twenties. There is one sister who’s 17. We snuggle sometimes, l sometimes hype each other up, and talk about sex a LOT. We’re very open, kind of like best friends. I have three brothers and  we do talk about our sex lives sometimes… we’re all adults. We cover all topics. definitely not to this level though.
With my sister-yes we will do weird funny stuff to each other. I would never with a male sibling though.
[removed]
The sex stuff with Rob is the most fucked up one to me. I have a brother, and I can objectively say that he is a handsome guy, without making it weird!! Same way he told me I looked beautiful on my wedding day!! It's the way you'd tell ANY family member they're beautiful! It makes me sick to my stomach to think about talking about somebody's brother that way..
Some is weird. Some seems normal. I’m an only child tho
Khloe and Robs relationship has always been odd to me. Just based on things said between eachother in the show.
 The rest I can get over but the group chat is weird 🥴. (The suck my tongue snap chat that doesn’t even look like a sibling who is that. Kim and who?)
[removed]
Slide number 1.... 🤢🤮 and the banter between khloe and rob is inappropriate. Everything else I feel is just close sister stuff.
Very normal
I’m close with my brothers but I don’t think an eggplant has ever ever been in sent in our chats unless my brother is telling me about a dude he is seeing. Like..they cross some lines for sure.
[removed]
The waxing and shit I get. The sexualising I don’t. Feels like a manifestation of intergenerational trauma of sexual boundaries crossed.
I always thought the relationship between Rob and Khloe was weird.
tbh i would rather have my sibling wax my vagina rather than a stranger.  not only is it free, but i know who i’m working with
It’s disgusting and gross. I could never be like that with my younger sister 🤮
Yes minus that group text🥴
I think a lot of it is played up for ratings and stuff.
I wonder if Khloe’s response is making fun of the fact that they’ve joked about Rob being attracted to Kim.  Or am I imagining that happening?
I have brothers. Their behavior is VERY bizarre.
I only have one brother and I wouldn’t tell him that lol. He also is super reserved about sex in general even though my sisters and I talk about it openly with each other. (Not sex WITH each other, I’m not a Kardashian, you know what I mean).
It’s not normal for a brother at all. Maybe my brother is just more respectful than others but he won’t even bring up inappropriate topics when I’m around and I’m a 28 year old grown woman. He’ll probably always see me as his little kid sister. That looks like a very incestual conversation, both my brother and I would die before sending eachother those emojis 🤢
Depends I guess. I had a friend who was quite out there and she used to get me to come over to do her spray tan then she would just stay naked to dry and walk to her room through the house in front of everyone - friends, mum, dad, her brother, sister in law. It’s just how she was.   another friend who was really close with her younger brother, had bad anxiety and often he’d sleep in her room when she was struggling when we were teenagers/early 20s.  my partner has friends who are twins (male/female) and also have a younger brother that we are friends with as well and they make weird jokes sometimes about finding each other hot but they do it to everyone, their mum, my mum, me, my partner etc. it’s just their sense of humour I think. I’ve never seen anything to think they’re doing anything inappropriate.   Then my sister will often get changed or just be naked/in her underwear around me. And sometimes asks me to come and talk to her while she has a shower.
I feel like it’s the way they put their hands around each other when sitting on laps is weird. I would never hold my sister like that 💀
The hair removal, as in a sister helping another sister do bikini line waxing I don’t see as inappropriate/sexual. Getting in and around the labia, folds, nooks and crannies may be a little much for a family member BUT waxing as I said the general area is fine in my eyes..  Even laying next to one another in bed chatting how Rob and Khloe were in the one photo isn’t inappropriate. I’ve relaxed next to my brother and had deep or silly convos.
The thought of doing this with my sister or closest friends makes me want to vomit. I can’t imagine
fr I would never ask my brother to pop my cherry buut thats me!
Like I don't want my sister sucking my tongue for funsies but that's me!
[removed]
Omg yess
>I think the interactions between the girls is a bit over the top but not really predatory  Eh disagree, especially when it comes to khloe. There is that moment when Kendall recalls drunk khloe entering in her room and humping her
Yeah the family group chat is the only thing I find weird here
Yeah I think this is it. Cause the dancing stuff I do with my best friends and we peck each other and stuff. It’s not sexual or trying to look sexy. It’s just fun and dancing. The group chat thing is fucking weird though. The wax is normal between sisters and moms. Idk why you’d let a random stranger wax you but it becomes weird and sexual when it’s your family. If anything it’s even less
Sooo agree! The sexual talk like referring to sex with each other is super freaking weird but the physical closeness stuff is normal, my sisters and I are always touching each other and falling asleep on each other when we are together. Heck when we are together no one can even shower or pee in peace. Even with my brother I will lay on his bed while he is in it. That is normal close sibling stuff to me.
Spot on. Some of these are people choosing to make pretty meh stuff weird for no reason. HOWEVER the chat? The hand down the pants? The tongue??? Hell no 😭
Yh i would dance with or on my sister all the time as well as sit on her lmao. thats nrml stuff to me but the groupchat stuff is weird as hell.
There's a diffrence..fingering you sister on camera for snapchat isn't normal at all
This is the best explanation I’ve read yet
She did watch and sold it..ray j leaked the documents
Kris for sure watched it and was taking notes the whole time
rob totally did.
I have a brother, and this is not normal at all. The thought of saying that to my brother makes me wanna gag violently 🤮🤢
Lol I also think the only weird thing is the Rob family chat thing, I don’t even think Rob being in bed with Khloe is weird just the sexual chats. I have a 3 sisters and no brother
![gif](giphy|26gN0tFg70wAljK4o|downsized)
no that’s a photo of a scene in kuwtk when rob told khloe that he slept with a kim k lookalike winner 🥴 and then khloe told rob “why don’t you sleep with a khloe lookalike winner?”
Same lol
Me too!
Why not? Waxing is not inappropriate or sexual, I mean I understand not feeling comfortable but what’s “ew” about it?
I think it was just a little joke.
100% this. I also find it weird when people are not super close to their siblings, that’s naturally supposed to be someone you trust with your life so if you’re going to be weird and goofy, they’re the first person to be weird and goofy with.
Close friends and siblings are not nearly the same thing
Exactly.
Lol right, I’m with you.
lol that’s not normal though, to me, so see how some normal things in your family can be viewed as weird by other people? I have 3 sisters and I’m super super affectionate with them, sometimes I just hold my sisters hostage and kiss them all over their faces and people would think that’s weird but I find it normal.   The family chat is the only thing I find weird here but that’s just me.
Lol exactly, I know people who are like this with their friends too. Somethings look or seem sexual when they’re actually not to the people performing the act etc
I can’t decide if it would be more impressive if he did it on purpose or not.
kylie sticking her hand down kendall’s pants
She was like 5/6 at the time.

That’s so not normal 😩😭
There is nothing healthy or normal about asking your adult brother to pop your cherry
Not in my house lol
Nah no it’s not,your people done lied to you😳
Delete this
Lol meanwhile my brother and I have had a drunken convo on whether or not we think mom and dad have eaten ass 🫣
>my partner has friends who are twins (male/female) and also have a younger brother that we are friends with as well and they make weird jokes sometimes about finding each other hot   >   >Lannister vibes
[removed]
oh ok, it’s just me personally i don’t think i’ll ever feel comfortable enough to do that with my sister! and that’s a photo of a scene in kuwtk when rob told khloe that he slept with a kim k lookalike winner 🥴 and then khloe told rob “why don’t you sleep with a khloe lookalike winner?” that’s why i said iykyk
I agree with this. Also siblings sometimes are at the births of their siblings so they see a lot more than a pretty vajajay😂 I don’t find that weird or boundaries being off. The convo with rob is a bit off but all the other pics of them I see nothing wrong with.
See I know that it should be fine but I don’t like my sister touching me. At all. Thinking of her waxing me makes me full body shiver. I actually don’t think I could do it.   Again, I know it should be fine but just nope hahah
I think I just threw up in my mouth

So putting your hands in your sister's shorts and recording it is normal?
Ooop, I missed that for sure! Oh Lordy! 👀That’s uhh def a difference for sure, I just don’t do that with mine- maybe we weren’t as close as I thought lol (/s jic it’s not obvious)
![gif](giphy|BRjyjJFQysCnDlQdl8)
Haha ya I figured it was weird but didn’t want to assume 😂. I think if I saw my boyfriends sister with him like this I would have major side eye
Im so glad other people agree
That’s true! I don’t have any siblings close in age to me so close girlfriends was the only thing I could personally compare to 🤷🏽‍♀️ we don’t share blood but those girls are my sisters.   I’m also bias because of the fact most of my family is toxic so strong ties based just on familial relationships mean next to nothing to me. I’ve got people that aren’t blood that are more like family and vice versa. And based on how the KarJen sisters treat each other it’s clear that they are all each others best friends.   ETA: so I guess I take back my initial “That’s true!” I don’t think I agree with you at all actually lol. But regardless I see where you are coming from in a traditional sense!
Why? My sister is my bestfriend and she’s sat on my lap in a club when there was no room for her to sit. And we’ve danced together not really like sexy dancing but she’s been behind me and put her arms around me and we danced like I would with any other friend.   We often fall asleep on each other or snuggle up under a blanket. We’ve always done it.   I think some people just have different experiences and are comfortable in different ways.
Excuse me, 👀 That’s definitely not normal, from my understanding… but I’m an only child so 🤷🏻‍♀️

Oh wow that’s just gross 🤢
Rob and Khloe are very weird to me. I remember Rob saying him and Lamar circle jerked off to a sleeping Khloe and it was very weird. I don't know if it's just their sense of humour but it's really odd
Some people are way too comfortable with their families. In my pregnancy group one of the other pregnant women said that her mom found a stretch mark on her labia while she was shaving her vag for her (I’ll concede it’s hard to reach later in pregnancy) and wanted to know if the stretch mark was normal. And I was like “the stretch mark is probably normal but the rest isn’t!” Ok maybe I didn’t say it but I thought it!
Remember when Blac Chyna’s mom made some incest claims…? I mean, it’s definitely a weird family that sexualizes each other all the time 🤢
🤢
Hey, we all have our limits! I guess in my response I should’ve made clear that it would be a better idea to wearing underwear or a swimsuit bottom to do the waxing then completely nude. I’m guilty of just shaving around my bottom when in a rush/lazy for a day of “swim” so my thought was that two sisters could certainly sit comfortably around each other and wax around the bikini line and it not be inappropriate. Bottom or no bottom, sisters can have that closeness and it not mean anything inappropriate. Believe me!  Also, TY for adding context to the photo of Rob/Khloe……..the 2 of them were always acting sus but I generally chalked that up to their relationship being thick as thieves considering Khloe prob had a hand in raising him as she did the 2 younger sisters. Nothing excuses having pillow talk of that nature esp w a sibling.
😂 I swear I laughed out loud!! If I had a sister I’d like to think I’d allow her to do this to me bc that’s just my attitude BUT I do not shame you for drawing the line in the sand where you have. I can’t stop laughing at your reply tho! Lol
That’s a little weird and I wouldn’t do that but we smack each others butts all the time and in general just are very much all over each other. I feel like that particular thing was for the shock factor.
Just so you know, no one fingered anyone. This user is a bit OTT.
Exactly. They need therapy
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
That would be even worse...
What you’re describing is normal.  This first picture, which is Kylie putting her hand down Kendall’s pants, is absolutely not normal.
No 🤍
Wait. Huh? More details please...
You should’ve said it!  It would’ve sounded normal to the other 98.7% of us!!!
I don’t find that weird? She probably felt more comfortable with her mum seeing her vagina than someone else. The stuff from the Kardashians in the original post is actually sexual and definitely weird but shaving isn’t a sexual act
Tbf,  I don't care about a single a word that flies out of Tokyo Toni's mouth.   But yes, some of the stuff we see from them is highly questionable. I've still never recovered from Khloe sniffing Kourtney and Kim's vulvas.
Me and my sisters do the stuff you said 2.but we def don't finger eachother especially on camera...I think the fact that they recorded and posted it makes it even weirder honestly
https://www.reddit.com/r/KUWTK/comments/ysjcvw/im_sorry_but_am_i_misunderstanding_this_or_not/
Sorry, I’m really not trying to shame anybody who would do that and I’m definitely not suggesting it’s sexual. It’s just that for me, personally, I cannot imagine anything more horrifying than my mother and a razor getting up close and personal with my vagina. I squirmed even typing that sentence out.
Lol this is a reaaaach
But they aren’t fingering each other….like do you know where the hole of a vagina is
I don’t think she actually touched her privates, of course I wasn’t there so Idk. But it felt very performative like how girls will make out and film it or make out in front of guys. When I was in college you saw that everywhere. Their life is pretty much a performance so it being for shock value is on brand…Again this was still weird, but the other stuff is normal for siblings well all the siblings that I know.
Seriously, the fact that you are doubling and tripling down on this has me worried for your home life. I hope you’re healthy and okay
Oh my.
I personally wouldn’t do it either, I don’t have that type of relationship with my mother at all but it’s not weird if someone else does, while they’re pregnant and can’t do it themselves.
Not my mom, but I offered to shave my BFF when she was pregnant haha we almost made a girls night out of it but her husband wanted to do it 🤷‍♀️
How is it a reach you clearly need therapy if you think this normal
You’re right, you’re right!
Lol no I find it all very weird, I don’t even hug my sister. But to say fingering her on camera when she (I think) just had her hand resting down the front of her jeans is a reach. If she was actually inside her or fondling her then yeah that’s insane. It’s all weird, but fingering leads to a different level and I don’t think that’s what happened
You ever see the “freak my shit” clip with Kendall and Kylie. It’s gross. Fingering for sure.
Well that's exactly what she doing in the first video.at the very least she touching the girl that's beyond clear.and equally disturbing.hints kendall scream twords the end..you need therapy and glasses....they have even tongue kissed eachother on camera. I know what my eyes see
I don’t see the video here just a screenshot. I haven’t seen it and assumed it was just placing her hand in the waistband- which is still very weird, but not the same as being up inside her - which would be actually insane. Not sure how I need therapy when I was just trying to clarify what actually happened. Hand in the waistband and fingering are two very different things imo
I love that Kourtney just had to tag her 😂
Kourt replying to kim’s criticism at the time by saying she looks like she just won the tour de france was savage, never forget
Khloe looks fucking amazing imho
I didn’t realize Khloe was pregnant for Japan. She was literally 8 months pregnant and rockin it. Can’t believe Kim told her that she looked bad
Kourtney was the only one ahead of her time in fashion. I look at her 2016 style for inspiration right now.
Lol and remember what Kim was wearing?? The “futuristic” Kanye shit that looks soooo dated now.
I love this 😭😭😭🤣🤣  I always thought Khloe and kourt ate for that tokyo trip. Kim was such a bitch to them! And insulting their stylists right in front of them smh
Kourtney’s outfit is so good here !💯💯
Kim always ends up doubling back.
they look fabulous. Kim is being a total dickhead for telling them what to wear n said they look like clowns
can someone explain this to me? 😭
Khloe looks sooo good here!!
Seriously makes me crave cotton candy when I see this picture.
Kim is SUCH a bitch.
The way Kim came for their necks when Kanye was styling her and now she’s using them for inspiration. 🤡
“People grow and evolve” aka I’ve never had taste and never will lol
I’m glad they can laugh about it now lol Kim was absolutely insufferable alongside Kanye before he turned the tables on *her*!
Her bottom lip is bigger than her top, the way lips should be!! She looks so beautiful here! I wish she hadn’t done the shitty nose job and gone overboard with fillers…….
Yeaaah okay. Now my VIBE is my HUSBAND.   She’s actually the worst of the 3. Look at her step daughter.
The looks aren’t the same they are just wearing a pink coat and Kim didn’t criticize the coat
I also always make a point to wear a fluffy bath mat with my jeans and heels. It’s a vibe.
I feel like Khloe’s outfit here is one Kim would totally wear now.
Khloe also told her to apologise 😂 in her comments
She was giving!!!
And in heels????
Jealousy.
8 months?? Is it even safe to travel so far along?
I didn’t realize either!!! Makes Kim’s criticisms even more… ahh idk
Too bad she looks like a Monster energy drink promo girl at a BMX meet now.
I somehow knew it wouldn’t age well…
Kim’s worst styling move was letting Kanye take over her style. She was doing great before his “visions” took over.
But let his fans tell it in every thread that she needs Ye to style her
When the sisters went to Japan a few years ago Kim was hating on Kourtney and Khloe’s outfits saying they looked like costumes. When Kim went to Japan recently she wore a fluffy pink coat like Khloe did, so people are rightfully calling Kim a hypocrite and this post is Kim “apologizing” lol
Me too, I’m so lost
This is old
No.
What her step daughter got to do with her? And it’s funny considering in that trip Kim vibe was her husband 😂
Did you see what Kim was wearing in that trip and her hair? She had no right to critique anyone.
yeah there was another outfit too I remember some crazy blue eyeshadow too. Kourt has some black and floral two piece  [Here it is](https://people.com/tv/kim-kardashian-disgusted-khloe-kourtney-kardashian-style/) it looks like she commented on both times lol
Apologize for what lol
Her old face was just 🥹 I miss it
Honestly probably because Kim dressed crazy for both her pregnancies.
No. They don’t recommend travel in the third trimester at all, so 6 months. Flying so far at 8 months along is just plain dangerous and stupid if you ask me. And I like Khloé so I’m not bashing. But that probably wasn’t the wisest decision if it’s true. She looks small for 8 months though, no?
Most underrated comment yet. 😂 accurate
Right? And he obviously makes her feel like crap about her choices. She lost her whole fucking identity it seems, and never knows if she is looking okay or not. And if not, Kanye makes damn sure to let her know he hates her looks: He mocks it and makes fun of her. It’s sad.
Kim, Khloe, and Kourt previously went to Japan and Kim had a shit fit over their "ugly clown" looks (eg this pink coat and some teal eyeshadow....), going on about how they were embarrassing her. She is now wearing essentially the same fits on this visit years later. So they are rightfully calling her tf out lol  I'm glad, she was such a raging bitch on that trip. But Kourtney absolutely destroyed her by saying "you're wearing a pink wig and you dress like you're in the fucking Tour de France.... stfu and let us have *fun*." This was when I realized that altho Kourt is also shit, she is one of the only people in the family to see the insanity of it all. Love it for her that she's been able to largely disengage.
Which one?
Nope she looked absolutely gorgeous when she was pregnant with North. Her midi skirt era was her best fashion era.
That’s for regular people, not people who travel on private jets with their own doctors and can literally afford the best medical treatment no matter where they land.
You can fly safely up until 36 week with most airlines. I get that that is definitely a risk and I personally didn’t feel comfortable to do that when I was pregnant but what you’re saying is not really true. Women with normal, non-risk pregnancies are not at all discouraged to fly after 6 months. It’s really about what you’re comfortable with until 36 weeks when it’s no longer allowed.
He was higher profile and she totally bowed down at the expense of her identity. I’ll always wonder what would have happened without his influence.
That’s true. But I know people with private jets still have to go through the same protocol and international security checks that we plebs do
Yeah but if True was born in Japan, she would be a Japanese citizen lol.
Idk, honestly. I feel like she wouldn’t have gotten further into the whole law thing because I feel she wanted to prove him wrong. Everyone says she has no talent and I wonder if he plays off that. I wonder.
From what I can tell by years of reality tv watching: I think they just wait in the plane when they land and the customs people come to them, which is irrelevant to the pregnancy stuff, just wanted to add to reiterate that we’re poor and they’re privileged af
But true she could literally fly her Dr out to Japan, so  But it’s a 17 hour flight….. she might have had to hold that baby in!
I don’t think jus soli applies to Japan, I believe Japan falls under jus sanguinis
I think she could get citizenship from her parents but since she wasn’t born in the US or an overseas territory or a military base she could never be President. Which could happen they already had two candidates in the fam :)
Hard to say but she got her babies at least. I always hated her but started watching the show from the beginning and the family has grown on me. I’m only on Season 10 though.
Yup. You are correct.
I’ve been having so much fun with the wayback machine lmao lmk if y’all want other karjenners
You guys.. **Marilyn Monroe Style**  Wow..  https://preview.redd.it/m6f4pe0rvrra1.jpeg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1f8e9456aca85ff09af01c3cecfd42954447ece1
I love this throwback, oh and cars!
I miss the MySpace era so much
Aww the way she said “my daddy” where it says who her heroes are
Zoomers could never fathom the ruthlessness in how Millennials ranked the people in their lives 😂
I miss that style of blogging
Occupation: Princess, I can relate to
The second photo looks like AI
Oh wow I remember this and when when we found her eBay account and the clothes she was selling as  kimsaprincess
Omg! I had almost the same interests down to Tuesdays with Morrie! Hahha
Love how high Brody is in her top friends lmao
not her using brody’s name for clout during the hills era 💀
Texting sweet messages 💀
Did anyone else cringe when they read “kissing” under her general?
Kim’s Official GLAMOROUS Page! has me rolling 😂
second photo at the top 😧 no way that’s her
It’s the occupation: princess for me 😂😂
I just realized how chaotic MySpace was 🤦🏻‍♀️ what a time to be alive lol
Why is Brody Jenner number 2 on her top 12 friends?! And Kourt and Bruce are at the bottom of the list 😂 Maybe she was was trying to mooch off The Hills fame wave during that time
I want to see the rest of their Myspace's!
Imagine being 28 and writing like this ffs. Princess wtf. She's so cringe
I didn’t reach myspace at the time…I’m more of Friedster then eventually facebook 😂
She was so cute and cringe in her Jafar days lol
She look like a psychopath in that selfie
The most beige person ever 🤭
[removed]
Bruce 😂
This is alot huh
Omg doing God’s work, this is iconic. I was just thinking about how much I miss MySpace 😭 I learned how to code just so I could code my own layouts
Your username is *chefs kiss*
Im glad you are because you’re doing the Lords work my dear! I am curious about Kylie’s tumblr…
[removed]
Yes please!
Ain’t no way that’s what she was referring to 😭 pls tell me you’re joking this is tragic  Edit; I googled it and oh my god ain’t no way she called this Marilyn Monroe 😭
Ok that makes more sense I thought it said ears lol
Lol with zero shame too and we all just accepted it 😂😂😂
It looks a little like Celine Dion
YES hahahahaha. One of her many interests
I distinctly remember her looking like that though 😅
Weren’t the top 10 friends always in no random order?? Sry it’s been a hot min since I used MySpace so I can’t recall all the in’s and outs lol
So it really is a selfie then

Hahahaha yuuuup, that’s *most deffff* what’s she referring to in her blog post; the dates line up and she loved *this* pose that night. I looked thru her other pics from that night and the “pap” pics don’t get much better. At least she was with Reggie —> hella cute together.  https://preview.redd.it/v94sa25catra1.jpeg?width=1607&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=13cc5e24f34671c00d3e4213a0524d879b7832b4
Grown woman writing “kissing” under general is way weird.
No it’s not.
You need help if that’s where your head is at. Your mind needs a cleansing..
Women calling their dads “daddy” isn’t terribly weird to me. I think women will always be babies in their fathers eyes.  Grown *men* though? So freaking weird and so common in the south.
Yeah I find it disgusting too.
Kalifornia-Klasss
Ya this is tragic 😭
She embarrassing. I have secondhand embarrassment.
The sexualization of daddy is a recent thing that’s occurred through porn culture. If you’ve called your dad daddy your whole life it’s not creepy.
As a grown woman who’s daddy passed away 2 years ago, I disagree 💅🏻 it’s only weird if YOU make it weird. If you didn’t have a daddy just say that.
I meant “daddy’s girls” or just women who do hav whole relationships with their dads (like Kim did), not all women. And I guess this unpopular for the sub but I do think men and women are different 🤷🏻‍♀️ it’s not a bad thing in my perspective
I don’t think it’s creepy to call your own dad daddy *and* it was sexualized decades before 2007
Well whatever he did to make you so bitter, I hope you get through it ✌🏻
Well you sound quite the opposite to me and most other people here lmao. Very bitter and very unhinged and very upset that other people love their dads

we’ll know if they’re back together by the end of this month if she posts for his birthday   she’s still slowly deleting pics of him though
am i crazy or is it possible that they haven't been "together" in a monogamous sense in a long time? i remember around the time of Astroworld, there was that cancelled W magazine cover/interview where they described being in an open relationship.   i think that, much like Khloe and Kourtney, it is important to Kylie that her kids have the same dad, regardless of her relationship with the man. if she decides she wants to have more children, then yeah i think she and Travis will be "together" for that. but i don't see them ever having a serious relationship again - because i'm not sure they ever really did.
Contract ✍🏼
Trying but not succeeding

She might post for his birthday even if they are not together he is the father of her children
Non-monagomous relationships at Kylie's age (especially entering the relationship) and with kids reads more like gaslighting and manipulation. Maybe Kylie agreed to something like this out of desperation to seem cool and stay together, and keep her family together, but I doubt Kylie wants an open relationship.   This relationship reminds me of my own at this age. He held all the power and manipulated, used and mistreated me. Living exactly the life he wanted while I had to compromise and go out of my way to make things work.   We can say what we want about the KJs but somewhere deep in themselves they have low self worth because no healthy, well-adjusted adults I know put up with the toxic relationships they do, and sometimes I feel very sad for them.

^just ^one ^follicle
Vanderpump rules is amazing, loved Potomac and New York and about to start Atlanta nowww
Vanderpump Rules is 10/10, teen mom franchise as well as 16 & pregnant, young & pregnant, bad girls club 🤣👏🏼
I never used to watch any reality at all, used to look down on it in fact. Then watched the Kim Kardashian interview with David Letterman and thought (as a Media & Cultural Studies major) I should at least watch an episode or two. Watched one episode each from seasons 1-4. Then went back and watched all four seasons. Then the remaining seasons. Then the spin-offs. Then ran out and pivoted to RHOBH. Selling Sunset. Below Deck. Below Deck Med. Below Deck Sailing Yacht. Buying Beverly Hills. RHOM. And most recently My Unorthodox Life. To say it's been a journey would be an understatement. I'm obsessed!!
Vanderpump, start from S1
RHOBH, Selling Sunset, Bling Empire
I’m old so I’m still watching the MTV challenges & spin-offs with TJ Lavin lol and HGTV shows. Occasionally those dating shows & spinoffs on Netflix
Below Deck (and it's offshoots) has the best pacing of any reality tv show I've watched. They have enough content that they don't have to have half the show taken up by recaps.
Big brother lol  And the random trashy Netflix spin off of big brother
90 Day Fiancé, and the 74849 spin offs! It’s addicting.
The trashier the better...Teen Mom is my guilty pleasure 😂  Also the golden era of VH1 reality TV - Flavor of Love, I love New York, Rock of Love, Charm School, I love Money. You name it
Yes, all the housewives! Also you may like Below Deck (sailing yacht season 2&3 or Med) and ofc Vanderpump Rules as others mentioned
I no longer \~keep up\~ with the Kardashians, but am always here to recommend:     * VANDERPUMP RULES (my all time favorite reality show - seasons 1 through 4 are just lightning in a bottle) * Below Deck/Below Deck Mediterranean * Real Housewives of New York * Real Housewives of New Jersey * Summer House/Winter House * Survivor
Summer House is hot ppl partying in the hamptons every weekend. I recommend starting season 4 on tho! The first 6 seasons of VPR is the best reality tv I’ve ever seen🤌🤌🤌 & welcome to the housewives🫶
I’m a VPR girlie. ✨
VANDERPUMP RULESSSSSS scandoval leggooooo  ![gif](giphy|l0HUol0DROgoBFl6M)
Rupaul’s Drag Race, LAHH, and RHOA
Love after lockup, 90 day fiancé, southern charm
Big Brother, all of the cooking contest shows on Food Network.
Real housewives of miami. Real housewives of New Jersey. Real housewives of nyc. Real housewives of Beverly Hills. Those ones are like the upper echelon of the housewife franchise.  I find Salt Lake City super boring. Married to medicine is everything housewives was in the early years you will not be disappointed. 90 day fiance as well the earlier seasons are reality tv trash gold.   Can’t believe I forgot the GOAT- atlanta
I’m looking for new shows to watch on Netflix or Amazon Prime. Let me know any good reality shows!  I’ve watched Selling Sunset & Bling Empire
Real housewives of New York
I’ve watched A LOT of reality tv over the years. Some I’ll keep watching for long periods as new seasons come out (90 day fiancé, love is blind, 600 lb life), some I’m short term with (below deck, survivor, big brother) and some I don’t keep up with anymore (teen mom, real housewives).   My husband watches most with me so the ones he also likes are what I watch the most. Recently started on the bachelor franchises and he says he won’t watch them but he’s secretly following along if it’s on the screen.
Below Deck, The Challenge, Survivor, RuPaul’s Drag Race.. probably more but I’m drawing a blank rn
Did anyone else watch Marrying Millions on Lifetime? I liked that a lot but they only did 2 seasons. Hoping for more!
None. I don't like reality TV. The only reason I'm into the KJ's is because I was a Kanye fan for a really long time. Newsflash, not anymore lmao
Pretty much anything on TLC - 90 day and it’s million satellites, welcome to plathville, unexpected, sister wives, extreme sisters, seeking sister wife, and on and on and on
I watch a lot of the housewives shows (Potomac, Atlanta, NY, Beverly Hills, Melbourne, Salt Lake City, and just started Miami). Also started Vanderpump Rules again recently after the scandal that broke.
real housewives miami season 3+ is my favorite! larsa 🤔 is on it
90 day fiancé and summerhouse. And any reality show Paris Hilton is in.
RHOBH and RHONJ
90 Day Fiance, specifically the Ed and Liz saga
The Potomac housewives LMFAO I fucking love them, it’s literally so true the KJ’s give us NOTHING in comparison. I couldn’t get through the first season of the Hulu reboot, it’s such a snooze fest, they truly are in their flop era and I’m not even mad about it anymore. Next.
![gif](giphy|8Pdy3Dn7Wxd0jsRi21|downsized)  Vanderpump Rules!!! Never heard of it, then like a month ago everyone was talking about some guy cheating on his gf. Now I watched all 9,5 seasons and I’m f-Ing OBSESSED
VPR, Sister Wives, 1000 Pound Sisters, Below Deck and 90 Day Fiancé are my other faves.  I wouldn’t consider the new Kardashian show a favorite anymore.  It’s far less superior than KUWTK.
Most of the housewives, housewives ultimate girls trips, 90 day fiancé, dance moms, Darcey and Stacey, vanderpump rules
did anyone here watch milf manor? it might’ve been the one show to give less than the k’s do
[removed]
All bravo shows are amazing. I watch them  but the cooking one. #bravoholic
Real housewives - specially RHONY, RHOBH, RHOSLC and RHOD.   Then I tap in and out of Below Deck and Vanderpump Rules   Then out of bravo; Love Island when it’s on    Then Netflix currently Love is Blind but also Selling Sunset (bit over SS tho tbh)  I love Reality TV because it always feels so low stakes and easy to switch off to.
Real housewives, below deck, 90 day fiancé
All the below deck I can get
VPR is incredible. I also watch the Challenge, Big Brother, and any shitty reality show Netflix is currently making.
Real Housewives foreva
Below Deck, 90 Day Fiancé (on a break from that, I'm burned out), Love After Lockup, Rupaul's Drag Race, Hot Haus with Tiffany Pollard, Vanderpump Rules.  I'll always re-watch early 00s shows- VH1 "of Love" franchises, Girls Next Door, and the Anna Nicole Show. I just finished ANTM all the way through. I stopped watching around season 7 or 9 when it was current.
MAFS_AU … married at first sight, but specifically the Australia version. The American version is just lame
Selling Sunset
Baddies West, Love Is blind, 90day fiancée
VPR! I hate watch it! They’re all shitty people but very entertaining.
Housewives and VPR are the gift that keeps on giving. I had discovery plus for a while a d most of their shows are so trashy but so entertaining especially 90 day fiance.  Also love is blind on netflix and RuPauls Drag race on Paramount if you are more into competition
My husband would never admit to watching reality TV but wow does he love Below Deck!
Vanderpump rules & Southern charm In the early seasons are both reality Gold. 90 Day Fiancé & Gypsy Sisters if you want to see some real trash
During COVID I got into Southern Charm which led to vanderpump which led to Summer House which led to Winter House.
I would pay money to go back and watch vanderpump for the first time.
It’s a completely different show, and somewhat outdated, but I’m obsessed with dance moms right now
In addition to everything on Bravo (not exaggerating) I watch 90 day finance, married at first sight, love after lockup.
Drag race (not sure if that counts as reality?) and Love island (UK version only).
Darcey and Stacy and all the 90 Day Fiance shows on TLC. Not a bravo fan
90 Day Fiance, Love After Lockup, Love & Hip Hop, Darcey & Stacey, Teen Mom, Catfish, Extreme Sisters, Sister Wives, Seeking Sister Wives, Unexpected, Mama June, etc.
Literally everything lol! Currently on the housewives train working on finishing those up. Also watching vanderpump rules, I used to keep up with all of MTV ones but stopped cause it just seems like the same stuff over and over again. Netflix has good ones too selling sunset , selling Tampa, love is blind. Also love all of the Below deck shows
Below deck sailing yacht
Vanderpump Rules
Geordie shore and ex on the beach
Selling sunset. Real housewives, started with Beverly hills and now on jersey which is bonkers. Honestly ive watched loads of reality stuff but it's usually on in the background when I'm cleaning
Pretty much everything on Bravo. Not all of them but every housewife, Married 2 Medicine is also a favorite and of course Vanderpump Rules! Although right now I’m watching Love is Blind 4 because it sounds like a crazy season!
Shahs of sunset plsss
Beverly Hills and also i started Desperate Housewives, not reality tv but same drama its amazing(ly bad)!  Stop watching around season 4 tho, it gets really bad after season 5. You don't want to be around to see the decline
i've just started binging Vanderpump rules in light of the scandal
Selling Sunset
Oh what I’d give to be watching Atlanta for the first time again! Enjoy! 🎈
Omg first season of Atlantic is the BEST in the franchise
I'm watching through Atlanta for the first time, up to season 10 already. Entertainment GOLD. Nene is life  ![gif](giphy|mPpueSGxCsF68)
![gif](giphy|3ohc1gRsZXmekuHIbu)
![gif](giphy|QObMkqZqUs0Xm)
Wait we watch all the same shows! Except Bad Girls Club - adding that to my list because I trust you now ✌️ If you don’t watch the Real Housewives franchise, I love Beverly Hills, obviously, and then SLC is it’s own thing entirely. It’s winter, there’s Mormons, one of the housewives is married to her Grandmother’s husband, who she stole from her mom who was supposed to marry him (!!!) I think you’d enjoy it, since we’re TV twins.
I say all the time that I feel legitimately bad for people who think they’re above Bravo. They’re missing out on such a robust source of joy.  Idk if you offered an exhaustive list, but you absolutely *must* watch RHONY starting with the very first episode. Ditto Vanderpump Rules. Ditto Southern Charm.   The premise of Southern Charm didn’t appeal to me at all, and idek what my preconceptions were, but oh my god, the first several seasons are just… There’s a middle aged man who lives with his mom who plays guitar in a band called Renob (it’s Boner, spelled backwards, he helpfully lets us know). There’s a disgraced 50 year old politician hanging around a bunch of 20 somethings who hosts a dinner every season where he airs his grievances and they all flee in a golf cart. So much on-the-DL drug use. True absurdity.  I’d also *highly* recommend at least the first two seasons of RHONJ. Danielle Staub is indescribable.   I also really liked the US version of Traitors, on Peacock, which is hosted by Alan Cumming and features a half “known” cast- several Bravolebs, other reality TV people I’ve never heard of, and Ryan Lochte- and half normies. Some of these people are so dumb. No one knows how to spell anyone’s names. If you drink every time Alan Cumming says a version of the words “treachery” of “traitors”, you’ll be dead before the end of the first episode.
This is me but when I got sucked into watching Toddlers and Tiaras after having never watched reality TV previously
Lol you should try 90 day fiance
Agreed! So happy that a cheating scandal brought this amazing show into my life.
I just started watching VPR after hearing about the most recent drama. On season 3 now and I’m blown away by some of these characters and the decisions they make 🤣 100x more exciting than Kardashians could ever be
Yes bling empire is so juicy I love it
The challenge is a classic! I wish they had the spiinoffs on the normal MTV channel 🥺
Love the challenge! Wishing for the days of the last team in dailies automatically in elimination back though.
What I wouldn’t give for them to bring back The Real World
Yes was going to say Big Brother and Survivor
i had to walk away from 90 day after they put angela's abusive ass back on. last one i watched i couldn't even finish (angela post-wls)... it was just bad. they know they're on a show for clout at this point, but the 90 day shit was really good in earlier seasons - especially "the other way" lol
I would also recommend Big Brother and The Amazing Race if you like survivor
![gif](giphy|3KVKEGGmEPqtBSM5MQ)
Love after lockup is amazing! Haha. One of my favorites
Same!!!
Is that “Big Ed”? The absolutely most vile person to ever come out of reality tv?
Yes lol it was such a strange concept to me. Somewhat entertaining but still weird. Ngl Jose was the reason I kept tuning in each week!

Omg Girls Next Door was my favvvv!
Ooh yes Gypsy Sisters 😂 Nettie and Mellie were my favs lol
Is season one Lindsay Lohan daddy season or is that 2? I’m due for a rewatch, I miss those ladies!
I live in Atlanta. That show is real life 😂
This slap just sold me. I’m starting VPR right now
![gif](giphy|l2ZDXLiukfsbgvgzu|downsized)
Omgggg and Below Deck!! It’s VPR on a boat!
I’ll definitely give it a shot! I’m starting real housewives as soon as I finish vanderpump! Tv twins 👯‍♂️😁
You mean the Rob Dyrdek channel lol
I always FF her segments 🤢 she’s so disgusting to watch and listen to!
I don't think Angela will be back. You can look up why. This current season is the other way and it's great!
Tried Big Brother and couldn’t get into it but I still have never watched The Amazing Race! I’ll def check it out soon since I’ve heard mostly good things
THE one and only
jose is a cutie! honestly i kept tuning in to see which one of the “couples” would hook up first… then none of them actually did…. the relationships all felt soo fake 🫣
There’s so much gold on this show, you’re in for a great time  ![gif](giphy|JOS2rvtXUMBKdhGMqR)
accurate haha
Rip big
Agreed! Even after all thar botox and filler, she looks worse than leather 🤢
Definitely fake vibes all around!
![gif](giphy|eDgv1wPddY8IE)  My single mom always made sure I had a good birthday party. One year we had a sleepover at a hotel, a spa day, party at Pizza Hut. And we all got goodies after it was over. I’m glad she did that cause I just breeze past my birthday these days. Y’all truly do complain about everything baby these kids do not care.
do you think a five year old cares about the environmental impact of their birthday party or think that it’s “too much” ? esp considering this is normal for her since most of her friends and family have parties like this all the time
I don’t really get what was so crazy about the birthday party ? The only thing out of the ordinary was probably the backpacks but it’s like a party pack.
Of all the extravagance and excess the KJs go through, it would be nearly neglect for them not to do this for their kids. Within the scope of their lifestyles it's not a big deal. It's fun to watch as a fan too because these are my childhood dreams!!
I think part of what made it seem so excessive is how she tagged everyone that played a part in the party. Typically no one else ever credits anyone except mindy the party planner. Khloe showed the backpack station, the multiple little food/ dessert stands, the artist stations (which there were multiple of), and the professional photographers that take all the pictures. Also this party had an obscene amount of balloons compared to most I feel like haha
I just thought looking at it “what do these people think a wedding is if this is just a 5 year olds party?” But these kids are billionaires and are growing up in a world that we previously never had access too. They aren’t growing up normal and it’s hard for us to assess how this will impact them but what I hate is how normal people feel the need to throw things like this for their kids, maybe for big birthdays but you know the consumption is alarming and the impact on normal culture is alarming.
idk they seem used to it and expect it at this point
i get what you mean OP, it’s like every moment of their lives is made up to be this huge spectacle and celebration with extravagant balloon arrangements and decorations and gifts and party favours and activity stations etc., from christmas to birthdays to holidays (even on one day holidays like easter, valentine’s day, etc., they all get sooo many gifts lol).   i think for the kids it’s still fun to experience regardless of how exposed to these things they are because they’re still little and full of imagination and wonder. like even though they expect it at this point, it’s still exciting to see how an event will turn out making it somewhat of a surprise.   of course all of this is just their normal everyday experience so it’ll get to the point where these things aren’t that big of a deal anymore for them but i just can’t even imagine what it would feel like for them knowing everything i want is at my fingertips (even wanting to meet any celebrity idol of my choice) and nothing is really impossible
That party was nothing for Khloe but could have been a college fund for Love Rat's other baby mommas. I'm convinced all the siblings are in secret competition with one another so of course Khloe has to keep up with Kim and Kylie.
It’s ridiculously excessive and wasteful like all their parties.   And how inappropriate is the option to bring home a goldfish as a gift? W  I’m always drooling looking at all the food that probably doesn’t get eaten.
I think this excessive parties & holidays is just the norm for their group & most likely the vast majority of rich celebs. The karjenners are mostly the main ones who showcase regularly on their socials.
I think these kids will not grow up normal. Their life is even more insane than other rich kids and their familly is so toxic. Kids should not have everything. When you have everything by the time you are teen Like North seems to what is there to hope or work for. There is a lot of rich kids but Kardashian are just too much. Having parties like this, meeting your fav Singer or athete as you like it iz is not normal.
I would throw over the top parties for my daughter if I had the resources.
I think now that they started to do these crazy parties, they can’t stop because the public will immediately question why certain kids party’s are not as extravagant as the other, especially with daughters vs sons parties as that is already a favorite topic for the public
It’s so excessive. I literally skipped through all of Khloes stories. I couldn’t anymore
No need to imagine it because you’ll never be a kid again
And I thought they were cute. If I could afford all my parties would be like that.
i feel like they all love their excessive balloon decorations, but especially khloe, her party’s always seem extra balloon filled lol
Because the party was sponsored if she had to tag all those companies and such. just shows maybe they aren’t that “rich” as they seem to be
Hello, it looks like you've made a mistake.  It's supposed to be could've, should've, would've (short for could have, would have, should have), never could of, would of, should of.  Or you misspelled something, I ain't checking everything.  Beep boop - yes, I am a bot, don't botcriminate me.
They finna say a bunch of nothing in that sit down  https://preview.redd.it/fxfhx6ki2pra1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=96d67d4ebc889b21186b0bb5edf36e37530eb4b5
That sit down will be a waste of time for sure.
Choosing Kardashians as finale to end the show is laughable.. out of all people in the Hollywood
Variety wrote the OG article
Both need to go away
This episode should really be called "Asshole chillin with other Assholes."
It doesn’t look sound it’s a sit down interview:  https://preview.redd.it/8mrzyk5xcpra1.jpeg?width=749&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=15ade1ed24c7677ccd1fffc8a2c53f404b50fe70
The variety article says they will be doing a segment called take a break. Basically do normal people jobs with james
The Kardashians just going to talk about things we already know about 💯
I’m sure there will be spicy questions like ‘who is your favourite sister?’
Corden is besties with them...
Why tho? They're one of the most powerful celebrities in today's time whether you like it or not
Cosplaying poor as escapism ❤️
Such a disgusting concept 💀
Lol
Powerful in what sense?
She’s the new food god. He was PR as well at one point
She’s the new StephShep
Emotional support employee
Tracy and Kim have been friends for years and their daughters are good friends.   They’re coworkers but also good friends. Even when Tracy and Kim weren’t working together, they were often together.
Tracy is Kim's Yolanda Saldivar...
Something about that woman, Tracy is off for me… I can’t put my finger on it.
 She’s her handler
What happened to Kim & Food God?
Sounds like a toxic work dynamic
Yes!! I can’t stand her but idk why..
I call her Tag-a-long Tracey.
Nothing they’re still friends as far as I know. I just meant he doesn’t work PR for her anymore and I think he lives in Miami so she needed a new sidekick
No it doesn’t.
Why not
She’s friend with Kendall and grew up in LA. They probably know each other well
It's a beautiful song.

the videos that i couldn’t include were clips from that one episode when they went to Japan, and Kim was calling Kourtney and Khloe clowns.
Sorry northie you can’t be goth anymore. Mommy’s in her Barbie era 🎀👛💓
Omg north is almost as tall as kim 😭.
including the moment when she made fun of them in japan is nasty work
yes!! i love this so much the nails go so hard
![gif](giphy|DPqqOywshrOqQ|downsized)
I love the jacket !!
Some of y'all are gonna shit on this but she ate
Besides the sunglasses I’m here for the look.
I like her jacket
I love the milk carton bag 🥲
Kim used to wear sweats all the time and people hated on her 😂 so it goes both ways
In the last post, second pic, who’s the girl in the hot pink hoodie behind Kim?
Side note North is so pretty! I genuinely hope she doesn’t develop the rest of the family’s addiction to plastic surgery because I can already tell she’s going to be a stunner 🥺
I love pictures where Kim looks her height.
Does anyway know what that Hello Kitty milk carton bag North has is?  Edit: found it but not available in Aus. Also found a povo version on Asos but sold out.
Surely she could have found something better to wear under that amazing coat then sweatpants.
Kim is soooooo skinny now omg. Like she was before but now she’s not as “fleshy” as she was before that’s insane!
In love with Nori's hair
Does anyone know where Kim’s sweatpants are from?! I need them 😍
Definitely feeling that pink coat 🥰🥰🥰
40 something going on 12
Is something wrong with Khloe’s picture?
The one with the kids is cute and they all look great. I wish they would SMILE though!

I’m as tall as Kim and my 11 year old niece is taller than me 🥲
Right?! I wonder if those are press ons??
seriously, & i kind of love that she referenced their time in japan
She looks nice, but she didn’t do any eating
Ate what?
Her stylist Dani.
North looks so much like Kanye. Based on the TikToks and whatnot she's made, she's also an incredibly funnt child haha
Can you tell me where to buy it from? I’m hyperventilating 😂 I want it so bad!
what makes you say that? because of the pink? jw
Smiling creates wrinkles.
Wtf?
Wtf is wrong with you

No not because shes not smiling.
Then yes you’re weird. Get off Reddit and get a job
What does reddit have to do with a job? Why are you so bothered by my personal opinion
You’re hating on a child weirdo, spend that energy doing something else

Sloane and River-Jen Atkin  Ace-Malika  Christian and Celine-Khadijah   Not sure who Rae is but I doubt Khloe would name her baby that
I don’t think they’d slip up… tbh I think his name is Tristian Jr. which is a big part of why they haven’t said what his name is.
I actually totally forgot until now that we don't know her son's name 😂
I don’t think they’d ever slip up and leak his name unintentionally. They love to pretend posts are candid but they never are. Also I think it would start with a T.
I kept refreshing the sub waiting for someone to screenshot and post this. 😭😂
My heart stopped when I saw “Christian”, but then I read the comment that’s Khadijah’s kid’s name. Thank God.
There isn't one for Chicago.
I doubt she would have it up there at such a social media event even if it was semi hidden
oh my god, i forgot she had a whole other child.
Pretty sure the hard-to-see one says "North" and all of the boys have blue, teal, or yellow while the girls have pink, purple, or white.
I’m up in the middle of the night with my newborn exhausted. So, when I opened this I thought people were speculating that his name could be Dolphin. Lol I need some sleep
Stoney Clover station. Way to get everything for free.  Geeze, and these people could afford it.
Who is Dove?
Looks like it says North to me
She said it was a T name. Any guesses?
Absolutely no fault of the kids, but this all is so much waste for the family
Praytell how is a wall w backpacks hanging on it "out of this word"  These ppl are so annoying lol
These are really cute! Kind of ridiculous that they probably got it for free though.
i can’t think of whose child in the KJCU is named Christian but i’ve seen a lot of people theorizing that either Kylie or Khloe named their son that because it’s come up before…interesting
I bet it’s Christian it’s closer to Tristian. 😂
Two Princes?!
[removed]
Tahoe? The hidden bag..  not sure lol just a guess
[removed]
[removed]
If it’s Tristan Jr, perhaps they will call him TJ.
I think it’s North’s bag. Mason has one, she’s the only one I don’t see up there. Why would the baby have one?
I like the color of Reign and Ace's the best.
Oh awesome!! I was hoping someone would say this, I don't know their friends' kids that well so I didn't know the other names.
How come true, Rae and dream are the only bags with the extra patches on them
Sloane and River are such cute names
Did Khadijah call her kids Christian and Celine because she likes French names or is it a very tacky nod to big designer brands ?
Thank you for this. I was so confused lol
Same!!! She knows it’s going to cause jokes
They’re going to announce they’re back together, and then announce it’s Tristan Jr.  Or Tristan the II to be bougie 💀
Absolutely!
She is absolutely fried. All that money and no therapy to fix her stupidly lmao
I think so too
Omg Tristan Jr.... TJ Thompson
She said it would start with a T
Hahahahha love that
lol
Or Psalm.
She’s in Japan
Yeah I thought the same! But you never know
I think Kim and her daughters and Penelope are in Japan so, not at the party.
I want to be at that station decorating my bag so badly
Right?! She didn’t pay a dime for any of those. Must be nice.
Natalie Halcro’s daughter.
Tristian 😔
Trevor.   That would be amazing.
Khadijah’s child is named Christian
Kylie’s son is Aire
One is Tristan’s son with Jordyn and the other is Kylie’s friend Yris’ son.

I was right there with you, zooming in on the names to try to crack the code! 😂
Khloe mentioned that it was a station where the kids can customize the book bags with patches. I am assuming that the other kids hadn’t customized their book bags yet prior to the video being shot.
No idea! But also does anyone know who the extra Prince is?
From Khloé’s story, it seems like it was a backpack station where the kids can customize their backpacks. True, Dream, and Rae must have already did theirs before Khloe took the pic.
River is an adorable name! My dad has a dog named River and she’s the best 😂
only sloane i've ever known was a massive c\*\*\* sooo not so much for me haha but i liked it before
These are Jen Atkins kids
ever since i saw a comment someone left on another thread about how khloe was obviously naming him tristan jr. so another woman couldn’t use it first…definitely makes sense and would explain why she hasn’t announced
If they are back together, I don’t think they’ll ever announce. Khloe is already insecure about their relationship
On her IG story, there is one for Psalm, but I never saw one for Chicago. [See here.](https://instagram.com/stories/khloekardashian/3072241884483856228?utm_source=ig_story_item_share&igshid=MDJmNzVkMjY=)
Yris Palmer’s son’s name is also Prince.
Tristan's son with Jordan Craig is named Prince.   ETA: I just saw that there are 2 with Prince on it.
Sloane seems incomplete to me verbally. Like it’s missing a syllable or sound and just kinda falls out of your mouth. But I don’t actually dislike it? I just want to find a longer version and use Sloane as the nickname

I just saw a tiktok of them together again😮‍💨
Oh your right there is. Hmm I don’t know them, unless Chicago was decorating her bag when Khloe was filming the instagram videos 🤷🏽‍♀️
Maybe one for Dads house, one for moms?
Chicago was (is?) in Japan with Kim, North, Penelope etc.
Highly doubt they’d give him 2 backpacks, one for his ex’s house  As uncommon of a name it is to use, it’s not for them - there were 2 boys named Prince there   Prince is Yris Palmer’s sons name
Oh yeah I forgot about that. Then I don’t know why Chicago didn’t have a bag on the wall 🤷🏽‍♀️
Plus if they gave 2 backpacks to every kid there who’s parents weren’t together, that’d be 2 backpacks for the vast majority of them (kinda sad)   All the kardashian west kids, all the disick kids, all of trashcans kids (if they even all got invited, doubtful), Malikas kid, etc
there was some for Penelope
I know, I saw it in the picture. That’s why I just mentioned Chicago. She seemed to be the only one who didn’t have a bag.
I don't think she is. I think she's just posting her child.
i don’t think she’s subbin that man when she post Theo
i mean he (allegedly) paid for her to not have the baby so im not surprised that he doesn’t want to be involved with him  edit: he even told her he wasn’t gonna be involved (allegedly 🤔)  [source](https://nypost.com/2021/12/03/tristan-thompson-retiring-texts-revealed-in-paternity-suit/)  https://preview.redd.it/fpp3mglg1lra1.jpeg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=94092b88a2d9bfb05f2e2e875099acb86c96b14b  i don’t think she’s shading him and i don’t really think she cares if tristan spends time w him or not
Why would she hint when tlits obvious please
Tristan is trash no if ands or buts about it   BUT   You’re a whole ass adult who has access to the internet who knew he cheated on both baby mamas, was still “with” baby mama #2 still slept with him, knew he paid or tried to pay to get an abortion and then want to act all shocked pikachu that he’s not involved in the kids life. At a certain point you are also responsible for the situation you created for your child
Ugh I feel so much for this sweet baby (my baby Theo is his age). It goes without saying that Tristan is awful, but it really changed my opinion of Khloe. I can forgive her for taking back a cheater 20 times (she’s mostly hurting herself), but how the fuck can you be attracted to somebody that abandons their child? And they all protect this man and tell the world he’s a good father. It’s gross.   Say what you will about Maralee, but at least it looks like she’s protecting her child from the media circus unlike other people…
remember when khloe posted to [this](https://www.instagram.com/p/CpvjtE2PvFj/) to her ig for tristan’s birthday calling him “the best father” ? on the same day, maralee posted a picture to her stories of her cuddled up on the couch with theo. i think a lot of people didn’t catch this, but i definitely did.   and now on the same day that khloe posts about true’s 5th birthday party, maralee posts theo again.   it feels like maralee is subtly throwing shade at tristan’s lack of involvement in their son’s life by posting theo on the days that khloe is posting about tristan or their children. it gives, she's pissed at tristan for continuing to ignore their son together. and i don't blame her.
I mean, if that’s what she’s doing it’s really not healthy. She should move on with her life and try to be the best parent for Theo without Tristan. I wouldn’t force someone to be a parent to my child if they don’t want to be, first hint at not wanting to be present would be my sign to nope out of there. Children should feel wanted and loved, always.

I’m still laughing at him thinking he was only gonna pay a couple hundred dollars a month in child support if she had the baby 😂 now he’s paying her $10k a month and she doesn’t have to see his deadbeat ass
Maralee doesn’t give two shits if he’s around. She just wants the $$$$
[removed]
Children are so innocent and literally just get born into nonesense. It's actually really sad because those yearly months set in stone a BUNCH of things from attachment style (which has MASSIVE implications) to world view. Even something like single parenthood can set a child back emotionally etc. Just sad how we like to act so selfishly, it's not about "let me show the world I can be an independent mother etc" it's about looking at the research and what it says about what children need to thrive and blossom. And sometimes that will mean reevaluating your type from basketball player or rapper to a regular Joe who is trustworthy, consistent and reliable. Men like this don't change when they become fathers as much as they showed us the WHOLE  time they had traits that would make them terrible fathers, and we chose to ignore all the red flags.
All of this!
Lol b ready for all the people that are gonna b like it's Maralee's fault cause she shouldn't have had the kid in the first place cos she knew what she was getting into when hooking up w Tristan 🙃  As an educator, I'm always on team kid. At least Theo gets child support 🤷‍♀️ hopefully as both of Tristans other kids grow up they want to be involved in Theos life cos I doubt khloe would want to do so

I bet that’s why he keeps going back to Khloe because she can help pay his fucking child Support lol
10k is not a lot in LA. Jordy C got 40k years ago and Maralee initially ask for 50k a month, but the judge said hell no. She thought she was going to be balling off that child support but now she’s only getting enough to cover basic necessities. She played herself especially since that 10k is going to dwindle the older Theo gets.
If she was after the money, surely she would be doing the most to get attention clout chasing? Instead she’s really low-key & private.
That poor kid with two lowlife parents
im not taking tristan’s side but if mara lee cared about the time tristan spent with the baby these alleged threats would’ve meant something to her  ofc it takes 2 to have a baby and ideally tristian would’ve taken accountability but he didn’t and he told her he wasn’t going to and she carried on with the baby anyway

these kids aren't being socialized together at all. theo is the odd one out and i doubt his half siblings will ever care about him if their own father doesn't.   tristan is alienating his own son from the rest of his siblings and i can only imagine the issues this is going to cause in that innocent kid as he gets older, especially given how all of this is being documented on social media.
Why do y’all continue to act like Tristan didn’t have a 14 year NBA career and made over $100 million dollars doing that? He now has a job with ESPN so even with taxes he and Khloe have made just the same amount so why would she need to pay child support? Some are y’all are either really dumb or just don’t know how child supports works. Child support comes directly out of the parent’s bank account every month and the only way someone else can pay it is if you have a legal spouse with a joint bank account.
idk 120k a year not including work seems way better than most peoples situation
Tbh then she needs to get off her ass and work like kimmy said bc the kid is hers to take care of and she knew he wouldn’t be involved from the start like he told her. Ik 10k isn’t anything in California but if she has her own income then she should be doing ok with that in addition to the $10k
Is it 10k pre or post tax? Because if it's post-tax, that's plenty enough to live just fine in LA. Frankly even pre-tax that's fine; it comes out to roughly $5.6k a month which is enough to live comfortably as long as you have a steady income. Yeah you won't have a brand new Corvette or GX460, or a high rise luxury apartment but those are luxuries, not necessisties.
Yeah. A father forced to be in a child's life isn't a good father. He made it clear he wanted no part and Maralee continued the pregnancy, which is her right!  Theo has a mom who loves him and hopefully other loving adults in his life. He will be fine without tristan
[removed]
It might be nice in west bumblefuck but not in LA where to rent a decent place is going to cost you at least 5k-6k a month…
Can you imagine being Theo and growing up and reading the texts from Tristan to Maralee about how he wants no part in his life? That's gotta mess you up in some way
Agreed with both of you. It was her choice even knowing what she knew. She'll be both parents as expected, gets the $$ and moves on with life.

I think black hair suits her more
She needs to be holding a cigarette as the accessory to put this whole outfit together.
looks like the blonde is washing her out a bit
Why does she exclusively dress like a dirt bike  enthusiast now 😭
I miss when she dressed cute
she looks like she's having mid life crisis
What in the trailer park? Kourt please go back to long dark hair please
I forget her name but it's almost like she's morphing into Travis' ex
I wonder how long she's going to keep the blonde? Also if she's going straight back to black or to some fun colors.  I think growing out your roots can look okay depending on natural hair color and tone of blonde. With Kourtney she has to keep it maintained or else it looks messy.
travis lineup is fucked  ![gif](giphy|3oEjHAUOqG3lSS0f1C)
This subs fave is _definitely_ Kourtney K lol
She is every woman who’s been in a relationship over a year
I hope se goed back to dark hair soon
The audacity of that woman to walk around with Justin Bieber’s son.
Reign is starting to resemble Mason more now.
Blonde is not for everyone.
Reign is at the perfect age where you can have a conversation with them but they still want to hang out with you ❤️☺️
I’m not a conspiracy theorist but damn he looks like Justin
Well, at least you know these aren’t paid for pap photos? 🤷🏼‍♀️
i'm sorry but kourtney and travis look horrible. these two are too rich to be dressing like this.
They need to stop with the blonde hair. It’s not flattering for them at all. It definitely washes them out.
Me wearing my pajamas to go to the convenience store lol.
Kourtney it’s time to retire this shirt.
I love how much all their kids rock Adidas.
Ok I will be the first to drag this shit show of a family to the ends of the earth for all their fake shit and photoshopped paparazzi images. However, I’m really against dragging them when they just have a normal people moment and look like they do in real life without filters or ridiculous uncomfortable clothes. Because who amongst us hasn’t walked around looking like this! More of this should be encouraged and not criticised.  In saying that, let us not forget our civic duty of needing to drag them to the ends of the earth because they continue to filter everything, and post images that CLEARLY look nothing like their real selves.
This pic looks straight outta 2003.
I go back and forth on liking the blonde, but without the right lighting and retouching, it really ages her.
Ever since someone said reign is kourt and justin biebers lovechild i cannot unsee it.
Personally, I don't agree with bleaching kids hair before puberty... not enough research about possible side effects.  Not to mention it really washes people out.
I love the roots! And, Reign looks adorable, too , much like a young Justin Bieber.
County Faircore
I would walk passed them at Walmart and not think twice
Kourtney Karen kardashian
Did they go to True's birthday party yesterday?
What in the Justin Beiber did they do to Reigns hair ?
I don't know why, but these photos scream "The honeymoon phase is over" to me.
That specific hair shade with their skin tone complexion is such a pet peeve of mine when it comes to people going blonde, just washes them out completely.   It’s giving Dog the Bounty Hunter.
Jon and Kate + 8 vibes with that hairdo. Yikes
Why does she look like trash omg
 Awww cute, she’s wearing his shirts.
Why does he look exactly like teen Kendall Jenner omg
Aww man . The blond is washing her out
Sigh this look is not… it
Too bad she has no sense of an individual identity and exists solely for whatever travis desires. It's also sickening to dye your kids hair when tht they're young. She is the WORST mother out of all of them.
She looks like shit
My god she has deep issues
They look like a normal family tbh
She looks trashy af
I honestly don’t know how celebs just go out in public looking like this…I don’t know maybe it’s a cultural difference because as a European no one is oils be caught dead in flannel pyjamas out in public if they were a nobody let alone a celeb that would be photographed. Like it’s the exact same effort to put black sweatpants on just as comfortable but looks so much kore put together. Kourtney looks like a cracked at t
white trash core
I’m enjoying the Kurt Cobain aesthetic
 A rare sighting of Karen Kardashian.
Since when did pyjamas become a trend!? 🤔😐 Sorry, Kourtney! You can do better than this 🤷‍♀️
dude looks harsh
Kourt has $90 billion and still dresses like she shops at my local Goodwill. Bring back fashion icon Kardashians!
She looks way older here
She’s really holding on strong to this disgruntled emo teen pajama look
Kourtney “Worst Era” Kardashian Barker
As a family who only rides Honda I want that shit 😅
jumpscare 🫣
i love that she's not following her sisters anymore, and it's her own person. no need to be glam and be perfect 24/7
Not digging the hair but each to their own. I hope she is happy ❤️
I hate this for her😩
I love her more and more. I love this ”I live for myself and my family” attitude. She is not here to please everyone 24/7 but to also hear her own voice and explore her style anyway she wants. I. Love. She’s cooler than before.
Looks like they’re headed for a parent conference with the principal
That’s not Kourtney that’s Karen
Yeah I hate it
I'm actually kind of obsessed with how trashy she looks now lol
She kinda looks pregnant in these pictures
None of them want to acknowledge that they are brunettes.  👩🏻👩🏻👩🏻👩🏻 no matter how badly they want blonde to happen. 👩🏼👩🏼👩🏼👩🏼
Holy bleachness!
I wonder if reign likes to sing
She looks pregnant
Are they always together?
[removed]
I dont hate her hair i hate reigns hair
It’s kinda nice to see her look like shit. I’ve barely seen her in the press lately. She’s embracing her new life, I think it’s cool
I like Kourtney as blonde and love Reign as blonde too!
That kids looking a lot like Justin and not Scott
GRAMMA
The photos make her look pregnant. I know I know but it just does for me.
i feel like imma flip flop between liking it and not liking it depending on how it’s styled…
I like how she’s so specifically granola, yet supports applying bleach to her and her children’s heads.   More importantly, just doesn’t suit her at all.
The blond makes her look her age, whereas with the black, she can pass for about 10 years younger. I don’t like it.
She needs to blend the roots so it’s not as harsh
1000%!
I think the blonde looks great but not with roots.
Seriously, she looks so aged in these photos 😵‍💫 hate the  Karen blonde
It’s giving People of Walmart.
This makes me feel like it was 100% Travis’ idea.
I like that she’s finally in a relationship where she can relax without getting dolled up.
And eating a bag of hot Cheetos
i was just thinking to myself she looks like a 90s cigarette mom
And a Big Gulp tucked under her arm.
I think the lighting is bad too, she has a grey tint to her skin in these pics.
She should just go hot pink atp
😂😂😂 this is so oddly specific yet accurate
It’s giving Ohio
She's in her frumpy mom era. No hate, no shame, I feel like a lot of moms go through this with kids at that age.
I believe Travis is really into bmx/dirt biking/racing etc… and is a big part of his aesthetic. He has several car themed tattoos as well.   I get it. I have several Navy tops and hoodies from my husband and I even wear his boot camp Navy shorts when running around the house, and my favorite is the lapel pin denoting his rank he bought me. It’s not exactly the same, but I can understand her enjoying his aesthetic and enjoying his hobbies with him that way, if I’m making sense lol.  🫶🏻
She had the best style out of all of them 😞
Hahaha
I’ve said it from the start. I get shit for it every time I say it but I dont care. Even Stevie Wonder could see this! He even used their initials when he proposed just like with Shanna. Same songs, movies, the way she dresses, the way he acts with her.. it’s literally Meet the Barkers 2.0!
Shanna Moakler
Oh God I’ve said this from day one, why didn’t I realise this with the peroxide blonde 🤦‍♀️
Shanna Moakler!!! Yesss
I see it too.
  ::NBA:
His lineup is a bunch of tattooes and even so it's jacked. Yikes.
If this was Kim caught slipping out here looking like this (which is fine imo), this post would have racked up at least a 1000 comments saying how she fell off, washed and in her flop era blah blah blah. Kourtney is definitely their fav.
Definitely, she looks silly and haggard and these comments are pretty tamed. Let this have been Khloe or Kim though lol
😭😭
Travis is literally wearing normal clothes idk what you are expecting from an old drummer lol
I dunno, maybe I’m weird but if I were rich af I’d still dress like a bum running errands out and about and what not.
No matter how much money you have it’s not illegal to want to be comfortable and just throw on whatever you want
What if they just wanna be comfy and not care? That’s me on the daily. I respect it!
The outfits are probably planned by stylists in advance.
The person you replied to said they both look horrible. You replied to say Travis looks normal and then I added in replying to you both by saying that kourtney looks horrible. I’m agreeing with the person you’re replying to and disagreeing with you because I assumed you left kourtney out because you did not agree. What is so hard to understand here
I have never left my house in pajamas with uncombed hair. But I also don't live in America, so I don't know if that's common over there.
I came here to say this now I see Justin when I look at him 😂
Kourtney and Reign was there as she posted on Instagram. Travis I have no idea if he was there.
They bleached it.
She just needs a brown sweater and a cigarette lol
was just about to type that she reminds me of Kurt here.
Was my first thought too.
I mean, they’re married…I’m with my husband most of the time, too.

It just ages her terribly  I only like it in photoshopped pics
This is giving Karen
And the lighting and the filters
It's obviously organic bleach! /s
That’s the first thing I thought! Like she wouldn’t wear deodorant when she was pregnant now she’s dying his hair?
Yeah yeah no roots and it’s good on her
Hah yesss it is!
![gif](giphy|3osIrq5pnB4TyXbxiC)  Literally spot on
What does she wear that isn’t?
CrAkron vibes 😭😭
Hey now!
Lmao this killed me
I’m 31 and in a frumpy mom era with no kids 😅
I feel like the frumpy mom era is usually when they’re toddlers/babies and you’re dying for sleep and that’s when she looked her best lol. This just started like last month?? Maybe she’s just trying to be comfortable but it’s ALWAYS dirt bike shirts lol. Switch it up a bit a regular baggy tee/crew neck is comfy and frumpy too
Immediately thought shanna.  https://imgur.com/gallery/7IGxIBX
Don't forget Travis and shanna used to be loud about true romance being their favorite movie. It's  so weird
THIS!! never understood how everyone likes kourtneys hair saying “she does blonde better than Kim”. Maybe in highly edit photos that wash her skin out yes but in real life no. They both can’t pull it off with their undertone and I still stand by kourtney being the least likely to pull off blonde
It's someone they can relate to 🤷🏼‍♀️
She’s in flannel pjs….the kind you get at Walmart for $7 it’s gross and if any other sister wore it y’all would tear them apart
I’m originally from Eastern Europe and back in the day I would have rather died than leave my home looking anything less than “perfect” and that goes for everyone. But I’ve lived in Australia for many many years now and will leave home looking like pure shit at times. It’s so culturally acceptable here. Today I went grocery shopping in slides, trackies and a huge tshirt, no bra, hair a mess and I was one of many who looked like that. My very European mother still dies a little inside when she sees me like that. She was too old when she came here and will never change. I however am a liberated woman 😂
I can’t imagine the dependency have with their spouse. I like being independent.  Too each their own I guess.
Thats what I thought tbh the way its styled here really is giving Karen
😂😂😂
True that
I’ve got a 22 year old and I’m frumpy mom AF right now. I have 5 between 22 and 7. So, I’m just accepting it.
Ummmm, holy fuckballs😳 This is seriously creepy to me. I’ve truly said from day one he is redoing his marriage to shanna and turning kourt just like he did shanna. She went from a cute fun pretty type model to exactly what kourt is. She started dressing more punk too. I get that people don’t change a drastic amount with how they love someone or show their love but honestly it’s really weird seeing them both(relationships) play out. I hope he doesn’t hurt kourt but he is love bombing TF out of her!
Omg that is so flipping creepy!!!
Oh woah
wait so do we think travis “encouraged her” to go blonde?
And they even dressed up and did photo shoots as the actors. Then the nightmare before Christmas and skeleton theme crap. All done with shanna before! She even wore a white with black ribbon for the wedding. Travis wore a pinstriped suit. And their colors were red/black/white just like kourtney in her little black outfit before the wedding🙄 It’s wild to me!
I second this!
This entire thread is people commenting that Kourtney looks awful, how are y’all even coming up with people favoring Kourtney to Kim lmaoooo
honestly yes. This is exactly the fit I use to drop off my my child in school or quick grocery trip. Minus the glasses which makes it worse. walking around your neighborhood in casual clothes without makeup seems fine and normal.
where in my comment was I talking about Kourtney, please point it out
Girl me too mine’s 11 and I’m pregnant, I’ve always been a frumpy mom lmfao. I’m just saying Kourtney was never like that so I feel like this is just a style phase more than a mom thing
Let's be honest Shanna and Kourtney looked alike even when she was darker-haired—nothing to do with morphing. I actually haven't seen Shanna dressed as Kourtney has been with this dmx biker look.
Goes more so to the pretty girl thing, typical people can't relate because most people simply aren't conventionally attractive. It's not the fit, it's what she looks like. For example, if Kim wore that exact fit, with her blonde hair that everyone despised because she looked "horrible and old", and looked rough, these comments wouldn't be forgiving and they'd be happy, because she's "the pretty girl" lol
I’m more so adding on to the conversation as the comment you replied to mentioned them both I was not not attacking your point? Why do you people take everything so personally on here
>typical people can't relate because most people simply aren't conventionally attractive  What? What does the "pretty girl aesthetic" have anything to do with this? It is very easy to relate to someone who dresses casually to do mundane tasks because that is how most people behave. Nobody in here is going out of their way saying she looks amazing and/or that this is fashionable just because she is conventionally pretty. She looks normal.     The only reason why Kim would likely be "judged" differently as the original comment pointed out is that she overdresses for casual activities so it would be a huge departure for her based on the image she has portrayed for so long.
“Die hard feminist” 🤣😂😂😂
uh huh. I purposely neglected to talk about Kourt because I think it’s odd to say Travis looks horrible for wearing normal clothes. what would you be adding to that line of conversation by going back to talking about Kourt looking “gross”
Sorry to break it to you but my relatability comment has nothing to do with what they wear.
I know common sense is not common but pointing out and disagreeing with the differences in how people speak about certain women using their physical appearance against them is literally feminism lmao
Wahhh wahhh you’re a sad girl every comment you make here is putting people down and insulting them. You legit need to step outside and touch grass 😫🤣
Sad? Aren't you the one crying about me "insulting and putting people down"? The IQ of people who inhabit this sub never ceases to amaze me  ![gif](giphy|j9mqKgQvkNOziGICfd|downsized)
Wah wah wahhhh clearly I struck a nerve, the truth hurts don’t it?! Keep the insults coming, Mar-bella who’s newly married but spends most of her time trolling this sub cause God forbid someone doesn’t worship the ground her idol Kim Kardashian walks in 😵‍💫 the parasocial relationship is out of control 🤣
LMFAOOO martha tweetin that 💀
Lmfao did she actually tweet that?
I love Martha for this. He must’ve beenLIVID calling Kim
The way his face is perpetually just this 🥴
What did he do to piss Martha off?!
He’s Kim butt sniffer  ![gif](giphy|85UIMa40gXZwA)
He just looks like he smells like dog food
Lmfaooo I love this for dog food.
Aaaaahahahahahahahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!
He’s the worst for fake followers and likes on instagram.
he looks like timothee chalamet kinda
OMG the other day I was at dinner, and my mom asked me who "the god" something was. I immediatly thought of "The Food God". She meant  Charlamagne tha God LOL.
Wow it’s real, I love Martha so much more https://twitter.com/marthastewart/status/745685639153197057?s=46&t=CujRmNLchUSwtbJAqQtlWQ
🤣💀
He looks like Timothee Chalamet if Timothee Chalamet accidentally fell off the side of a building
That’s an insult to timothee
Take my upvote.
🤣
I’m shaking laughing I can’t stand him lmaooo

Living for the horse content and honestly surprised Kendall washes her own horse lol
I find it very endearing when people have hobbies that they are passionate about, I love how Kendall really loves her horses and it’s also a way to bond with her neices considering she’s the only sibling that doesn’t have kids 🥺
Kendall’s horse is so beautiful!!
Awww Kendall washing her horse is cute
She posts soooo much more when he and Travis aren’t together
“You have a heart on your back” - it’s a saddle mark!! Someone groom that pony after riding please 🥺
I thought the horse was giving a side-eye for second!
This is so cute
Is Kendall’s horse at Kylie’s barn at her house then?
can’t take the horse girl out of her
I took like 3 riding classes and each time they made us groom the horse both before riding and after. Like I paid money to groom the horse and clean it's stable. Maybe I was bamboozled or maybe it's horse etiquette, idk. The horse never kicked me in the face so I choose to believe the latter lol
I'm so surprised, I can cut cucumbers but DEF NOT wash a horse... nope.
I’m wondering if Kendall will do it after, she’s super defensive about horses. Also wonder when it was ridden last if it’s stormi’s horse
No it's clipped is, we clip the coats and leave an area for the saddle. I'm a groom, this a just a fancy shaped clip
Haha yeah I used to be an equestrian growing up and we always groomed, tacked and untacked before and after our lessons. I thought it was fun!
It’s important to bond with the horse. I have always casually ride but all my friends who are very “in it” take care of their horse themselves (for what their competence allow them). So yeah seems to be a horse people thing
I had a similar experiance during sleep away camp. I was promised we would get to ride horses eventually. The entire reason I chose to attend that camp. First, we had to learn how to care for them.. I was there for two weeks and road a horse one day.
What does that have to do with anything… she is just washing her horse. Not everything is a pr stunt
or maybe it’s not that deep…
I remember when she bought that pony, it’s older and deserves a chill life. A very appropriate first pony despite the price tag. It’s also incredibly adorable!!
I would think that Kendall (or a groom more likely) was probably about to, im more so just making fun of Kylie calling it a heart on its back!
I enjoyed spending time with the horses, they seemed to appreciate the grooming and cool down so I didn't hate it. I didn't grow up around horses so it was an experience I guess. I can see why horse girls become horse girls. It's a commitment for sure.
It definitely is a good size and if Stormi likes riding it helps a lot in the long run!
I bet Kendall actually would do it if she enjoys horses - I always stopped by the other stalls on my way out after riding lessons hahaha. Kylie seems shocked that Kendall is spending her Saturday washing Arizona so I feel like she has a little less connection to horses (but Kendall and stormi have a cute bonding moment then)
Yep in her Jay Shetty (or whatever) interview she says she takes stormi on the weekend to ride her horse with her. Probably a good connection between them.  Kylie rides too just not as much as Kendall and is not as interested in it but Cait raised them both to ride horses
Jewel tones are perfect on her.
u/Successful_Main_2018 requested this like 6 months ago and I forgot to post it....so here it is finally!!!! The request was for emerald and yellow, but I felt so bad that I forgot to post it, that I went crazy w/ the colors and also edited that darn boob hand out and edited some of the makeup!  #
I think it only looks good in the dark jewel toned colors. With the lighter colors you can tell they are edited.
the black and red one is a slay
For me the problem with this look was that she looked too stiff. I wouldn’t have styled the dress with that necklace. She also wore so much makeup that day so perhaps if it was more a natural makeup look with wavy relaxed hair the necklace could have still worked… idk tho. It was just all too much going on. Especially the makeup hair necklace combo.
The gold is stun.ning.
Gold, emerald, and red are 🔥
emerald ruby red and the original
Pink, purple, champagne, and black. Good job!
Champagne is number one imo actually. I love the way you changed the makeup on that one as well!
I love the pale green on her
I agree, although I do love the black w/ red one too!
True, it's pretty hard to take something so dark and lighten it, well at least for me it is, I haven't been photoshopping for that long!
That's my favorite one too! I added the belt, makeup and added the flower to her hair and I freaking love it!
I don't think I can say I completely disagree with that assessment lol
I love the gold one 💛
![gif](giphy|3o6Zta8uDkLWuLcUuc)
Thank you!
I also really like the lighter makeup on her!
I had to go back and look (I made this a while ago & didn't look to closely when I posted) but I really do like that one too! My personal fav is the blk w/ red belt & I hate the white and turquoise ones (those could partly just be my fault on a bad editing job, but I don't like them)!
I don’t know anything about Photoshop so I’m not one to talk!!  When I first saw the post I misinterpreted and thought you were asking for a critique on your Photoshop! So if I came across as rude I apologize! 🤗
She reminds me of a vampire queen🖤
Oh no I didn't think you were being rude at all! I'm still new at this so all critiques good or bad are more than welcome, always trying to improve, I was just agreeing w/ ya that the lighter ones do look shopped lol! All good here, you have nothing to apologize for, I'm sorry if I made you think you needed too!
Just making sure because I think it can be rude to give somebody a critique if they weren’t asking for it! So I was just making sure!
I mean True is his daughter. I think it’s ok for him to be at her birthday party.
What a NICE suit
ugh tristan went to **his own daughter’s** 5th birthday party 🙄🙄  as if he wouldn’t get dragged for NOT attending her birthday party
Tristan is literally her father lmao why wouldn’t he be there??
Who is this little boy? I think Kris looks fabulous in pastels.
is this little boy one of the malika’s sons? he’s so cute
oh good lord are we encouraging him to be even *more* of a dead beat? how is it objectionable that he attend his own daughter’s birthday 😭
I mean yes he’s an asshole but it’s his daughter.
Okay but I LOVE this yellow suit
Alert the news a father went to HIS CHILDS birthday party
That’s such a cute suit
Why 'ugh'??  That's his daughter.  Not defending him, but he should be there.  It's about True, not him.
Everyone else has covered TT, but I'm glad to see Scott and Khloe are still friends. Even seriously flawed people need a support network.
Kris got the memo! “Wear pastel and match the cotton candy.” She looks flawless.
Boo I’m sorry but this post screams touch grass. It’s just a dad going to his daughter’s birthday
Kris looks a lot thinner
Kris looks great. A little orange but still great!
Umm why am I obsessed with that suit?!? Jesus that’s beautiful
Awwww he’s soooo cute
I love Kris’s suit!
Guys I hate Tristan too but like…..I hope he goes to his daughter’s birthday party? Her feelings about her dad are really important and she probably wants him there lol
 im wonderin why they did the bday party early
Why is kris the godmother lol
Kris is so sweet with the babies though, I’ll give her that.
You guys are ridiculous…..as a child of divorce YEAH the father is ALWAYS INVITED to their child’s birthday? Unless it’s a saftey issue that is still the father regardless of what the parents are going through.
Do you know how coparenting works?
Why do people act like this is so insane? No matter what a POS he is - he is still the father and should be there. It’s about the children, not the adults.
Is the scott far left in the background?
ok kris is goals. i legit can’t hate.
Meanwhile I’m like grouchy over the shoulder pads on her jacket. I never wanted to see those return 🤣
Wait… why is Kris Malika’s son’s Godmother? Hahahha what did I miss
I think it’s good Tristan is at his child’s birthday party. As for Scott him and Khloe have always been friends. Scott has also been part of the family for years and his children are trues cousins so it makes sense that he would be there. I’m my family the only time an ex who has children in our family isn’t invited to something is if they are horrible to their ex partner.
aww kris is ace’s godmother
Ok Kris! The Van Cleef 💅🏼
Omg I couldn’t love this Kris Jenner pantsuit more if I tried. 💚
He’s already a deadbeat who ignores his other kids you want him to ignore this one too?
If there was ever a perfect Kris Jenner outfit, this would be it. It looks like it was made specifically for her. I wish I had the dough to get everything custom tailored like that. She looks amazing.
What filter does everyone use to smooth themselves? All the influencers use it
Am I the only child of divorce who had separate everything because my dad refused to be any where near my mom🧐 and that seems to be normal for me and others from separate households.
Orange you glad you got a spray tan?
Now let’s not discourage a father from being around his own daughter…some of you sound way to entitled to say when this man should and shouldn’t be around his kids. Let’s get real
I don't think people are angry at Tristan for being at his daughter's birthday party per se. Again, people are pointing out how he's so involved with ONLY the children of Khloe's. He barely recognizes any of the other children but never forgets about True. If the tables were reversed with him and his children and he ghosted True and the other one Khloe had while constantly posting Prince and Theo, some of you would be out for blood.
There are pap videos of Khloe with Tristan daily. They are together.
Off topic but ugh, I hate the all white ensemble
Well yeah he is true’s dad and they’re probably back together
Kris is blackfishing in that photo
sup lil nigga ✊🏿
True's shoes look huge.
[removed]
[removed]
Is that True with Kris?
This color looks amazing in her!! Love the suit
Lol wtf it would be way worse if he didn’t attend 😂 as a child of divorced parents having them both attend the same events amicably is the better option
[removed]
Gotta say I do love Kris’s pastel yellow suit. Super cute
Kris looks like shes getting too skinny too
Right? I don’t know why people are acting this way. All of the exes get invited to their parties.  This is his child. My parents have been divorce for 25 years and still celebrate birthdays/Xmas all together.  That’s healthy co-parenting
Came here to say this. I would be saying “ugh” if he wasn’t there to be honest. The kid deserves to have both parents at her party! What is wrong with some people on here?
As someone who has almost 16 years of "co-parenting" (using this term pretty loosely) I would have LOVED for my daughter to have been able to have one birthday party with BOTH of her parents in attendance. BUT sometimes when the other person stops being cool for whatever reason and you know having them at the party is more trouble and drama than it's worth, they don't NEED to be there.  The other parent can have a party too. Long comment short... I guess I can see it from both sides. They get along and it's best for the kid in this situation. But I just wish Tristan was there 100% for True and not 50/50 True/Trying to win Khloe back (just kidding they're already back together 😭)
At first I thought this was Malika's son birthday based on the pic, but...it's True's? Her dad should be there....as well as her uncle, like WTH lol
I mean Khloe made a big ass deal about not inviting him to that one party of true’s. I don’t think this post is necessarily about him being there and more about the fact that they’re clearly back together
Funny,people were so up in arms about Kanye last year but then it was:  "Why does he need to be there! He can do another one after!"
I agree Kris looks amazing!! I usually feel her looks are drab.
Yes! Totally not her usual matronly shape flowy dress.
Indeed he would. Not sticking up for the cheater but he really can’t do right in the public’s eye no matter if he is in or out of the kids lives.
This. Now I personally think they are together so it’s neither here nor there for me really, but, I find it such a weird  take when ppl get angry that he’s around for the kids events. The man is a serial cheater. He’s not abusive, or harrassing her. From the looks of it he’s a decent dad to THEIR kids. Regardless of what is going on in their romantic life, they’ve chosen to co parent cohesively. They’re putting their child first and providing her with memories of family and positive togetherness. I think that’s really admirable in todays world and it’s weird so many people would have in issue with a father being around in a positive capacity for his children.
Malala’s son. He’s adorable 🥺
[removed]
One of the malika’s. ☠️
Look up her tiktok! The videos she posts Of him are ADORABLE
on tiktok, he's the CUTEST!
Yes!! I’m so glad he was invited and showed up
I mean she is 67 sometimes you get thinner as you get older
I thought the same thing. I wonder if she is sick w something?
Maybe cause next weekend is Easter
Why not
$$$$
Yeah
Prince is always at the bdays too. Maybe there are some rules around photos from his mother. Theo is a different story.
And he’s still cute
So what are you saying? What’s wrong with him looking like his father? And what is it that other people see that you don’t? This is a very weird comment, he’s a literal child
ion know why you gettin downvoted, that boy definitely look like OT

He is trash as all hell but he is going through a hard time right now and ngl I would side eye the Kardashians if they were pushing him out completely right now. Does that mean he should be taking advantage of khloe? Hell no! If he could just leave her alone and take the same role Scott has in this family, shit would be fine.
Damned if they do, damned if they don’t
Yeah but Kanye was harassing and borderline stalking Kim. His behavior was (is) unhinged. Tristan is a shit partner but as far as we know he doesn’t give Khloe any reason to feel unsafe around him.
Also Kanye wasn't invited. The family didn't want to interact with him and cause drama at the party. Tristan is A LOT of things, but he has never openly harassed or cause drama at Kardashian events so I would guess they feel more comfortable inviting him, regardless of what his relationship is with Khloe right now
I mean the difference was last year Kanye was harassing Kim and her then boyfriend online for weeks.   Kanye’s behaviour is why he doesn’t have the relationship with the K’s that Tristan does. We know how quick they are to forgive the men usually.
I’m pretty sure Ye wants zero to do w/ that family anymore unlike Tristan & Scott who are obsessed w/ being around them
he is a bad person
Malala? Or Mallika? Lol
He’s sooo cute
That’s amazing! Yes he is.
Is Kris Jenner the god mom?

Love that Kris is god mother to him
Probably just on the same body trend as her daughters
She's older than his mom. U would rather make someone whose closer in age
Don’t pay that person any mind. For some weird reason they hate when Tristan is pictured or spends time with True. It may be because they hate Khloe and think she is forcing Tristan to spend time with her kids while forbidding him from seeing his other kids. They directly place blame on Khloe all the time. Meanwhile, Tristan is very much present in Prince’s life and he’s is around his little siblings and even Khloe often. Like you said Theo is a different situation and that’s only for Tristan to worry about, not Khloe.
My point still stands and your last sentence exemplified it.
Maybe cause of the emoji used
Didn’t they ask him to take a drug test before coming too? Says a lot about the mental space he was in…
And good for them because Kanye is a raging racist. Whether he stays away from them or they stay away from him, they’re winning.
Lol it autocorrected 😭  I meant to say Malika
Look like it going by Malika’s caption.
Malika knew what she was doing appointing a kardashian/Jenner as a godparent to her son
That is not Tristan’s child.
I have never, ever placed blame on Khloe! Never! If you can point out where I've EVER blamed Tristan's inability to be a father to ALL OF HIS CHILDREN on Khloe, I will openly apologize to you on this forum. If you can't, I'd suggest you put up or shut up and two- stop shittin' on Kim in your quest to try to big up Khloe! Even I can give a positive about any of the rest of them at any given time. Meanwhile, YOU seem to give shade mainly to Kim while kissing Khloe's butt. Give it a rest, girl.
Kim had more kids with him after he said “slavery was a choice”
You had me thinking this was the child of Malala Yousafzai lmfaoooo
I think you’re right and that is so strange to me.. lol  why wouldn’t she make it khloe or really anyone else
yeah… but why not khloe? 🤔
I know. He's malika's child
And he still had a huge fan base after he said that (people constantly defending him and saying that’s not what he meant) and kept making money from people who bought his shitty brand of clothes. I mean shit, at least she had the excuse of being his wife at the time and I can see that maybe she wanted to try and make it work because they’re married and already had children. You seem to be a Kanye fan and back him and you have no connection at all with the man. Can I assume you agree with the things he’s said and his views?
Sorry 🤣😭
Screaming 😭
Lmao 😂😂
Yeah feels fame grabby to me. Like she's hoping Kris will hook him up somehow and make him famous
maybe she’s got enough god children? Idk. But Malika went for the top lol
Ah I see now - thought you meant she’s older than Tristan’s mum. Still, I think godparents are more symbolic than anything. I can’t really see Kris Jenner taking this child in as her own if both his parents were gone and she were still alive and well.
I don’t back shit he said I don’t own any Yeezys so I didn’t have to get rid of any Yeezys. Kim is the one still wearing Yeezys and still supporting his “brand” like a fan after the anti semitism rants
I’m crying I was like when did she have a child? And why is she friends with the Kardashians 😂😂😂
I was truly so confused but was just gonna accept it 😭😭
Yeah exactly it’s just weird
Now that would have been such a random link up 😭😂
It wouldn't be the first time a completely out of the blue person showed up at a KJ event.
She even deleted pics where she’s just wearing his shoes 💀  https://preview.redd.it/8eqgpfjf4hra1.png?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=22f47d2ee2b16f617a212b54f66790971e5c5a2f
I wonder what he did to make her THIS mad
Did she delete it before or after he commented 😂
i dont blame her its a shit picture
Is any scandal come out soon? Not trying to be mean, but between his recent comment and the blinds I wonder if sth big happened.
I thought this picture was cute lol  I would be scared of the ramen by my baby but I have a similar picture with my SO eating donuts like this and we were still in the hospital 😂 I just thought it was a dad thing..  https://preview.redd.it/vh4aaxuh5jra1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b3bd38990ba33d17f6d52752b0600c9ddb400b72
Trash picture anyway.
Why do their sons get anonymity but they feel comfortable plastering their daughter’s faces all over the internet?? Khloe is the same way, I don’t understand.
Oh she’s mad, about something.
He looks like this is a rare occurrence. This picture looks so awkward and staged. The children look like props and he has no connection with them
It’s because they don’t want people to know that rich people eat Ramen too.
She really be trying to relate. Had to make sure she got the ramen in the pic. Tf
oh lord the ghettooooo
[removed]
[removed]
She probably threw them in the garage too 🙄
oh she is DONE DONE
Doesn’t he have like a whole baby coming with another woman? 😅
Eating hot ramen over their newborn in bed apparently wasn’t enough
Before. 2-3 days ago I suppose
But these (+ all the other photos she deleted of Travis and the kids) were cute.   This time he really screwed up.  https://preview.redd.it/9v1vk7dvsjra1.png?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=01a1e0e872f0a8fea45e97a30952b13f0e03d65e
Hot bowl on a babies head, idk what she was thinking posting it tbh
I remember when she first posted this pic we roasted her on the sub lol
Lmao came to say the same.
What did he comment ??
Aww haha the baby just sitting there
lil baby just chilling fr

Oh fr!?
she deleted that pic like a month ago
Its giving some credibility to the rumor hes got another girl knocked upppp 👀👀👀
Aw top right is adorable. I’ve never seen him smile!
I remember when this pic first came out and we were all shitting on it and there were people defending him like “welllll we don’t know the soup is HOT” 💀 like that somehow makes having a bowl of food by his head suddenly less stupid
I thought the same thing when i saw it. I was like ooookay...bad decisions are norm for them lol
Awe. That was a good day.
This one 😅 Cause he rarely comments!  https://preview.redd.it/8rol8f7fqhra1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=660f810c26ea6b98e1a94c23133bf2f0e37fd693
He’s 3 now and still lays on his dad like that while his dad eats donuts… but he also has a donut in his hand now 🫠
Maaaan, he lives his best life everyday, I’m jelly tbh
I mean that’s at least the rumor that’s been going around and allegedly the reason why they broke up
*mmm cold soup*
Dying at these two comments 💀
april fools?  LOL
I wish he didn’t
Whaaaat
same i am too!! all love to you guys and your cute baby
Was it? 😲
Thank you!! 🥰
It looks that way on Insta... I went to MTV page and there is nothing on there that shows it is actually happening.
😢 i was hoping for more interesting storyline... thanks for the info tho! 🤍
Never know!  Fingers crossed!!  :)  Have a good Sunday!
You too! xoxo
This is the content she needs to do more often. The I’m desperate for any man’s attention thirst traps are and have been old. It’s time for something new
Only 1 thing I'm envious is their kids birthday parties, they look so much fun!
That's a softball girlie. Sign that child up!
Kris looks good. Love that suit on her!
What a life it would be to be a child in a billionaire family that’s not afraid to flaunt their wealth.
Ok this party looks so fun though
Kylie watching Stormi hit the piñata like  ![gif](giphy|voOhKPgzYsyPu)  😂😂
stormi beating the shit out of the piñata is sending me
True and Stormi’s hairstyles are so cute! Beautiful curls
This was so cute! Love it
I always just wonder how much waste is made and wasted for these kids like every thing is name plates for them I wonder if it’s even used up. I remember as a kid even feeling then like there was so much stuff I didn’t use that I got as gifts, and that’s without excess $$$
Cute
Lmfao Kim’s nanny matching Psalm
Stormi favourite grandchild?
WAIT is that Khloe’s son?!
Seriously…what I would do to be Stormi 🤣
no it’s Kylie’s son, Aire
Bahaha oh. Thank u!!!
He's got an album coming out, he's making sure he gets back in before then
This comment kinda comes off as desperate to me?? Idk but my theory is that he’s trying to win her back and she’s not having it
I think this is linked to the meme of the ex boyfriend texting or commenting stuff like "I miss you " to the ex gf to knowlingly mess up with her healing process.
One of her new shadows is called “onto the next” so probably not
He never even commented on that bitch’s page when they were together😫
Just a pathetic attempt to get her attention😒😒😒
Waiting for Ro to insert herself now 😂
I think the majority of people on here have guessed it correctly.   Every single time he has a major project coming out, ie: an album, product launch, documentary, etc. he is all over Kylie and pretends to be so in love with her, shows her off at public events to promote said projects. Then when the hype dies down, he literally discards her, It’s all so pathetic that he only uses Kylie for PR reasons.   It seemed to be especially obvious after the Astroworld incident, he was all up Kylie’s ass trying to persuade the fans to like him again and support him.
 He's thirsty for the attention again. If she gets back with him she's no different than khloe.
Toxic people cycle back to each other infinitely. 🔁
I'm just here for the jawline content
He’s doing this to put a spanner in her post Travis journey.
STAY AWAY FROM HER😩😩😩 release Kylie from these shackles!!!
I mean she’s his baby mama I’m pretty sure they’re at least amicable lol
That jawline is crazy
As much as I think think this is lame, this kinda shit could have these girls running back, the bare minimum is a massive feat to these insecure women
Why do these super successful women just have kids with trash?  Like it’s so bad o
Pathetic
They looove these toxic cycles.
I feel like they're in an open relationship
I told y’all this was gonna happen when he stopped his new album LOL
She’s just like khloe fr
It’s giving she’s finally over him, he knows it, and he’s trying to get back in.
![gif](giphy|2eqzSenHzJxHqcjR3u)  I've never understood what she saw in him anyway...not just looks but he's like not even a nice person...is it clout? Like look at me i'm dating a rapper!?>!?!
I can't handle this weird dress lol.
Did she like it?
i hope kylie is repulsed and stays away from him.
The fact that he’s commenting on her page is what tells your they’re NOT together. IMHO
Just PR, always PR
She actually looks cray on the left.
Ugh sad
Seriously desperate
Nooooooooo💔
Imagine spending all that money to look like while having her net worth and taking back a cheater...that looks like him non the less.
this def wasn’t him commenting from his phone he barely knows anything about her makeup brand
Y'all take the most minute things and read it as a relationship.
The differences between photos she posts and her candid side profiles makes me sad. I can’t imagine spending so much to look a certain way only to have to edit your photos because you still don’t like the way you look.
Maybe inter tube dresses are his kink
he wishes lol
it’s the mother of his kids and a man replying under an IG comment. this tracks? what y’all talking bout.. reading too far into this one.
Maybe just complimenting the mother of his children.
I think he’s just trying
Naw, Kylie got to his phone.
She’s so lazy she using any pic for merchandise now

 one of these days i want one of these girls to experience a trustworthy, normal, loving relationship. one that doesn’t have them constantly nervous about other girls, one that doesn’t have them constantly breaking up and getting back together, and one that they don’t have to bend over backwards for. I want them to experience the type of relationships my friends and I have, where the guys are sweet, regular guys that just love them. it just struck me that they probably don’t even know what that’s like
Dudes a whole cuck.    Let’s his wife share men , then comes back trynna be a family man for the holidays.
I mean it is the mother of his child  And cringe  And this is what they do. I wouldn’t be surprised.
Like this if you buy her products 😴
Lol Kris Jenner purchased his account
[removed]
LOL Makes sense
Kylie loves being used by rappers
GD I HATE THAT
It's giving very much Tristan and Lamar slap fighting in Khloe's comments.
It’s coming across as PR and ‘let’s get as much talk around the mascara launch as poss’
Right if you have to compliment me on Instagram you clearly don’t have direct access to me outside of emergencies  ![gif](giphy|3oEjHYiB13HhXko6Bi)
I thought Travis was the one who didn’t want her
[removed]
Has Kylie finally seen the light ? Never thought that would happen.
This comment sent me💀💀💀💀
She was lucky to get an emoji. This screams desperate 😂
the kardashians showed us really took away any envy or curiosity we could’ve had around dating a famous dude it seems revolting
This is the comment of the year. 😂😂😂
I think she has dropped him for real and he’s realizing he’ll never get someone else of her status and money lol . Someone who’s also willing to act like a doormat
LOL
That girl never gave even a crumb of receipts so she’s done in my book.
YUP can’t forget all the dinner dates (with “random” paparazzi there to take pics) and family photoshoots
Isn’t that a huge narcissistic trait ?😬
She needs to spend more time with Kendall and take dating advice from Kendall 🤔 Kendall could have really guided her. She takes no shit from men like 90% of the time
It’s the Karjenner way
Stay away from her! Get a job!
Low self esteem
He was a hot up and coming rapper when they met. I think it was more of a hookup that resulted in an unplanned pregnancy so they tried to make it work and be the next Kimye.
Dumbass
I think it’s cause it’s unusual. He rarely  commented when they were together. Even then it’s just like an emoji.Minimal effort . Now that they’re broken up he’s giving this kind of compliments🫥
if he knows that it’s public knowledge that they split why would he publicly comment on that knowing people would speculate?he could’ve just texted her that. Lol
not you trying to excuse Kanye’s actions by saying “everyone has problems” as if he wasn’t harassing Kim and others online and being antisemetic

It's her kink lmao. Treat me like I have no self respect daddy! Treat me like Tristan treats Khloe! 🤑
Frr!! And he never really commented on Kylie’s posts when they were together, let alone comment on her cosmetics account! It’s definitely giving desperate 😂
Highlight of my year lol
Yeah plus I don’t think Travis even talks like this, he usually comments in emojis
It’s the punctuation that’s making me sus
lmaoo this is men when they realize they’ve run out of dumb bitch chances
She’s Kylie Jenner…

The fact that he didn’t even comment it on her page, he commented it on Kylie Cosmetics
Seriously she lost all credibility . I initially believed her. But if everyone has seen her with him there HAS TO BE pictures. I’m a nobody and when I’m dating someone new my exes friends if they see they take pictures and send. No way Travis Scott was regularly cheating and there’s no evidence from anyone besides ro
[removed]
That makes sense...cuz I mean...really she could do sooooo much better!
Me or travis?! Cuz I'll admit I'm a dumbass lol
Soooo... him not acting like he did when they were in a relationship makes everyone think they're in a relationship?
Maybe his social media intern was having some April fools fun
It’s giving attempted redemption
Because he struggles with letters and pictures he understands
Plus she's loaded 💰💰💰💰
Bleh
meh 🙄
Omg I love crab Rangoon too
Is that a bad thing or a good thing  ?😅
I think they meant Travis lol. Whenever I see his face all I can think about is astroworld and I get raged
It’s a gossip sub about the karjenners. People are just speculating. People have different ideas.  I think very few people think they’re back together. My guess is he’s trying to suck up to Kylie for whatever financial or image related  reason
😆
He has enough money but yeah status wise he will never do better than her lol not even close
I want to love it I’m gonna get some this week and see if I do
Yeah like I am a dumbass but he's most definitely a much BIGGER DUMBASS!!!! lol
Yeah,  I'm aware of where we're at. But some of the "speculating" on here just looks immature. Like males and females can't interact without fucking. They probably laugh their asses off at how quick people take the teeniest bit of click bait they throw out & blow it out of proportion. They want reactions and don't need to do shit to get it.  The reaches are huge-- that's all I'm saying. The KJ's out here making no actual effort but fans pounce, create a fictional narrative and drive up their mentions and relevancy. They should really pay these people.
Definitely not after astroworld. No woman with money and status who has an ounce of a brain would touch him with a ten foot pole
💯
Let us know! The sauce is a must too
Oh honey don’t even use the same word as you use him to describe yourself. He’s a disgusting animal. I’m sure you’re a wonderful smart person.
how did he ever pull Rihanna he’s such a gremlin
I gotta have a lil dip for everything 😂
To be fair Rihanna’s taste in men is pretty shitty
LMAO shit I tried thinking of a counter example but they’re all so bad 💀

I swear that True’s birthday happens like 5 times a year
True is 5???? When did that happen?
it is reasonable to assume that tristian attended his daughters birthday party
The Octonauts? True has fantastic taste.
This is a really cute cake.
yeah pretty sure he was there
I’m sure Tristan was there
I feel like True’s been 5 in my mind for years lmao maybe it’s just cause she’s so tall
Damn didn't she just have that cat birthday 😭 time is going too fast lately
Where are the rest of the Octonauts?! Lol
lol why wouldn’t Tristan be there? It’s his kids birthday
I'm loving the cake! It's so cute! Btw, I'm 100% sure Tristan was there as well.
Fuck yeah Octonauts!
Crazy that she's 5. In my head she's still 3
I am so desperate to eat that rabbits ear
I can't believe she's 5
I want that cake!
That's a cute cake though
Love the octonauts. ❤️ she always does a good job on true's birthday  Also remember last year when her mom tried to get trashcan to pay for the birthday party 🫠.
r/fondanthate would hate this lol. But I think it looks good!
that cake is ugly
I thought Kourtney is in Japan?
[removed]
I was just thinking that like didn’t it just happen with the kitten ball pit thing?
Ugh same I was like didn’t they just have a squishmellow pit for her 2 weeks ago?
YES!! I saw the 5 and thought damn wasn’t she just 3 then 4 less than a year ago😂
Best show ever
Creature Report!
Same thought. One of the only kid’s shows I could tolerate watching
I actually think that’s all buttercream.
Yep, they would. It kinda looks like all butter cream, though. With some cookies made to go on it.
No I think just Penelope is in Japan with Kim and her kids.

such a good one!
I remember loving this as a kid!
I thought it was new lol
It must have come out when I was around 5, so 2010 maybe?
This video hurt my head.  Its like they could afford Kendall only for a few hours so they had to stretch the few clips they got
Kim & Fergie are old friends, that's probably how this happened. This is really bad, both the song & the video.
Wtf was that?
ironically this used to be one of my favorite songs around 2018 and i was constantly rewatching the video because i loved the concept - i didnt realise so many people disliked it
A Fergie video Yikes how embarrassing  ![gif](giphy|26FKVMXf8UNZ4NF04)
Giving absolutely nothing, shocker!
I remember this, the video wasn't that popular
I’m assuming they were friends before meth?
I thought that was Kylie
She's back to the stupid redneck in space bug shield glasses 🤦🏼‍♀️
I cannot express how much I dislike these sunglasses. They scream bargain aisle.
Copied Khloe’s Japan coat    https://people.com/thmb/vIW7KoixEE_6LJBr8EP6QMVgoYA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(800x0:802x2)/khloe-kardashian-japan-d73b0c3ebd0f41049072ba058dd7068a.jpg
So cute and then she ruins it with those shades
I’m obsessed with this shade of pink on her
Hate the sunglasses, very ‘dad on myrtle beach energy’
i love, it just sucks that it’s balenciaga
La familia peluche
It’s all Balenciaga
She looks like a muppet
"So I gotta be real with you guys. She looks like a f\*\*\*ing clown".
She would’ve talked mad shit if Kourtney and Khloe had worn this when they were in Japan.😂😂😂 Still like it tho.
I don’t know because it’s vile and will be clogging up a landfill within 7 weeks
is this an april fools joke?
“i cut up my [bedspread](https://www.reddit.com/r/sexandthecity/comments/uegnql/she_cut_up_her_bedspread_for_this_gtfo_of_my/) for this!”
Because it’s perf
Bc it’s great
Very unkim of her
gotta always sport the trashy 1 dollar biker sunglasses though
Same !
Omg you are right! That is weird
Kim’s is a Balenciaga coat
I…I thought it was Kris
That’s nice, but I meant the style. It’s funny since she said Kourtney and Khloe looked tacky in Japan, but now she wearing a similar coat.
LOL seriously, I believe the words she used were "f*cking clowns." But it's fashun when she does it, sweaty!  Honestly tho I do like the coat. But not with her sunnies and hair. Should have paired it with a more kawaii or high fashion style. Make it deliberate!
I think they looked cute back in Japan Kim is the clown 🤡
Kourtney in her denim set!
I absolutely love that outfit!
My cats waiting for me to choke so they can eat my face after I’ve died
Me right now. Was going to eat it but suddenly craved bdubs... anyone want anything?  edit: for folks outside the US, bdubs is buffalo wild wings
"I'm going back to your baby... I'm going back to you!" (Once I have no money left on my uber eat card)
How they should be looking at the men in their lives
I don’t remember Kendall’s hair ever looking like this. I kinda like it!
Kris is the leftover fish that I saved out of guilt but we both know I’m not going to reheat fish
man i feel so bad for khloe sometimes
when was this pic taken?
☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️
💀
Girl LMAOOOO
I agree. She looks super pretty
omg i need someone to post this clip
this is the brand she should have a long-running holistic endorsement deal with. I know they've worked together obvsly but I mean Mugler should be the Balenciaga in her life
Her Mugler looks are always the best ones.
Kim glows when she embraces her softness. These looks are a 10/10
I’m getting super hero goddess vibes.
Left dress is ethereal god
Not only do Mugler pieces look good on Kim, they also perfectly encapsulate her personality. When she's in Balenciaga pieces, it doesn't feel like she is able to express any personality at all. It just comes out lifeless and uninspired. The opposite of how she looks in Mugler.  https://preview.redd.it/6amcmcoy5fra1.jpeg?width=2160&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=374dac4f9ccf9febd69a7c6cda9d8b5551f10ca2
Left: Aphrodite  Right: Hermes
Whoever did her makeup here atteeee😍😍
This!!! No more pootz
She’s such a romantic essence
Absolutely stunning holy shit
What makes it even more impressive is that this was during winter in Montreal and it was around -25 degrees Celsius which is so cold I don’t even have words for it
Mugler is forever her look
this is the best she’s looked in a MINUTE (ik they’re prolly old photos but damn she looks gorgeous here in both. i love those dresses!!!)
mugler leaves not a crumb anytime they style kim tbh
mugler has never failed this family, i can’t think of a single bad look honestly, this is the brand she shouldve rocked
Purrrrrfect
She kinda looks like Kourtney in that first image, when you zoom in on her face a little
She looks like a High Elf sorceress I would make on Elder Scrolls 😂😂
I completely agree. She always looks amazing in Mugler. They know how to dress her.
THIS
ethereal is the word!! I would love to see women’s fashion pivot from these boxy ass cargo pants and lazy crop tops to something like this…captivating! otherworldly
True. The top left “wet look” is my all time favorite look on her
You've explained it perfectly! When Kim wears this designer, it's almost easy to be able to name him because the way she wears these clothes looks as if she owns the look. She looks assured and confident. Most of the other designer clothes she wears seem to make her a walking billboard because THEY wear her! People loosely use the word iconic when describing her attire but that wet look is indeed....iconic!

It just fits the Libra goddess vibe so well for her! Khloe can keep the catsuits
Sittin here in my boxy ass cargo pants and lazy crop top feelin called out 🤣
nope it’s about a woman named k’yanna barber  drake is just a bitch who can’t keep women’s name out of his mouth
no it’s too early for this theory yall…. pls….  https://preview.redd.it/m6p3je5azbra1.jpeg?width=324&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=dc45597debe6e39c8aa9492a420162ff1416746f
He has a thing for everyone he’s so gross and desperate
He’s just bored and trying to rile Kanye up. He’ll never forgive him 🤭
LOL 👀👀👀 Is Kim OP, y'all?!! Because... 🤣🤣🤔 Kim, this you, girl?
Kim is not the only KiKi to exist, far from it.
MTS looks like a Siamese cat in this pic.

Be forreal
Drake loves all the women, so yeah probs.
Oh bro I saw the TikTok Snoop dog made about this.   I laughed until i cried.
I would die of happiness if Kim and Drake got together. I dunno why, but I feel like it would be such a cute fit.

😂 facts tho!

He recently did an interview with Lil Yachty (A Moody Conversation) and said he regrets name dropping real past love interests in his music.
I always thought it was a double entendre. He was never gonna say it was about Kim but he knew it would get Kanye riled up enough anyway

i thought it was Keshia chanté?
lots of artists use past relationships for their music, what do you mean???
No. It’s Todd Kraines
😜
The only explanation
Aren’t there rumors Drake has made his way through the entire family? (Not sure about candle though)
ewwww seriously, DRAKE???!
honestly idk why it makes sense but I agree!!! lol
It’s not like he’s a chump or anything idk why everyone’s hating 🙄 I would love them together

nope he says in the song “KB do you love me?” which are her initials which makes it clear it is not about kim   fans were being messy bc earlier in 2018 drake and kanye had beef (the poopity scoop drama) and ofc kanye is kanye so he had something to say too
No  it was confirmed by k’yanna and rap genius. i said this in another comment but he uses her initials “KB” in the song
💀
I wonder if that's true or not. I took tequila shots with Drake at a Bel Air house party back in 2021. He was not super friendly and didn't acknowledge any girls there. Even the super hot model chicks. Maybe it was just an off night for him. I seriously have no idea how Sophie (his baby mama) landed him. Luckiest chick ever.
Right!? I dunno why I'm getting downvoted lol
He’s a nonce
Haha exactly! He's one of the biggest artist in the world, basically a billionaire, handsome, and funny. Him and Kim would be a good match and I think it would be cool to see him with someone a little older. And Adonis can play with Saint haha.
“(The poopity scoop drama)” is sending me
How could you forget about the story of adidon
Omg really? I’ve listened to it so many times and never heard that. Kanye didn’t seem to notice either lol
There’s one verse where he says KB. There’s another verse where he says “Kiki do you love me”. Kiki is Kim’s nickname
Downvoting should  not be used as a dislike button. It’s for comments that don’t contribute to the conversation   Plz don’t downvote me
Agree lol people on this sub are drake haters tho  obviously 😬
Scoopty poopty drake has a child with a pornstar yeuuggh
I’m sent 🤣🤣🤣
bc that pic genuinely scares me 😭
Both are referring to K’yanna
Lol for real, 11 downvotes on my comment 😂 As if I said something horrific. My bad for liking Drake as an artist. Tough crowd Reddit
Read that last part as pusha to a T
