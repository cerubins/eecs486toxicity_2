This was a great talk at the end of his stream. I hope he has a lot of pride in the community that he has built that has enabled the HOA women a place to feel safe and welcome, both in the server and out of it. He's put together a wonderful group of people.
Not sure if this is allowed to be posted here (if it's not then of course mods, go ahead and remove it), but as one of the more bigger streamers who plays on the server, I figured there may be some who would like to hear his thoughts on all the recent events happening with the server.

This video was comedy gold. Like a literal planned skit. Don't know the context about where it came from but hilarious ending.
Ok this is pretty much the standard for comedy gold lol.
Where does he confess anything here?
The guy filming and the guy talking to Asher were trying to set him up.
Context: Freddy Fastfingers, at the time of the recording, was trying to ruin Osvaldos' life. He had Marshall Rays sit in the bathroom of burgershot for 45 minutes with a camera, waiting on it to clear out so he could talk to Asher, who he knew has block brain and would self snitch.  This video was leaked to Zaceed by Marshall during the campaign as well and given to Brian Knight.  *Edit additional context.

Wrangler was right about Andi all along.
For the longest time her MDW profile just said "told you -Wrangler"
Someone (I think it was Sweets?) read her MDW notes to her while she was in the cells one time, and it was like 5 or 6 messages from Wrangler lmao. "Leader of the HOA, they are her goons." "told you so" "told you so x2" "she has the most extensive record of any former mayor look it up" and "CUM" all from Wrangler.

Did he lock it after the clip?  Because during the clip I didn't see him f1 menu lock it or lock it via his phone, is there a third way to lock it I don't know about?
He does not the lock door immediately. He watches both doors, 2 pushed the back door he downed them, 1 pushed the front door and he downed them, waited about a minute more and then locked the door to call Ash for backup.  Eventually he unlocked it and ran out to Ramee who helped him escape,
Just posting this here cause I think some people just talk without knowing shit  https://www.reddit.com/r/RPClipsGTA/comments/x5pz3c/new_rule_about_spawncamping_in_holdouts/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
Pulled a Tyrone biggums
he went out of his house shot a bit to bait them into spawn killing them at the door  https://clips.twitch.tv/SteamyRelatedCroissantFeelsBadMan-1qDO74lfZbTU1tpa
this same guy said nothing when a member of seaside was hosting a race an robbed a  ex member of the  ballas. while he was doin that he comes from behind says nothing shoots the guy in the robbing mechanic an then the other member of seaside  soooooooo door camping is exactly in his must win mentality  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG55PNCIWDM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG55PNCIWDM)
Using interiors that have to load for other players to holdout in and then locking it is definitely one of those things where you should think .. should I be doing this?
Classic spawn camp and no initiation GGs tho
Knock knock Tyrone
I thought you weren’t aloud to enter property’s like that mid fight?   Also didn’t they just remind/update or add a rule stating you can’t camp doors?  he held the doors and waited to take half them out entering then locked it, imo it’s just awkward and you shouldn’t run into houses mid fight
We don't see him lock the door, so as far as just the clip is concerned - no issues. It's like Mike Block running into a randoms house that was left open, its not against rules.  If he does lock it after the clip ends - then yeah, thats a bad move..
Nahhh seaside got smoked  🚬
[removed]
So what is the difference between this and people running into lockable buildings ?
RDM didn’t even say anything and just shoot first.
I mean gsf were doing this every day against cg and no one had any issues

is there a way to break in if a house is locked ?
he locked it mid shootout, other Seaside members tried to go in but couldn't  https://clips.twitch.tv/CourageousBlatantHyenaKappaClaus-y0DyB8VHbkyX0TxC
The people pushing should have left it alone as the mechanics for entering those buildings mean they are stood still when entering so easy to be shot down. But running and hiding into your house mid shootout is a bit ehh and then locking it when you have downed bodies inside and people outside trying to get in to retrieve bodies that you are robbing is definitely ehhh.
You can actually watch the whole thing from the seaside member dragon he was the only one streaming I think and all them where able to enter apparently
That means he pretty much baited them and spawn camped because if they go inside of an apartment they look like standing still for few seconds
Sadly that was my first thought reading this post
Sheesh
First thing that came to mind haha
Ss about to push him and he locked it
[removed]
Clip?
2 questions 1 his gun was away is that not nvl ? an 2 arent  you not allowed to door camp an isnt that exactly what hes doin
Imma be honest… if 2 of your boys died inside you shouldn’t hesitate to shoot. Thats on the ss guy.  That was a nasty shot.
This is almost like watching a search and destroy game when someone’s camping the bomb lol
I would call that a highlight cuz that was a nasty shot 😆
When someone is involved in an active gun fight, the rules of NVL become much more muddied. NVL is just when people don't value their life. Being involved in an active gunfight and not being told to put your hands up basically means that they had every reason to believe that they were going to get shot. Someone who values their life would try to fight back by any means necessary unless they were given reason to believe that they wouldn't be shot, which didn't happen from this PoV.
i think only cops can do that as they went in and found the downed seaside members
Wasn’t there rule update few months ago that you can’t just camp a spot where players go through “loading screen” like the casino vault for example, u gotta let them push before shooting.
It’s 1v6 what else can he do
Worth mentioning as well this guy was holding down the roof on harmony Seaside pull in with their cars and he immediately starts shooting at them without saying anything then goes to hide in his house
Incorrect. He did not immediately shoot either, they shot at him too.
This whole war screams easttttsideee
He locked it after 3 SS pushed him, waited to see if more would, no one did so then he locked it
Oh then yeah, thats bad. Sometimes people say stuff that isn't shown in the clip and it turns out they're lying. Fair.
https://youtu.be/9tBfUJQhI1Y
I'm not sure if anything has changed but back then if you load into an interior, doesn't it disarm you? That's one of the issues with the spawn point from what I remember
Probably couldn’t see anything yet
he couldn't really see much...had to wait for things to load
He ran out afterwards and got picked up by CG and left it unlocked. The PD went in after they saw him leave
But what about crims literally just robbing houses? How do they get in?
Not shoot them when they pull in and act like a mechanic not a gangsta holding down turf?
Not break server rules, for one
You take the L and put your hands up. A disadvantage doesn't give you a pass to abuse a mechanic.
I just watched his pov. He immediately shot lol literally spawn camping  [clip](https://clips.twitch.tv/StormySleepyHornetChocolateRain-_CRenApKWdTGSVXn)
On dragon pov, dragon got scuff outside and SS about to push they were counting down but once they try going in its already locked
yeah the locking the doors things is one thing but being in an apartment where things have to load for others makes it even harder to push...dragon couldn't see much when he went in and got one tapped
you understand that its completely different  because they dont have to load into another area an its the same thing as someone pushing the liquid library or any building ..... right ? like come on you have to realize its its not the same at all ...unless theres another clip of them doin it with an actual house but this one is not a valid  example
Locking the door is the only bad part of this clip IMO. Not nearly the same either because there is no loading going on and the shooting hadn’t even started when GSF were in the house (based on the clip).
The house robbing mechanic allows them to lockpick the door of the house they get assigned.  You can't just lockpick random houses anymore.
how is that immediately the first guy stood there for a second had time to roll and then got shot at and the second guy came in at nearly the exact same time and got shot 3seconds later
It’s very likely they were using other houses. My whole point is no one cared, and if I were to guess no one really care in this case either. This war is becoming toxic because of 3rd party individuals, via hoppers and drama clippers, much like this clip
Even then it wasn’t actually into peoples houses, it was a stock interior.
Damn, that's stupid. This is exactly the kind of situation where it should be allowed. I mean, being able to lockpick into anything just seems normal. And if people want it to be harder to break in for whatever reason, just make them pay for a better lock that has harder challenges.
them "standing still" is them loading into the interior lol... there is a reason why a rule was made to not camp spawns in buildings.
It takes a second to actually load in, that guy has no option but to stand still
1 the clip started with him not saying anything an shooting people = RDM . 2 Do you think its fine that someone camps  2 doors an is shooting people standing still phasing into the building because they cant move? 3 the dude has prior history of strong arming a rp scenario so he can get the W....... ya no one cared because there wasnt any rule breaks in this case there was atleast 2 and ur very likely video example isnt  exactly proof so im gonna have to believe ur mistaken
yes but he combat rolled which is an indication hes able to act
i know that but the fact that he combat rolled meant that he was out of the loading screen. dont get me wrong im not debating on whether people should hide in their houses cause thats an admin thing but he was able to control his character
Once again the people involved didn’t seem to bothered by it. If they did they can report and move on. All this clip does is encourages people to either hop or trash the person involved on a public forum, for possibly breaking a rule on a private server of a game that’s nearly a decade old. where nothing really is at stake.
By the time he is able to control his character the guy camping has the advantage, that doesn’t matter at the end of the day imo
you have eyes correct ? you can clearly see the rule breaks . you are talking like this is cut in some way like its malicious the dude is breaking rules hes not the victim in this situation why are you tryin to start what aboutisms when the facts are infront of you
yeah true its kind of a copy of the initiation problem if you initiate properly the other side can blast you and youre done and if you say 1 word and blast its fail rp.  in this case it'd be if you shoot him while he stands still its fail rp and if you wait too long he'll just shoot you first personally i'd say apart from hiding in a house this was a "decent" middle ground (him waiting until he moved)
the facts are, the ones involved seemed unfazed by it, and a person completely unrelated decided to clip it and post it to a public forum which enables the person to be shit on by a bunch of people for making a mistake that has no real effect on anyone at all. Seems somewhat toxic doesn’t it. Which rolls back to my Point that 3rd party individuals are the reason people shy away or have to halt conflict rp early.
One of the biggest issues on 3.0 is everyone shortcutting or failRPing in order to get advantages in conflict or shootouts.  I mean even the fact that viewers bring it up as if it should even been a debate if you should just shoot first and fail RP or allow  someone to spawn in and lose your advantage is pretty telling on how bad things are lmao.
we just saw an example of it....fredo from seaside pulled up to ramee and asked him to pull over and ramee just one tapped him lol   it was a rough situation for seaside to either push or leave their boys in there...it is what it is
a mistake done multiple times isnt a mistake its a choice at that point. you are tryin to defend a person that is manipulating mechanics for his own benefit to secure the W. People are shitty you are correct but the fact you have  0 evidence to support your earlier claims and are trying to divert attention for clear rule breaks because his rp is being called into question is the real problem. because there not crying  aloud doesnt mean there not upset jus because whenever CG go down they  bitch an winge till people feel so obligated to cater to them jus to skip a situation doesnt mean everyone else does
mate...what is toxic is the rules this guy breaks...he needs to be banned from the server..he is ruining other peoples rp just so he gets the w.

I never for a second thought that Baas was going to face any real consequences because "reasons".
Really enjoyed the RP however can't help but feeling kinda eh with the conclusion with the judges just going  into a room without the full context of the situation(wrangler being listed as a defendant and not haven given testimony yet in the trial) or even the witness that is a judge being there and then made a hasty ruling when the ramifications could be huge for one side but now not the other
Didn't Pred set fire to someone's house and a hospital?
Kinda funny from Pred because when he was Sherrif he had everybody cover for him when he did something stupid again.. or blew up a hospital. 😊
How many times do they have to teach Wrangler the same lesson. Leave your corrupt bosses ALONE!!!
Special treatment for certain people on NP? What a shocking development.
I think the server has a major culture problem that results from staff insulating so many people from IC consequences for their IC actions. It is so ingrained that even the characters who want those consequences can't get them without just going balls to the wall and leaving no room for other options. Kyle had to choose to have Pred stay in jail just to get the RP of being punished for his actions. Penta has Wrangler just steal food off of people he is arresting in what I can only imagine is hope that someone sues him and gives him some court RP. The man walked into Siz's house hoping it would lead to a court case.  I can't help but imagine that protecting big streamers from consequence RP also comes from the same place the desire to protect big streamers from consequences for rule breaks does. They want to coddle streamers. And in the end it causes heinous problems OOC and devolves the quality of roleplay IC.
Bass ever facing consequences for anything on this server is just a fairy tale.
Color me shocked that there’s special treatment
When I watch NoPixel streams, I remind myself that if there are any consequences at all, it was probably scripted from the beginning. Every time the clown show pulls up stop whatever RP isn't scripted, I never get too surprised. Its so blatant and apparent that it just looks like the network executives are controlling everything, so why try to improv anything. When you look at how the tit for tat started with Pred and Wrangler vs Baas and the goons, one side very evidently is having all their RP thrown out while the other can push Pred flying into the air on Nimbus to trial.  Baas did all of what he is being charged for blatantly and in front of a judge to their face. To me that says the scripting is so hard that we don't even know where the RP begins or ends. All the Judges sprung from their sleep like The Undertaker when this was happening. It caused so much rupture and confusion that it snapped Bundy and Brian into a defense Attorney. From the Earth oozed a slime that dissolved all the walls and all the ceilings, revealing the meaninglessness of it all.
Not really sure what the goal was here. Baas could shoot someone outside MRPD for no reason and probably walk away without charges. At most, he would serve time then go back to his position.  Ssaab has been very clear that he is in that position for OOC reasons. Im sure he would go with most RP out of respect, but this was never going to cost him his job.
I always kind of assumed Baas was a cop that kind of had the OK from the “Senate” to go through these cycles of corruption. He’s also very likable OOC which I think makes it harder to hold him accountable IC. He gets to write his own script and it supersedes everything else.
When has Pred ever been the voice of truth. That's literally not what the character is
If they were right, how come they folded when Baas agreed to a bench trial? They realized that they had nothing and were completely screwed.
Always so disheartening to see really engaging RP that goes at full speed into a brick wall. It's not difficult to tell when the RP suddenly just switches off for sake of server health or consequences. Then something gets changed to make sure that engaging RP can never possibly happen again.   Rinse and repeat for eternity.
It's odd because when you watch Saab play literally any other character, whether it's a crim or on WildRP or whatever, he is 100% down for any and all consequences whether they're expected or not.  But when he logs onto Baas, there's this shift or something in that mindset that's entirely different from when you watch his roleplay with his other characters.
Yuppyupp. I honestly didn't watch most of Penta's stream today when I realized he was going full hog on the Baas thing. The outcome is just so obvious. Baas won't face any repercussions because he is the server owners chosen one for the pd.
As others have said in the other thread, this is why court cases should happen in-character in the court room instead of OOC in backrooms or literal discord messages. Even beyond the like  'purity' or the RP or whatever, just getting the actual facts of the matter in front of them is so important to making decisions like this.
That's kinda the point though, they can't justify a HUT hold without testiomy that wasn't presented.  All the facts in play point to witness tampering being an incorrect charge, therefore the hold is not justified.   You can't just say oh grant the hold and wait for additional evidence that might make it relevant, as that's unlawfully holding someone without just cause. The correct way to do it would have been to not try get the hold until they had the statement. It was just a rushed job again that backfired, the judges decision was pretty reasonable based on the facts available, which is what they have to go off.  Not to mention they technically kidnapped Baas when arresting him so it would likely have been thrown out immediately anyway.
He followed rule #1: Don't get caught.
Pred the character isnt the most self aware human being
They were getting rid of the hospital/parsons anyway and Kyle went with the rp lol crazy huh
That's different because even with little evidence they came down hard on pred and he always just played along, he even went to jail for scuff and didn't complain but it feels like when it comes to baas they find a reason to let him off that's the issue pred had
Gimme a time where Pred didn't face consequences in character for absolutely no reason by the judges?
I mean if Penta is looking for real authentic RP, this is it. People of extremely high power or high status almost never face real world consequences. It sucks, but that’s the harsh fucked up reality.
Riiiight. Because Baas didn't go to jail for the Meowfurion thing at all. Pred and Wrangler brought that case up multiple times as if he faced no consequences for that.
Kyle ooc said crane was totally right in his explanation of why the charge didn’t make sense.
If it is an RP position make it a senator type character and make a new cop. Having blurred lines like that on characters sucks for everyone.
Which sadly makes all of this tremendously boring.
Kyle ooc kept saying “he’s right” (as in crane) when crane was explaining the reasoning of why extortion over tampering.
They agreed to it but Judge Bailey wasn't available.
I genuinely cannot stand any time there's a wiff of a chance that Baas may actually have consequences for the shit he does. It's always going to end the same way
None of this is on Saab he did 0 anything ooc he reacted purely in role play. Please don’t be that guy.
I stopped watching when Siobhan first approved the HUT. I have anxiety and sitting there waiting for the other shoe to drop makes these situations not very fun for me to watch. Just a deep sense of dread and foreboding.
>Not to mention they technically kidnapped Baas when arresting him so it would likely have been thrown out immediately anyway.  If that was true then every criminal in the world would be free to go
They effectuated an arrest warrant and if you want to get down to it they never "forced" him into the car just emphasized he should come with them but with no force or threat of force.
What? Baas got into the car voluntarily and never even put in cuffs
Wasn't Baas just cuffed for over an hour in MRPD? He even wanted to be sent to jail, until Brian stopped him.   If Baas didn't want to play along, he could literally just suspend/fire Wrangler and go on with his day.  Edit: Baas wasn't cuffed, but was still detained or arrested. Point still stands.
Dude was sent to jail for a scuff encounter he had and then made something out of it and created RP.   When was Baas ever sent to jail for the corrupt shit he has done?  People really trying to argue Pred was never punished dude is literally the punching bag of the PD and DoJ even when he was a HHC.
what can you do? Thats life. Sadge
Officer Baas did, not Chief, Commissioner or Colonel. They brought it up not as an example of him dodging consequences, but of the risk he posed towards witnesses.
So the man went to jail and he was somehow still allowed to be an officer and wasn't allowed to be fired? Instead he was just given a slap on the wrist, demoted for a month or two before jumping from a deputy or senior deputy to the chief of police AFTER committing torture.
It was correct with the knowledge he had. But they rushed the process and instead of confirming things, left out facts that completely negate cranes entire reasoning.
Saab has mentioned about making a new character for his deputy commissioner position because of Baas's past. Would make things more smooth, but then we wouldn't get rp scenarios like this lol
Exactly
They didn't even have Bailey's statement for the PC for the HUT. They didn't have shit.
Both you and the comment you replied to are incredibly correct here.
Sure if you ignore the actual circumstances and generlise to a ridiculous degree then you're correct.  If you actually look at what happened and what they are supposed to do as cops, then no, no they wouldn't.  Context and details matter, you appear to be missing both.
that's not the point at all, the point is that they directed him into the car under false pretences with the intention of arresting him. They then proceeded to drive him to the station without informing him that he was detained or on his way to being arrested. It was only after he was inside the vehicle, and after the vehicle was already being driven to the police station that he was informed that he was under arrest and read his rights.   There's a reason that cops have to do things in a particular way and in the correct order, otherwise it's not a lawful detainment/arrest. No threat of force is needed for this and it doesn't matter if the reason for the arrest was lawful if the actual arrest itself was carried out unlawfully.
He was led into the vehicle under false pretences and was read his rights and informed he was being arrested only after he got into the vehicle and was already in motion on the way to the PD to be processed.   Before you try to argue this any further, just be aware that you're wrong and your reasoning doesn't apply in the same way to how police are required to function when carrying out their duties.
No he was never cuffed.
To answer your question no he was not cuffed in MRPD for any amount of time.
Baas was one of the first cop to be sent to jail in 3.0 I think. He got facedump in the toilet by Bovice and spend a couple of days playing a bike cop.
> When was Baas ever sent to jail for the corrupt shit he has done?  He went to jail with Dante for the Meowfurryon kidnapping and torture, voluntarily staying in jail for around 24 hours.
Well given how RP scenarios like this tend to resolve, and given that Wrangler seems to be the only one willing to push those scenarios and may very well be fired soon, he won't have to worry about missing them in the future.
Yeah, Baas could step down, and his new cop just takes over the position. Hell, this would have been an opportunity for it, because of this case Baas gets demoted and a new guy gets flown in with more experience.  Win win for everyone. Get to have spicy court RP with the trial and punishments, Baas can still be a character, and a new commissioner that doesn't have the past.
He still doesn't get RP scenarios like this, he swats them away and everyone praises him for "going along with it".
The reasoning was based on false information. Wrangler didn't testify yet and was a defendant. Cranes reasoning was that he wasn't listed as a defendant because Siobahn misremembered things.   7 judges and not a single one tried to confirm events from people who are involved first hand.
You don't need every witnesses statement for a statement of PC. A witness is to prove something in court.
The HUT was approved so they obviously had all the shit they needed.  Until the Server Health Unit showed up
??
The the kidnapping argument falls apart. They think it's kidnapping because he entered the car without knowing why they wanted him to go with them. That goes out the door when he then willingly entered the vehicle again after the car crash when he was fully aware of the situation.
So in NoPixle Penal kidnapping requires "Abducts another person and holds them against their will" where at no time prior to informing Baas of his rights and that he was being placed under arrest did anyone abduct defined "to seize and take away (a person) by force" or hold him against his will.
Hey man , ex Leo here 8 years.  A suspect must be informed of there arrest status within 72 hours of being detained or transported ( if the decision and legal threshold of probable cause has been met)  ( barring extreme circumstances.)  As at that point you are in my  legal custody and I am responsible for anything that happens to you.  Police can lie to you.   So in general the false pretenses is not a valid statement.  This is the same as people claiming a cop selling drugs and then arresting you is entrapment.    All that said since this Was a Warrant being served, the only thing the police must do IRL is show you the document ( which can be done in a timely manner IE once your at a police station or processing center). In this case a judge has issued a statement that means " after reviewing the evidence presented I believe this person has committed this crime and i am ordering you ( the police ) to bring them into custody to await the legal process. So the burden of proof for PC is already been met.  mixing IRL with RP is always messy and the way wrangler did it would violate many safety protocols, but yes was a legal arrest.
Damn, fucking tripping in that second statement lol
Police don't have to tell you that you're being arrested. It's completely legal for them to lie and or trick people into custody. It's literally their most powerful asset.
What about detained/arrested?
That's why I think this particular instance is fucked. Because Wrangler resided himself to the consequences of his actions in doing this. Any reasonable boss would fire him or heavily demote him for this much insubordination. At the same time, he can't even get 1. Not a single edge when its so due at this point.
He does seem to have a habit of avoiding the consequences to his actions.
the only one actually saying wrangler was a defendant was wrangler.   there were a lot of other things wrong with how the charge was levied that could have been brought up and probably were. 1)  victims cannot prosecute their own cases as it's by default malicious prosecution 2) even if he was a witness there was no implied intimidation which means it didn't fit the definition 3) by their logic baas is still a witness and between the way they led him into the arrest and the way they attempted to intimidate him making threats of taking their sweet time they are as guilty if not more guilty of actual witness tampering..  had bundy had been given even a minute to talk, the entire case and any potential subsequent case would have been thrown out with prejudice. that's why they wanted him to put the second charge up then and there.
Right but Kyle the streamer and Pred the character are different people
It was almost Mazed up and would have been glorious if that gun wielding psychopath was allowed to be heard.
They went shopping for high command approval and when they couldn't get it they exploited a loophole to push it in front of a judge. They knew they didn't have what they needed and they pushed ahead anyways.
Baas should 100% be accountable for his actions, and he is in character. So, a bribery charge should be applied.
The Nopixel police officer and IRL attorney that was dealin with this case disagrees with you.  He was being held (i.e. in custody and not free to leave once he entered the vehicle) without being informed of this until after the being taken into custody. He was also being taken away to the station without ever being informed of this. Even if he got into the car voluntarily, he was being taken somewhere without being told where, or why. Regardless of whether he entered the car voluntarily, he was then held and taken away without his knowledge. He can't voluntarily be held and taken away if he was never informed that this was happening.
Not tripping at all, his entire basis of what he was trying to articulate is incorrect. Getting into the car voluntarily doesn't matter and not being put in cuffs again is entirely irrelevant. He is wrong, there's no ifs or buts about it. People are free to disagree, they'd also be wrong.
They can lie and trick them in order to arrest them, but they can't then continue to lie and not inform them that they've been detained and arrested like they did. They have to follow certain procedures once they've actually taken him into their custody, which they did not do. As soon as he was led into the car and the car was being driven to the station, he was in their custody which he was not made aware of until after the fact. They didn't carry out that process correctly, which is why it was essentially kidnapping.
He wasn't in MRPD at all
What do you mean the only one saying Wrangler was a defendant was wrangler? Was he not listed as a defendant on the case?  As far as 1 goes, Victims in LS absolutely can prosecute their own cases, or else every conviction made by a cop prosecuting someone who shot them would have been made in error.  2: That would be something to prove in court, with all the evidence that comes with the case. 3: The idea that threatening to take time for something makes someone as guilty as a literal quid-pro-quo in front of a judge doesn't make any sense to me. Arresting someone is an attempt to bring them to trial with the option to testify. When did any of their actions threaten or intimidate Baas into not wanting to testify? As opposed to the idea that if you don't come to a plea agreement that includes dropping charges against me, your job will be at risk.  It all just sounds like someone wanted to smurf on the law and ignore the in-city limitations and implications to get Baas out of a charge.
Many of these points would have made interesting material for a roleplay court case. That would have been cool to watch.
He said that before he knew they made it based on the wrong information. The above clip is after he found out.
Except that they did get approval from 2 members of HC. And following the way a law is written is not exploiting a loophole.  But enjoy your version of what happened
They got approval for the HUT from both Torreti and Dark.  They posted it to the docket and then the judges independently approved the HUT.  You can argue about a lot of things in this case but that is not one of them.
I just don't see it, and seems to be a stretch. Also I am fairly sure that in nopixle am officer doesn't have to inform you that you are under arrest when transporting you in this manner. If they are effectuateing a warrant for arrest then they are given a lot of leeway to complete said task. I think its just Bundy throwing things at a wall, which is fine and makes sense in RP.
Seeing how you are a legal expert, could you all do us the favor of explaining what makes it a kidnapping under nopixel law?  I'll help you with the definition of the law on the server: "Abducts another person and holds them against their will"  reminder that the way it is written mean you have to do both things to satisfy the charge.
Cops can lie to people they suspect of committing a crime. The only person wrong is you. The fact that he was in the car under false pretenses is entirely irrelevant.
We definitely didn't watch the same thing......
>It all just sounds like someone wanted to smurf on the law and ignore the in-city limitations and implications to get Baas out of a charge.  this comment right here... this just shows that you would rather people display an ignorance of the law just so baas could get charged.   the only reason 1) happens is just exactly what you've pointed out yourself, limitations of the city, but if you're going to prosecute and be a witness you damn well better act in good faith which no, wrangler was not doing.   2) what you're asking them to prove in court, as a requirement for huts should have been PROVIDED.. NOT NECESSARILY PROVEN BUT AT A MINIMUM PROVIDED within their statement of probably cause on the hut warrant.. They did not. They admitted they did not. That they did not have a statement from bailey and would have needed another for clarity means the form itself was submitted with fault and never should have been approved as it did not meet the standards necessary WHICH IS WHY IT GOT THROWN OUT.   3) you don't think essentially kidnapping, which yes what they did was kidnapping as they coerced baas into a vehicle under false pretenses with the goal of detaining him and did not either read him his rights or properly detain him until the vehicle was moving.. and then using the threat of a 72 hour as a punishment (something of which wrangler has already been in trouble for in the past) qualifies as intimidation?   &#x200B;  do yourself a favor and don't get your legal advice /legal opinions off of penta. he may be a relatively smart guy and know his way around a nopixel court, but he's spent so long stretching the lines of the law that i don't think he actually knows what's real and what he made up to justify things to himself anymore
im pretty sure this is why crane came in and it got tossed though soihban should have known better. 1000%. and the problem with the whole "panel" of judges she ran it by is that there was 3 baby judges in their literal 1st day of being a judge. She should have immediately realized the seriousness of this and gone right to crane before signing it but i don't know if she actually realized it wasn't just an sbs thing until they got to paleto.
Not only have I demonstrated that both points you've required to be made have been satisfied, but also highlighted the fact that the same argument was made by a nopixel cop and IRL attorney, and that you can even go back to his VOD to see the argument being made.  I think the fact that you still refuse to even entertain the notion that you might be wrong in the face of that really says a lot about you. If you made a single reasonable and fact based argument instead of just saying "it's a stretch" and "i don't see it", then i'd be happy to consider a different point of view, but everything you've said is weak as hell.  Also your statement about not needing to inform them they've been arreseted and being given leeway.... is that based on anything at all or did you just make that up on a whim with nothing to back it?
I've never claimed or even suggested that I'm a legal expert.  Bundy/Occams however is a legal expert, not just in Nopixel law but also as an attorney IRL, and it was him that made that argument and provided the reasoning. Feel free to go back on his VOD and listen to it yourself.   Even from a basic point of view though, he was not informed that he was being taken to the station and was not free to go but was also never told this until after he entered into the vehicle and was being driven away. He was therefore being held (could not leave) and was being taken somewhere without his knowledge that this was happening (against his will).  Both elements satisfied. Again, don't take my word for it, take it from the Nopixel police officer and IRL attorney who was directly involved in this.
They can indeed lie to people they suspect of committing a crime, that is correct but it has never been implied or suggested by me to be incorrect. you've just made that statement entirely irrelevantly and without need.  The fact they lied isn't what made the arrest unlawful, it's the fact that they held him (once entering the car, he was in cusody and not free to leave) without telling him and then they started the journey to the station in order to send him on his hold (being taken away against his will without being informed of where he was going or why).  Police can lie, they cannot however hold/arrest you and take you away without telling you, that is kidnapping.
I would rather roleplay happen then have legal geniuses only display that genius to get the DOJ out of the line of fire of holding Baas.  2: A HUT only requires PC. If there is enough PC for a trial, there is enough for a HUT. If they are denying the HUT, but saying it is okay to go to trial, then how can you argue they are being consistent from a legal POV?  3: It is not kidnapping to lie to someone to apprehend them. It is not kidnapping to move someone once they are under arrest. The only arguable time kidnapping applies is moving someone who was detained but not arrested. The fact that you think they needed to read him his rights only shows that YOU are the one that has a serious misunderstanding of the law. Miranda rights are only necessary to guarantee that any answers given during questioning are admissable in court. There is no legal requirement to read a person their rights if you aren't questioning them, and if you are, you only need to read those rights before the questioning. SOPs may say otherwise, but SOPs arent the law and the DOJ doesnt rule on SOPs.  Using the threat of a 72 for what? If they were intimidating him with it, to what end was that intimidation? Was it to get him to not testify or to change his testimony?  It is the height of Irony that you accuse me of getting my opinions from Penta, and yet it seems pretty obvious you are just parroting another streamers take too. Let me guess they have IRL law experience? How much? How long did they practice law? What type of law did they practice? How long has it been since they practiced law? Have they spent so long pretending to be lawyers and judges ruling on fake laws that they also get mixed up from time to time?  Luckily for me, I actually get my real legal advice from practicing attorneys with expertise in the necessary field when it's needed IRL. When it comes to made up law on an RP server, I don't treat any streamers word as gospel because I have seen even the best Judges on the server make absolutely mind-boggling legal decisions.
No, I mean: the court case that we'll never see, now.
  The only thing she did wrong was applying the law as it is written.    And Wrangler doesn't bring SBS cases to court.
Lol when did this become so personal for you?   We have different opinions on the matter let's just leave it there.
There are many arguments I am kind of tempted to make on this, but I think in general it is hard to argue something like this that lacks a precedent in NoPixel. Especially cause the interpretations of the law tend to come from IRL legal understandings, and I am pretty sure what Wrangler and Pred did is perfectly legal IRL, but the lack of clear common law background within the server makes even shitty legal arguments technically correct in some cases, right up until a Judge rules them incorrect for whatever myriad reason. The fact is Occams could be 100% correct in some ways, but a judge could throw out that argument anyway.  I agree it is an interesting legal argument that could be heard in court however, and I think it would provide a valuable precedent on the extent of cops ability to lie, and perhaps better codify their immunity to certain criminal charges while carrying out their duties which most IRL cops have but Nopixel lacks.  I don't agree to defer to Occams as always being right. Many IRL lawyers or people with legal experience who take part in the DOJ have made mind-boggling rulings that make little legal sense. People often forget how expansive the legal profession is. You don't get legal advice on criminal matters from a personal injury lawyer etc. It just feels like an argument to authority, and one that sits uneasily with me. Especially when it comes down to trying to apply IRL legal expertise to a half-baked legal system where the only real law is what side of bed Crane rolled out of that day.
Would it shock you that Occams might be wrong? Basically the second they got Baas in their vehicle he was read his rights and informed there is a signed warrant for his arrest. With the judge that signed it present as well.  Saying "hey you have to come with us" and not telling him why is not kidnapping if you're acting as an officer legally arresting a person that has a warrant. They do not have to explicitly say "Hey you have to come with us because you're under arrest."  Edit: to make sure I'm not crazy I went back and watched the whole arrest. Within a minute Wrangler explained all this to him AND informed him which station he was bring taken to for processing.
They did tell him. He was read his Miranda rights? What are you on about?
Ah the good old, I'm out of reasoanble arguments so I'll just try the old moral high ground and dip reaction.   A classic.
I made it very clear each time i mentiond Occams being an IRL attorney to also include the fact that he is a nopixel officer also. Not only that, he also has a Nopixel lawyer and Judge char too.  I don't think anyone should blindly trust everything someone like that says, but it's also very foolish to blindly dismiss the opinion and arguments of someone with vast amounts of experience, certainly more than anyone commenting in this thread. I also made sure I understood and agreed with the logic of the argument before commenting.  Also, pretty much everything you've said in your response that 'sits uneasily with you', you're pretty much guilty of doing the exact same thing in your positioning and arguments. Just a little food for thought.
I like that you're immediate reaction is to suggest that the person with far greater IRL and Nopixel knowledge is wrong, instead of thinking that you might be wrong. That says a lot.  It's also not that they **said** you have to come with us, then not telling him why, its taht they literally arrested him, held him in a vehicle where he was not free to leave, and then started the actual journey of taking him to the police station to send him on his 72 hour hold, ALL without telling him. That's what made it unlawful. That's why police have procedures they are supposed to follow when arresting someone.
jesus christ dude, do you have selective sight/hearing?  They told him AFTER they did all of the above. I'll redirect your question... what are YOU on about?

don't get baited into believing PENTA's plans about anything
He'd play Wrangler on another server, get RDMd within the first hour, and quit the server forever.
He hasn't been impressed with any of the other servers he's tried. I doubt that will happen.
Eh not sure if I believe it, but there are better servers for Wrangler than NoPixel.
thatsbaitmeme.gif
Penta isn’t going any where
This dude has a “plan” for everything and almost none of it actually happens.
He can finally join Lenny on that camping trip.
Yea sure buddy
Biggest bluff I've ever seen
Well its good that he has a plan...
I mean look when they were both in HC they were okay with dealing out punishments to the point where he wanted to fire tails for taking a call mid conversation and they talk about being okay with consequences and with that in mind what do you think is going to happen when you disrespect the Chief of Police among other things.  If the RP is going after your boss the consequence to that is you're in hot water. Shit was fun honestly
Just play another character PEPW
i really hope he gets fired and just play that character anywhere else, i think the entire role of that character is to provoke others, and the amount of toxicity he produces ruins rp'ers and viewers experience like no one else...
[removed]
Yeah, he says things like this in the heat of the moment (we all do), so I wouldn't take what he said here seriously.
I only believe that fucker’s plans when he’s planning to eat a third rotisserie chicken over his sink. /s
nah I think hes real about it   its just nopixel 2.0 jordan and not a new server.
I mean, he hasn’t actually gave any serious server a fair shot. Mostly because he isn’t actually a “serious” RPer. Nopixel allows him to mix serious moments with SBS that would get him banned on other serious servers that a lot of his chat wants him to play on.
To be fair, he's hardly played on any other server. Like, I get that's he's a veteran, but one bad interaction from 1 short play seems to be all it takes to make a person dislike a RP server.   Surely you need more than one day to fully understand the dynamic of a server.
I feel like most servers would not have a good or functional DoJ and Penta loves his court RP.
Or is he ?
In their early HC days the Baas Meowfurryon stuff was going down and Wrangler was saying Baas should be suspended until trial because it looks bad the PD had a cop running around that was charged for torture. Which is true but there was pushback of having consequences that severe. Then he wanted him fired for actually losing the case  and being convicted which of course makes sense again but again the it's just RP shouldn't be taken that seriously OOC excuse exists.  Why wouldn't the same standard apply here? What Baas did there was far worse and he has done many other things as have other cops that are far worse with no consequences. A few months after that situation he was made Chief, that was the "consequence" of him torturing someone. Why would any of this need to be taken seriously when nothing else is?
He went in knowing full well he may be fired for it. He wanted to stick to his guns IC.
> to the point where he wanted to fire Tails for taking a call mid conversation about her uncuffing a suspect during an armed standoff with her command, making her complicit when the suspect went on to hold the command members at gunpoint  Left out some context there, bud.
yet the 'Chief of Police' has gotten away with more than anyone else, which results in rules/laws implemented so those said things cannot be countered
Imagine awarding this comment lmao.  You’re doing a solid job of mixing ic stuff with some warped view reality.  Take a step back bucko.
cant tell if hater or mike fan
He…will…? Is this supposed to be some kinda gotcha?
I dont care what happens to Wrangler I just want more Peter Parker.
Wow a toxic Buddha Stan.  Do they call you the great white buffalo?
Why? there would still be Mike Block, John Cop, Jordan, Jimmy etc... on Nopixel. He'd just be playing Wrangler somewhere else lol
What? He literally said the same thing when Wrangler wasn't a cop for 30 days before. He wants to do cop RP, why wouldn't he just go somewhere else. There really is no downside the way NP has been OOC with all thats going on, and IC where all the positions of power are just admins or people who are untouchable from consequences, or both. It really feels like at times we are in the end days of TFRP.
It sounds exactly like what people here say CG would do if one of them gets permabanned... even though 2 of them have been and they haven't done so.
only three damn asshole i subbed for 5 rotisserie sink chicken's what a rip /s
He perma'd Jordan last stream and said he didn't want to rerun the character.
I’ve both seen and heard new day policing is really solid.  However, I’m not sure they have a court system.  But I feel like with the right direction it wouldn’t be to difficult to develop one.
I read a comment 2 weeks ago from u/Valuable-Novel8641 who I think plays cop on Production RP, and he [had a lot of good things](https://www.reddit.com/r/RPClipsGTA/comments/1224kcq/comment/jdoszug/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) to say about the DOJ and the court RP in general on that server.  I also know that SheepDog switched from Nopixel to Production RP and he seems to enjoy it so far.
Narrator: No, he's not.
*Music* Hey Vsauce Michael here
Who else was perma'd aside from the obvious?
What is so bad about wanting to play a character on another server when the server you're playing on doesn't allow them?
There is nothing wrong about taking Steam ID's, plenty of streamers do and most of the times they dont even report it.
If true, I don’t think any reasonable person would refute that…
wow I must have the biggest HEDOESNTKNOW sign on me right now for that
The guy who plays Jaylen is permad as well
Jaylen was ST no? Also he wasn't apart of their brand. Them not following Rated also makes sense if he did something bad enough they want to disassociate from him, they might follow if he got banned for the same reason Jaylen or Lil Bleach got banned (however CG is protected from any perma unless it's something obtuse as Rateds)
he was like a year or so ago but around this time last year he got made full CG like Wayne, Anto, etc.
Oh, the point about him not being core CG still stands then, the CG brand is just the dudes that went to FB and Shotz, and those would be followed around whereas merald being in the gang is just a RP thing, not as much a OOC thing
Siz looks different.
I actually kinda feel bad for the HoA in this, somehow everyone is their enemy and they haven't even really done anything.
I do feel like the the HOA got the thin end of the wedge with this whole thing. Lots of people are so far down the rabbit hole that kidnapping and torturing a gang leader doesn’t hold up as a reason for war.  Having said that the whole alliance thing does look bad to any anti Simone
[removed]
Is there a loremaster for this?  Why is Siz using a female ped lol?
Get ready to get 67 replies about how you're wrong and actually everything is their fault lol  People refuse to see the forest for the trees. Andi has somehow become the source of every problem in the city.
All they needed to be clear about was their connection to the Simones and it would only be about their leader being kidnapped and dumped  EDIT: holy shit what issue do people have with my comment and opinion? I personally really like HOA and their RP.
i think it was one of the things why benji was afraid of going at the umbrella/cb. while they may be pretty good at war. cb/umberlla's true strength is their connections money and diplomacy(hydra turning ballas on their side). marty even told them the moment he heard Cg is also supported by cb and noped out of it. they should have taken the secretive kidnapping route coz getting in a open war with the 2 strongest factions in the city would not end well
It’s Erin’s model, they switched bodies after they got stuck in a dryer  Or something idk
He is roleplaying with Meka that both characters exchange bodies like freaky friday, so he uses her PED and she is using the Siz PED.
Before he took a break him and Erin did a Freaky Friday bit and switched bodies. It just never really got resolved though cause i dont think either of them have been playing.
Siz and Erin did a body swap.
Siz had Erin do his laundry and unfortunately the drier was cursed so they swapped bodies.  Now they have to ~~fuck~~  bump their bodies together to go back to normal.
The HoA joined the coalition and the entire perspective of the war changed for other people. It no longer became HoA is going to war because Andi was ocean dumped, but rather HoA is teaming up with Seaside and Lost to defend the Simones and are asking gangs like Ballas, GG, and Rust to join their alliance.
Just like the narrative during the Basem stuff. Almost everyone tried blaming most of the issues solely on her and it was just as stupid then as it is now.
How could Andi Jones brainwash and m-word everyone with her superpowers.
Andi literally did that before she was even kidnapped.
> it would only be about their leader being kidnapped and dumped  Do you not see what's wrong here?
You've heard of Hottub Time Machine now there's Body Swapping Laundry Machine
Lmao, that's great haha.  I miss Meka, Erin was so funny and so cooked at all times lol
Not with everyone involved. Are you not watching the current RP she's having with the Guild for example?
Yeah. That's literally what my comment is about. Their only issue is their Nick connection for many of the groups. The Guild just met with Andi exactly about that
She has told the guild. Multiple times at this point.
And yet they don't believe her because of the RP that has happened. You sound as if you are only aware of one POV
>All they needed to be clear about was their connection to the Simones and it would only be about their leader being kidnapped and dumped  I'm sorry, did you mistype your initial comment?
I'm sorry did you not understand what multiple POV means?
>All they needed to be clear about was their connection to the Simones   &#x200B;  >And yet they don't believe her  &#x200B;  So that wasn't all they needed to be clear about? They needed to do more than make that point?  I have no idea how you'd come to a determination about what I'm aware of, when all I've done is point out the obvious falsity of your initial statement.
I'm sorry but this is a discussion about RP. I've watched the Guilds POV of it all and I'm not sure how that's some kind of 'objective wrong'

Didn’t Gable point out that Suarez wasn’t listed as a witness for The People vs. Sam Baas, which is what catalyzed all of this? Meaning that case should have never made it to trial because there was no legal standing?
RIP Pred and Wrangler.
Judges had a long discussion before reaching to this decision its very informative if you watch it   also Wrangler is in deep trouble [Libby's text to Brian](https://i.imgur.com/UGCEfp9.png) , Toretti is also pissed because he went against him
Fair enough I guess with Cranes explanation that they should instead push extortion, makes sense.
Balla gang
Well apparently the DOJ made a mistake. Maybe that's why things should go to court and not have a pre-judgement just because the accused has (IC) clout
Judges hate this one simple trick that makes them come on duty

The dumbest hill to die on... Just move on . Lol. You know Baas isn't getting removed or convicted
[removed]
I guess the reasoning could be Suarez was literally a witness, just not on the witness list. Pred and Wrangler aren't literal witnesses nor on the witness list. Idk if that's the actual argument but that's what I got.
That doesnt even matter, witness tampering 100% works in this case since Baas using threats&intimidation to hinder/prevent all the witnesses in the Baas terrorist case from testifying.   Doesnt need to be directly against the witness, hes doing it indirectly through stopping the case as a whole.
did he go against Toretti? Toretti said to put in the HUT when he was ready... which is what he did
Except the witness tampering charge relates to the fact Baas offered a quid pro quo during a plea deal before Wrangler and Pred testified as defendants/witnesses in that case.
Cops in trouble for doing their job as is usual in that UPD shithole
[removed]
Personally I didn't really like a panel of judges deciding it's not witness tampering with zero input from the people involved because, quoting Crane, "we can't trust them to handle this because it's just the usual PD squabbling" and apparently they still fucked it up because Siobhan misremembered and told them Wrangler already testified during that court case so he couldn't have been tampered with.  It is what it is and the explanation made sense and I don't think the decision would be different with the additional context but it still comes off as being lazy just so they could wrap it up ASAP rather than doing it properly, especially since was a big happening.
They made a minor mistake bu after reviewing afterwards that hasn't affected their decision at all. Just to give prior the full context, it's not like the mistake lead to them changing their mind.
yup

I don't think it really went OOC for the primary 3 involved. But unfortunately so much is tainted by the OOC micromanagement by Staff that things are rarely fully IC when it comes to situations like this. Between SOPs, Sentencing guidelines, DOJ afraid to rule on things, so many little things, it is obvious that an atmosphere of doubt and fear exists that causes characters to make decisions taking into account what nopixel management might think or want, and not what their characters should think or want.  People's livelihoods are on the line if they upset the wrong people. The people who management bend over backwards for.
Ssaab kind of went OOC in the cells talking about wrangler being “fired” before.
They gave a fairly long and in depth explanation but I guess you didn't watch. Instead you are strawmanning by quoting a made up person
They were the defendants which always have the right to testify as a witness on their own behalf.

They didn't decide that it was not witness tampering, they decided that based on the HUT form submitted by Wrangler, there was not enough to hold Bass for witness tampering.  There should not be any input from the people involved, because judges are meant to approve/deny HUTs and warrants based on what is submitted on paper, as is. If the officer/prosecutor has things to add to the warrant, instead of doing it verbally, they should amend and resubmit the document.
This wasn't a trial, it was an application for a HUT.
Sure do love how all seriousness in the PD is completely undermined because the DOJ won't take it seriously.
It completely changes their reasoning for the no HUT judgement before they went out there.   Crane then had the audacity to say he thinks the case can still be argued in court, just not with a HUT.   Somehow the HUT charge can be argue in court, but you can't hold the person til trial.   It all just makes the DOJ look laughably inept. It couldn't be clearer their treating Baas with kid gloves because of his standing.
it was for bail
Is it common for this many judges to wake up for a bail hearing? how often do a panel of Judges come around to overturn 1 judges approval of a HUT?  Since when can you not Hold cops? Does Baas himself saying he gave them that COURTESY, mean it's an SOP to not hold cops for HUT charges?
This doesn't excuse people accusing madoreline of hating Penta, nor do I think should it be an excuse to cry OOC whenever a streamer's character doesn't get it their way.
Wasn't he fired by the senate? That should be IC knowledge for Baas. PBSO HC going with the North Korea story doesn't necessarily mean that the senate thing was retconned.  I also don't get how this would even be relevant for the people accusing madoreline of being a Wrangler/ Penta hater?
oh and look, they were wrong because details were misunderstood...
Without hearing anything from the prosecution ?
I mean the only explantation you need is that its Baas on one side and Wrangler on the other, they were gonna find some way to throw this out no matter what
Yeah but as the judges said, it gets a bit wishy washy. Both sides can be argued so I guess it’s more about judge discretion.

Crane said they'll question Bailey themselves later on rather than letting the PD handle it, which goes beyond the HUT situation and Crane also said during his explanation that it wasn't witness tampering but rather extortion so it doesn't really make sense to push the charge other when 8 judges already decided that it doesn't fit.
Im confused. Is the HUT form not simply PC for the charge itself? If there is enough PC to push the charge, does that not mean that there is enough PC for the HUT? Or is there an unwritten standard beyond PC for HUTs?
The issue is really that whenever something exciting and dramatic is happening with real consequences on the line (in this case, Wrangler/Pred expecting to be fired over it and doing it anyways), the RP gets stomped out completely by a third party steamrolling through trying to end it immediately and return to status quo.
He said they could push an extorsion case not witness tampering.   The key takeaways were that the threat to their jobs was a logical consequence of if they were convicted in The People vs Pred. As such mentioning it is appropriate in a plea deal because plea deals are built around arranging lesser consequences in return for a guilty plea.(There's a lot of ethical debate around plea deals in general irl as there are cases of innocent people who accept lesser charges in fear of losing court battle on higher charges)  The other big point was the quid pro quo was for dropping prosecutions not stopping witness testimony, which is where Wrangler and Pred being listed as Prosecutors only in the case against Baas comes into play.  Since they weren't listed as witnesses in Baas' case it couldn't be argued that he was trying to stop testimony in that case.(The one source of BS here is that Prosecutors not being allowed to be witnesses hasn't really been enforced)  And even though they were Defendants in the Pred case this case was the quo and dropping it was supposed to be in benefit for Wrangler and Pred.(So they dont lose their jobs) If they wanted witness tampering for dropping this case it would be hard to prove that the intention was to stop Wrangler from testifying in his own defense.
It might have been because of the election today but it's definitely not normal to have 80% of the DOJ to immediately conflict themselves on a pending case....
Today was the judge elections results. They didn't wake up for the bail hearing, they happened to be awake for the post-election celebration and orientation when Siobhan asked for a panel of the judges who were around before it even became a bail hearing.
I agree with you on both of those points. Luckily they have nothing to do with what I said.
People were going out of there way ooc to say that wrangler was sent to NK ic because nothing was ever communicated.  He was randomly banned from cop before anything was communicated IC.  Korea was the IC reasoning for a decision admitted by almost everyone to be ooc.  Everybody assumed the “senate” realized they fucked up and agreed to the Korea IC explanation.
Account made 24 days ago, no wonder you are made of nothing but lousy takes.
What does your comment even mean? How os the person I'm replying to not strawmanning a made up quote?
Thats what a HUT hold request is, they decide if the charges are apporpiate not if they are true or false. they didnt say he is innocent, just that their request points to a diffrent charge than witness tampering.
Basically it amounts to the PC provided doesn't warrant a HUT for Witness Tampering because Wrangler wasn't listed as a witness for a court case. It is more akin to Extortion but they are open to a HUT for Witness Tampering if Bailey provides additional information that pushes it over the line.
Without mis-quoting the prosecution at least lol
It just helps that the reality and RP led them one way I guess
I think it got wishy washy because they were only thinking about them being prosecutors in the second case. The right of a defendant to provide testimony (or conversely abstain from testimony ie 5tth amendment) is foundational to the judicial process, but it seems like they all overlooked that part of the first case (except for Bill apparently).
[removed]
[removed]
Crane is already conflicted, so he's free to question Bailey. It has nothing to do with the current denial/approval of the HUT against Baas that was submitted, especially considering Wrangler/Pred stated Bailey never got questioned officially for testimony, when they wanted the trial immediately afterwards.  Crane says it's not witness tampering based on what he knows, which is also part of the reason he wants to question Bailey.  Again, if new information comes to light, Wrangler just needs to amend the HUT form, and resubmit it.
>Or is there an unwritten standard beyond PC for HUTs?     There wasn't before this situation.     But I'm sure that they will write new sops or laws so it applies to everyone in the future and not just this one incident with Bass. /S
Except it wasn't wrong. If you listened to Crane trying to explain it to Wrangler on the phone it couldn't be more obvious. He still thinks Witness Tampering can be argued in court, just that for some reason this time it isn't a HUT.  Don't forget when Siobahn approved it she showed it to a panel of judges beforehand to get their thoughts on it.
There were 3-4 judges online, majority of which approved of the HUT.  Then 4-5 more judges happened to log on and give opinions about an already approved HUT.
If that is the case, then I concede they didn't wake up for it. My second point stands.   Siobhan wouldn't have asked for that panel if this was any old criminal. And as much as people might want to argue it makes sense because he is the second-in-command of the PD, I personally think that the precedence already established by Crane when it comes to trying to hold Baas to account, a precedence that absolutely stems from OOC considerations, is more likely the behind this than anything else. Siobhan wanted to cover her own ass, she was afraid of getting in trouble, and not because she was afraid it wasn't legal to approve the HUT, but because of who it was for. A judge wouldn't want to do that in normal circumstances unless someone was protected by the same powers that have historically been known to interfere in rulings.
I mean your points can be easily used as an argument to cry OOC in a ton of situations, which certainly has something to do with my second point. While I don't disagree that a lot of people let this fear influence their characters, I don't think that nathankb_  altered Crane's judgement out of fear. I guess you could say that he had sever health in mind, but I would say that's another narrative that gets pushed whenever it's convenient for some overinvested viewers.
The reasoning for a decision might be OOC but that doesn't mean that the knowledge of a firing itself can't be IC. As long as Baas gets a notification in game or through an "IC email" (senator XY to Baas, not admin XY to Saab) he should be able to use it as IC knowledge.  I'm just not a fan of these OOC accusations when viewers themselves barely have any context or know how the situation exactly played out. It's a lot of dot connecting and assumptions being used as if they were some facts. It would be uncharacteristic for Saab to use an OOC comment against an IRL friend, as much as people on this subreddit love to villainize him.
sure, its not an actual quote but its what they did
Wrangler and Pred were defendants prepared to testify in the Suarez case.  The DOJ, with the reasoning provided, were wrong.  That's why these things are typically adjudicated in court rather than amongst a panel of judges in private.
It helps that, for the first time ever in a bail hearing, 8 judges conveniently decided to log on and make a decision based on second hand infos without hearing the prosecution.
I mean, i don't think it is 'crying OOC' to acknowledge the systems and the way the server management has implemented them to protect OOC interests.  It is one thing in my mind to say that a specific person was maliciously taking something OOC, and an entirely different thing to me to say that people are taking OOC things into consideration because they have been browbeat and forced to do so by management.  I don't think Crane changed his judgments out of fear, he is too important to management to have that issue, he just changed them because management told him to (I know Nathan claims he changed his own mind, but I have too much faith in him as a person to think he just magically decided to change his own ruling in hindsight). It's all the other judges who are now too afraid to even make rulings on certain issues without either going to Crane or a panel of judges that I was referring to. It's the Judges who are completely disposable to management that have things to fear.
Is it though? Maybe use a real quote next time instead of blatant bad arguments and strawmans
Yes, they can put it on the docket and go to trial to prove Witness Tampering. The problem is that the HUT requires the DOJ approval and the DOJ did not feel they provided the PC necessary for a HUT. They could still go to a normal trial, just without a HUT. Don't think you need DOJ approval to push cases to the docket, just to get the HUT.
What did Baas do to tamper with them testifying in their own defense?  My problem with the decision is about the terrorism trial and the judges going "yeah, we should really tighten up the prosecution/witness distinction, also we're retroactively applying this distinction to actions that have happened previously so it's not witness tampering." As an extension of this, are they not going to let him testify? I feel like "prosecutors can no longer go on the stand as witnesses unless listed on the docket" is a pretty big change that needs to be announced ahead of time and applied only going forwards.  Also it would mean now you can tamper with prosecution/council with no serious charge?
They were on because the judge elections were today and they were having a celebration / brief orientation for the newbies. They didn’t conveniently log in.
>It's the Judges who are completely disposable to management that have things to fear.     It's very similar to the PD HC who would have had no problem signing off on a HUT for anyone else charged with witness tampering.
I can generally agree with your statement, but I genuinely don't think this ruling was influenced by those things, with nathankb_ being able to rule without much fear. Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't he also usually pretty open about management overruling him?   Saab was willing to take the HUT, the whole thing went relatively quickly and with the big man on vacation, I honestly doubt that staff decided to step in this quickly.
They based their decision of lack of PC on the charges not fitting because, to their understanding, Pred and Wrangler were prosecution and not witnesses on the People v. Sam Baas torture case.  They failed to realize they were potential witnesses in the Suarez case that was currently ongoing.
There were 3-4 judges online, majority of which approved of the HUT.  Then 4-5 more judges happened to log on and give opinions about an already approved HUT.
I don't think Cranes's ruling was made with fear. I think it was brought to him at all because of fear. I also have misgivings over Cranes general approach to any case where cops are prosecuting cops. Especially after the time Wrangler took Baas to bench and Crane essentially threatened to have them fired if they didn't stop bringing cases like that against the PD before the DOJ. The whole thing stunk to high heavens because why should the DOJ defer punishment to crimes to the PD. The DOJ should want to hear any and all criminal cases. The fact that these cases involving Pred and Baas just get the exasperated 'they are acting like children' response feels very odd. The idea that trying to prosecute Baas or Pred for crimes they committed is childish to me only makes sense if the exasperation comes from the fact that neither were at risk of actually being removed from their job (for OOC reasons), so why try?

I don't think Saab realized how that sounded no need for hate on that shit Penta is already banning people bringing up any OOC shit.
I thought Penta heavily hinted that the biggest issue was the wranglers puppy pound issue not the bad warrant with Charlotte.
So THAT'S where the Nuke came from!
I love McConnell's energy in this.
It was the Illuminati they are scrambling our brains NOOO
"...I dunno, bad warrants..."  Real good receipts there, Baas.
[removed]
I am very disappointed in Saab. I thought he was better than this.
Yeah I just think he never got the lore. Admin decisions usually are said to be senator decisions. It does sound bad though ngl.
I was under the impression that the IC senate fired wrangler but allowed Pred and Jenny to make up whatever story they wanted to tell the lower ranking officers. But he was still fired IC and Baas knew that IC.  Here both characters are taking shots at each others pasts.
he never said the pound was the whole issue, just that it was a bigger sticking point.
What gave you that idea?
Yeah it's just RP, some spicy RP. Seemed like he finally calmed down and went with the lore they had all established to brush over the OOC reason.
Wait, so they went with the North Korea trip as a reason for him being gone instead of that he violated Tony's 4th amendment rights and was suspended for a few months over it?? Pretty odd choice.
Because I watch Saab on occasion and he's a pretty great streamer and RPer the vast majority of the time.
Nobody involved in the firing ever really made any announcement with an explanation. The North Korea trip was an explanation from Pred and Jenny. When he came back, the senate never opted to bring the issue IC, so the North Korea explanation stuck
Yes, because nobody pressed the rights violation on him. It was absolutely an OOC decision.
it was explained. maybe not announced but when do they actually announce firings? pred knew the reason about the senators IN CHARACTER before coming up with the korea story IN CHARACTER. this is the same thing as FIB stuff.. just because someone wants to make up lore for something does not mean everyone else just has to accept it if it impacts them as well. the north korea was a way to keep things lighter within their department and not worry as much about people slipping into doomer talk about it, but make no mistake, the senate firing happened in character in game first
Tbf I'd imagine it would be pretty hard to fire someone IC when they refuse to play on the server
Fair enough then, i know at the time no one knew that he would eventually be rehired. I guess, i assumed that once he was rehired they would agree on something other than the north korea thing a few officers had mentioned.
Since when do they announce firings? You think they keep them secret? When someone is fired, people are told.   How can you say the senate firing happened IN GAME, when it didn't? Did Pred know IC from the senate telling him, or from Admins telling him? If it was the senate, that could technically count, but you must remember Wranglers firing was an OOC decision first.  As far as the FIB. When someone is given keys to the FIB building and is whitelisted with police powers, that is a lot more than just making it up.
Your Imagination is limited then. They don't need to talk to Wrangler directly to have woken up on a senator character and actually given a reason to other cops. The Senate, as the IC arm of management and admins chose to make 0 effort to explain it IC to anyone.
theres a difference between telling something and making an announcement and pred knew from hhc discussing it IN GAME. just because you didn't see it yourself doesn't mean it didnt happen
When did the senate show up in game to do the firing. When did HHC fire him in-game? They didn't, he was emailed that he was fired.
my god, you're so hung up about the senate showing up in person to do this or blah blah showing up to do that... i guess i don't have to follow any laws since the president of the united states didnt show up in person to tell me those laws were passed.... YOU DON'T HAVE TO SEE SOMETHING FOR IT TO HAVE HAPPENED. if they decide that a discord call with all the high command members and senate members counts as an in game event then you know what? it's in game.
I am hung up on the truth of the matters. If the senate didn't show up IN GAME to fire him, then they didn't do that. I seriously feel like you just don't understand the difference between In-Character and In-Game.

Jesus, the scream out of Diva scared the hell out of me.
Meowfurryon returns to save Baas?
Holy shit that fucking cat launched them GOD DAYUM.
thats why wrangler is only going for dogs , cats are too strong
Damn was that Wrangler that killed another animal?... Wait till Tessa hears about this. Madge

8 judges currently on.  It's like a reverse of that Chase Clouter trial with 12 lawyers.
Wrangler has moved past pumping too close to the sun, man is now pumping on the sun lmao
Wrangler fired into Armageddon MC rp, please god.
This ain’t even gonna reach the courtroom. o7 Wrangler and Pred
I like that Penta clearly stated multiple times he is 100 percent willing to be fired to run by this arc, really hope it all remains in RP and it plays out instead of just OOC step in.
I was here for this, the last blaze of glory Gladge
the judges said no hold get the fuck out
Things was going well for Wrangler. I do admire the character sticking to what he believes in.  This RP between Wrangler and Pred vs Baas has been building up slowly for 8-9 months since that LSPD meeting at grapeseed. So the RP is all there but will the senator or god step in?
It's honestly a great last hoorah, Wrangler stays true to his character and it might lead to his downfall in the PD. Did Penta talk about any possible post PD arcs for Wrangler if he actually ends up being fired?
We're about to witness wrangler and pred being fired and the entire HUT system be reworked within the week. Grab your popcorn, this is gonna be good
One last pump
o7
Alfonzo waking up. Thank you wrangler!
[removed]
ARMAGEDDON MC BOUTTA TAKE OVER THE CITY
One pump to rule them all, one pump to find them.  One pump to bring them all, and in the server health bind them.
one last ride with wrangler o7
Semi unrelated, but 1-2 minutes into the ride Wrangler hits a fox or something and it does not go well. https://clips.twitch.tv/EasyWrongCatCharlietheUnicorn-CGy7vdZPLIXAxSix
Baas has escaped murder charges so many times in 3.0
o7 in a blaze of glory  I am reminded when baas did this to andrews   now the table turns
One last pump o7
Well this was fun until Saab brought OOC knowledge into it.
Bench guy flaming everyone involved is truly making this RP even more hilarious.
This just gives Baas an excuse to play more 2.0, what's the big deal?
o7
I love Baas so much for being a go along with it RPer. I'm going to miss Wrangler tho.
And bass is already lying 🤣
Current command are soooo bad at their jobs it’s hilarious
I so hope they fire Wrangler and Pred, connect them with CG and let the two of them become Jack & Bauer for the final season before the nuke hits.
Something about Wrangler always pushing boundaries never gets old. People will still complain it's all RP. Grasping at straws.  Edit- Chatters over here believe in RP consequences. Watch them complain when God Senator comes and fires both Wrangler and Pred. The meltdown would be interesting to watch.
Request Denied by    Shelby    Toretti    Dark   Libby    then Wrangler goes to a judge for approval until he gets what he wants smh
Shoutout saab for actually going through with all of this
anyone else in baas's position would've fired them on the spot, shootout to saab for going along with the rp.
This is hilarious
\#REVENGE Season!
Baas is too nice to exert the full power of his position, but he should have just fired wrangler on the spot.
Life be unique to stand out.   NP  being unique will get you removed.   o7 wrangler
[removed]
The problem is, Wrangler is pushing for a HUT just because. He have NOTHING to investigate, niether will he actually investigate (that was the whole reason for HUTs getting removed in the first place)  The facts of the matter are: no matter how funny Penta is, when he closes the game he does NOTHING with his paperwork, for weeks at a time.
And they still didn't notice that wrangler was indeed giving testimony on the first case PEPW
bro is pumping inside the sun LUL
Who knew Wrangler would be the first to get to space lol
Man went straight to the core
Id rather trailer park windsong RP.
Update, it in fact did reach the courtroom. o7 Wrangler and Pred.
Torretti already saying "we'll discuss your future with the pd". He got on lizzy's bad side by going around her and then calling her weak.
well
IDK, I get a vibe that Wrangler feels like he doesn't fit in anymore and that his type of policing is no longer welcome. Definitely feels like he knows full well the potential consequences for his job, but is fed up with neutering himself and would rather go out in a blaze of glory.
I mean, he's been talking about Wrangler dying alot lately lol
He said ooc, ship wrangler to a new serverr, personally i was hoping for lawyer/judge wrangler.
One IC  statement he made was something along the lines of "if they fire me, then I'll just wait and get hired to another department".    However, we now know the big man controls all hiring and promotions.  So, it could be a coin flip what happens next.
o7
ESB on top!
It's been such a long time since RP has had me feeling thrilled and tense. This is *fantastic* RP. I'm loving every moment of it. Penta, Saab, and Kyle have us eating good today.
Yea chatters are weird people forget there all good friends.
Yeah. People need to kind of take the hint that Penta clearly wants something bad to happen to wrangler. He keeps mentioning his perma conditions and keeps trying to press issues against other cops and especially Bass. As well as keeps insulting members of command.
My god her scream is always so ear shattering. It's both horrible and great
TBH Andrewd deserved it. Andrews constantly ordered people like Baas to do corrupt things (like the Dundee incident) but completely avoided consequence
Saab has gone OOC since the early days with the original Dundee missing storyline. Guy was open to getting fired for it, but then changed his mind implying BBMC were meta gaming info.
That OOC comment was kinda fucked up coming from Saab honestly. I wasn’t expecting that haha
HHC Vod review meta knowledge in action!
That was a big yikes.
Was that when Wrangler was asking for examples of wrong doing?
Isn't he an admin?
What did he say?
I didn't catch anything OOC. Ssaab has been a good sport about this RP honestly.  People bringing up the North Korea stuff are very silly honestly. It's not like that stuff was actually the truth. It was just funnier than the truth so people rolled with that story
it wasn't OOC and anyone braindead enough to call that ooc and ignore resentment from wranglers side is seeing things with blinders. the senate firing wrangler was the in character explanation period
You mean like no one seeing Baas throw a brick but somehow both Pred and Wrangler knowing about it?
Ssaab just said that Pred and Wrangler might not have jobs after all this is said and done.
Well its a big deal because IC Wrangler will probably get fired for this. Its not a big OOC deal. I imagine Ssaab was laughing his ass off(which we cannot see, because his vods are sub-only).
Saab was so close too. "Send me in." Brian " Wtf baas, no shut up."
A degeneration into crime with wrangler Pred would be legendary.
Toretti's EKG wrote down  "wrangler you are fired" during the surgery
Actually doesn’t have what it takes.
The majority of people here are expecting them to get fired. Im not sure what kind of gotcha moment you are trying for, here.
Hilariously this is exactly what they are expecting to happen.
Are you trying to imply that this is OOC and malicious and not just RP between 3 IRL friends?
Why would God Senator fire them when Baas can legally fire them?
Pred and Wrangler get fired? Sounds like Slim and Uncle need to wake up.
Did Dark deny I thought he had to leave for an emergency
Dark and Libby didn't deny anything. Shelby said go to Toretti and Toretti said post it to the docket which is what happened.
Because the judge can’t be fired by baas
It was to be approved by Dark but he had to leave before he had the chance to sign it.
i love spreading misinformation online
Oh he definitely getting fired after this one. Maybe. Should be funny though.
His request for a 24 hour hold was denied, never his request for a HUT. Him going to the judge was giving up on the 24 hour hold and just moving on with the HUT.
Wow
What did he go through with?
Well wouldnt that be illegal BECAUSE of his position?
More corruption charges hurray!!!
Baas said he will play ball and then fire them afterwards because he doesnt want people who use anything to get back at people and hold petty grudges in the pd
Firing wrangler would prove him right. Why would baas want wrangler to have vindication
Should have done what Wrangler did to Minerva (?) when she arrested him for shooting the dog.  This will probably be funnier though.
And waste all the RP from this stellar group for what exactly?
Firing someone on the spot is kinda boring RP. It's like the PD equivalent of shooting someone straight away who "disrespects you".
That is why the Judge came, it would've made Wrangler's case better
My brother in christ, even Penta knew he's getting fired for this lol
[removed]
HUTs don't exist to allow for further investigations, that is 24 (72 with judge approval) holds. HUTs exist to keep a criminal in jail until their trial (or nowadays until bail)
are you a cop on nopixel?
Just look at recent events, he procrastinated pushing charges on Rosa and Murphy so much that Rosa became a judge.
Really he has just left the atmosphere and is pumping in deep space right now. Im sure he could write a song about it.  Pumping the sun would be a Senator or the top cop who cannot be named.
Baas really helping Wrangler reach his full potential lmao
Update, it's probably gonna end in this court house. Crane saying it's not witness tampering. o7 Wrangler and Pred
The funniest part is he did it the way Toretti told him to. This is process with a HUT charge that's going to the docket.
Torretti really emailed that from the ICU lol
wrangler calling Reed weak was cruel man, calling her weak for denying what he wanted is some bullshiit. If anything she is strong for not rolling over and letting wrangler do what he wants.
*further on her bad side.
About that... stepping in ooc.
Penta has been dropping perma hints too at the end of his Wrangler streams a couple times, the most recent one I remember is him joking around saying that he sure hopes Baas doesn't kidnap him otherwise Wrangler might not survive the encounter.
I second this. The writing has been on the wall for awhile now and I love Wrangler sticking to his guns and going full on pump.
This x1000 i think that pumping has become too stressful and he knew well going into this he had an extremely high chance at losing his job on wrangler and just full sent it to see what happens, not sure if he will eat the 30 days and make the new character hes been saying he feels like or if he might try a different cop who knows.
Tbh i think penta would HATE HATE HATE  the shit out of being a judge. Sounds like more ooc BS than any IC being a judge.
He wasn't talking about another department in terms of one on NoPixel.
Didn't Wrangler show some interest in Aegis after Pred and he talked to Crane about it? It might be some kind of alternative for an arc if PD doesn't want to hire him.
He meant another server completely. Not another pd on nopixl, even stated as much later.
problem with another department will hire me statement is he pissed of libby(lspd Cop) and torertti(sheriff) so who would hire him
100% agree. It's 9am now and I couldn't pull myself away to go to bed. Good thing it's friday lol.
I really hate the tension because I'm waiting for it to be stopped short with considerations that shouldn't come into the situation at hand.
Honestly was kind of a nice whole week so far. Peter Parker,Jordan,Charlotte yesterday and now Bass and Kyle and wrangler stuff
That was a really frustrating time to watch Cop RP. And it was definitely the spark that lit the 3.0 PD corruption and lack of consequences arc.
The cycle goes on
I expect it from Saab now, look at who he defended. Look at who he coddled on the server.
Do we actually have any confirmation that it's not IC knowledge? Did Penta explicitly say that it was OOC knowledge?
Why is it unexpected?
Ssaab is an admin. Baas is not. There's is a distinct difference.
"you werent shipped to north korea you were fired"
There's also the ponytail gun. He brought up that she never had a class 2 on her back at GG Gas. Which it really looked like from his perspective and she was accessing a van so when he got a clearer look he figured she stowed it.
Then why did no one say that at the time and everyone went with the North Korea story?
The difference is other people told Pred that happened when those people shouldn't have known about it. Shouldn't have happened but it's not Pred's fault for having other people give him OOC knowledge in character.
Because 4 people who witnessed it told Pred and Pred told wrangler???
How would you or Baas know for a fact no one saw it?
Didn't Bloom know and have the brick but tossed it because of amnesia after the Bundy hit?  Honestly dunno, I'm not sure who I watched, some cop threw away a brick that had something to do with Baas because the character didn't remember.
I can’t believe they decided to try to rewrite history and take away all the work Malton did to solve that cold case.   We all know Government Employee Baasem ^^^^^(Shaheem) threw that brick, there was even a press conference about it
I think that's what Penta wants at this point
Later on he said he wouldn't be the one to make that call.
He was laughing.
Well while this is only a minute and a half long clip, I didn't hear a single laugh so we'll have to see later how he is really taking it.  From the tone in the clip, seriously. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltAgRFWeUFo
Genuinely curious because I'm not too sure how it's handled on NoPixel, but can't people stay in ICU while they're still recovering? I think I've seen it a few times, it was mostly after their supposed recovery and them being released soon after it, but from what I've seen, being in the ICU doesn't mean you have to be unconscious.
What happend was: Libby came, said she was disappointed Wrangler and Pred ignoring her saying she was gonna think about it (authorizing the hut) and went straight to a judge, when multible HC said no. She also had sent an email to Pred saying to not do it. He didn't read it. When she said this, Wrangler said to Pred and I quote " I told you she was weak". Also that he knew she couldn't do this (meaning being a chief)  She left, came back with an email from Toretti saying he was disappointed in them going over his head and that he would talk to Wrangler about his job later.  She wasn't weak, she didn't cave. She just didn't have to put up with bs.
Word for word? Seriously, that's kinda sad.  I mean, the writing has been on the wall for a while. Guess this is better than death by a thousand paper cuts.
How is that OOC? Didn't toretti and baas just say that?
Dark didn't deny, and neither did Libby. Dark had to go, Libby said she needed time to think. Shelby felt it needed to be run by Toretti.
Libby has officially denied it. She responded by email and has now shown up. She said that it wasn’t necessary to have a hold, and then was very disappointed that they went over her head to the DOJ. She also read an email from Torretti who said he plans on talking to Wrangler about his future employment once he’s out of the ICU.
literally  they just wanted it him to go about it differently
This needs to be stated over and over again.
Of course Dark lol, Richard has been after Baas' ass for years by now, still holding that L from the Dundee situation lol.  edit: and baas was barely a senior deputy during that, so no excuse of "baas higher power" from that situation.
This'll be the narrative.
The fact that wrangler was trying to send him in on a HUT?
Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't Wrangler fire Charlotte for...going on a date with CTH? I believe his quote to her was something along the lines of "Police officers are at will employees and can be fired for ANY reason". I think this was before he used his position of power to trick her into withdrawing all of her money out of her bank account at gunpoint after hiring the HOA to do it.
He can literally fire Wrangler because of his position
isn't that what wrangler did when he shot the dog?
The man literally committed the crimes just the other week. LOL
Crazy when Baas literally started it. The court case for Pred's witness tampering was literally petty shit to delay the shit pit case.
The irony.
Baas has already threatened to fire Wrangler for arresting him, where do you think Wrangler learned it?
I think the point is that he even will get fired by this, not that anyone is surprised it will happen.
This is how everyone gets more Mike Block
HUTs by definition don't. Investigative holds do.
They were charged the same night they were arrested. Just making things up now?
He didn't know he needed to file a bar complaint. The charges were filed the moment the report was finished and they were sent.
tru
#ShelbyDidThis
Server health you asshole cranePls
Dude woke up from a heart attack.
Lel
Wrangler sort of has an issue when people don't take the initiative I think. Same thing happened with Shelby and he insulted her for that as well and came back to apologize. But yeah
Did he call her weak to her face?
> calling her weak for denying what he wanted is some bullshiit.  You don't understand Wrangler's perspective. If you were absolutely sure without a doubt that Baas deserved to go to prison, you wouldn't see it as "not giving him what he wants," you would see it as "not standing up to her boss." It wouldn't even cross his mind that she would have a legitimate reason to say no.
He called her weak because despite all he has heard about how strongly she is against corruption in the PD she didn't follow through with it when it was her boss
Did she suspend or fire him? Because that would be the appropriate response for something like that.
Ooc she was woken up twice for it - and it was all basically unnecessary IC in the end because her wishes and opinions on the topic were circumvented because she wanted to take time to think instead of getting bullied into a decision like Siobhan did.  Turns out Libby had the right read and made the right call - being impulsive is weak, considering the facts and making a rational decision while being openly ridiculed is what strength looks like to me.  And that comment is in no way a slight on Siobhan, just positive affirmations of Libby's strength.
He wouldn't perma Jimmy, let alone Wrangler.
I wouldn't be surprised if the three of them all had perma conditions with each other.
Ever since the character was chain-nerfed and denied anything investigative OOC he's been pushing towards wrapping him up it seems.
He mentioned moving wrangler to another server, but penta wouldn't play another server consistently. I feel Wrangler would just be shelved(even though i think the character could still do strong outside cop). More mike, more 2.0.  Idk we'll see.
Well see you missed the point.  Even if they are on good terms with him, they don't have the say if they wanted to hire him.
Another department = another server
100% It was when only a few people who didn't want consequences were allowed to be corrupt. It was stupid. I personally can't stand Andrews
But it was always okay because he’d just laugh off the OOC insults from them. Yeah you’re right can’t argue there haha
The example given was the pony tail incident which was a vod review discussed ooc and was never brought to court. that's all you need to know.
He said the Senate fired him, that's it. The reasoning for his firing had OOC reasoning, but the actual firing was very much IC
Yeah I was wrong it wasn’t unexpected. Maybe because Saab and Penta are friends IRL i wouldn’t expect him to bring OOC shit up towards him
Classic people bringing up Saab and baas the same person baas is a character Saab is a person and already addresed the issue and they are literally friends irl lol
I mean he was fired regardless of what characters said about his absence
He is right though. That is the RP management went with. Like it or not. The only people saying he went to NK were Pred & Jenny, and they both knew they made it up.  You cannot just rewrite the RP because it was not done in the city.
It was very obviously the IC explanation by his  bosses to cover it up at the time. IDK when people started to think it was the truth and not just Pred/Jenny covering for him?
Courtesy of saving face probably
Because it's more fun to rp around obviously even if it's a lie
Probably didn’t want to deal with rapid chatters
No one witnessed it. That's why he stayed in the PD. Go and watch the clips.
Nobody did. People 'metad' it and made it into a meme and got bannend for it..
Lol because he knows the big boss upstairs makes all the PD hiring/firing calls.
He rolled with the whole thing lol
You do not have to be unconscious and you are free to role play your ICU time however you like it. People just like to make sly comments because emails were used and Wrangler is involved.
That explains where the comments à la "Actually doesn't have what it takes" in here are coming from.
Im trying to understand what it is you are saying cause, between the original comment and the edit, it definitely reads like you are saying this isn't all RP.  edit: perhaps you are missing some commas that would change the meaning?
Libby sent a message to pred (which he didnt read) that she said no.
And Toretti approved sending him in for the 9's, just for the Witness Tampering charge itself and not investigative reasons.
I mean she's right, it's definitely not necessary. But it's something that would easily be pushed for criminals with the same crime. I see both sides tbh.
well he's certainly gone about it differently PEPW
But he didn't get sent on a HUT.
Wrangler may have been legally in the right to do so because there are no workers' rights at all in NP. But generally most people try to afford people those rights anyway, because it's courteous and usually   (not always) leads to more interesting RP.
"The past is the past" - Baas
I mean it fits wrangler the character to a tee.
Yea he said something like “see pred I told you she was weak” when she told him she denied it in the cells.
Yea, the grievances people take with in character decisions is wild.
>instead of getting bullied into a decision like Siobhan did.     Siobhan wasn't bullied into anything.  She exclaimed loudly "FUCK" when she realized that Wrangler was legally right and that her job as a judge required her to sign off on it.      Libby doesn't have to approve it for whatever reasons,  but it definitely weakens her anti corruption stance....
Baas is Pred's perma condition, he even referenced it today on Baas "mission" for Pred out on the ocean when Baas made Pred Trooper.  If you go to 5:23 of Kyle's VOD today (he's live still as I write this), you can see the whole sequence of events from Baas sending Kyle on the "mission" and about 30 minutes later Kyle accepting Trooper.  The clips currently up are pieces of this 30 minute interval.  https://clips.twitch.tv/ResilientSteamyBananaTwitchRaid-NJqCDN2fS3gmWvJK
I mean what consequences are there on the server? Sentences are capped, no one looses anyone important, fines are a joke, DOJ putting up roadblock after roadblock. Even when you get a pump, criminals plead out for a few days of sentence and go right back to crime
Yeah, he's been saying lately that it'd be crazy if someone kidnapped and tortured Wrangler... "He might not survive"
i wish people would stop the narrative that it was targeted at wrangler, everyone was denied detective from the big guy
Penta tends to get addicted to good arcs. It's possible he could play Wrangler on another server and barely touch it. Or if he ran into good RP, he could get hooked on wrangler.
I could understand his wanting to chill on an RP server with his friends while taking a break from the reality of the actual job but the way management handles things OOC always leaves much to be desired. I don't blame Andrews.
Do we know whether it was used as one of the reasons for Wrangler's dismissal from the senate? If it was used, people could use the same argument for that point as people are using for Wrangler and Pred knowing about the EMS brick incident. It could OOC knowledge that got spread IC, in one case through a possible reason of Wrangler being fired and in the other case because some dumbfuck spread the clip in a PD meeting.  Edit: Also a genuine question, but wasn't it already established that body cams are always on and can be reviewed when that thing happened?
it's crazy that you seem to know all of this but the roleplayer that plays Wrangler is finding out about it being "ÏC" this way after all this time.
I'm pretty sure he was never even "fired". He just had his whitelist removed. It wasn't just Wrangler, it was all his cop characters including John Cop (on which he never had "problematic" behaviors). That's why when it was brought up he was like "nah I was in Korea" and after Baas pushed it again he was like "alright then, why was I fired?".
Yeah. I don't know why people mix this up: Ssaab is friends with Kyle and Penta, al Saab is in The Clean Boys, and Baas is in Chang Gang. It's not hard.
Didn't realize his firing was done in the city. Must have missed that stream.
There was no rp behind it at all. I doubt they had an IC convo Out Of City. So to bring it up IC it was to NK since there was no IC firing or w/e at all.
I think the problem is that was never explained to anyone ic. Unless I’m wrong and I’ll delete if I am.
It's actually the slow chatters you have to worry about.
Yeah, the clip of it happening was watched by a ton of people and a doctor didn’t realize that it wasn’t known in character and made jokes about it to Baas. He was banned. People were told not to reference it because nobody saw Baas throw the brick IC.
AFAIK there were people at the farmers market who saw him there, saw him leave, and then also saw the dead EMS. They put together 2 and 2 but they didn't see the brick toss itself. IDK if anyone ever actually did a thorough investigation at the time, like interviewing people at the market. So there was no PD investigation to get Baas in trouble in the first place. It was only way later that it came up and the people in question said what they knew.
But Pred was told IC though. How the people who told him knew, is a different matter.
But wrangler got the information in-game. So to him, it wasnt ooc.
[removed]
About the 24 hour hold right? That is what they were asking her for. As far as my memory goes, everyone he has talked to has not denied him a HUT, just a 24 hour.
Apparently not since Toretti said he is extremely disappointed in Wrangler and that he didn't need a hold for this.
jumped the gun like usual, classic.  didn't even get the recording from bailey
That’s why I said “trying”. He initially thought it was till they went to court
"My past is in the past,  but your past is with you forever"
Dumbest shit ever, especially when it's about court.
Ah, i had to stop watching after the arrest started. Didn't know she came back.
Nah i think wrangler said, " she didn't have it in her".
He said “see pred, I told you she doesn’t have what it takes”
Agree to disagree, on both points, I feel Siobhan wasn't given time or space in the conversation to reach her own conclusion naturally - it felt like she was being forcefully led to make her decision at a rushed pace.  I am aware this is my opinion and perception and not concrete fact.  And I think Libby didn't alter her anti-corruption stance at all negatively.  Just because after that she couldn't justify 72 hours of hold time, doesn't mean she doesn't support Wrangler or his position.  You can think baas is acting corrupt and in the wrong with quid pro quo and still not think the witness is in any danger, to necessitate a 72 hour hold.
From what he said, it seems like it's been one of his perma condition from the very beginning but that it's never happened.
Stubble said today that wrangler had now been re-approved to head the detective department in BCSO (this was during Winston’s interview when he said he wanted to do it now that wrangler had been told no). Unfortunately they haven’t been able to tell Wrangler yet.
i don't think this comment implies anything about it being targeted. It just is a fact that his ambition to be a detective was denied.
No No and No.
Not everything IC happens in the city. Discord/email RP is real.   The simple fact is that management decided on something. That cannot just be ignored & rewritten because it never resulted in a conversation in the city.
That does not really work when Pred & Jenny both knew Wrangler had been fired, and chose to come up with the lie to preserve moral.
From what I remember, when Malton conducted the investigation, IC he was able to come to the conclusion that Baas probably did it, but there was no definitive proof. I don’t think Malton ever shared that belief in IC, though.
The investigation died when someone linked the gif of Baas throwing the brick at an MRPD meeting. Ssaab talked about permaing Baas if it was figured out or he faced repercussions. Brian Knight covered it up. Lenny Hawk was trying to figure it out.
*  "People will still complain it's all RP" = People will say its IC when its not. *  "People will still complain, but it's all RP" = People's complaints are dumb.  Grasping at straws can be interpreted as meaning the people who think it is all RP are grasping at straws.  Saying both those things after talking about Wrangler pushing boundaries makes it read like you are saying Wrangler pushing boundaries is an OOC thing.  When you add in the edit where you are complaining about chatters who like consequences melting down because a god senator flies in to fire Wrangler and Pred, it muddies the waters even more.  I am no stranger to thinking something I wrote sends a very specific message, and being made to discover that what sounded clear in my head turned into words that would easily convey the opposite meaning. I am just trying to clear up what it is you mean, that is why I asked the question in the first place, because it felt like you may have been meaning something different than your words conveyed.
Toretti showing how spineless he is by going back to his words, a classic.
He was going to try to get the recording after they put baas in jail. So bailey would be protected.
You're shouting out Ssaab for not outright rejecting the RP?  Is that where the bar is?
So why do you insinuate she was rushed into a decision if there is no evidence that is so?
BIG OOF.... LUL.  now fired...
That’s not exactly what happened, he told Winston that Wrangler would lead the BCSO detective unit because in character, Stubble hasn’t been told that Wrangler’s been denied that position so he’s still working under that assumption even though Myles OOC knows it’s not happening. So Wrangler wasn’t reapproved, Stubble the character just isn’t aware he was ever denied in the first place.
So what about [this clip from January 2022 where  Wolfabelle talked about OOC information being used to punish cops IC](https://www.reddit.com/r/RPClipsGTA/comments/saqni9/the_new_pd_announcement_on_using_ooc_information/)? As OOC information is still being used to punish cops IC (see Gable), I find it hard to believe that it wasn't in use when Penta's stuff was  reviewed.  Unless you come with some receipts, it's difficult for me to believe your other replies as well.
Lol no it's not. "Email RP" lmao
[removed]
TBF it seemed like Toretti was blasted on Lean last night, or something. Dude sounded as if he was on something lol
Unfortunately it is.
The only thing that could possibly be construed as rushing her was when Wrangler told her to stop stalling and sign it, she laughed out loud and said you saw right through that.
>Do we actually have any confirmation that it's not IC knowledge? Did Penta explicitly say that it was OOC knowledge?  There you go you ended up answering your own question. makes me wonder why you asked it in the first place.
I wanted to help you understand that your message was not as clear as you thought and could probably do with another edit, I was trying to help you clear it up. But all you have done is insult me. Have a nice day, I am done wasting my time.
Lmao, I genuinely don't know what this is supposed to mean, so did he confirm that it was OOC knowledge?   I did a quick search because your reply was so dismissive, how dare I?! I guess you should call me a fucker.
I don't believe what you are saying is true. Have a nice day too brother.

I just got off a group call with Uber and Chalupa, they were very determined to let me know that they are angry OOC about this and fully intend to settle this OOC. I asked what they meant and they sent me a picture of Uber shirtless and covered in a bright orange powder, and Chalupas arm in frame with COUNCILOR written on it in sharpie.  Before I could say anything else, they said they were about to board a boat full of orange snow and ended the call.
Wtf is wrong with people
Kebun was just talking to his chat about this and how the HOA are like a group of the nicest people. So much so he doesnt want to somehow get roped into this fighting with them. Over invested viewers are so bad in the NP community which sucks because RP is such an enjoyable thing to watch.
It's sad how often this happens with HOA and wars. People actually tend to enjoy going to war with them because they make it fun and there isn't as much malding as South side wars.  Silent was laughing his ass off after the LL breach yesterday. That's what wars should be.
I know Vtechas(Daryl Dickinson) (who wasn't even streaming at the time) was getting angry DM's when HOA were first meeting about what they were going to do about the whole situation ( Andi getting kidnapped and ocean dumped ).
Context: HoA are ending the war due to toxicity. Multiple bad hoppers, death threats, and people not logging in. Julio talked about it twice on his stream. Later on, Julio meets with Ant in the LL and talks about ending it as everyone woke up feeling terrible.  **UPDATE: War may not be totally over, but they are no longer hunting, instead aiming to go after Lilith and do war from their approach. (Less shootout, more RP/Kidnapping.)**
This sucks. They both could war and have tons of fun. They were shooting each other one minute, pause for a wheel chair race. How many wars do you see on a server that is that much fun. Trolls need to stop their sheet cause they ruin all the fun
It's no wonder HOA avoid war at all costs when this is how it turns out. Really kills the entire vibe when viewers think they need to shit on the people involved for no reason.   Can't see UHN/Siz coming back any time soon with the way things are either, which is a shame.
hoa been losing and get toxic viewers, it would be even worst if they were winning.
Audible gasp! Who could've seen this coming?
It was really bad in Dragon's chat the last couple of days. Idk if theyre Hydra/CG or Angels hoppers but dude doesnt deserve that
at these point, all war should be done off-stream. fuck the contents. let the streamers enjoy their time on the server for fuck sake
Yup saw this coming. too many hands in the pot. if it was just the people who were involved with the kidnapped of Andi it wouldn’t had lead to a large war thing.
With nearly every group in the city having a connection to a piece of the overall conflict, hoppers gonna hop (not that they should).  The war created a lot of funny moments, sad to see it end.
Ever since the shooting started there have been a lot of comments directed toward the Hydra side. A bunch of passive aggressive shit about them not rping. People acting like Hydra is somehow doing something wrong even though everything that has happened totally makes sense in RP
Oh wow that's surprising considering who they are at war with, that's so crazy.
Also various HOA-related streamers immediately going into meta chats and shitting on the war didn't help either.
It's was fun with hydra only. Hydra involving angles and then angles involving vft was just stupid imo
There still at war with hydra and cg
ngl it seems like an accuse to end it as many have used it in the past. ( Just  my opinion ) Its there chats an they can have there mods handle it period. Dnt take things ppl say on the internet to heart and DNT EVER let hoppers/chat to dictate ur rp an how it goes ect. In saying this , HOA of all grps do NOT deserve such treatment. There the most chilliest an RP heavy grp than 95% of others on the server. War RP gets ppl all riled up an fans start hoping an being toxic cuzz there wayyyy to invested. Just ban the dumb asses an move on.
This has gone TOO FAR.
this wouldn’t have happened if kraytor was around. just saying
OH GOD!!!
[removed]
Yeah it’s sad because any conflict always brings out the weirdos. As an angels viewer they’ve openly talked about avoiding wars since 2.0 because the viewers can’t handle it. Even Claire and Flippys RP relationship has created some stalkers, and that’s not even conflict, it’s always just dumb fun. I’m certain every cop gets death threats, I know snow has talk about every time he has a clip on this Reddit he gets a bunch of death threats. It just sucks the fun out of the game
[removed]
Which SS (and 1 member of HoA if im not mistaken) immediately fucked up lol Im sure they will talk to Julio and get the HOA side of things figured out at least. He seemed pretty upset about then going after Alex from the angels right after a really fun race down a mountain.
And what do you know, Siz actually logged on today.
He is 100% done with NP after all this shit.
This shit right here is the toxic shit they are talking about.   Viewers fucked it up, not the people they are at war with.
I don't think anyone from hydra or CG has been toxic about.
How do you equate people receiving death threats to people expressing a dislike of an RP war? In what way are those things even remotely similar?
I might be crazy, but this is literally blaming the people receiving death threats for... not being positive about the war?
Who from the HOA side shitted on the war huh
Don't be obtuse
Why is that stupid?

Glad my assumption was wrong! Hope he sticks around for a bit, he's a fun character.
Eli brotha you really need to stop talking for James. Like really need to stop.  You're in a ton of threads doing it. Chill.
Uber and the rest of the HOA have been quietly working on TangWorld, an invite only RP server that's due for release at the end of June. I don't want to give away too much, but the server has the ability to instantly switch from GTA V, Red Dead 2, and Cyberpunk 2077 for the first time-travel capable RP server.   There's also a team of PIs on retainer to run background checks on prospective members. Because of this, I will be unable to return due to an alleged incident where I shit my pants in a Wal-Mart parking lot in 2002.
He's 100% done, which is he's literally on the server right now.
Which is a damn shame after all the time, effort, and IRL money he's put into the server. Not to mention having a generally positive attitude and being really creative.
He's not done. He's just burnt out as fuck lol hates the drama and the chatters tend to make it worse with some of their weird takes on things.  James is just waiting for the drama to blow over, I'd assume.  I was actually looking forward to his idea of HOA doing a southside gang arc in 2.0 lol
You watch all the streamers PoV they're all laughing and having a good time 90% of it.
[removed]
Well to be entirely fair, they aren't exactly wrong. This isn't the first war (by far) that has been ended due to toxicity when involving these groups.   Now, that being said, you are also not wrong. It IS the viewers and not the streamers, and comments like the one you responded to aren't okay either. Two wrongs don't make a right.
Viewers reflect the streamer. Just because this war hasn't been toxic doesn't change the make-up of the fan base.
NONE of the streamers have, it's all the viewers.
People cant seem to comprehend that outside of a select few HOA members, most dont like fighting but IC it makes no sense to not retaliate when your leader is kidnapped and tortured. Absolutely nobody in the HOA has shit on a single other streamer or person. Some have been disappointed mildly that a bunch of gangs got involved when they had absolute 0 to do with the kidnapping and ocean dumping especially when Hydra and CG do not need any help especially when until up to now its been HOA + Dragon and 1 other Seaside member. Thats about it and I guess the complaint about heroin lol. Nobody in the HOA has been toxic to others. HOA has gone out of their way during battles to stay positive while theyre getting dominated and yet hoppers were still abusing them for no reason.
Mayumi pretty much said the shooting was just GTA Online/Valorant on stream. Then you have multiple members in discord saying the same shit to viewers in meta chats lol
Because they have no business getting involved, sure hydra is close with the angles and angles are close to vft but still, they gain nothing from it, only hydra because of migL and liliath
smh leaking just like Fred. Julio's gonna have to blood you out now.
LEAKER
I hate/love you spicey. I hope everything is well on your end.
Good!
I dont think he has said he was done it's just the drama is probably going to extend his time away
He REALLY gets uncomfortable with the OOC drama and with the Rated stuff coming out? No shot he returns.
Literally the streamers are purposefully doing things to make sure the other side has fun.
This doesn't really show how Ramee feels about death threats. Just Ramee being a bit defensive too quick and probably cuts off before he even says anything of meaning
The streamers fuel that shit. They foster audiences that make that shit acceptable. A lot of the rated stuff coming out these days further demonstrates that.
I do believe that in this case, but it's undeniable that some of the streamers involved have also purposefully fostered a community that would act this way.
Wow you don't say: https://imgur.com/a/5223e7p
LUNA, the streamer, said it was similar to GTA online because she had just been shot down.  Meta chats are literally there for meta and to discuss the stuff, be it positive or negative, going on.  It sucks you're blaming the streamers, who aren't having fun because they're receiving shitty messages and death threats.
Luna has had to deal with hoppers before (the BSK /casino stuff for example), so it’s understandable that she may be frustrated having to deal with that stuff yet again.
That's pretty bold to claim multiple HOA members were shit talking the war in discord without any prove lol. And Luna was talking about conflicts really just do turn into who has the better shooters. That's not really false.
It does become like that. The war and all these shootouts is just like filler in the RP about this whole conflict. You have May wake up immediately get in a gun fight. Some people find that shit fun while others wont to just interact with others.
I don’t think you understood anything she said, she was saying she didn’t enjoy it because it’s not RP anymore, it turns to a shitty shooter in GTA. And that wasn’t even the main point of what she was saying
The moment Benji went around asking for gangs to join a coalition it was completely fair for Hydra to ask Angels for help. In fact Hydra and Angels connection makes more sense in rp than most of the gangs the coalition asked.
Was that before or after the Rated stuff?
he's on Siz right now. this is what happens when you try to talk for someone you don't even know personally, please stop talking for James LMAO
>No shot he returns  Bruh he’s been internet famous for like 15 years if he didn’t retire from the internet after the dozens of other dumb content creators dramas, this  isn’t going to do it either
Some streamers do, I fully agree with you. Some also don't but still suffer from toxicity. No matter what you tell people, there is going to be a percentage that give zero fucks. It's no excuse to half-ass it though. Always do your best as a content creator to shut that shit down as best as you can.
Bruh Migl was losing it when Flippy wanted to do a shoot out at LL. He then lost it again when they ran in HOA/Seaside on the highway. So yeah toxicity is a reflection isnt it?
I mean yeah, MgL is acting weird during this whole thing. Swizz isn't but MgL is. Kinda have a tinfoil hat theory that MgL is an op for Mike Simone tbh.
HOA and Seaside developed a coalition because the members of each group involved had a stake in the Simone debacle. Furthermore, HOA and Seaside's gang leaders got kidnapped, interrogated, and oceandumped because of the Simone web. Angels, VFT, and all the other groups Hydra asked to join in the war had no stake in the Simone debacle. They were simply asked to join for coverage and to put pressure on HOA-Seaside.
Tbf idk why Benji did that. Haven't seen much of his stream to know whole either
I think return like return to nopixel, he'll still stream.
It is just common sense that if you act toxic, youre going to get more viewers who act like that with that type of mentality even when youre not being toxic. This is why its important that Nopixel management starts taking ALL TOXICITY seriously because it breeds a viewership that has more vicious viewers.
Migl is acting kinda weird this entire war, ngl.
I don’t disagree with HOA and Seaside (Lost too except they haven’t done anything yet) being involved but them asking completely random gangs was their biggest mistake
This. He's streaming now, I just think he's done with NP.
MGL been acting weird in regards to the HOA for the past 2 years.
You mean he's IC playing fear for the fact that if he gets caught by Seaside or HOA he will be tortured and/or killed?  How's that being weird?
I mean there's an IC reason Miguel is mad and is a bit more riled up than Flippy and the others.
I wouldn't say "completely" random, the Lost and Diamond Dogs are also pretty involved in the Simone Debacle. Rudi was also kidnapped, interrogated, and oceandumped by CG. Reed and the Diamond Dogs have history with the Simones, especially Michael. I don't know much about NBC's involvement with the Simones, I only know Pilbus was willing to fight because of Andi.
dawg wtf are you talking about   why are u in every HOA thread speaking for him
I too like to wildly speculate that's why I like WSB.
My guy, Benji also tried to get Rust and the Ballas to join his cause too. All Hydra knew was that there was potentially half the cities gangs after them, so naturally they're going to go to their (second) closest ally that actually have IC reasons that make sense to join. He absolutely tried to involve random groups to join a coalition. Hydra can shoot, but asking one group to go against 6 is too much.
The most toxic HOA viewer I hate to say it

Meelo even joined in when CG/Hydra were trying to protect Lilith from HOA, Zaceed wanted to get GG involved in WW3 when AshK got kidnapped by Seaside etc. Flippy finally figured out why after they almost ran over AshK and Meelo.

lmao, unless they find out it was Denzel, (at this moment) Knight/Baas think the Simones put a hit on Norman because the witness (statement) misheard it as "The Simones sends their regards".  Edit: nevermind, witness statement had it correct. Not sure if Baas got wrong information or if its just a classic case of Baas being Baas.
Denzel Williams is fucking back.
oh baby, its #REVENGESEASON
MANY MEN
No one can do this kind of shit like Jon honestly
How will this arc end I don’t see this ending without one party losing everything and looks like none of the party want to lose anything
AND  he strutted out.
GIGACHAD
This was so bad ass to watch
Scariest man the city has ever seen is back, love to see it.
Time for revenge season. A lot of people are about to get everything that matters taken from them and there’s nothing they’ll be able to do about it, and at the same time a lot of people are going to get rewarded for their hard work and loyalty.
What happened? didnt Lang and the rest have a ceasefire with the Simones?
revenge best served cold...   or with a bullet with a 50% chance of perma LUL
Did Norman win judge? That might be terrorism 😂
HARD
Baas and especially Knight are always happy to be able add another pin into their Simone conspiracy board.
Siobhan is right there, i think they will find out.^^
Just Ssaab being speech and listening -1000 lol
Lang told him that he needs him and Denzel was like "bet."
Denzel & Harry standing side by side like The Gunns while a camera does a 360 shot.
Whenever I get reminded of this I always hear Speedy's voice hahaha
MAANYMANYMANY MANY MEN.

Him tracking down and capturing meowfurion was legit scary even as a viewer. He plays a psychopath so well.
WhatCanYouDo 󠀀
Simones do so face swap stuff or fake death. Lang goes to the moon with his runescape wife only to find another time lord waiting for him there. Lakers still lose.
Arc ends with Michael Simone being found guilty and sentenced to death and the Simones bending the knee to Lang for him to pardon Michael.
They won the election, gloves are off, and the leanisters always pay their debts
Denzel and Harry want to gang bang real bad. I'm here for it honestly
He heard that simones trying to sue lang for ??? (Not sure details, something about using mayor to send twats).  And that norman adams is the one helping nick do it.
They don't consider Norman part of the ceasefire. A day or two after the ceasefire lang told Harry and Denzel to go after Norman.
terrorism means nothing to denzel motha fuckin williams
Norman wasn't shot because he was a judge. He was shot because his affiliation with the Simones and shooting at the court house isn't automatic terrorism. So it would be hard to prove especially since witnesses having him mentioning the Simones
Doubtful, but if they are going to try to push terrorism, you can rest assured Denzel will make sure he will make that sentence worth it's time.
Brian was talking about Norman droping from the case against Lang just before this, so he kinda had a better timed motive.
literally this. guy said "im only coming on for layla".. then lang said "i need you".. and 2 days later the city was burning :D
"Say less, Lang."
As the resident Kate/Nancy Drew poster and also a mod on SquaredCircle, this combination of clip and reference **NOURISHES ME**.
That entrance went so fucking hard
huge aew reference! what an entrance that was!
I need someone to make an edit to simulate this **immediately**.  What an insane entrance that was despite no real added effects.
ThatsLife
Lang isn't pardoning Michael lol
Jon playing his ESB character on the 2.0 server got him feelin some type of way lmao
pretty sure the case will get dismissed (not confirmed). Norman stepping down because he got elected as judge and Hayes probably going to lose his bar license
Nick is trying to sue for defamation
true, that guy will get a sit on spaceship either way
Getting shot because Simones supported his election campaign sounds like textbook political motivation to me. (I'm no judge or lawyer though.)
Yelling "you're a Simone puppet" or whatever at a newly elected judge and shooting him... cops might try it, definitely sounds politically motivated.
IDK. I believe Lang would absolutely pardon Michael if he's begged for it. It's the ultimate "I win" for him, IMO.  2 "trust fund babies" admitting defeat and bending the knee.
its RP anything can happen
I think you would be surprised by that one.
Hopefully it’s a job for Himothy. To be honest just call Michael as a witness and you’d just win when he fails to show.
Either you admit that you're a Simone puppet judge so you can push the terrorism narrative, or you eat the bullet but keep silent and deny the Simone involvement in your political campaign?  Seems like an easy win-win for Denzel lol.
I highly doubt they will, but like I said, even if they will, Denzel will make sure he will go down for actual terrorism.
But is Simone a political figure?
It might sound politically motivated, but do they have reason to believe it is. That's always an important distinction. Just because something may sound like something, it depends on what they can prove.
> I believe Lang would absolutely pardon Michael if he's begged for it.  No he wouldn't. He (Lang) is more likely to beg to be put on the firing squad himself.
Listening to Himothy on vacation just reinforces that he really is Him lol
There is probably a third option. Political motives do not have to be based on facts. E.g. if x shoots y because x believes y is a communist, then that is political even if y is not a communist. So you can both deny Simone's involvement and argue that it was politically motivated. All you'd need is to build the narrative that Denzel *thought* that Simone supported the campaign sufficiently. So for instance, if they have twats or texts of Denzel asserting that Simone is involved in the campaign.  I doubt that's an easy path to go in rp (nuance with these things isn't really a thing in rp most of the time), but it would be an option. The easier path would indeed be to admit it.
No, he is in fact a gang member, hence I can't see how it would be political at all.
That dude is the epitome of roleplaying just for fun. No desire to farm drama, not exploiting the clout he gets for working with big streamers, just taking a week off to chill on a beach because fuck it. He really is Himothy Collins.
Casually restringing his tennis racket
While flying his private jet to go sip some whisky on a beach somewhere... He really is that guy

I'm pretty sure that's the same NBC doctor that lost his mind in the car with Jack when he was shot down for acting like a gangster at a event.
Context?
These doctors are getting out of hand ngl, ever since GG got terrorism because of the doctor Turk mouthing off and using the hospital as a safe zone they've been on one
Tyreke (GG) said to the doctor after he kept talking shit "you are a fucking doctor so act like one". Some doctors got some big egos recently, pressing people and saying shit like "if you hurt me i will just run to the hospital" or "I'm on hospital turf, you want terrorism?"
At city hall Jay was being insulted in front of everyone by a woman who looked exactly like the one in the clip. They thought they found her, OOC they knew it wasn't her, but they wanted to make sure.  Then suddenly the guy NVL's.

Great counter move, people were eating up Rated's apology video and making it seem like it wasn't that bad.
It's good that he is tweeting this because I already read people saying "Thats all he did??? Send some DMs???" when it's likely just the tip of the iceberg.
If CG dropping him wasn’t enough “proof,” then nothing will convince people not even providing more information.
Its crazy that people are defending him, even some people are reddit are wew.
Anytime rated does something to damage control himself, God just ults and wrecks him lmao
The replies to his tweet are doing my head in. I can’t believe people feel entitled enough to say they deserve to know who the victims are and the extent of what he did to them.
Giga rare W from NP management.
If you are genuinely surprised that there are people defending him, justifying his actions, downplaying them, or anything similar, I would really suggest you go and look at how the over whelming majority of instances of sexual harassment and abuse towards women are handled in literally every aspect of life on a daily basis.  This shit is tragically normalized and almost the expected norm in incidents like this and its gross and fucked up.  It isn't just people who like rated, or just the weird ultra para social diehards.  There's a very real problem with sexual harassment and assault in the world, and this is just another example of it.
I think there is no speaking sense into the people who continue to support him. Whether it is worse than minor harassment or not. It is still harassment against women. Evil is evil and the people who continue to support that are just as bad
Man, Rated is going to dissemble and blame shift his way into forcing other people to out him if he keeps it up with this whole "but what did I do??? No one will tell me! I didn't do anything that bad!!?!?!" schtick.  Love to see it.
Not at all surprising. Hopefully the right steps are taken to protect the victims, it sounds like they've been through more than enough.
The story being that he got cancelled for cyberbullying is already firmly planted as the one and only truth in the minds as of the diehard fanbase, that on top of the "she was a cam model why is she offended when asked for nudes" argument just goes to show they are completely smooth brained.
Thought this was incredibly obvious based on his discord message saying that they "verified multiple severe claims."   Fuck 'em.
Stans will downplay and justify literally anything they streamer do, it happened with fedmyster, the OTK guys, etc. Can't fix them.
Glad Big Boss man is putting this out, especially after Rateds comments where he is basically just gaslighting his community/supporters into thinking his ban was due to him asking for a cam show from a female role player.
Jesus the amount of delusional comments under this tweet is ridiculous. Things like "Stop with these gaslighting statements" and "leave him alone and let him rebuild" I can't quit believe these people actually exist.....
Good thing he wrote this cuz a lot of people especially on yt have started saying "he got cancelled, cuz he asked for nudes". i read this message on yt under one of rated's response videos.
To me it was obvious that it was more than what we have been told. There is a reason that NP are defensing the victims and refusing to tell who they are…
These announcements seem like a double edged sword. Asking for nudes and sending harassing messages should be enough for a ban like this. The fact they looked the other way until it became something that makes those “pale in comparison” is a huge problem itself.   I hope they seriously reevaluate where they draw the line going forward.
He was the main reason why I stopped watching CG. Mainly because he, at least in my opinion, was far more toxic than the rest of the crew. But I would've never expected him to be this much of a dbag. Crazy that it was all so much worse than not being able to take an L
He was obviously downplaying it crazy how bad it was to try to keep most of his followers so he can still stream, dude never felt bad or tried to seek help when he was actually doing it but now it all comes to light suddenly he’s a changed guy? Half assed apology to everyone involved this guy is trash
I guess it's nice to see even though admins/management have been enablers of the toxic environment where people like this have become this untouchable in the first place, even they have their limits. Now do something about the environment and stop giving passes for high view counts and veteran status.
[removed]
Owner is on a crusade, its like that scene in Indiana Jones where the rolling rock is chasing Indie through that mine tunnel, except there is no exit and only a wall of hurt waiting at the end!
He fell back on things that was known, using that as a scape goat. What really was revealed is locked away, probably for the sake of the victims. So yea, him shifting the focus on things already known and glossed over is just a tactic to ignore the stuff we don't know.
If anyone still defends him after some of these recent tweets... I don't know what to say. Insane amount of para social people out there willing to look foolish for their 'idol'.
Just read about the organised anonymous stalking/harassment of other streamers by his prior mod  This I am not surprised by, I've been waiting for that exact hostility to be exposed evetually  The animosity between communities/RPers on GTA is crazy
Good, don't let him weasel his way out of this.
Bro I'm loving for the dogpile. Don't let him worm his way out
Figured it was more than hassling for nudes/cheating/emotional abuse stuff. All of that stuff is bad of course, so not meaning to downplay it, but based on the management/CG reaction/big mans legal talk and this seems to be leaning to something much more serious.
dude must have done something really dark.
In other words, the things the others spoke about WAS NOT across the line for him.
I'm glad they are not just letting him gaslight his fanbase. Good move.
It had to be something done physically to another person. We'll probably never know exactly what, but there's no way it was only online interactions.
[removed]
Don’t let people like this go easy, expose the hell outta them so people know their true nature.
Props to the Big Man himself. Holding no punches is the absolute appropriate thing to do. I hope justice finds its way.
Yikes
RatedTate
There's worse? What like blackmail?
Even how with how fucked up it may end up being that we dont know.. I do hope that Rated himself is sincere in getting the help he needs. (Or if granted with the severity forcefully through legal actions)  Not because i am a fan or sympathise (never even watched him). But because he is young and pretty much anonimous therefore inevitably WILL interact with more women in the future, even have relationships. Realisticly only the name/online persona "RatedEpicz" has been exposed. No one online really knows who is behind that (beside CG and FB). He can easily change his online name, find a new online community and continue his behaviour if he wants. Streamers and more so GTARP is just a small part of the internet with millions of women online unaware of him and this whole situation. Therefore only he himself can prevent future victims of his behaviour and so i hope he does realise that enough to find the help he needs.. fast.
That's... I get what he's trying to say but it doesn't come off great. Those things *should* be a removal reason. Probably should've gone with 'those things are horrible, but things even worse came to light'.
Can someone explain what happened? I don't follow NP drama
Yikes.
This is interestingly apparently no one knows him in person so I wonder what it is that could be online some kinda blackmail or something
Does anyone else feel that this tweet implies NP management were fine with women being called names or harassed for nudes by someone with major server clout…
Imma put this out there - UK laws are extremely lax when it comes to SA etc, so it absolutely wouldn't surprise me if there weren't allegations that got swept under the rug by the police there, especially given how hard he hides his identity.
Even if all he had done is what we've seen on twitter, that should have garnered the exact same reaction as this from fuck stick up here. The way he phrases it makes it seem that he wouldn't have been treated the same way if all he'd done was ask for nudes and harass women in their DM's. Then again god over here likes to refer to women as "females" so what did I expect?   Let's not even talk about how rated should have been toast on the server years ago on server rule breaks alone. Imagine how much less suffering would have been caused if nopixel had just applied it rules equally?   I know some folks want to heap praise on him for this but I just can't. From the way it sounds actual IRL crimes have been committed and it's only that which finally pushed him over the edge.
"i just want to be clear so he can't gaslight" he says, as management is completely silent on what happened, making the gaslighting *way* easier.
Yo I posted this and it got deleted, wtf man
I think its time for the entire story to come out or Rated will just keep gaslighting. With the Adam situation at least the victim was brave enough to post everything that happened so you got the complete picture.
In the US sexual predators are labeled as such, their actions are public record and they must report their whereabouts to authorities as they move. This is done to expressly let people know who they are dealing with and to do their best to not let that person do the same to others.      Not giving the details, even high level, of the actions this person did just makes it easier for him to do the same thing to others again in the future. In cases like this details should be given.
protecting the victims comes before our morbid addiction to drama.
I hate these entitled pricks.    The victims safety is more important than any answer you think you deserve.
Credit where credit is due, Owner is handling this like a fucking champ. Get rid of the problem quickly without giving them time to strategize, shut down excuses when possible while protecting the victims.
Little Billy needs to read up on what defamation actually is if he thinks that not revealing the information leading to the statement qualifies.  I get most people don't even have a basic understanding of their respective law but come on.
I just don't get how some people are so entitled to think they deserve to know everything.  Like holy shit.  It feels so many people don't grasp exactly what happened to the victims and just wants to spin this into either another agenda or just sip on some juicy drama.  Honestly best thing going forward for me is if Rated's name never gets brought up ever again.  Let him fade into obscurity and live with the fact that he's a scummy human being so we can move on.  Plenty of good guys to follow on the server without needing to shine the spotlight on that guy.
[removed]
That makes it sound worse than the KA situation, which is horrifying and disturbing.
IMO, people like this who beg to violate the privacy of victims don't want further proof to convince them that Rated does not deserve to be on the server. They want the exact list of names so that they know who to go after on Rated's behalf.
Isn't he kind of still revealing by saying it wasn't?  Rated can do the math on how many 'get canceled'  he did and can now strike a few of those off the list.  This posting didn't need to happen. It serves to benefit is dumb viewers who would have believed Rateds gaslight, at the expense of revealing more info.
It was kind of sickening, to see how fast people shifted in other reddits and YouTube comments because of Rated video. They were just looking for the slightest hope to forgive Rated.   I don't know how women deal with stuff like this, it's disgusting
Are you surprised? Adin Ross and Andrew Tate have a massive following for basically condoning this type of stuff
[removed]
there's always people ready, willing, and eager to minimize stuff like this, no matter the severity. it's really disheartening to see.
As if sending those DMs is even somehow acceptable behavior. Not to mention all of the other extremely public documented toxic behavior over the years throughout 2.0 and 3.0. anyone defending the guy at this point is extremely delusional and no amount of evidence will ever change their mind.
There will always be people saying that.  Victims could literally come forward with video evidence of him physically sexually assaulting them or worse and there will always be shit heads that would try to defend or justify it.
Yeah people on the other subreddit trying to minimalise the whole thing. Its insane.
It’s to be expected when the full extent of his actions hasn’t been disclosed and there’s so many kids within his community. However you cannot criticise anyone within the nopixel staff for that because they are doing it to protect the victims. The first thought should always be with the victims
I think it's a combination of  * not everything being made public  * the allegations that have been released are normalized in certain communities (andrew tate, fresh and fit, etc)  * the people in that community are accustomed to antisocial and abusive behavior, even finding it cool and/or funny  * there are a lot of dumb people online  If the allegations are as bad as the owner is saying then Rated should probably be off Facebook (and Twitch and Discord) as well. If they're not reporting these actions to those platforms, then they are just allowing for future victims to be created.
He's got Anna's debuff grenade from overwatch
Those people don't want the victims names so they can see definitive proof he did anything. Nothing revealed will convince anyone still defending him, they like that rated is a scum bag because they are scum bags and they've found one of their own in him. They want those victims names so they can have a target to harass.
Lianndri(Eve from Cerberus) tweeted "treat women better" and its only reply is someone saying "No thank you"(the individual is defending Rated and downplaying the whole situation in other tweets). Like her tweet wasn't even directed at Randy. Twitter is such a shithole.
Roman Polanski...I'll just leave that here. I agree hardcore!
It's all just one big "FERR WAAAT" with extra steps.
The sickening part is that he's just trying to find out who did this to him so he can literally call out his audience to constantly harass the people behind it.
The server already has long-standing rules about being toxic towards other players. Even based off those rules, had his accrued points been calculated like normal and the appropriate punishment applied he probably would have been perma banned by now.   Several victims made comments publicly this afternoon and spoke about how his toxicity and harassment made portions of their time on the server a living hell. That's not even getting into the more serious allegations. Even without further info there's already public clips, posted here over the past 4 years, detailing rule break after rule break that'd result in  him being permanently removed anyway had he only been treated like every other player.
It's difficult for me to understand how they do this when Rated's best friends were all silent and not supporting him the moment he was banned which would've been the case if this was anything remotely small. They just straight up seem to have cut ties at the very least publicly and yet these idiots are out here buying his shit about it being nothing more than some horny dm's.
Sorry there isn’t any sympathy for a person who treats women like that well actually worse than what we heard
True. I also hope this makes victims able to speak out more openly and be listened to more regularly by a larger portion if the community
I think it's because a lot of people after seeing Rated's apology video were just like "Oh, that's all it was? He was banned asking for nudes?". Owner probably doesn't want Rated to be able to just brush this whole thing off as a minor case of horniness.
things you just said is why i have brought up in comments on twitter that the whole legal action thing might actually be more to protect nopixels name. like the whole suzy\_q thing calling out the lack of management and now all of this comes out.
I agree
Yeah that was a big oof for me. That sounds like that should have been enough especially considering how many people seem to have first hand experience. The fact that either they felt they couldn't report or they did and nothing was done imply there is still a lot rotten in the core of NP.
I mean CG being toxic in general was part of what made him feel comfortable doing this.  I mean something like this doesn't happen without a failure on multiple levels from multiple groups. No Pixel management failed by setting a culture where both Rated and the women felt he was untouchable, CG as a group failed by fostering a general culture of toxicity and bullying that people felt they had to walk on egg shells around them.
Based on what?
It's not dogpiling. It's not letting him freely push his narrative to make it seem it wasn't a big deal.
doesnt sound like it was something physical but we also dont know the details. lyndi was very emotional and distressed from everything so we all have an idea at the magnitude of the mental side was done towards her. if theres more insanely bad things (sounds like there may be) , we wont know unless its exposed at some point.
For now no one has said that the Harassment was physical. Rated also denied of anything being physical.
> I wouldn't be completely surprised if one of his close friends or CG ended up finding out information and passed it on to admins  Didn't all of CG come out and say they knew nothing when he was first banned? This is some high grade copium brother.
Lots of people start out as CG fans until it gets to the point where you look at it and you’re like, man, these guys are not good people. Why am I watching them? I know because that was me  like 4 years ago.
I don't see that happening, at least with the main CG members.  The reason being that this hurts their business and puts their other misconduct in the limelight. It also risks having management have to be stringent about their toxicity, which hurts their business model (lol look how mad we made these cops) and influence over the server.  If it *was* somebody in CG, I would have expected them to give Rated an ultimatum to quit streaming/get offline to save everybody the embarrassment. Like how politicians resign to "spend time with their family" when they get caught with a mistress.
I know how hard it is to be a fan of a content creator and come to realize that they aren’t as great as they seem and are enabling someones abuse. This situation reminds me a lot of The Yogscast. Don’t let it taint your other experiences with NoPixel. I believe there’s no reason to apologize. You never really know who’s behind the screen.
My copium is that they just weren't told what happened for the sake of the victims' privacy, or that they deliberately didn't focus on the victims in order to keep those who want to be anonymous as far from the spotlight as possible.   I have decidedly and deliberately not defended CG from accusations of OOC toxicity and the like, but I don't pray on anyone's downfall and I don't wish for anyone to be a shitty person just to validate negative opinions that I already have.   I don't feel entitled to accept your apology on anyone else's behalf but I can say with all honesty that I appreciate your perspective on the problems that allowed this behavior to happen.   I hope the CG streamers and their wider community can recognize the role that they played in protecting this person, and the fact that they helped him seem untouchable to the point that his victims didn't feel comfortable coming forward about what he'd done.   You're not an inherently bad person for whatever role you feel you've played in this, and everyone has the opportunity to grow and learn. Personal growth is more poggers than any shootout could ever be.
>I realized I am also part of the problem of enabling, and I apologize for that  You are far from the first person to like CG and find them funny only to realize they can be and often are incredibly toxic and just generally not good people or are at least willing to sell out and be toxic people for clout and money.   A LOT of people who have been in this sub for quite a while started out as big CG fans and overtime the toxicity got worse and worse and a lot of us had a "straw that broke the camel's back" moment.  Hopefully this is a wake up call to many people and we can talk about how a culture was set up by both No Pixel management and CG as a group that made these women feel like they couldn't come forward.
It's not about letting him go easy, it's about sparing unnecessary distress to the victims. They can come out with it when/if they want to.
Protecting the victims is more important than making people on the internet feel good about it. If this is a case for the justice system, let the justice system sort it out.  Nobody here is going to do a thing about it, so where's the value in anyone knowing?
You let the women come forward on their own if or when they feel comfortable. Giving details can make these women face further harassment by him and his fans.
Really? Do you think what has been exposed would have caused this type of reaction? Sure, he's clearly creepy in the few messages we've seen, but that wouldn't get him thrown out of everything he's been such a big part of. Clearly he has been doing some very fucked up stuff, whatever it is.
Something maybe IRL maybe? He did just go on holiday with some other streamers…I have no idea though, I’m just spouting theories
He definitely could have chosen his words with a lot more care.
I didn't get that from it. Just him saying that is minor compared to the even worse stuff they obviously discovered. Basically don't let rated simplify things down to it was just him asking for nudes.
As long as it didn't damage their name and prevent them from making money, they could care less. It's only when something that could potentially ruin them for staying quiet did they decide to do something about it.
How are UK laws lax exactly?  Intrigued, as I wasn't aware.
Did you mention the big man's name in the post? He's the boogeyman around here and it will get deleted if you don't use code words for him.
Your need for details doesn't supersede the victims' privacy. Stop thinking about yourself. He's been publicly ousted and removed and knowledge of the details wouldn't change anything.
Sure, and if the evidence they have is serious enough then there's no way they don't pass that onto the authorities. But Twitter and Reddit are not those authorities.
This is very different from a person just in the US, starting with it being international and online. Besides this isn’t criminal charges, at least right now, it was a ban from a community he was apart of. The people uninvolved have no right to know the specifics.
I disagree. Exactly as his follow up states, he doesn't want to give up any information so that the victim is shielded. In reality, we don't know what really happened, we can only speculate. This could actually be far worse than what most are guessing that happened. We just don't know, and the victim should be shielded at all costs in my opinion
Not giving details is to protect the victims from any retaliation. You know how crazy things get with doxing swaying and stalkers. The nopixel community does not have to deal with him again since he has very publicly been exiled and this will follow him as long as he is known as rated. Nothing positive comes from release that info other than Reddit gets to know more details. It seems everyone involved knows what happened even if they don't want to admit to it.
I mean registration laws in the US also have many problems and they vary state by state.  They often tend to have the opposite effect because offenders are unable to properly rehabilitate if they are used as retribution rather than a deterrent or a pathway to rejoining society.  Those labels also often destroy the livelihood of offenders' relatives and loved ones and ostracized them from communities they have every right to be a part of
Such a close second though /s
bUt, BuT hIs CaRrEeR!!
You know its gotta be something absolutely unforgivable because the owner isnt exactly the best at handling situations with tact like he is with this one.
There's been previous accusations and openly horrific treatment of many on the server by him for years.  He could have excluded someone years ago who was making the experience worse for so many. he's only doing it now that there is genuinely legal ramifications and he could get in trouble for keeping them around after being made aware of more serious allegations.  But some of the victims might have been prevented if they just went wow, this guy is absolutely fucking awful to people here and got rid of him years ago.  Basically when it wasn't him being the victim of shitty behaviour he didn't care about anyone else, when his bottom line is in danger is the only time he'll act.
The only reason he is doing it is to keep the pitch forks and torches from coming his way he allowed this to happen, he made it a safe place for rated to do this for years and then he punished people on rateds words
Years of OOC toxicity was allowed and only now is something being done, they are not doing this out of the goodness of their heart.
You understand that the same person you're praising basically created this monster and the space he existed in by publicly stating he gets special protection against feeling the full force of nopixels rules. This same special privilege created a situation where the victims rightfully felt unable to report him without facing severe repercussions to their careers.  They banned someone who broke the rules, congratulations that's not praiseworthy, it's something they should have been doing from the beginning. Let's not act like management and him aren't up to their eyeballs in this. If nothing else comes of this hopefully the error of special treatment ends after seeing what devastating consequences it can bring.
homeboy literally gave rated the platform to commit all this alleged heinous shit, until it finally spilled over. Please dont forget that. NP is just washing their hands and trying to pass the blame on this.   Fuck them for being enablers.
Can someone explain what happened? I don't follow NP drama
At this point people should know enough to stop supporting the guy. Nothing more needs to be revealed unless the people involved want to reveal it.
I think that some people let the concept of honesty/transparency run amok. Like both of those things are good in healthy, collaborative human interaction. But when it comes to conflict, violence, and competition (and of course privacy), withholding information is of course circumstantially justifiable.
Remember how Andrew Tate was running a sex trafficking ring by making women think they were in a relationship with him and then coercing them into being cam girls for his profit?  The fact that rated was asking at least some of the women to do cam shows but was also trying to hide that he was asking them made me think of that.   Of course I would never say that might be what rated was doing because that would be an unsourced allegation. I’m just saying the cam shows being mentioned on Twitter reminded me of another situation that happened.
Even if Rated does that it's harder for his viewers to get mobilized this way. It's another barrier so he can't weaponize them as easily
Which is why he was given the opportunity to go silently and never been seen again. Unfortunate he had to say more than he wanted to but it is better than the gaslighting.
Theres a reason women struggle to come forward with the truth alot of the time
That is what he said just in different words.
Yeah that shit is a reason to be rightfully socially shunned. What actually happened sounds like a reason to be sued or in jail. These are good responses from the owner IMO
Honestly GTA RP toxic culture has collectively broken the brains of a large portion of the community, any well adjusted adult would correctly describe sending people DM's that are "OOC Toxic" as harassment.   I mean it's literally a textbook definition of harassment.   Like go to someone who isn't on social media alot and try and explain what "Toxic OOC" means in this scenario of privately DM'ing someone calling them names and sending your fans to bother them which results in death threats, doxx'ing threats etc and they would likely describe it as harassment.
It shouldn’t have been acceptable but if it were just for being extremely toxic, the entire Chang Gang would have been removed with him rather than them acting very surprised to find out what he’d been doing. It was pretty obvious that the things that we’ve learned so far aren’t the full reason he was removed from NP and CG.
[removed]
Shit you not, when it first was announced I went over to see wtf their reactions were, and tons of people were whatabouting Penta and Kyle, and how clearly the entire admin team is in their pocket, due to for example in their eyes Penta unfairly shit talking the big guy's wife.
They have always done that, for years. There were a group of people on this subreddit a year or two ago who would always defend them, no matter what.
It’s fucked because you’re absolutely right.
>they like that rated is a scum bag because they are scum bags  That's the fanbase that CG cultivated, both No Pixel management and CG as a group set the culture that led to this, they created a culture that clearly made both the women and obviously Rated himself feel he was untouchable.
And the fact that he’s done worse things to enough people that this doesn’t narrow it down enough for him to know who came forward is very telling as well.
Blackmail is just something that fits the bill of: 1. Something that can involve the legal side of things. 2. A creep that gets nudes can easily use them to start the blackmail. 3. Something that you would want protect those that are the victim of, because the number of people being blackmailed would be low and easy to pin point who it was.
well no shit he denied it. what’s he gonna do, admit he did anything?   let’s be real, the stance that management is taking should be worrying. if they let all the past shit slide, it must be *bad* bad.
> Rated also denied of anything being physical.  Wrap it up folks, that's as airtight as it gets.
>Rated also denied of anything being physical.  He also said he's not an evil person....
No clue why you and the comments below took my comment as expose the woman. You do know you can expose what the perpetrator did without releasing details on victim right?
Bro the burden of proof for SA cases in the UK is nuts that basically unless the cops see it, it didn't happen.
It was manually deleted as it has comments and predated this thread by 10 minutes. Maybe because this thread's title is better and it's a serious issue.  https://www.reddit.com/r/RPClipsGTA/comments/12ezd5p/he_who_shall_not_be_named/
Nope, I deliberately kept his name out; I even cropped his name out of the screenshot. Ah well! Hopefully the OP’s post doesn’t get removed
You do realize you can release information about the crime and not the victim, right? Authorities do it all the time.
From the sounds of it,it should be criminal charges
Welcome to k*ck, where everyone is a scumbag.
He isn't handling this with tact either, but it also isn't a situation that requires it.
Wasn't he also one who "downplayed" the allegations before ?
Yeah I’m not giving credit either. This is coming from a guy who has protected him before and, quote “he’d have to shit on my chest [to get banned]” so this is as more NoPixel administration damage control as it is altruistic tbh.
This isn't the same thing as OOC toxicity and NoPixel has been incredibly clear in drawing the line with situations similar to this, long before 2.0. Owner excuses a lot more unacceptable (in my own opinion) behavior than I'd like but NP has always been praiseworthy when dealing with extreme issues. That doesn't exempt them from criticism for not dealing with OOC toxicity nearly enough, but people can do both good and bad things at the same time. Recognizing one doesn't mean that I'm excusing the other. The world is not black and white, people are not good or bad, almost everything is complex.
Yep, “god” keeps mentioning court so his hand most of been forced. Having this type of thing reach a court room would have killed the server especially with how much he protected Rated in the past.
And gave him a position of power in the PD because while he may be extremely toxic he can occasionally provide good rp. If it was anyone else other than CG golden boys they would have been removed from the PD or banned a long time ago
Novel concept: People can do both good and bad things. They deserve to be praised for the good and criticized for the bad. Highlighting one doesn't mean that you're disregarding the other.
I don't see the point of being so negative about this. They're taking action and sending a clear message about server expectation. It's absolutely praise worthy.

I agree to some agree with what you said, but we have no idea how long Rated has been this way before he even started streaming and irl. There is probably a reason why he wont reveal his name or show himself, for all we know he could have been cited for this type of behavior before. The internet and GTA has given him a somewhat anonymous platform to take this behavior to extreme lengths.
to some degree i understand what youre saying but theres a big difference between breaking server rules/being OOC toxic and this and its unfair to compare it. nopixel has been extremely consistent with banning the really bad stuff like sexism racism abuse etc they even canceled the arab server for it
If anyone is still supporting him at this point a couple extra details isn't going to change their mind. You could give exact details and they would say "Uhm do you have pictures or evidence of this?"
In my opinion, the kind of viewer who would be 'mobilized or weaponized' are not swayed by these 'barriers'; heck they more likely be emboldened by it. Gives them the underdog oppression ark they are looking for.
this world fuckin sucks ass
I mean look at the popularity of Andrew Tate, we like to think it's all edge lord 12-18 year olds but there are a bunch of grown ass men who are incels and hate women and will look for any reason to hate women.   They see a guy being a gross creep and think it's not their fault but it's the fault of the women for "trapping them" or "trying to cancel them".

They still are. Also a sick obsession with wanting Blau punished too.
That part is crazy to me. I really don't like Penta, but there's literally nothing to suggest he has done anything remotely as vile as Rated.
DARVO
Absolutely.
Who said it's not bad? Do you think only physical abuse is bad and everything else is not that bad?  I'm saying no one has accused him of physical abuse, at least not yet.
What is describing the incidents causes Rated to know exactly who came forward and he and his fans harass that woman or women further?   For all we know it's multiple different scenarios and in order to describe them would bring further harassment than it's not worth it.   The people who are not convinced at this point aren't convinced because they don't care.
I think cropping out the name is why since it's just words without a name. Could be anyone typing it even if we know who said it.
In this case it sounds like that would give the offender the knowledge needed to 100% know who came forward. That would not be a good thing
But if the details come out he would know WHO reported it, and they could be sent hate from his deranged fans that are still out there dick riding and defending his ass.  It's pretty obvious WHY they aren't being told, and probably won't until the victim is ready.
Criminal charges for this can be super messy since like I said before, it’s international. Though with how vague everyone is being and how fast everyone dropped him, it’s definitely bad
Even if you could find a law enforcement agency who could grab the idea of something that even other terminally online people don't have a grasp on (GTA RP) and then add in the fact this seems to have all happened online, which most law enforcement agencies are AWFUL at handling, I don't see an international law enforcement agency taking this on.  Look up videos of women who have faced online harassment and tried to press charges or women who faced revenge porn and tried to press charges and you will see video after video of them explaining how boomer police officers have little to no grasp on how to handle it.
I dislike him and his takes but you have to give him credit where credit is due. He probably was playing smoke and mirrors to get to the bottom of the allegations similarly to the death of a previous player, which ended up false.
>he’d have to shit on my chest [to get banned]  Well I guess we know what happened
There have been reports of misogyny before swept under the rug.
> but NP has always been praiseworthy when dealing with extreme issues.  The point people are making is that No Pixel has had ample opportunity to avoid this particular extreme issue if the toxic clique was not literally given free reign to be toxic in the first place.
Indeed the world is not black and white but I'm not about to praise a group of individuals who allowed years "black" when they do a single "white" and only when they were FORCED to do so.
If you think that being toxic on stream causing chat hoppers is the same as sending dms to sexual dms, harassing and manipulating people is on the same level idk what to say.  It is reasonable to call out people for handling situations in the past poorly but trying to claim these things are on the same level is just stupid.
Except he was praise for his handling, but the handling of rated includes the years of protection that made it harder for his victims to come forward.  He's not suddenly acting to protect hte victims but himself, which is why when people did complain about him before nothing happened. When people made complaints about him, he was made aware of who made the complaint, what it was about and he went after them in game.
In a way  the owner cultivated this guys behavior by letting him and his crew live above the rules in the first place
But is this going to be the norm, or will they go back to ignoring toxicity until it finally reaches a breaking point again? Rated's actions aren't sudden, it's a long history of toxicity that was gleefully ignored. Hopefully, this isn't going to be a one off thing where they pretend everything wrong with the server culture is now fixed.
shouldve been nipped from the start
People doing the bare minimum for their job don't get bonus points. Its great that they are doing something, but they have done anything that earned them a pat on the back.   If they really want to help prevent this from happening in the future they would lock down the OOC toxicity and create an environment where women aren't afraid to come forward. Then they would make sure that clout wouldn't protect someone from repercussions of it.
Why be overly positive about people doing something they should be anyway. Especially when they're the ones who helped create the problem in the first place.    How are we to know the way things are run has truly changed and this won't just happen again down the road?
Had the rules been applied to Rated in the same way it is to everyone else on the server there's a high probability he would have faced perma bans long ago. Possibly before he could do the sexual harassment, or worse. It's not as if the two things are mutually exclusive.
My point is those people now have less knowledge and can't as effectively lash out as a result. Knowledge is power and denying them any additional knowledge is only a good thing
Yeah, I saw that too. Good god do they hold grudges. You'd have thought Blau personally was one of the sources of all the toxicity on the server based on how they talked about him.
Wait what did Blau do?
Blau?????????????????
RPing an asshole is worse than being an IRL predator to them lmfao
I like Penta, and he absolutely takes things too far at times, but yeah, nothing remotely in the same REALM as Rated.
he has done nothing off the server so that his name is even brought up is weird. shouldn't even be mentioned in this context.
i didn’t say that. but i think that if there’s mentions of legal action being thrown around, we can extrapolate. there’s only so much someone with such a small brain can do over the internet that’s both in line with his known behavior and illegal.
>Who said it's not bad? I'm saying no one has PUBLICLY accused him of physical abuse, at least not yet.  FTFY
> like I said before, it’s international  The UK is pretty big though, has a lot of people in it, so it might not be international.
I personally dont see how it can be messy. Send the FBI to pick his ass up, that's how they got Chapo and then extradite him to the us and the rest is just street justice
Smh. Protect and serve my ass
Sorry but what Credit that he did his "job" ? He created/supported that toxic space for a looooong time.
I think you give too much credit.
You're acting like nopixel and staff are omniscient and know all see all. From what I can gather, this came to light only because someone in close contact leaked critical information through private DMs and whatnot. Action could only take place if persons involved reached out to management. The person you're actually blaming are the victims who took this long to come forward but you're somehow pointing fingers instead at people who had no control over these private issues.
Free rein, as in a horse.   *tips fedora*
The problem is your definition of "black" is clearly different from theirs. The staff/the owner doesn't get care because people got salty OOC or trashtalked cops. But they do when it comes to sexual harassment. You can disapprove of the way the staff handles other situations, but to even being up "OOC toxicity" when someone is accused of being a sexual predator minimizes his acts. Staff allowing people to get salty doesn't mean it allows sexual harassment, even if yourself considered both of these things to be "bad". They don't care that much about the first one, they do about the second.
I agree that Rated's toxicity has been overlooked and excused for far too long, but clearly he did something so much more indefensible and heinous when compared to his normal bad behavior. Taking a stance and inviting people to come forward and speak on issues is a good thing pure and simple.
People are afraid to report things, especially against some one with a big following because you going to get alot of  backlash from mindless dumb followers. Things often go this way, one person speaks out then other feel like that can do the same
I think it's pretty clear the toxicity isn't what got him banned. This is likely something far worse. They should take action on toxicity tho - I agree completely on that. Rated should have been banned long ago.
Yeah, it's sadly late. But it's happening, and at least that's a good thing.
You in fact should be overly positive about positive change. That's how you keep encouraging it to happen
Yup, it seems several women he hurt are scared to come forward in large part due to his audience and to date because of reprisal in the server where they're trying to earn a living. Would that be true if he'd been cut out 3+ years ago due to being an asshole with a lot less viewers?
imo by sending the message that harassment/sexism/racism gets punished quickly and harshly they already did what they can to encourage people to speak up about it. the difference between toxicity and harassment is just too big to compare a lot of things can be prevented if you have the hindsight view.
Left the gang,  called them bitchmade, etc.  In character actions, but they took em OOC.
Left their gang and points out their toxicity
I made the mistake of clicking on their clip of Penta reacting to the Rated drama and saw a classic comment.   "Penta only plays like 4 characters and they're all the same".  Oh those kids would be angry if they could only read.
A lot of (especially younger) people fail to realize that being an asshole to their favorite streamer does not equal being a straight up criminal.  Edited to apply in a more general sense.
Name one time (said in penta voice)
He absolutely hasn't. People hate him so much that anytime he says anything mildly negative they act like he said something major. Could you imagine if he consistently called CG 'shitty aids criminals' or the sort of stuff they say to him and cop streamers?
The worst thing he's ever said OOC is how some players who are too emotionally attached to pets/money (OOC to IC stuff) are cringe lol. You can talk about his characters and the effect it might have on other players but OOC I don't think he's ever said anything bad. Again the worst he would say would be criticism towards some RP and how it clashes with his own style of RP (which is more serious in general).  Totally not the same, not even close.  EDIT: Anyone, feel free to give me example(s) of anything worse since you seem to disagree. Thank you
You know there can be legal ramifications for abuse/Harassment that's not physical? Blackmail/threat is enough for legal action. Him physically abusing someone is yet to be substantiated, hell he's not even accused of it yet.
I don’t think this type of crime online is as simple as that.
If you want to hear something extra disgusting in some states the laws are so outdated that there isn't many laws surrounding online harassment like revenge porn.   So in some states the ONLY way to get any sort of punishment for revenge porn is for the women to COPYRIGHT their own nudes so they have to take nude photos and SEND THEM TO THE US COPYRIGHT SERVICE and than file a copyright infringement lawsuit. How fucking gross is that?
It's okay, he and the rest of them will have a moment of clarity and self-awareness any day now. Just wait. You'll see. They'll realise they enabled this guy for years and cheered his behaviour, safe in the knowledge it wouldn't lead to anything worse. Just you wait.   Any moment now.
I think you missed the point, none of us really give a fuck what his definition of good or bad is.As viewers and consumers of their product we get to decide that on an individual basis.   To many of us, and as the actual victims like Kylie have spoken about, the harassment endured by this individual to them was extreme regardless of what type of harassment it was. Who are you to categorize what level of trauma is better or worse for a victim? So are you basically saying that anyone who didn't face the most extreme negative behavior from Rated is somehow invalidated? Even if what they endured push them to potentially end their own lives?
No one's saying taking action isn't good. But someone being forced to rectify a problem they helped create because it's now a giant legal Quagmire doesn't make something praiseworthy. That seems like extremely low expectations to meet.
You don't have to give the person being reported all the details, the same way he is doing now. According to at least one of the women coming forward the details were shared and that's how he harassed her after it and sent his viewers to harass her.
Yeah but you're ignoring what people are saying. Some of Rated's victims have both tried to report him in the past and nothing came of the reports (ON TOP OF Rated then using language in those reports to harass the people who reported him.) and then some of his other victims never felt comfortable coming forward until recently because they -knew- how protected he was.
But I've not seen any change. I've seen someone forced to rectify an issue because it's turned into a giant potential legal mess. Change is something that is proven over time, not a week and a half while the problem is still unfolding.
The thing is how many women would have come forward long ago had they felt that No Pixel wouldn't defend Rated?   We had one woman say she reported him for being toxic and they gave him details in the report that led him to harassing when even more and sending his fans to harass her. Shit like that sends a message to any women who may want to come forward "keep your mouth shut or else".  The fact it was THIS bad and we JUST NOW know is not some random fact it's a clear indication that all these women didn't feel safe to come forward, THAT is entirely the fault of the constant defense of the CG boys by No Pixel management
They also accuse him of being overly risqué with 2 female streamers he collabs with.
Yea still fuck Rated tho. Hope this dude gets what's coming to him cuz he cant possibly get away with this now that everybody talkin
Someone abusing people was banned and other victims regardless of their relationship to this incident have been encouraged to come forward and speak. It's praiseworthy.
IMO this response is change. If you feel otherwise then that's valid as well
i trully understand what you mean but the thing is every time there was concrete evidence of these kind of things staff has always acted on it unless theres some unspoken cases. wwhile its very understandable its daunting to come forward with this as a victim the staff has done their best to make it clear they take it serious if its something that bad. its a fucked up situation regardless but my point is staff has shown no signs of them defending things this severe (doesnt include breaking server rules and slight ooc toxicity)
context? that sounds even more stupid than their normal
The process you described is how the basic rules and report system has worked since the inception of nopixel. The fact that it is only now being applied to a wildly toxic individual after a gigantic legal quagmire has unfolded is not praiseworthy.  Sorry but my expectations are a lot higher than yours, clearly.
It's not change, not yet. For all we know he goes right back to avidly defending members of the server he calls friends and we have another similar situation at some point. This is showing why NO ONE should be untouchable or above the rules.
There were comments about it on the Twitter thread yesterday.  I honestly don't know how to link things on reddit, and it's been like 17 hours since I saw it.
nah this was funny as hell
Now that Julio shot out his knees and he can't drive all of Baby Alex's skill and talent is focused purely on shooting.
Classic dwagon
These types of altercations always has me dying. Shooting and engaging first then getting one tapped. The reaction when it happens is hilarious. Lol
Then after the Angels killed Seaside and HOA they went and played golf LMAO
It's too bad that the main two groups who are up for this war are in different timezones, so there won't be a proper fight. Hydra has been NA lately and Seaside is AU. Silent was saying earlier how neither party can be blamed. If Hydra would change their schedule to Seaside's they'd be cooked and if Seaside would wake up in Hydra's timezone they'd be cooked. All Hydra are degens and their schedule eventually always goes back to AU, so maybe soon?
AintnoWay angles out here clapping the gazebo

Heroin is busted as hell, basically shouldn’t fight if you don’t have it
Well......I think it's time wave the white flag honestly.
he is also taking a bunch of Oxy so he can temporarily get up and shoot on foot
This has "they invited us to eat pancakes... Pancakes..." Energy lol  God I miss charlie murphy
it's gotta be embarrassing that for their first war in how long?!? the angels are wiping the floor with people :D
Even if the war went to AU seaside would still only have 3 or maybe 4,  they haven't really been waking up since before the balla war.
It has basically been HOA + Dragon this whole war

You Can still get one tapped with a deagle on h
heroin wouldnt have saved him
HOA and seaside have H now
I agree, Heroin should be nerfed, it's way too overtuned. It basically  enforces some kind of "gun meta" because normal guns are rendered almost useless, while guns like deagles and pythons can circumvent the effect.

Watching a little bit of Lysium for the last week or so seems like they are down bad in AU, as a consequence of AU on the server being super dead in general. Like 100~ empty slots some days.
HoA are ending the war due to toxicity. Multiple bad hoppers, death threats, and people not logging in. Julio talked about it twice on his stream:     https://www.twitch.tv/chalupa\_pants/clip/CrackyZealousTireCeilingCat-NGbMomUJcV4gSdxa

cant wait to see him reunite with his twilight   Baas asked Brian too so maybe him and crystal next
Poor Pred, fate worse than the sweet embrace of death.
Tbh, this whole thing of firing Pred from the LSPD and getting him to join the state felt a bit forced, especially considering how he was always anti-state. Now, it feels like he's just trying to adapt and make the best out of the situation by pretending like he's joining to infiltrate the department when, in reality, he just doesn't really have any other choice.  But... oh well!
Emo Pred arc here we go!
Sad day.
He couldn't beat them... so finally joined them
Crystal has been on the fence and leaning PBSO but was waiting on Pred. This will tip that scale absolutely.
Crystal got an invite. Unsure about Brian.
How bout gunner on day 59 and 23.9 hours into UPD lmao
that was an in character way of setting up the rp Boss man and Kyle both were talking about it ooc in twitch chat to setup the trooper invite and to quote boss man \[ i can invite anyone to trooper ooc but kyle is a roleplayer and setting it up like this is for depth of the character progression \]
Him being forced is purely an in character bit. Kyle could let Pred stay in the UPD pool forever if he felt like it, Pred would not get fired.
I wouldn’t read that far into it Kyle has already said him and the big man speaks all the time. This is definitely far from forced

she was actually leading to Trooper and was thinking about being a trooper who helps Pbso  (This was info from last? stream when she was in the pbso meeting)
i think OP talk more about whole "Pred will not be Sheriff anymore". Like why?  Even when streamers are ok with it IC it doesn't make sense at all how it all went down. Instead of firing him during arson arc they kept him in position bog power and then demoted him like everyone else.  Pred becoming a regular officer then a Trooper is one of the most nonsensical arcs ranked in post 2.0 era
Yeah, I missed the last one. Honestly she's been so back and forth it's hard to nail down, but the last time I heard anything was after her convo with Bloom who she really wanted to end up with.

Lmao Lang was trolling her yesterday too going like "Aren't you corrupt?  Why aren't you investigating Cleo who the Simones are terrorizing?" and Juno just went like "I'm CONFLICTED" lol
“Juno, you are conflicted,” is a running joke at this point.
reminds me of when Lenny Hawk threw away a missing persons poster for Ro Block
the funny thing.. the really funny thing. brian just separately on his own asked an ems about cleo because he hasnt heard from her during all of this and he's worried & looking into it
> “I’m CONFLICTED”  Bryce later kept asking her about it until she yelled it at him too.
That is funny. Wasn’t he going after her at one point? Like trying to destroy her?

Buddha has always talked about how much he appreciates the women on the server that he RPs with on the daily. He also tells them that all the time. Basic respect for one another is not that hard
That’s my OG right there 🥹
What a simple concept. Crazy how hard it is for some people to understand. Mutual respect
For all the credit that Buddha deserves for his enabling of other roleplayers on the server, particularly women RPers, and he does genuinely deserve that credit, let's also recognise the amazing women RPers who support Buddha and allow him to make the stories we all love to watch.      And what I mean by that is, if you do not already follow EagleAye (Eve), Kate (Nancy), raine (Penny), Ashi (Fiona), Traycee (Lexi), rlly (Shelly), ikitty (Kitty), Alex (shadiko) and a host of other roleplayers who are vital to the RP Buddha is a part of - if you love that RP, do the basic minimum you can do and follow those twitch channels. Subs are obviously great, but we can't all afford it, but following is free and is of massive importance to those streamers.  Support the great roleplay.      Make an account, Follow the channel.
No lies detected.
Watching Buddha grow has been incredible. Dude is genuinely an inspiration and huge motivator to keep going despite how dogshit life is/can be and I don't think he even realizes it.  Much love to him. NP is a better and brighter place with him on it.
The queens are amazing
W man

Buddha is such a goat man 🐐 <3
Good guy Buddha 💟
W as always
THE GOAT
Looking back at how much buddha loves his mother, i can totally understand where the respect came from.  My OG.
Pac was right man.  ...cus if we dont we'll have a race of babies that will hate the ladies, who make the babies.  Granted this is about women but everyone should be treating everyone better. no matter anything
<3
It has been said before, but the best pure rp on the server is done largely by women.  That is not to say that men can't rp well, Buddha, Uberhaxornova, Jonthebroski, fat streamer who won't play Ricky, to name a few but by and large, those rp'ers that facilitate on the server are women.  And good on them for it.  Men, step your game up.
this is just all love. :)
**females**\* /s    Jokes aside, Buddha has been the man who I saw do so much for the women in the server, a real example of how top roleplayers should behave.
fuck it even Petunia
Funny how in the early days of 3.0 lang would meme on Donnie for hiring so many women to the rooster’s, now you can see lang understands now
[removed]
In simple words, Buddha is a gentleman, and this is rare, especially on the internet, RIP to his mother, she was a great human being!
Buddha's original plan after coming back was to end the Cerberus RP.  After all Dean's gone, Leslie didn't look like he was going to wake up any time soon, and Lang was gone for a good 3-4 months.  Without Eve, Nancy, as well as all the other people in Cerberus/businesses (Penny, Lexi, Fiona, and Marlo among more that I can't even name off the top of my head), Cerberus should have been dead.  This mayor Lang arc and honestly everything from the Simones/Space/etc is only possible with the work that the women Lang put in place enabled.  Hell even Jenny/Pred were holding down CPD despite not getting any support due to OOC issues and facing people in their department wanting to leave Cerberus.    Without the queens and all the other women on the server, the last month of insane RP just plain does not happen.  It's amazing what everyone on the server can accomplish with mutual respect and just good RP going all around.
SuperBunneh (Mila Smoak), ItsJustASummerJob (Bunny Cohen), JavaShorty (Shelby Lane, comissioner), Madoreline (Libby Reed, COP), Madmoiselle (Pixie Plum), Jogiiee (Emma Gaine), MsTeamKK (Riley Carter), NikkisaRiot (Jenny Hall), Kiwo (everyone), Saturneighteen (Cleo Shaw), Hirona (Copper, Olga), Jennybeartv (Peach) and so many others as well. Without them, the stories that Buddha viewers- and plenty of other communities- have enjoyed watching would never have been possible.   Let's celebrate the women of Nopixel as much as possible, not only in light of what's going on but just because they deserve it.
The character Alex is a she, but shadiko, I believe, identifies as a they. But they are awesome no matter what!
From leaving his discord and not watching because of toxicity in 2.0, to one of the most consistently positive streamers who constantly uplifts those around him and a testament to the fact that you can get through the toughest times that life throws at you. The transformation he went through post ban has been incredible.
Best thing about him is that he makes mention about how it pales in comparison to how much they do for him. Eve and Nancy kept shit running for him so he had something to return to after his health problems.
Let’s not make this about that scum and focus on the amazing women in the city and out of the city
Still miss Dreah.
> Kiwo (everyone)  lol im ded
Thank you!
Shadiko has become my favorite to watch lately. Shadiko is so chill and is never in any drama. In the last few months that I’ve started watching, there hasn’t been 1 drama incident. Never seen them get angry or upset at anything. Such a chill streamer.
Ah!  I did not know that!  I'll leave my error intact so this comment makes sense, but good to know!  Thanks for pointing out, and as you say, the message remains the same.
TBF, losing both parents and having a tumor in your brain within a year or two is pretty damn humbling.
Still remember how many even on this subreddit celebrated her losing prio after she announced she was not coming back to NoPixel due to the numerous sexual harassment claims that women face there went unanswered or brushed off.  Wonder how those fools are thinking of themselves now.
It’s true, she even plays Lang Buddha
Alex and Stag are my favorite characters in the guild. Calm cool and collected but blunt when needed and take charge if necessary
Even before that, dude's roleplay was completely different. As for personally, though, that was a huge inspiration for me and it helped me get through some serious personal shit.
probably still happy because the ones who did that then are likely every bit as misogynistic now as they were then sadly
Dreahs unwhitelisting was well deserved. Sexual Harassment is terrible but Suzy accidentally-on-purpose witch-hunted a smaller streamer over a bad breakup.
Remember kids never use the highlighter tool to censor information.

Onix isn't a bad choice honestly.
Charles is one cute ass dog!
MVPs Franky and Zaceed for real.
Never would I think I'd see Hydra, Ballas, BSK, Saints and whoever else pose for a photo with Cerberus.  It's wild how things have changed.
Miguel with a Seaside chain is killing me lmao
Shout out to Osvaldo for making it close, but the amount of degens campaigning for Lang along with all the deals with group just seal the results.
This is probably the hardest I've seen Cerberus go for a campaign since Denzel vs Abdul lol.  They've pretty much been handed every victory since outside of the Bunny vs Ramee one.  And the Bunny one was mostly Bunny/Nancy shouldering the weight while this is the full might of Cerberus being put to work lol.  Insane effort and crazy ending lol.
ItsOver
Zaceed was such a hidden-gem-find for me throughout this campaign. He's so fucking hilarious lol
Theres actually a big gap if seaside wasnt go against Lang. but WhatCanYoDo
round of applause for osvaldo tho, guy did insanely well Clap
Miguel wearing the seaside chain is the icing on the cake   I feel bad for Osvaldo but the last day with buddha gathering all the gangs and his campaign team nonstop promoting for 24hrs gave him all the extra votes he needed
I feel like Lang's campaign got carried by non-Cerberus people more so than Cerberus employees (not to say they didn't do anything).
Is that crack sparrow on the right?
They are a juggernaut. Osvaldo has been at it a year is widely liked and couldn’t get it done.
This was fantastic, all these elections highlight how powerful Cerberus has become! But now I'm hoping a non Cerberus wins the next one.
Is that Miguel with a seaside chain?? I hope someone twats it 😂
 Just saying since Lang folded and became besties with Claire he started to overtake osvaldo
"Everyone say fuck the Simones, Seaside, HOA, Lost, Diamond Dogs and Osvaldo"
The biggest names on the server had to join forces to beat 1 Cuban.
Charles MVP as always
The umbrella votes just might have made the difference here, it was good on Buddha to capitalise on them.
Damn they nearly hired as many people to make up the vote difference between Lang and Osvaldo.
Lang won by about that many votes too
Onyx’s lunch
McGregor went unnoticed but he is also one of the best at helping Cerberus with mayorship
Waceed
Angels, Ballas, BSK, GG, Guild, Hydra, Mayhem, RUST, Saints, Vagos, Redline, Vendetta, and I think even Yokai were there. Of the groups that majority voted for Lang, I think only BBMC, CG and SDSO and ST weren't represented there but Miguel kinda counts for the umbrella vote. Honestly I might even be missing some.  GSF, Hidden, HOA, Lost, Mandem, PBSO and Seaside are the only groups I can think of that didn't have a deal of some kind with Lang/Cerberus/their people or actively voted against them.
More important than that... Lang has got his bestie Claire back.   And apparently Charles has a 50 million + dollar valuation.
Just notice because of ur comment, thats definitely a power move by Miguel 🤣
this was my fav election by far, the RP with Buddha, Harry, denzel and CG, hydra etc has been a whirlwind ,  Will go on to say I mean ramee has gone on record to say he was told he won that election but ‘Russia’ interference changed the results so make of that what you will
What do you expect,  he is Harry's son
Seaside joined him over Simone stuff, CG ditched him over the Simone stuff. For sure a net loss for Osvoldo there.
ThatsLife
Yeah that is kind of the plan by design though. Lang and the crew didn't go that hard making allies, striking deals, calling in favors just for the people he struck them with to do nothing. They made moves and they were effective in that it got big players with influence on his side.
The thing you have to remember though is that a lot of the recruitment and bringing in of the non-Cerberus people were done by, predictably, Cerberus people. The outreach done by both Cerb and the recruited nonCerb was a combined effort, and really shouldn't be seen as anything other than a unified force.
I think the extra part was all of these groups also campaigning on their own not just announcing support or voting. A 13 member gang all voting is a lot but then 1 or 2 of them bringing in 10 more random people throughout the campaign really made a difference. The gas stations and repair kit type things too.
Yeah, it is. BSK did a little to help Lang. Buddha was actually impressed, saying that they had no reason to vote for him since he hasn't done shit for them so he's hoping to get their carwash working this time.
No shot if Nancy runs, which is apparently the plan. Only person I see beating her is Andi.
i mean, cerberus has ran elections for 2 years. At this point, its "Cerberus Candidate vs Non-Cerberus Candidate" And cerberus are pretty much fighting against the same people every time. Obviously they flipped CG. But Ursula still had their businesses on lock.  Luckily with the wars, lang was able to gain some new votes.
Hired? They (or more like lang) made deals with most of them. it's called politics.
Least clueless hater
he was noticed but it's hard to separate him and franky sometimes :D from one best scottish vagos to 2 best scottish rust members
Yeah apparently the big guy said that dw withheld the data for the ramee election and ramee actually won
Ngl, I feel like Ash would be another person that could give Nancy a run if she went clean. It would basically be a battle of the tsunamis.
It's called an RP server with a popularity complex, not really politics.  I love Buddha, him and Lirik got me into watching RP, but it gets really tiring to just have the same status quo everywhere you go, and this is a continuation of that.
A) I don't really trust everything that guy says. Vale's a big example.   B) All of the admins and devs have shown an ability to remain unbiased in NoPixel that I cannot believe that could ever happen. CLUELESS
okay now it is getting ridiculous, ramee should just take the L instead of the conspiracy theories
no shot lmao
I mean you say that and it's probably been the case in several of the elections but this one seemed to be relatively realistic.  You had one side representing business interests of the city while also having the power of the incumbency which was heavily wielded (i.e using grants, both those already given and the promise of additional ones in the future) while the other side was trying to paint themselves as representing more of the "average" citizen's interests. Osvaldo did a really good job against someone who on a paper was an absolute behemoth of a candidate due to his extensive campaigning.  I think most people voting for Lang out of their character's own self interests rather than because he was a big streamer who was popular.  In reality Osvaldo was really running on a pretty weak platform with the only proposed legislation I had heard of was his anti-monopoly bill which was largely targeted at Cerberus and was very convoluted and would have been a horrible policy (and thats while ignoring the fact it probably wouldn't be able to be fully implemented due to how certain businesses are WL granted by admins to specific people).  Despite his limited platform he managed to attract a huge amount of support by just talking to people and ingratiating himself with them.  In reality the support for Osvaldo was more "popularity" based rather than characters acting in a self-interested manner although I wouldn't say that was true of all of his supporters.
i mean there casino pattern was significantly harder then anyone elses, and that mayor election was during like Peak CG v DW times... lot of factors, owner has said he did a lot of shady shit to CG,  which makes sense cause of how angry he was
Owner is also part of CG and an incredibly salty individual at the best of times. Parading a one sided narrative that is to his and his friends benefit is hardly coming from an unbiased point of view. The casino shit they may well have had harder patterns simple fact was they meta gamed the rest of the knowledge only random patterns would slow them down while everyone else was doing the Dora work. Not to speak for the bloke but DW had a good habit of finding ways to drain funds from the overly rich.
i mean but then on your own logic DW was exactly the same,   the casino shit had the weirdest shit to start with anyway...., Offline finding the opening by a mistake? the biggest streamer also finds it out... The watch alongs that was holding thousands of views etc  for me heist progression was the worse part of 3.0 for me it was literally dog shit, the toxicity was unbarable from ALL sides

The way I look at this is:  Last final push from Lang side is getting people who normally would never have voted, to vote.  That's also why the total votes was so high by the end.
STOP THE COUNT!

Fuck that was hard to listen to. He really messed her up nobody deserves to be treated like that.
I talked about this in another thread. I remember when she first started out, she used to rp a lot with kyle and had a game night with penta. But seemed to distance herself after meeting rated, and rated said he was a insecure person in his “apology”
This shit is so gross.  It makes me think back to all of the times when people would ask her if she was in a relationship and she'd deny it.      Just knowing that behind the scenes the whole time someone was telling her to keep it a secret, making her like she should be hidden, and it turns out that the reason behind all of that mistreatment and being made to feel unwelcome and something to be hidden, was all because the person wanted to freely creep on other women.  It's the sorta shit that makes you feel sick.
I remember first watching Lyndi back in 2.0 when the whole Violet and Brett RP was happening, the amount of crazy and stupid things Lyndi and Kyle came up with on the spot was hilarious.  Heartbreaking to hear how isolated she's been over the past 3 years.
Nobody should ever be made to feel like this.
I hope the community empowers Lyndi and any other person in similar situations so they can speak up and feel heard.
To anyone who's thinking "why didn't you just leave if it was so bad?" Understand that this relationship had a massive power dynamic at play. Rated was part of a group that is close personal friends with the owner, has been protected for YEARS from punishment, can get entire rules/SOPs changed with a discord call and has had updates that seem tailormade for them. They basically run this server.  Lyndi on the other hand is in that no mans land on nopixel where she's stuck on the server because if she leaves her views/subs will drop and streaming will cease to be a viable full time gig. How could she know if she left him that he wouldn't exert his power to get her banned the first chance he could? We all know it happens because it literally just happened to gable a few weeks ago.  She really was in a terrible spot and forced to make terrible decisions. Nobody should hold anything against her.
[removed]
She deserves all the love and support in the world. I hope she gets to rebuild the relationships she lost, and that the community comes together to make sure she's cared for and protected
Man I seriously hope people are willing to give Lyndi another chance. Being in a relationship with someone that chronically abusive to everyone else... I can't even imagine the shit he probably did and said to her when no one was looking.  This is why I get so furious about this sort of behavior getting brushed aside as "just banter" so often on the server; it shouldn't take someone getting to this level of emotional duress to finally get justice.
I have so much respect for these women. God damn. Just... fuck.
Man I honestly don't understand how this guy had this much manipulative pull over so many people while being as private and anonymous as he was. The way I've heard it even his closest friends in CG never saw his face or even know his real name.  Apart from his twitch and NP personas dude's a complete ghost, him being this successful as an online personality is surprising enough let alone getting into multiple "relationships". In hindsight knowing what happened behind the scenes I guess he tried his best to be a ghost exactly for that purpose.
The amount of strength this must have taken. I admire her so much
God this just broke my heart. Classic abuser tactic to isolate someone from their friends and family so they only have the abuser to rely on. I hope people will reach out to her now.
It's so bad when you know that if you complain about being treated like shit, you will be the the one who is going to be outcast.
Trigger warning, this so sad and hard to listen to even as a short clip.
I can’t imagine the amount of pain she’s feeling, I hope she’s able to find peace.
💙
Man. This whole talk was so fucking hard to listen to.   It gave me flashbacks to when I was in a situation like this. I gave up a lot of my life because of my abuser, and the lasting trauma.  They had more viewers/influence over people, and it was their word against mine. I had to deal with years of them becoming more successful, and their videos everywhere. It wasn't until a few years ago that people started to see the side of them that I knew.  Even now, a decade or more later, I still find it hard to be myself around others and to express my emotions. It hits hard especially when you are in your 20s because you're still discovering who you are as a person, and that gets tainted by these people. You are left so confused.   A saying I found that helped me gain my voice back was, " You own everything that happened to you. Tell your stories. If people wanted you to write warmly about them, they should've behaved better." I can speak about it now, and am grounding myself more and more each day.   I hope Lyndi knows how many people support her, believe her, and will be there to help her on her feet. All of this takes time, and I hope she takes the time she needs to heal from all of this. This also goes for anyone else who has experienced abuse. You are stronger than you think, your feelings are completely valid, and you aren't alone.
Poor girl, I feel bad just watching that
Friends with Penta? Can't play with any CG members.
What happened with Carmen when she did a twitter thing about Penta and deleted it do to push back from a certain community?
out of everything that came out, this one breaks my heart not gonna lie. what a disgusting human being Rated is. I feel for her. and also fuck his chatters. hope she will get all the love she deserves now.
[removed]
I didnt like lyndi because about a year or so randy was sexist to carmella on twatter called her a whore or something and people criticized him, like suzy\_q (Dreah) on twitter , then lyndi came out and defended rated and said that he is not sexist and he is a good guy since then i never opened her stream ,
Were they together irl??
I think that Lyndi and Rateds victims need to stay off the net for a bit and go and get some counseling irl if they are not already. Continously going online and streaming about the situation and then getting evil comments and dms is not going to help them at all. Kudos to them for being brave and speaking up.
Can somebody fill me in, i didn't know they were dating. Thought it was a stalkers imagination spreading rumors.

She's one of the best... Off the cuff.. come up with some random rp shit to take things in a different direction... On the entire Server
I want to say it was Lyndi, Ashlynn and Meka in the same game night at one point. It was so loud and chaotic and nonstop hilarious. I'd love to see that again in the future.
I hope a lot of those relationships can be rectified. She deserves it.
Rated have always hated Penta and Kyle for never taking his shit and even fighting back so it doesn't exactly come off as a suprise she distanced herself from them when she didn't want to.
Not a bad thing from not playing with Penta
[removed]
Like literally.. one bad interaction with Rates... Cost Gable his PD job... That's the kind of pull he had over someone he doesn't interact with... Imagine what he coulda done to her
Giving her another chance? What did she do?  As far as I understand she was one of the victims.
She's not the one who did anything wrong. I'm sure all the people she hung around with would be more than happy to hang out and rp more.
I'm pretty sure CG met Rated before at Twitchcon or something  And there ain't nothing impressive about this. Anybody can sit and play games for hours. He ain't special
When did this happen?
When?
What did Carmen say before she deleted her tweet?

Nice victim blaming. Many victims find it difficult to leave their abusive relationships.
Go on your main account pussy
Google "coercive control" and "victim blaming". Then shut the fuck up and do some reading.
Also Kayden was excluded from the Angels when they first formed. Remember, Kayden and Violet were sisters.
Weak people hate strong people not surprised he couldn't deal with penta or kyle
This is not grooming.  Grooming is establishing a non-sexual relationship with someone that has less power than you.  Usually a child, but not necessarily.  Then the abuser uses that non-sexual relationship to lower the victim's defenses and establish a sexual relationship they otherwise wouldn't have done.  It seems that, from what I've seen, he explicitly established a relationship with her but asked her to be quiet so he could sexually harass others.  This is textbook emotional abuse and isolation. It's bad enough without calling it grooming, which weakens the impact of that term.
Idk how you make the leap from “he’s overly controlling with his girlfriend and a cheater” to “he’s probably a pedophile”

So from the sounds of it, it sounds like Rated exerted a lot of control over her relationships, and effectively limited her ability to foster relationships with people he disapproved of. So I'm hoping people don't just blithely assume that now that Rated is gone that everything is all good, and maybe extend a hand to try again to build friendships that she previously felt pressured to disregard.
I believe, and I'm speaking anecdotally as I don't really follow this stuff, that she was not very kind to Megs when Megs came out with the initial accusations against Rated. If so, it's clear why that happened in hindsight.   That said, Lyndi is a victim, and I don't assign her blame. Nevertheless, some relationships might be past the point of salvaging, which is unfortunate.
She did absolutely nothing wrong, and I hope people take the effort to reach back out. That was literally all I meant.
I never said or implied he was special , in fact I'm saying he's sus AF since no one ever knew anything about the guy.  Dude abused and manipulated a bunch of people but no one knew who the fuck he was behind the screen, shit is super sketchy when you think about it.

Women in the USA and Canada take, in average, 6 or 7 attempts of escape before being able to do so (the sixth or seventh being the success).   They don't know anything about abuse. They don't want to not care to.
It's more like abusers try to isolate their victims, especially from those who might be in a position to help.  It's much harder to do online, but if you notice a friend, especially a long-term friend, suddenly withdrawing from their friends and family, that's a huge red flag. Especially so if they're in a newish relationship.
He clearly hates fat (formerly fat) boomer fuckers
There’s a pretty big difference between Kyle and Penta even though there characters can both be a holes.
[removed]
you can groom an adult as well, that term isnt only used for cases with children, although its more often seen in those situations.
[removed]
Oh that makes sense.
One of the most fun, chaotic pairings was Violet and Kayden in 2.0 for that brief bit.
better verbiage would be: I hope people are willing to mend broken relationships that got shattered through the systematic pressure from her abuser.  but i get your point
I’m just gonna say it CG is aware of the fact that Rated was abusive and manipulative. Now whether or not they knew the intimate details of what Rated was specifically doing I’ll lean towards no probably not. But the reason I said they knew is because every core member of CG is manipulative and abusive. They show their abusive side with every OOC rant they go on because people don’t roll over for them or go against them. And Ramee proudly boasted about the fact that they bully cops so that the cops do what they want which is manipulation 101.  Have you have noticed that the core member of CG all seem to hate the same people no matter how much or little the member has interacted with the other person? They’re not shy when saying they back their own 100%. They also share their disdain for certain  people with each other clearly. Rated controlling who Lyndi can or can not be friends with is just logical extreme of the mentality of backing your own 100% and everyone hating someone because one person hates someone. Its the abusive belief that if you’re with me then you must also hate who I hate. It’s why People need to stand up to their friends when they’re being toxic. Because normalizing toxicity gives the abusive the very wrong belief that their toxicity is not normal but also acceptable.
Amen.
Seems you think Kyle = Kyle Pred  I imagine, as someone who watches & currently defends Rated, you have never watched someone actually roleplay before
[removed]
One day you'll learn to separate RP from reality
No.
You think Kyle is the same as rated?
The person they responded to also said mentions "teens" when talking about grooming. Let's not play ignorant. When someone hears about "teens being groomed", no one's first thought is, "oh they must be talking about consenting adults that are 18 or 19."
Idk who Josh is or any of that situation so I can’t speak on that.
Man I love having the way I talk/type critiqued on an internet sub-forum. Not even grammatical errors, just people blaming me because the precision of the English language is a little wanting.
100000%
I mean is it his fault? I'm sure all he's ever watched was self inserts after all, so he's just assuming it's the same for everyone!
oh I actually have no idea how I missed that when I first read it, ya probably best not to assume shit like that, hes an awful person already no point to make stuff up like that.
Critique is a valuable way of learning and improving in life. The commenter was not digging at your English skills, but rather trying to portray this uniquely difficult situation as best as possible.
Eh thats the internet.  i dont even mean anything with ill intent. precisely because the language (or any other language) has nuance is why its important to get the verbiage as good as you can.  And i do feel like my comment was as close to constructive criticism as i could get

atleast now there is a announcement if you help Simone you are fucked   Libby also asked Brian list of cops who were in contact with Michael Simone  (for High Command)
Lol half the city about to get an accomplice charge at this point, the Simone web is pretty large.
Only mayor can pardon death penalty LOL
Finally the story can progress on the PD side, Michael has been having meetings with his lawyer discussing how the whole thing was in limbo for him since the docket was never refiled.
o7 Jenny Hall and Seaside
Rip the Simone Coverup Unit
Hasn't this already been ruled on in court, like, a lot of times? Hitting the prison transport never counts for that. It only starts to apply when actually broken out of prison. iirc, even the Siz/HoA won a slam dunk bench trial after hitting a prison transport and pd tried to give them the charges of the 95s.
Maybe cops will actually try arresting him now instead of dragging this on for another year, babying him, acting like he's a victim and meeting up with him just for content.
This is going to shake up a LOT of things (and people) in the city.
Last couple times there was an announcement that you could get fucked for helping terrorists, nobody wanted to deal with the fallout so they retconned the entire war.
Won't the 60 day limitation save most of them?
In before Lang pardons Michael to make Yeagar happy.
but for death penalty you need tobi to allow it XD and he said he isnt perma michael sooo
rip also hydra/guild
jenny is fine because she had always given all information over that she knows
You're expecting the DoJ to be consistent/competent.
I think that applies to a specific charge (harbouring a fugitive, maybe?) you can still be charged in the way being described here. If Michael Simone is caught people will be charged as accomplices after the fact.
There are "big bads" like titanium and puppet master who has been ongoing for like 5-6 years because cops chasing them dont actually want to catch em as chasing them is better content
Now is the first time he's actually hard charges pushed against him. Tobii has been understanding of why but a little personally frustrated since Brian hasn't being pushing charges against him so there wasn't any end to the RP in sight.
I mean Dawn of all people still has Treason and shit on her record forever.
Or the charges against Ray and Miguel (maybe someone else?) that were from the prison breakout. Even when Michael “died” and those charges could have been pushed finally since SOL was not part of those charges they just weren’t.
Certain parts of the war did get retconned because it became such a clusterfuck, but all of the stuff from the breakout onwards only got put on hold because of the awkwardness around Michael's SOL.
Anything involving Michael Simone has no statue of limitations I'm pretty sure
Pretty sure crane it didn’t apply to this case specifically
I can see this happening lmao
tobii ooc has said he plans to continue to play michael, so I can imagine him agreeing to something like this as a workaround
Lang already addressed this.  He's going to tell Michael he's the only one who can save him and then let the death penalty happen lol.  Revenge SZN baby
Does Coops law still exist? Wasn't that a way of getting around needing consent for the death penalty?
Guild and Hydra want to kill both Simones. They have nothing to worry about.
Not anymore lol. Pretty sure that's only if they're caught harboring him and Hydra hates the guy for shooting Miguel while the Guild is pretty firmly on Lang's side.
Something this big will most likely go through Crane.
Yeah, you right. That's my bad.
RP endings 90% of the time are a huge let down and anticlimactic so I totally understand wanting to keep the chase going.
I believe Miguel has been told, the second he is caught, all those charges are back.
Thats because he waived it, I don't think that transfers to others.
That seems pretty arbitrary
Not just for Yaeger.   Batman needs his Joker, after all.
no, is the streamer choice , you cant force someone to perma his character
Miguel literally snitched that he was one of the people who actively organized Michael Simone’s prison transport breakout. So o7 to Miguel, AP, Ray, and Jay Jarvis
but they still helped him, just because you dont like him now doesnt change what you did before XD
they cant just ignore all hydra did to help michael just because he is mad daddy michael didnt call him XD
nah, crane is already mega super conflicted, hes done all the subpoenas and warrants for this and pretty much knows every detail. This will most likely be a senate trial
If they still plan on pushing them that’s fantastic. There’s should be that weight there.
Crane was pretty clear that it doesn't apply to anyone involved with the Simones going forward
ray and migl both have charges waiting for them
It was stated over a year ago to be the case. It’s why Miguel and Ray were able to be released from their HUT charges until Michael was caught - anyone with charges/crimes related to Michael won’t have a 60 day SOL for those crimes as it is well established to be long term RP.
Guess it would depend on what charges get pushed for the involved parties. Could be nothing, or is could reinvigorate prison rp lol
And in this case the streamer is a dev so....
The announcement wasn't talking about charging people for previously helping him. They were saying that if you help him now that these charges have been filed again, you will be charged accordingly so be prepared for that
People are only going to be charged if they help now that this annoucement went out. Since the charges have been refiled he is a fugitive and helping him now will get you charged with harboring/aiding and abetting a fugitive
What I mean is that I think it will be a lot harder for them to get evidence on people who aren't helping him anymore, so they're at much less risk than people like Seaside/Andi/certain cops who are still regularly in contact with him.
Michael waved his statute of limitations. I don't think that transfers to others.
Who has enabled nothing but nice rp through his character and has never went for the w.   Forgot to add that?
The PD still plan on charging AP, Ray, and Jay Jarvis for the prison transport breakout. And since Miguel snitched that he organized it he’ll probably be charged too.
PD plans to charge those involved in his transport breakout, including MgL. Along with Cops who helped in the past.
They don’t have a choice. Either they get involved in Michael things with waived SOL or don’t get involved in Michael stuff. Was made very clear with that court case and the charges being delayed until he’s caught.
tobii messaged them all before they tried and said if you are involved and get caught the SOL does not save you
Tobii has been adamant that he doesn't want to perma. He has also been very vocal on streams that he doesn't want to have Michael be in jail for 30 irl days or so.
Just saying they aren't going to force perma him.  Plenty of great rp, agreed. Both simones have interacted with lots of people on the server.
Miguel has been told he will be charged, and expects it. He also let Ray know that those charges were likely coming back. I believe the only way they have offered him out is for him to actually testify against Michael, which he has said he wouldn't do.
Force perma ofc shouldn't happen but would be weird if he went in for like 14 days only after all this shit lol.
Miguel didn't think he would do a lot of things.  But things changed over the last month or so.  I wouldn't be so sure now
14 days is still more time them 200 loa kills just saying

Crazy that Osvaldo achieved so many votes against someone as connected as Lang.
almost 2 years worth of ceberus mayors was bound to catch up to lang and co. More people would end up hating them. Luckily they were able to make some new allies against the simones. And  still manage to stay undefeated in elections.
Context:  The view as Judge Crane reads the election results.  Nancy Drew will become one of the Deputy Mayors this term.  Congrats to everyone who campaigned!
It's because he was also backed by Nicholas Simone, trying to get him elected, briibing and using gang pressure/group voting.  Also, Osvaldo has been working on the Cubans and trying to get elected since the last election, so he put in yons of work too.

It's interesting that a lot of the chatters didn't think it would be close at all.  Last election already showed how formidable Osvaldo was.  Buddha was dooming but his instincts is correct.
The breakdown is pretty interesting, Osvaldo was pulling ahead for quite some time and then the actual campaigning from Cerberus started during the last two days and completely flipped the results.
The votes Lang flipped by getting so many gangs who usually opposed him on his side really mattered a shit ton this election.  And then the Simone announcement after. This great arc continues!
That was actually way closer than I expected.    Osvaldo's team did a good job. But the amount of people that supported and campaigned for Lang the last 3 days was insane
Oh wow Buddha was actually correct dooming on the first day. I thought the 2.0 server would have an affect but didnt think it was gonna make it this close.
Respect to Osvaldo really shows hes very well liked.      I look forward to the rp which comes now that Lang is on his final term so no longer Mr Nice guy to preserve votes, especially against those who went against him.      Also Lang has alot of promises to fulfil (A Leanister always pays his debts).
One thing I’m looking forward to is Buddha not helping all those who turned on him. We all know his petty ass will remember everything. Lmao Pbso is probably the most fucked one along with Hayes.
Buddha playing back to back in the car was perfect after. Also…  The announcement was huge. What a mix up. Detective K really got things rolling.
Awesome infographic, vote was way closer than I expected.
Pretty close! I hope Osvaldo gets a chance at Mayor next time.
always down by 20!
Because you can vote for more than 1 person, its always going to be like this.
Team Lang really went ham the last days and clutched it for him.
nidas subathon carried
Aw I was kinda hoping for Osvaldo. I like hogshund, he's worked hard for it over the last year.  But that's life I suppose.
Damn that's a super close election! I think buddha was justified in his dooming lol
I *really* hope he follows through and goes scorched earth petty against the detractors.
Amazing. It was so cool to see everyone on super late that night campaigning for Lang after he was dooming all day long. Ellie, Harry, Denzel, Leslie, Ray and many others put in so much work that night and it payed off.
Franky and Zaceed MVP. Cerberus, RUST, BSK, Saints, etc all pulled their weights
The degen dooming hours was amazing.
That push from everyone the night of Nidas' subathon was insane, damn.
I didn't look frame by frame closely so there could have been a time with a slightly larger margin but it looks like Osvaldo was up by 53 votes at one point.  Pretty large gap to overcome.
Can people still vote for more than 1 person?
We all know Jacob was the reason Buddha won the election!  The fix was in! /s
B2B
Depending who runs next time, I hope Osvaldo runs again, cause they went hard and his tried so many times now, this was so close and shows he has a chance. Until Lang gets a run like Mickey did that is.
They when hard yesterday
How exciting!
A bit disappointing, I would have liked to see something new, but I guess most people were happy with the same old status quo.
Byrd Cock was robbed
last election Buddha barely campaign and won, this election he tried.
Franky from Rust went insane the past day and a half once they were given official word to support Lang from Ray.  Dude was grinding all sorts of crackhead hours.
yeah with the election over he can now refocus on working with CG against the Simones. oh and also aegis soon hopefully
yeah i mean, 2 years of running elections under cerberus is bound to make a lot of enemies in the long run.  Because osvaldo was campaigning for 11 months, Flipping those votes was huge.
1088 total votes  485 - Mr. Lang  406 - Ossssjavaldo  85 - Weedingle Dan  64 - Byrd Cock  48 - R. Caldwell  So Lang 44.6% of the vote with Osvoldo getting 37.3%.  Lang won by 7.3 points - - by voting standards that's a landslide.  Of course if Cerberus didn't go hard they probably lose or just edge out a win.
Yeah he turned around after hitting the panic button first day.
He did mention he was going to stop not following his character traits against people that were openly working against him
Tbh he never really followed up but he might fuck over pbso because they were disrespectful to Nancy.
He said his wife is expecting a baby in June - so this was his last time running.
He ain't running again, he's having a child. In June I believe it was.
Nancy is running next. Will be a close one
Because of the first election delay, Hogs has been at this for like 11 months. He has said many times this week that this was going to be his last campaign. Shame, looking at his growth as a streamer and roleplayer since his days fucking around with spaceboy doing terrorism this time last year I think he deserved the win.
Unfortunately, he will not run again. This was the only opportunity for him because he has a baby on the way. 11 months was put into this, kinda sad tbh but GGs.
That's only if people are splitting their vote between the front runners.  If someone votes for an underdog they really want and the front runner they prefer then yeah you will probably see the front runners getting a much higher % of the votes than the other candidates but it doesn't mean it will always be a close race. It comes down to the popularity of the front runners.   You could vote for multiple candidates when Mickey was running but he absolutely crushed in his elections.
WhatCanYouDo ThatsLife
what can you do...
Yes
Hogshund already stated he won't be running again because his wife is giving birth in 2 months and he didn't want to neglect the city as mayor.
Oh definitely, I wanted to mention people other than Cerberus in my previous comment but that would have been too many people lol
Same with Zaceed dude didn't sleep much and was always campaigning
Waiting for Him Collins to be back for that.
That’s also voting standards of a multimillion person nation, not a 49k person nation so the margin isn’t as crazy
Byrd cock did better than I thought!
The Degen dooming hours was amazing.
Yup. He mentioned that Benji will regret his tweet and PBSO will find out because they fucked around.
Nah he met some of them last night while on kick and got some votes
oh no, nancy's fragile ego
Holy shit that's so awesome for him!
Really sad cause he would have done a lot better than most have.
I genuinely think Nancy's election will be the biggest blowout election ever. She's insanely connected and close to everyone.
I think she's forgetting that Hardcastle wanted to run.  It's possible she backs off that intention when she remembers.
I don't know if it's because of him not feeling like he'll be able to be a good mayor when he has his kid, but there's a non-zero chance that Lang and Cerberus try to get him on their side and back him for the next election so he might not have to campaign at all. I'd love to see him get it done, though.
Longest campaign ever 🫡🫡🫡 big up for Hogshund #OsvaldoOneTrueMayor🇨🇺  #HeStillHasMyVote🇨🇺 .  Congrats to Lang winning the election.
I mean 7% is 7%
It's revenge season. Leslie is there and he will encourage maximum petty. Payback is going to be extremely creative.
He doesn't have another term to campaign for, time for finding out season.
He said he was going to fuck them for being rude to Nancy today

What makes you think that?  I like Osvaldo as a character but his entire platform was pretty much "Cerberus bad".  As far as I know he doesn't run a business in the city so he doesn't really have any first hand experience with challenges businesses are facing in the city.  It also didn't seem like he had anyone really experienced with running the mayor's office that was on his team for deputy mayors positions.  It seems like he would have gotten into office and had no idea what is or isn't realistic to implement or really how to make things happen or had reliable people to delegate responsibilities to.
don't count the old favorite party hardy
Nancy will be a landslide. Does anyone not love her?
Yeah same. I wouldn't be surprised if she gets at least a 200 vote lead. She would have to run against someone just as connected which are only a handful
I could see that being a possibility. I do think its was really the campaigning and not the prospect of mayorship though. The guy also works a job outside of streaming so these last few weeks of streaming outside of his usual hours were a pretty big strain. Also just because he hangs out with the elderly (aka terrorist shitlords) there has been a near constant anxiety of them getting him into serious trouble and fucking him over for the last 11 months lmao.   My biggest wish for his term as mayor was his commitment to the people who roleplay characters who can't really fit into the mechanical molds of the server. Stuff like food rations, places to live (old folks homes), access to vehicles (you cant rent a car if you're in debt), stuff like that. I think that kind of struggle goes under the radar and it just gets in the way of good rp.
I think the difference is that in a small election you can literally personally campaign to small groups of people or even individuals directly which is hugely different to how elections work once you scale it up. So, yeah it's 7% but getting to 7% is much harder in a larger election.
Plus with Denzel back…☠️
You obviously aren’t paying attention… Osvaldo never bad mouthed any of the Cerberus during his campaigning (he actually made a large effort to not do it), BUT Lang and his team did to him, in fact Osvaldo wanted to do a debate with Buddha but he refused. Osvaldo actually does have a news business so he does have a business. Also the person that’s been by his side the entire time was Ricardo Perez who is quite arguably one of the best Deputy Mayors that’s been in the city, whomst has run and had hands in many businesses, owner of pitchers and CEO of pixel perfect, they also do the Pride event yearly. And even if Osvaldo didn’t have all that, you think mayors previously haven’t won with less?
Andi and the Simones don't like her anymore but idk about anyone else.
Damn I didn't realize he still worked another job in addition to streaming. Hopefully he pops off enough before his baby comes that he feels comfortable to stream full time. He's a gift to the server for sure.
I didn't say he was badmouthing individuals at Cerberus but the business as a whole.  The one piece of legislation he stated he wanted to push was one specifically designed to target Cerberus businesses and would have been bad for the city.  Osvaldo definitely tried to spread the anti-Cerberus sentiment. I don't think it's a coincidence that when people voting for Osvaldo were asked why they were voting for him it was pretty much all anti-Cerberus sentiment and not much positive for anything Osvaldo had planned.    I was wrong about him not having a business based on him having a news business but that has a very different business model than the vast majority of businesses in the city which rely on storefronts and actual production of goods / foot traffic etc for business.    Comparisons to previous mayors isn't that valuable because there was a time when essentially no one had experience with anything so it would be expected that mayoral teams wouldn't have experience.  The city has been around for a lot longer now and expectations on experience change.
The same Ricardo that at one point would prefer scrapping Pride from the server because Cerberus didn’t want to work with him (they’d work with ANY other person from Pitchers, Ricardo could still control everythibg, just not be in direct contact with Cerberus), due to his previous public dislike of Cerberus, trying ro snake Cerberus? That Ricardo Perez?
Andi doesn't dislike her, they've had at least neutral convos since they stopped hanging out. She dislikes how Nancy treated other people close to her and decided to not be friends but it's not like she hates her or something. In the past she told Nancy she would make an excellent mayor several times.  Nick does dislike her though.
People voting for him because they dont like Cerberus isnt Osvaldo's fault. There is a lot of RP reasons why people would not vote for Cerberus.    Like them firing all of the auto's employees and giving their jobs to people that already have jobs.    Them trying to take over PBSO and extending their reach, into places people think they shouldnt.   The fact that Lang has killed a lot of police officers that are still active and they hold grudges.   The newly instated thing that Buddha brought in called Aegis that can literally take away companies from people if they want to.   Not only that people are fed up of every mayor being Cerberus and want some variety.   Theres may reasons in rp why people wouldnt want to vote for them.     Not everyone has experiences with every part of the city when it comes to business which is why you have deputy mayors.     As for city and expectations, Mayoral expectations have got worse and worse. When was the last town hall meeting? the ones that were held every time zone so that everyone can be heard.
You can tell you didn't watch hogshund stream at all lmao. Osvaldo made it a really hard point to not bash buddha or cerberus and Osvaldo has stated multiple times he has no hate towards cerberus. Dude would call people on the opposing side and ask them if they where having fun and shit.
You mean the Cerberus that snaked him first? They did some shady things to him first, if you would watch Jubby he goes through it regularly with people about it, because people constantly get the timeline mixed up. They fired him from Cerburus and tried to take events planning from him, which is why he then went to work with CG cause they recognized how great Ricardo is.
andi also never bothered to get both sides of the story in that thing. nancy's point was fair, but to try to turn nancy's relationship with coliln against her as ammo in how she responded to TJ was screwed
Oh, my bad, I haven't gotten a chance to watch Kiva recently and misremembered what she said around the time that Andi and Nancy stopped hanging out. Thanks for the correction!
And why did he get fired? Does he say that?  Don't take this as me saying that Jubby, the streamer, has a problem with Cerberus. He's playing Ricardo perfectly, as he says, pretty often, "Ricardo is a petty bitch" "Ricardo is a dramatic bitch". The character has proven that they'll burn bridges for VERY minor things.
When was Ricardo ever part of Cerberus to be fired from? Cerberus was going to assist Ricardo with Pride until Ricardo openly went against them during the Ramee v Bunny election. Cerberus told Pitchers employees that they still wanted to work with them, but did not want to work with Ricardo.
Yeah... he does, Jubby goes through it all, he good at explaining to his chat.
Ricardo worked very closely with Cerberus in his early days, he hated Bunny a long time before the Ramee vs Bunny.

Lot Q vs the angels gang was a fun arc not gonna lie

As usual a super based take from Ziggy
Yeah its crazy reading posts on other subreddits and YT comments saying it wasnt the "worst" or "that bad".      Hell some people are more [mad about Blaus reaction](https://imgur.com/a/Hn3rdwa) to the news than at Rated.
But....He reads my name out when I sub.....
Is it a mental disorder or something?
NGL i dont watch RP anymore but damn i come here for the drama... its almost nonstop, but some of the fans of a character/streamer go fucking nuts. The fandom made me quit watching NP as a whole... but damn i love me some good improv.  And the drama on this sub, its like a neverending soap opera
Common Ziggy W :nodders
Honestly the people who defend this guy, give off terminally online vibes. It feels like a lot of these people also lack real world interactions with other people.   I’m a newish viewer to NP and when I read about the whole rated faking his name thing recently, that immediately threw up a red flag and I would have cut ties knowing he had some skeletons.
The fact that they are calling Blau a clout chaser  but yet ignored when CG went to Summit or when Fuslie joined NP, Fuslie was part of CG lol  That was honesty what made me stop watching CG and NP in general.  The stupid fanbase for the streamers.  Those bad apples made the actual good people who want to be fans a bad name
It comes as no surprise to me when it comes from that part of the community, these viewers has been groomed and manipulated for years to maximize their profits from these viewers .  Dropped by Shotz stream shortly and its just a pity party to milk even more subs out of their viewers while anyone mentioning Rated or for that matter just alluding to it will get you banned.   Just seems like they are trying everything to get it buried and forgotten so they can continue doing what they always do!
[removed]
It's basically the same as Stockholm syndrome in a way just without the intent to do it.  You spent so much time watching someone and being a fan of them that (especially with live streams) you feel like you are directly associated with them and an attack against the person is an attack again you as well
Yes
Yeah, it comes in many variations, some pretty harmless, others very very harmful
completely disconnected from watching NoPixel at the moment.  But the drama that spews from this subreddit is very entertaining. 🍿
Don’t forget when most of CG “kings of Los santos” all applied and worked at burger shot when chance was RPing lmao
Blau openly admits he is a clout chaser though lol
For YEARS it’s been clear that they do not care how despicable the behavior of a CG streamer is. They will always support them, and that’s deliberate on the part of CG.   They’ve purposefully built a community around their toxicity. This is not news to anyone that’s been paying attention since like 2019.
So, what if a streamer feigns victimhood over imagined wrongs committed by other streamers playing on the server?  What if they perpetuate that sense of victimhood in order to elicit sympathy from their audience, which of course can be expressed via subs and donations? I think that the use of this revenue model is very intentional on the part of Rated and his ilk.
Joking about networking is different than the word being used as a cudgel to shut people up or try to make them feel shame in reaching out to interact with popular/influential peers. Wild to think League of Legends was training to interact with RP viewers and streamers.
that's a lot of words lol, how about... ignore rated he is a piece of shit
Wild. Just a joke my man.
>he retaliated against me for filing a report, using info from the report to do so.  Obviously the problems with NoPixel are systemic, and are not about a few bad apples.  &#x200B;  Edit: also Rated can't say that he did not know he was harming other people, if he was able to weaponize women's reports against him to silence them.
I hope they review every report that guy ever submitted. If he was weaponizing access to NoPixel that makes them look complicit.
Apparently Kylie also reported him multiple times for his toxic behaviour in 2.0 but was always told there's nothing they can do, and it's not like he was ever all that subtle about his grudge against her.
And this is a part of why so many have trouble coming forward about things that are happening. It's things like this why there are others doing similar things on the server and they are afraid to come forward without concrete proof (some even with proof).  Edit to add:   Evees second tweet: https://twitter.com/EveeTTV/status/1644118521767501824   And Kylie on a former admin (vod talks about other things too): https://clips.twitch.tv/TiredMagnificentHareGivePLZ-jMEZlNFv9CQF7t\_x
This seems pretty damaging for management. Rightfully so. They need to do better. Catering to and enabling people like Rated, and those similar to him who are still on the server, is how things get to this point.
At this point, nopixel either needs a refresh of admins, or to set stricter guidelines as to what they expect from the admins in terms of not only handling reports, but also handling in game toxicity that happens in front of them. No more "well what am I gunna do about it???" or laughing along. Stop enabling these people to make the server a shit place for others.
Yeah "Just report them 4Head" was never a solution, not only the report will end up in nothing or in a "hard punishment" of a 3 day ban on a weekend, you will end up in the "fuck X person" 4 hour car talks, and once you are on that list, you end up there for years.
This is why victims don’t come forward.  I know sometimes it’s obvious who reports who, but NoPixel management should be monitoring, asking the victim how they are, if anything else has happened since their report, support them etc. Especially when we all know how vile he is…
Explains why a lot of people didn't bother to report CG
Situations like this are why I am always either recording or streaming. It is hard to look video evidence in the face and deny it.
Penta has illuded to certain individuals weaponizing reports against him which is why he doesn't bother alot of the time. (ie he reported me so report him for anything and everything)  I can see rated being one of these people
this is a common CG issue like Ramee was complaining IC to Trooper Boss about getting reported. They get so vindictive when someone reports them
They really need to make a rule about harassment and shit by going after people who report you.
At the end of November 2022, NoPixel removed controller support from the server ([A](https://old.reddit.com/r/RPClipsGTA/comments/z4lpkq/neutren_controllers_disabled_on_the_server/), [B](https://old.reddit.com/r/RPClipsGTA/comments/z7ai7c/gtawiseguys_reply_to_summit/), [C](https://old.reddit.com/r/RPClipsGTA/comments/z7c92d/judd_replies_to_summit_basically_saying_anyone/)).   At the time, [CowsMooingNSuch Tweeted](https://old.reddit.com/r/RPClipsGTA/comments/z5loly/cowsmooingnsuch_blocking_people_from_using/) about how the decision negatively impacted roleplayers - including themselves - who rely on the usage of controllers for accessibility purposes due to their physical conditions in real life.   That Tweet garnered a larger-than-usual amount of replies. Almost every reply was negative and abusive in nature. Almost every negative reply came from an active account of a viewer from the Chang Gang fanbase:  https://twitter.com/bgzz2122/status/1596653663069433859 https://twitter.com/kampchino/status/1596673508628537344 https://twitter.com/nk760955/status/1596675274707734528 https://twitter.com/Quna_Zelsius/status/1596704526077149186 https://twitter.com/Quna_Zelsius/status/1596703865625538561 https://twitter.com/wholesomethomas/status/1596758813973295109 https://twitter.com/tide_crim/status/1597385059715383298 https://twitter.com/CowsMooingNSuch/status/1596654180281614336  CowsMooingNSuch is not a big streamer and does not have a significant presence on Twitter. At the time, it was interesting to see their Tweet gain such an unusually large volume of negative attention, and that all of it came from one very specific fanbase.
I always suspected that list of cops that Rated and CG held a grudge against were the list of cops who had reported them. I'm sure some of those cops are currently being told they're not getting hired back from the "shake up" too.   I 100% believe her, there was definitely retaliation.
There's so many women. Some of them have alluded to having heard stuff about his behaviour long ago. It's incredible to see how many people are relieved he's finally gone. Makes you think twice about CG's PR strategy of pretending they didn't really know him personally so they didn't know about any of this
Not the biggest mcmoo fan for how sensitive they can be, but hearing all the shit the past two days.   I dread to think the shit rated would have said to them.
The big guy at top is literally Vince Mcmahon. He protects them
Rated should learn from other influencers who fucked up and just fade into irrelevancy.   Thankfully he lives in the UK and probably got more severe things coming his way than the wrath of the internet....
This sounds like some people on this reddit.   if people know who got Ther favorit streamer banned. They harassed players every chance they get.  Funny he turns out to be just like the people he complain about.
For real. I have a strong suspicion that particular tactic wasn't unique to Rated.
Apparently Kylie mentioned that one of the Admins she had reported Rated to was recently outed as a transphobe themself. No idea who that Admin was, but it's an indicator that people on the inside and at the top were enabling abuse and harrassment.
Thats why the staff introduced anonymous reports, sure, a report might lead to a justified ban, but in most cases they will be back and even if not "the boys" will know.  Still, people get given a reason for the ban, and unless they have been going demon mode thy can deduct who reported them.  TLDR: the reason characters dont snitch on eachother IC to the cops is the same as why players dont snitch on eachothers to staff. The cost/benefit calculation just doesnt make sense.
"Obviously the problems with NoPixel are systemic, and are not about a few bad apples."  THIS. its disgusting how alot of people are trying to portray themselves as "allies" when the harassment has been going on forever and they've never had the backbone to do/say anything. Admins and Rprs
This is definitely a NoPixel problem.
at this point not having a no retaliation policy and letting people find out the reporter is probably the point.   no dont report the money makers infact get harassed go offline leave, [Low tier god quote that the community we harvested in chat will gladly say to you]  its is a system problem cause anyone in any power of at least an admin could easily stop it.
Which tells me whatever he did was worse than his usual antics. Clearly the bar for harassment on nopixel is too high if you’re close to the owner.
She also said that she made those reports, or specific reports in earlier 2.0 to an individual that no longer is a part of staff and was removed as she put it "because he had his own issues". Unsure the context of that or who it is but the insinuation was that she's unsure if the reports she made were even passed on to the rest of management or just ignored and hidden by that individual
yep, my last few posts have been about this and how CG actively pushed (and management bent over backwards) to get special treatment. When you create a feeling that a group is untouchable, not only do people feel like they can't come forward with what they have to deal with, it makes members of that group feel enabled to continually push the line.   It's only when it goes so far past the line that it becomes a brand risk that anything is done. Anything less is brushed under the carpet and makes people feel like it's pointless coming forward thus making the people with power feel even more protected.
Considering the preferential treatment large streamers enjoy is the server owners idea, without him fundamentally altering his business strategy refreshing staff positions won't do much.  Admins won't push initiatives that go against his wishes.
Ramee has had the tab open on player reports before on stream. How can you fight that.
Remember when Ramee went on an OOC rant about him and Penta got banned for responding by calling him a dickhead. Nopixel wants you to just shut up and take it in silence.
Makes the server a hell hole for everyone but a select few. Makes me wonder if this is going to change or something to protect people that report.
Alluded, but yeah. When you start reporting people, they start reporting you. It sucks, because retaliation shouldn't be a thing, but it is, and companies have to take specific steps to even pretend to mitigate it.
Thats my OG.
Was this recently?
There are rules against harassing other players, that is one of the big issues here. The rules don't apply to CG.
Yeah I never quite understood why that got as much attention as it did until you posted this.
I have never reported him. Unsure whether I can discuss it in the other direction now he's gone gone so I'll refrain, but it was hilarious.
It’s been stated so many times now, like there’s a list of cops that for some reason were target. They could have not interact at all with the cg and yet cg would talk to hc about them. Like this person should be demoted  or the only reason why so and so got rank was because they are around all the time. Idk, I just hope things change and cg really does some looking in at their own behavior
I think it just makes you think twice about CG in general. The other members may not have sexually harassed anyone, but they have harassed players openly before on the server. Causing a toxic culture, chat hopping, etc.   Any regular player not receiving the same level of special treatment would have already caught a permaban or two just from the amount of points they've racked up. They shouldn't be exempt.
and that is fair, I don't expect everyone to like my character or myself. I try to be respectful of others and their RP and that is all I really ask for in return.
It’s always been fascinating how people weaponize their bans against others. Some do it to get anger at admins, some talk about the situation and allude to who the reporter could be (letting chats go after them), some use things IC and OOC personally against the reporter, and then some use a good variety of the strategies combined. You take all of that and then also that the worst offenders often get little punishment even when found guilty and it’s no wonder people don’t report things.  Edit to add:  Evees second tweet: https://twitter.com/EveeTTV/status/1644118521767501824  And Kylie on a former admin (vod talks about other things too): https://clips.twitch.tv/TiredMagnificentHareGivePLZ-jMEZlNFv9CQF7t_x
Ramee has pulled up reports against him on stream and laughed about them and shit on the people reporting him.
[Here is the clip where she mentioned this.](https://www.twitch.tv/kyliebitkin/clip/TiredMagnificentHareGivePLZ-jMEZlNFv9CQF7t_x)
Is this someone that is still a current admin or one that has been ejected?
No she said a prior admin who used to be around. She would report what rated did and this person was the one to kinda handle it.
I know, I'm saying this is something he needs to do. From a business perspective, these things harm his business and this should be a wakeup call
Considering that staff was very open about how CG got special treatment and that they would not be punished to the same degree as normal players, you can't fight that. That's the problem.  Management / owner basically created a playground for this group to openly harass players they have disagreements with during role play, and then for someone like Rated to abuse that influence to sexually harass and do whatever depraved shit he had going on for years with people being too afraid to fight back.
He projected hard, for a long time he would say "I have so many reports against me" then when it leaked all the reports where him reporting other people. lol
That was so fucked up! No way it was an accident, it was intentional, he knows his audience..
yes just before 2.0 launch. He texted him IC about it
If you didn't notice that one it took for Suarez to become a server meme and for remdogg to i feel completely take his foot off the gas for them to back off him.  But before then his name was muck and he literally was the subject of a impromtu OOC meeting in the captains office with Baas and CG.
Hey   I hope you're good.   It wasn't anything personal. Wether I'm a fan or not you don't deserve hate and civilian RP will always be better than gang rp so at least You're in that bracket.   Hopefully this ban makes your time on the server more enjoyable:)
Wait non-admins can see the reports?!
I know. I was being cheeky and implying the other likely guilty parties.
Pezz? He's the only one recently that went from admin to permabanned in a span of a few months.
Yes, it was a former admin, I should have specified, although I did say "was". Not sure why you started the reply with 'No' though.
We can only hope. Considering the language he's been using in some of his public statements, about legal action, hopefully this will end up being a wake up call that allowing obvious problems to persist can turn into much larger catastrophes.
This is why I was so angry at CG announcement yesterday that they stayed silent and complacent when all this shit was going down. Anyone who tried in any capacity to protect or soften the blow against Rated needs to be shamed and shunned just as much as Rated is.
Dude needs to go back up to paleto bay area when he was a nobody on NP and try to create RP with the many ppl that still frequent the area..... on a new character.
Penta really helped out Suarez by turning him into a server meme. He saw CG OOC attacking him from miles away
It was noticed, like there are reasons shift 2 has been down bad. Cops had to be door mats
You are fine, I get that my character is polarizing, and quite a bit of that comes from how I am due to being autistic and stuff from my past. I try my best to fit into situations well and sometimes it just doesn't work.  I am slowly getting there. This situation made me lose quite a bit of my enjoyment of RP and having to deal with chat hoppers/shitty DMs from people has made me severely question if I want to continue streaming at all. I ended up taking an LOA from doctor and paleto pets on Sophia and from EMS on my other character because of this. Also is one of the major reasons I didn't have Sophia didn't run for mayor this term.
They could see the reports against them, yes. Not against others.
From the way she said it, it sounded like the reports were things she made to person back in 2.0. Was he an admin  back when she shotguned Randy in the back? It's possible she could have been talking about reports made in early 3.0, the statement was fairly vague but seem to be in reference to things that happened in 2.0.  It's also possible it was someone who didn't openly play on the server, so we wouldn't really know their names or when they come and go from being staff.
Also Blau was an admin for some time but seems unlikely it's him. I think she's talking about something before 3.0 maybe?
I hope so. Rated was always going to be a shitty person, he showed it time and time again. But removing him earlier would have saved so much hurt for a lot of people. I hope he learns from it
no comment = protection ?????
So, I don't watch Ramee, but, weren't people pretty happy with him in 2.0 since he basically is a nobody (as most people were) so he was rping more. Kinda crazy to think that if he just distanced himself he could manage it
It's so crazy to me that you can see the report being made against you and the person making it. No wonder people are so hesitant to report others.
No Pez was a more recent admin. He came in the same time as Curvy, which was after Nakkida had been made admin but before Saab was. This was all well after the shotgun incident.
If it's 2.0 probably Coop
I generally enjoy CG-less Ramee, he doesnt have as much of a "Real Ego". He tends to RP and is fun to hear on other people's streams. (Im speaking mainly about Conan)    But I also dont watch many people who do Serious RP and mainly enjoy Spaceboy and Bananaduck and prefer the sbs side.
Correct, him and Shotz were basically nobody and knew nothing of each other, i watched shotz a few times in the early days and he would chill at paleto gas station and RP with car people, and they would zoom around a bit and work as mechanics.  I remember Ramee doing his paleto arc from a cop i watched a lot back then and he was so damn happy there were calls on the north side of the island, when caught he was always happy OOC (in character mad but you could hear him giggling ) and would shoot the shit with the police involved... keep in mind this is like an about40-60 slot server back then.
I think they have implemented anonymous reports now, but I could be wrong. But it’s also not hard to know exactly who reported even with anonymous reports if it’s for a specific incident
The way she said it made me think the staff member who left also was a dirtbag and that's why they may not have done anything. Maybe that's not how she meant it though.  She's referenced Coop in a positive light even recently I feel like, so I find it hard to believe it would have been him.
Doubt it. Used to watch him a lot and I can't think of a single incident for me to think that. People usually out themselves in hindsight but I'm coming up empty.
I'm not sure...Coop didn't exactly seem like a good guy towards the end of 2.0
He was one of the guys that would get a 100 bomb from zb and enabled esb abit
Accepting huge sub bombs from ZB doesnt mean he is transphobic
lmao says sorry then blocks like thats gonna help. Wtf
A lot of people owe her an apology. Lyndi included, The amount of shade she threw and subtweets after the first screenshots Megski tweeted out was disgusting.  The big man especially owes her an apology for going off on stream as well.     The way people reacted to her coming out with her story is a great example of why women are so scared to come forward with shit against larger streamers/figures.
Good for her. Holy shit this dude could not do a better job painting himself as the evil asshole he is if he tried.
Not wanting to break Reddit rules or anything, but as someone who has been through similar IRL things, the last thing I wanted was them messaging me. Go away. Leave me alone. Change your behaviour for the future people you interact with. Don’t include me in it. Hard enough trying to move on and heal without them popping up with an ‘apology’
Lol.  What a fucking asshole.
"I'm so sorry I'm not going to give you a chance to respond and risk taking responsibility for my actions byeeee."  That's embarrassing.
Of course, there is that one asshole from YouTube in there calling her a clout chaser...
Holy shit, Rated, dude, erase yourself, GTFO here. No one wants you around.  Leave, stop bothering women.
Guy but he said “I am not an evil person”
Is it just me or is there a new person every hour?
I doubt she will get apologies from certain people who didn't believe her but she definitely deserves them.
I think damn near everybody owes her an apology, tbh
And the CG subreddit is already running defence for Rated, disgusting
Shameless beta behavior
This is a very common tactic by narcissists. He didn’t apologize because he was sorry. He’s losing control of everything right now so he’s trying to reel her back in so he can control her. Yes, it sounds ridiculous that you’d block someone you’re trying to regain control of if you haven’t witnessed how these relationships work, but it does work.
Hell, include this subreddit & lsf too. She got crucified by the public because she also was not a perfect victim in the situation.   "they were just teenagers saying dumb shit"   "it happened so long ago"   "we all said dumb shit when we were that age"
Couldn’t agree more
Lyndi was a victim too, while I’d assume she probably will/has apologise, don’t villainize her when clearly he still had his grasp on her
does rated being exposed for being a sex pest suddenly make everything she said and did in those conversations irrelevant? she was just as much of a toxic person in those DMs as rated was, regardless of what occurred with other women.
I still don't think her story was bs, so I'm not apologizing for anything. Just because it was revealed that rated actually did fucked shit that doesn't mean her story was valid.
No he specifically said he’s not evil
It wasn't a real apology if you just sent a message then blocked them.
Just wanted to say hope whatever happened to you IRL is OK now and you have recovered from it. ❤️
“I’m not an evil person…I’m a super evil person!”
It’s vile the amount of abuse she was receiving. I had to take a break from here as I knew if I commented my mind (in reply to all the horrible comments about her) I’d get banned
I wish I could say I was surprised but that sub was pure CG cope from the moment it was founded.
Yeah I just had a wee peak. I’m not wasting my breath - apparently we’re just as bad as Rated himself. Lol
She was and I’m not saying she’s anywhere near the same level at all. But at the very least she owes her an apology and I’m sure she’ll do the right thing.    she was very outspoken with defending him on multiple occasions including during the things he said about Carmella/Carmen. https://www.twitch.tv/lyndi/clip/SparklyOddCurryTebowing-RA2rVpvXIc80DLtK?filter=clips&range=all&sort=time
And we all know that if someone says something on the internet it’s true and real!
Exactly. Maybe she needed an apology from him (all people are different and heal differently!!!) but the immediate block just shows that he doesn’t care. He isn’t even up for any dialog - he just wants a ‘see, I said sorry!’ gotcha moment
Oh thank you 🥺💖  I appreciate it. I’ve somewhat recovered. I have C-PTSD and still see one of my abusers on the daily, another two are related to me, one lives in my village etc. But I’m doing a lot better than the last few years 😅😅
Some days it's very tempting to go ahead and eat a ban because of some of the things ppl say and defending here ngl. Being skeptical and wanting proof is one thing, but man. No wonder she didn't speak up for so long.  I feel the same with the Vivian situation and the abuse she received and still is. Ppl are acting like she killed somebody, it's crazy
Have you considered that maybe she was lied to and gaslit? This kind of stuff is going to traumatize Lyndi because I genuinely believe deep down she does want to empower women but was lied to and deceived by someone that appears to be a manipulative abusive person.
Does she have every right to respond and say what he did was F up to him? Of course she does.   All Rated had to do was take w/e she was going to say( if she wanted to respond in the 1st place) on the chin and leave it like that.  But now him blocking her and not giving her the opportunity to say her piece and maybe put closure for her shows that Rated doesn't care and is just for show to make him look like he's apologetic ( his apology yt vid just now) but in reality doesn't want the smoke to actually be the one responsible for the horrible actions he caused
I think now that she’s able to be her own person she’ll do the right thing like I said in the previous comment. I think it’s safe to also assume he deceived a lot of people close to him and weaponized their position in the community/streaming world to silence and scare victims from speaking out and these are just two examples. As a viewer the signs were there but any time someone said anything remotely negative about him they’d be banned from both communities.   Again this all shouldn’t be about her or any one person besides rated but I do feel bad for megski and other victims of his who got so much hate and I hope they get vindication.
yeah sounds reasonable, I just felt it was unjustifiable to say she owes an apology when they both were victims of the same person you know? should unify and talk and express frustrations, not divide and isolate people

Context: BBMC, taking advantage of how downbad the UPD is, has jokingly started offering people the opportunity to "try out" for a chance to be a hangaround by completing the 100k Hangaround Challenge. Finn made Dupont cry yesterday in the cells when he suggested she could be a BBMC cadet if the PD kicked her. Cute shitlording with shift 3.
_A lot_ of cops are going to get let go in about three weeks and inevitably find themselves in various gangs.
this is exactly what i suggest gangs do your gonna have a lot of officers out on there ass questioning there self worth with how shit the shake up has been handled, any gang worth there rp salt should want some of those former officers epically bbmc sense as fair as healthy support nets go there one of the best in the city right now
didn't they invite the upd like the first day?
lol sweets was interviewing malarkey the other day and asked "what do you plan to do if you don't get hired" and he said "I'm gonna do my first s+"

I can't believe Osvaldo the politically motivated terrorist would do this.
How could the Simones do this?
Pred one man'ed and hijacked the situation. Everyone just followed his order. Absolute chaos but A beautiful shitshow
Cool girls don't look at explosions!
Political terrorism
>Pred one man'ed and hijacked the situation. Everyone just followed his order.   Makes me laugh seeing people blame Pred for stuff when he's one of the lowest ranking officers at the scene. What's the point of the others having higher ranks if they aren't gonna use them?
Pred's gonna be Pred, I am more surprised none of the other officers established comms with Ray lol. They just stood there and watched local cars run into the blimp.     They needed 1 cop next to Ray to constantly give each other status updates and permit hovering and things like that.
Ranks almost never matter when it comes to leading a scene. Whoever is leading the scene leads the scene. Every command member delegates decisions to the person leading the scene because no one wants to be the person that is scene as taking over another person's scene.
Lol that chat is... Just wow.
Did he seriously apologize to CG before he apologized to the victims? Or did I mistake that?
“I’m sorry if I made you feel…” literally every person that doesn’t truly understand what they did was wrong starts off with this weak ass apology.
here's his ["apology"](https://streamable.com/8k1omu) for anyone that doesn't wanna use facebook
Even his apology is toxic. dude tried to paint Evee as a liar, and made her a target for his toxic community.
he literally has his fans admitting to doing what he did to people in their pasts. people are so desperate to defend these men its sickening
His community still supporting him is crazy but expected
At this point kyle’s take is the best. Dude was and is always going to be a scumbag and the less he is talked about the better  we are
Seems he is a good role player after all - he’s managing to convince people he’s genuinely sorry!
"I just have very toxic traits..."  Well pack it up boys, he's obviously reformed. ^(/s)
manipulative
why is he acting like it was just one mistake ? He's been a horrible person for years and he's only sorry because he got exposed.
"I'm not evil."   "I know my truth."   "I know I haven't done anything so fucking bad to deserve this severe of a reaction."      Dude has been denying knowledge of anything over the last two days despite CG and NP management telling him exactly why they parted ways and banned him.   He has been incredibly toxic to so many fellow streamers and fellow role players, Kyliebitkin just now has come forward saying that Rated was incredibly toxic towards her because she was a trans women and stated that he hated her for no real reason in rp as it was all fueled by his ooc opinion on her. As well as the numerous other women that have come forward.      The fact this dude is going live and "clearing up" the discord screenshots where he deletes his comments to people (which itself gives you icky vibes) where he is very obviously using women for his own needs.      The way that he sits there trying to be a victim with that fake voice he puts on where he talks nothing about what he actually did but wants everyone to give him sympathy for his sudden mental health issues that he has. Meanwhile he used several women for their bodies because they are "cam girls" and then also spent most of his existence on NP making women feel uncomfortable, which ive witnessed live on many different streaming perspectives. Today Kylie came forward and spoke about how she was persecuted by Rated and others to the point she wanted to take her own life in the past.      You don't get to be the biggest c\*nt to so many people around you and then ask for forgiveness when you for the last couple days and years have seen no issue with your actions till you have received this push back. Rated should definitely get some help but i don't wish him any further success, hes made his bag off of his years of toxicity, if he had any empathy within him he'd vacate the streaming area and allow women he hurt to thrive without his presence.
Dude goes on stream to make a press announcement instead of reaching out to the people he hurt to tell them directly.
I'm not sure he has the skill to completely fake an apology, it's so weak that I think he was trying to be genuine, but he genuinely doesn't see or know how bad anything he has ever done was or not, so it's hard for him to empathize for a proper apology. So he's sort of just ignorant of himself and his actions and doesn't see it. Maybe all the years of babying really did warp his mind, or he's just like that. The only thing he understands is that he is in trouble, like how a child feels bad and they know they did wrong, but they may not actually feel bad for the actual reason it's wrong alone, since they simply don't comprehend it. I'm not defending him, I actually think he's dumb or sheltered or something.
My man really stated he wished he had been closer to CG and the people like that would have stopped his BS.  Delusional.  Dude deserves everything he gets from this.  There were so many opportunities to be better or to genuinely redeem himself but does nothing until exposed and even then, constantly says he doesn't get it, it wasn't that bad, etc.  It's sickening that people were exposed to him for so long out of fear of retaliation and it's sickening the people that were around him and enabling him and not pulling him aside to get him to stop.  I genuinely feel gross listening to his "apology".    edit - added last line.
This MFer apologized to CG before anyone else.... I x'd instantly.
Im sorry but his is the most fakey mcfake fake shit I've heard in a while. This guy attempting to clear his name or actually apologize is so pathetic. He should just go into hiding.   &#x200B;  The scary thing is no one knows him so he could just start anew with a voice changer and be back at it again.
A summary and my opinion for what its worth (nothing)...            \-Rehearsed apologies that were repeated multiple times which didn't really specify what he was actually apologising for. (Not saying it was disingenuous, but it almost felt like he was apologising for the outcome instead of the actions that led to that outcome at times?)      \-Mentioned his own insecurity (which seemed like a truth).      \-Mentioned his own mental health issues (likely a truth, but felt like it was a subtle excuse).      \-Specifically dismissed what one person had claimed but nothing else (probably a truth).      \-He momentarily mentioned being abusive towards one person in particular but quickly moved away from it (this is almost certainly where all the substance for the ban stems from, but we kind of already knew that).      \-Spent a lot of time talking about being toxic (In my opinion he did this to divert attention away from the allegations of abusive behaviour. "Toxicity" just seems more general and more forgivable.)      \-Dismissed allegations of sexual assault, rape, assault etc (probably a truth, you have to actually leave your house and meet people to perform such acts).      \-Offered to help any victim (Not sure what help he believes he could offer or why he thought this was a good idea to say at all).      \-Said the server owner was kind of like a Father figure to him? (What??)      \-Said he was a bad friend to the CG guys because of his insecurities and secrecy. (Probably a truth, but more focused on what he has personally lost as opposed to the damage he has done.)            My thought is, the type of shit he said previously when he was younger, that we have already seen, is sustained behaviour and he has continued to act in the same way since towards Lyndi. Difference being now, he is an adult, he should absolutely know better and she probably didn't act in the same way as the other young lady did. Basically the benefit of the doubt given previously is out the window now.
This dudes a fuckin tool. Smh
This apology actually makes it sound worse.
I listened to it for about 5 minutes then i turned it off, you can tell this guy has some serious self esteem issues and need some serious time offline with a therapist working through his issues.. Delete everything you have that connects you to the internet, and put some serious time into fixing yourself...      It's to late for apologies, take the consequences and own up to your mistakes.. Ain't no one else fault but your own Rated..
The worst part is how he thinks people that have came out and have been affected by him to reach out to HIM instead of him reaching out to THEM to apologize or talk about it. Putting the  notion on the victims to have to reach out for something  is so messed up.
Seems he’s more apologetic towards his boys and messing up their brand, rather than the victims that he abused.
It is insanely narcissistic to think he is the one who needs to help the people he hurt.  He should just go away for a bit and work on himself.  No need to help anyone Rated.
The amount of people that left comments on that stream brushing this off as an "oopsie" is mind boggling and for me terrifying tbh.   What is even more terrifying tho is that most of those people have children!  I don't understand, i won't ever understand how a father of a girl can look at a situation like this and be like "yep, this is fine".  What a sad reality we live in..
"accusations" ....
The only good think about Khaos is that when it happened he did everyone the favor of disappearing from streaming.
Near the end he started a sentence with "I'm even sorry to...... *ugghh* ". I thought he might say Penta or Kylie for a moment in time. I might have actually believed a word out of his mouth if he referenced a single person who he was toxic to AND he hated. It's easy to apologize to someone you loved, it's HARD to apologize to someone you hate.
This reeks of someone seeking absolution from their own guilt. He wants to reach out and help people he’s hurt because he wants them to say “It’s OK,” so he can feel less guilty. This isn’t someone seeking genuine contrition.
You almost wonder if eventually all this "regret" and "remorse" he has is eventually going to turn into anger.  Rated has been in the Rp community for a long time he prob knows a lot of behind the scenes stuff from over the years most people aren't aware of and could start leaking random things that's happened. Could end up being quite a spicy April
Terrible "apology" as expected lol  Also, unfortunately not surprised to see a lot of his fans praising him for this weak attempt and declaring their undying support for an abuser.   Hope he stays banned. The server is better without him.
skip
narcissistic delusional POS, this was the most "I'm not sorry for what I did but sorry you feel this way" apology ever, i stopped watching when he said "i have very toxic traits especially if you don't know me" lmao
Feel like he’s always been a weirdo. If you joined his Discord back in 2.0 days, you’ll remember a NSFW channel he had. There was a nude picture of Curvyllama & an explicit picture of AvaGG. Those pictures were there for a long time until I guess the mods realised the channel was against Discord TOS & deleted that channel. Always found it weird how them pictures were not deleted sooner.
LMAO those Facebook comments "I Knew it wasn't that bad" and "People are way too sensitive".
They dont want your help, you have helped enough bucko
I got the impression watching this that he seems to think is anonymity was more of an issue than the actions he made. Man’s delusional.
Remember This [https://www.twitlonger.com/show/n\_1sr9psr](https://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1sr9psr)  He is still on Np. JustJamieHDG, Northing was done. Cant even remember if ther was a Thread on this reddit about it.  So they must have solid proff of what rated has done is much much worse.  Like the rest of streamer Scums, who have done some fucked up shit. It will blow ower, and people will watch/donate like northing had happen..
The guys a POS but it's crazy his apology was somehow better than Garret caring more about the brand then being more sympathetic to the victims
Narcissists gonna narcissist.   If you've seen one, you've seen them all.
Dude should have left this apology behind the closed doors of tate university. You'd think the pivot into youtube esq content wouldn't have also meant a terrible youtube like apology
If he was innocent, he wouldn't be apologizing about anything. He should be mad. It's pathetic that he waters down the reason why he was banned by his own words "being secretive."   &#x200B;  Also saying the word allegation a lot of times, lil bro isn't sorry at all. Anyway RIPBOZO #PACKWATCH.
this has r.kelly apologizing after the piss tap came out vibes dude is a fucking creepy sociopath whos clearly put his focus out on main with this shit
It's come to my attention allegations have been brought against me  I know it's taken me a long time to respond, but here's my story  From my perspective, I'm exempt from consequences  I thought I'd get away with it, but didn't  So here's my apology  I'm so sorry  Here's a notes app apology  It's come to my attention allegations have been brought against me  I swear to God this is not my fault, it's a big misunderstanding  No one's ever told me I'm abusive and controlling  You sound crazy, no one will believe you  But here's my non-apology  I'm so sorry  You have problems with honesty
he started with "this is interesting" ... not worth my time
Blud said he has mental health issues idk bout u guys but I believe him
All I can hope for him is that he takes it seriously and  gets himself offline and actually gets some help to sort himself out. Maybe then he'll be able to fully understand how damaging and destructive his actions have been. But that's about as much grace as I'm willing to give him.
now he can go back to being friends with KhaosAdam
Just sounds like he is reading up from "How to apologize when you fucked up as an influencer for dummies"  Textbook influencer apology that carries 0 weight.  He didn't give a shit before he was about to lose everything, but now that everything is on the line he cares... funny how that works
Sad thing is he knows what his problems are and is saying he'll get help, but he probably won't. If it takes 2 days for you to be able to identify every single issue you have, you've been ready for this day a lot longer than that and have been practicing. Get help instead of giving lip service.
Honest good faith question because maybe I missed things, was his harassment of women the problem or was it combined with how toxic he was in general? Like if he was just a perve asking every girl for a cam would that have caused this reaction?  I feel like he was really toxic in general to people so i'm just wondering what is the primary cause of the reaction to him that is happening
[removed]
Its not to late verbal abuse is bad very bad but i belive in reform
Apologizing for sliding in dms is crazy
[This person did key points about the stream if you don't want to or didn't watch](https://twitter.com/VALKYCRUNCH/status/1644066437567336452)
Hot take but everyone is not perfect. What he did is such a scumbag move, but still everyone deserve a second chance. Hopefully, he brings awareness to women being abused on a daily basis; donate/help communities, non-profit organizations, therapy, etc.
Other thread got removed, reposting here.  All he's doing is "addressing" the stuff that people tweeted out. Like Evee's Twitter screenshots.  **I'll be editing this as i go through that bullshit.**  "Addressing", but attempting to make it like his ban was about stuff like that.  EDIT:  Bloody hell. Direct quote from him in that video:  > **I know that I just have very toxic traits that, especially if you don't know me and you just see what you see through like the Internet and what I pretty much portray as, it's so toxic and I'm so sorry...**  Ah yes. The "i'm only playing a character" defense. The "once you get to know me I'm not that bad" defense.  Another quote:  > **I wanna help as much as I can in becoming a better person, but also helping anyone who I've ever hurt or made uncomfortable...**  The fuck are you even saying? You wanna help yourself become a better person? He keeps on saying about offering help to anyone in the community. Doesn't get that the best help the "community" could get is to kick him out of it. Still unconsciously speaking like he's in some position of power.  He doesn't realize how many people are outright RELIEVED that he's out. That the genuine, majority reaction to him getting kicked out is just a raw loud RIPBOZO.  I'm not even kidding, some streamers got real fucking emotional, after finally realizing he's gone and they don't have to walk on egg shells anyomore.   Opened up to their viewers about the shit they've been holding down due to this dipshit. Some said they were suicidal and were actually planning how to end their life because the torrent of abuse from his community, along with outright gaslighting, both in words & actions from his Nopixel friends on the server(players and above) that they went through every time Rated and his community got pissy in a situation with them. People avoided interacting with him or even getting into scenarios involving him.  That's how he made people feel on the server alone.  Another quote:  > **Like I saw this one post from Evee and, again I'm not tryna, I really don't wanna turn this into a back & forth, I'm not tryna...**  THEN JUST DON'T BRING THAT SHIT UP ON A LIVESTREAM TO YOUR RABID FANBASE. THE FUCK.  If you really don't wanna start shit, just don't show it.  He says that when he saw the Discord leaks, he "needed to and wanted to address that quickly".  Motherfucker, your "needs and wants" got you into this mess. Step back.  > **Don't send no hate to anyone, no talking shit, no harassment, literally nothing, but...**  Proceeds to bring up a tweet screenshot with no names censored, painting a direct target.  I'm sure the rabid fanbase watching you totally won't descend on the Twitter handle you're showing and start to spam her shit in with tweets in your defense.   You know, like they've been doing during the whole thing.  I'm sure that you talking to your viewers about what she did before she started her streaming career won't be a juicy morsel for your viewers to try to bash her with.  ***It's all loooove.***  He didn't think any of this through and is making it worse by every sentence.  LAST EDIT:  I can't keep watching this. Made it to about 16 minutes of the 29 he streamed this rambling. He didn't think any of this through. He didn't consider what he wants to say, he's rambling in circles.  He keeps saying:   > **I hope I can provide closure and help" and "I'm a very insecure person with a lot of mental health issues. -  and - I'm gonna get help for that**  Really dawg? It's obvious to everyone that you're insecure as shit. It's always been obvious. You just acted in a way to punish people who made you realize that. There's a fuckton of people with various mental issues that aren't fucking assholes.  But yeah, get help.
is it just me or does it sound like he's forcing himself to try and cry, but can't get it out
Hope mods are cross banning everyone in that chat
It's absolutely gross. People saying "I don't care what you did I'll support you anyway"
to be fair they are a chat that will hop dm and harass people hes against and are just as toxic as him.   to find a saint there is finding a needle in a haystack.
I dont even know how to see the chat. I fuckin hate Facebook lol
First one I saw: > Good luck trying to watch CG rob a vault anymore randy was the only one who could do it
I liked the part where he says things would have worked out better for him if he was just a bigger part of CG and more involved
ya clocked that too? its so pathetic lol
CG is the only one that makes him feel like shit so he puts them first
Not surprising from a guy who messaged one of his victims to apologize and then blocked her.
Well you see it was an honor for those women to even have their existence acknowledged by him, it’s not like they could server any benefits to him. But the boys….well they provided a platform for toxicity and profit and he let them down by exposing that.
Yeah he apologized for threatening their brand dude. Didn’t you see the Garrett post from earlier? The brand of CG is what’s really at stake here. Thank god he is remorseful for what he did to them, now we can all move on.
It was pretty clear he wanted to spend more time talking about the actual victims. Nitpicking shit like this really doesn't help at all.
Gaslighting 101  It is YOUR fault for feeling offended or unsafe.
That is called a non apology. "A non-apology apology, sometimes called a backhanded apology, nonpology, or fauxpology, is a statement in the form of an apology that does not express remorse, or assigns fault to those ostensibly receiving the apology. It is common in politics and public relations."
it really is the "if" that is telling they dont care at all
He's over-apologizing to avoid putting the focus on what actually happened. He's apologizing to the "community" and "people he argued with" in the same breath as apologizing to the actual victims.  He will never, ever admit or own up to what he's done.
That title LMAOOOO
Thank you I fucking hate facebook as much as I hate tiktok
"RatedWeinstein" bruh that's some wild shit lol. also he should hide from the internet and fuck off, its the height of shamelessness to have the gall to show your face after this
But he told them not to attack her, so surely his perfectly reasonable fans will listen
Yeah, his fan base is going wild on YouTube. They are trying to say that Penta has done worse stuff then Rated, they are grasping at straws in order to stand by him it’s bad.
On one hand its a bunch of kids that just went through covid and have warped socializing. On the other hand, holy shit just unfollow scumbags and move on. There's always another streamer.
i agree but you had to just put "men" it goes both way most men won't ever speak on it because people will make fun of them.
I actually disagree with this. The less he's talked about, the easier it is for the people who enabled him to hide their complicity and sweep it under the rug.
Got a time stamp for that would love to watch
Underrated W comment of the night.
this is what im confused with becase he was toxic publicly, theres not much to expose when everything was already out there
professional bully  always use the same tactic
Wish Kylie's VODs live-published, I'll watch that when it is. Super brave of her to speak up about stuff like that.
Don't think kylie said the trans part about rated, she doesn't know, she specifically said that he had a grudge ever since that one 2.0 incident and she avoided him as best she could because of it because he couldn't let it go, there was like a 2 month period in the beginning of 3.0 where things were fine, then it went very bad again, so almost 4 years where she just wanted to avoid him at all cost, but of course it wasn't always possible in RP.
I've seen her endure waves braindead morons encouraged from what I assumed was jealousy over being a good shooter, which I have to say is still almost  as pathetic Transphobia. Absolute shit management, including streamers who give off good vibes, have allowed this to happen. If in 5 years of mismanagement it took this long realize that rated shouldn't be apart of the community, they are useless. I started watching nopixel as a rated viewer, and realized that I had zero interest supporting him when he'd have his temper tantrums. I've since become a bald man subber. I hope for happiness for Kylie, she seems cool.
u ate as usual
It's just a classic showing that there was no real self-reflection. He just watched places like reddit, youtube, etc. and absorbed everything being said about him to say "sorry" about it now.
Also the chat was kind of disappointing, with a large portion of both his young female and male fans seemingly still supporting him. Not sure why these people are so revered, this again, as has happened numerous times before, shows that you do NOT know these people, they are not worth your admiration.
Couldn't agree with your assessment more.
aw yes, the classic: "I wish the people I harassed and victimized simply did not say anything to anyone. Or if they did say anything to anyone, they should have said it only to me. Then I could have the power to convince them that what they experienced was not what they experienced, and they would have no one else to confide in to reassert their truthful experience."
"Look, I can help you... But you gotta get on cam for me first -- I mean I'm not evil!" - RatedWeinstein, probably
I mean it’s on brand abuser behavior.
I'd expect him to start throwing others under the bus in an attempt to make himself look better
There was a thread yeah, and at the time HeyOrbz was banned because of the sexual assault stuff but it looks like with Jamie he didn't really suffer any consequences (I can't remember if he ever addressed it or not).
There was a thread on this Subreddit at the time. It was deleted by Mods with the following explanation:   > This is a tricky situation. On one hand, we support victims telling their story and getting the word out. On the other hand, this is starting a witch hunt against the individuals involved. Until further notice we will be removing these types of threads until we have a better understanding of this situation and any future ones.

Andrew Tate University this is all making more sense now.
I dont think they ever stopped being friends….
So you own a company and you just found out one of your managers has been asking his female subordinates for nudes and it has been going on for years.  How would you respond? that isnt something you cant just wag a finger at and ask everyone to move on. I feel like this has nothing to even do with his in game behavior but has to do with the weird situations he put his female peers
What about sexual harassment? Abusing women and using your clout to keep them quiet?  Or being the catalyst for someone being harassed to the point where they considered taking their own life? How about victim blaming while giving a non-apology and playing dumb?   You really think this is just verbal abuse?
I don't think some of them understand the severity of the accusations tbf. Some ppl just live in a bubble and only get information that's fed to them by their streamer or their specific community.
I mean I just clicked the facebook button in the bottom left.
Dude's a straight up sociopath.
hearts in CG streamers chats for the potential income they may lose over this.
Better yet... He somehow tried to victim blame Evee.
To be fair, Penta keeps saying he'll play things and then he doesn't. That's JUST AS BAD. Madge  And he's a fucker. And fat.

It's shockingly not a bunch of kids. These are grown adults, you can see their profile
ya i meant what i said. sorry the shoe fit
I would usually agree with you on this, but the problem is people are going to enable and downplay what he’s done for a few reasons.   One, is the way he has curated his online persona. This makes me believe that he was doing this before he even became popular. Also because of the incident where he was using a fake name to even the people he was “close” with and will most likely never show his face, also seems to reinforce that he is a serial abuser.
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1787207091?t=0h6m6s better version without the censoring
https://youtu.be/FVglWEQ5urs
The VOD won't be published, she was very emotional and doesn't want clip channels to grab it. She also shared some very personal and dark things with her community and I'm not sure she wants that known to the wider community.
She heavily implied it as like she said there was no other reason for him to hate her. And like she said she couldn’t prove anything, yet she got the vibe from him and those similar. but she also mentioned that a certain mod that she reported Rated too did nothing about it and has recently been removed because of his questionable views.
Kylie is genuinely one of the best role players on the server and she’s enabled a lot of people and given safe spaces for those that feel like they aren’t welcome. Not to say anyone should experience what’s she experienced but to see someone as kind and eager to roleplay with anyone like her it’s frustrating to watch.
Hey now, I'm sure he's changed.  Sure he only apologized for being toxic and abusive after he was caught and punished. I'm sure if he was let back in he wouldn't be doing the same exact things in 3-6 months.
It's hardly even worth trying to figure out why his fans still support him. It's actually rare that a fan base ever completely turns on someone they support, like the way every normal person would expect them to. A celebrity could commit murder on a videotape played in court, and their hardcore fans would still act like they're the victims.
That's what I was thinking
God, this thread brings back a lot of betrayed feelings.
Ahh i see.  Its fine  now i guess :)  Thx for the info.
Randy is a business owner here? Isn't he just a peer at a hobby?   I guess the argument then shifts to this being a place of work and the women streamers are being harassed by someone they are forced to interact with and the power dynamics of him being such a large figure in the community.   I'm not saying wag the finger at all, I just think he should have been banned for not treating people like people a long ass time ago. Maybe it took the combination of things to wake up to how shitty of a person he is.
A lot of them are also more than likely pretty young. Don't have very much life experience or any real gauge to how damaging this type of behavior can be on other people. They see it like shouting gamer words in a modern warfare lobby, not understanding why everybody is getting so worked up about it.    Garbage communities like that have no real place on NP.
what are some of the severe accusations i haven't really caught up
Might be in mobile where it doesn't show. At least not for me.
Gilbert Godfried called Penta a fucker and then suddenly he's dead.  Why is no one talking about this!?
He promised to take Trav and Chief catfish noodling and that was 2 years ago. Total Hollywood fake.
He's not fat anymore.  I only watch fat streamers.  I feel lied to.  Where is my apology Penta?
And he can't even be fat anymore! The FUCKER looks healthy. It's bullshit!
Don't forget one ball
[removed]
> you can see their profile  I can't because I'm not going to facebook, let alone a rated stream, but I assume it looks something [like this.](https://i.imgur.com/MyzvK9m.png)
You're probably right that he did all this to other women even before he got popular, but I'm just mainly focused on not letting this happen again. Sure he's gonna gaslight his audience and play the victim no matter what, but I guarantee something similar will happen in the future unless systemic changes are made regarding server culture and favoritism on the server.   Not talking about him allows his enablers to avoid any accountability. Women and other groups are not going to report harassment if they're scared of retaliation from an untouchable group.
I mean I get that, and this is not at all a defense of Rated, but ill just say wanting to remain anonymous online doesn't mean you're an abuser or want to get away with shady shit. Like obviously being anonymous helps enable that behavior but as someone who values their privacy myself I don't like those things being equated. I get its a little different with him since these are people he's supposed to be "close" with, but personally I feel like that's perfectly fine thing to do
Why is all the swearing edited out? This video sucks
Thank you for the info!   I tuned in a bit after I read that comment and realized I missed a lot, so I stopped watching with the intention of checking the full context later. But yeah, the stuff I caught was very heavy. I hope she's doing at least a little better now.
She was talking generally about people, that she can't ever know if that is a reason some people do what they do, and about rated she doesn't know if it played a part, but yes she does know there was a specific reason (the incident) because that's when it started and he couldn't let it go for 4 years. The "ick" vibe she described I understood as simply that she just always got the vibe he hates her and this is a guy she doesn't wanna be around.
Not just that but you also have to realize that a majority of viewers and fans are not basement dwelling redditors like us, and may not be up to speed and date with anything regarding drama, bans etc or for the matter even care about that.
I would consider the people on NP coworkers for sure. It's also more than just the nudes thing. He was cheating on his IRL gf by being pervy online (not a crime I know) but it also seems he was restricting that same IRL gf from interacting with certain people due to his jealousy.   Pure speculation but I'm honestly starting to think that jealousy popped up during the angels meet up and suddenly they became aware of what's been going on then blam everything comes out. Like if he is that jealous and she was around other dudes I could see him getting pissed, her being upset and her other peers being like wtf is going on?
Naw there's some dudes in there that are like 40+. Real names and pfps
Cant be a coincidence
Ricky at 10k, then 11k, then 12k
I think it's cause they're trying to monetize it.
Youtube's been fuckin weird about light profanity lately, demonetising channels for it. People are playing it safe.
It’s YouTube chief, that’s how things be lol
Maybe so but thats how it was implied the way she said it, but none the less it doesn't subtract it from the fact that he was an awful person to her for a long period of time despite whatever dumb reason he summed it up to. He made her feel like nothing for years with absolutely no valid excuse.
To be fair, he's pretty firm in the "I'm not playing Ricky" stance.
moonmoon comeback at 13K,15K, 40K
Still ripping someone's stream and monetizing it is pretty wild. You put effort to censor not your own content just to make profit off of it

It’s effect should be you run slower but any car you drive is slightly heavier so it’s in line with the Peach theme of weighing down every car she’s in.
Anchovies, mayo and peaches.
LOL Raymond will not allow Mayo on a pizza.
It’s effect should be that fire hydrants and light posts don’t stall your car.

Poor dan gets a raft of shit.  I love aaron he is such a good sport :)
Man it’s hilarious but you gotta feel for dan always being a punchline
I expected the excuse he gave Dan but when Stubble pulled up and he asked ifhe wants to ride in front of him i fucking lost it that was so good
Aaron has really embraced Dan's punching bag role
Dan is pretty much getting what Big T went through so hopefully big things ahead for him.
Dan and Ramee (the character) catch so much shit from everyone for just being them.  It’s crazy how much the people behind the characters can take when they get piled on from EVERYBODY in the game.  But their both good at what they are supposed to do.  As much as it pains me to say it, Dan is a pretty damn good cop, and Ramee is somehow I really good crim.
It's his character. He could be more if he wanted, that's just how Dan is though!
Dan knows what he has to do to get a job.
Dan yes, Ramee no. Ramee has gone on to many rants about people ooc. He’s part of the problem as well. He my not be rated bad, but still abuses people.
Dan is definitely a cop.
Here in lies the problem.  He genuinely doesn't believe he did anything wrong.
What does he mean "I dunno what to do"? Be a better person.
Someone on the CG reddit posted this under one of the posts about his community.  "It was fun for a bit! I realized I ignored a lot over the years or just clicked off if I was uncomfortable. Obviously that wasn't the best way to go about it. I enjoyed modding and the community a lot. He wont ever say anything not when he told us this when the girls were taking to twitter...https://imgur.com/a/YHDfk4V Thought yall should know. Support women."
Dude has been given leniency and special privilege on top of making a lot of money, of course he will feel like he didn’t do anything wrong or cant do anything wrong
Not an evil person btw... literally has no empathy for the people hes had impacts on.
"I was just horny and wanted women to expose themselves for me on cam."
Denial first. Next will be anger. Then bargaining. Then depression. And finally he will hit acceptance and maybe actually grow as a person, but I have a feeling he will be stuck on the denial and anger phase for quite a while.
Idk if he is trolling or genuinely doesn’t feel like his actions have an effect on others lol
"i dunno what to do" idk bro maybe be a better person?
Wowwwwww
Not a bad person btw.
He knows he’s done some bad shit but not that bad? At least apologize bro lol
This just shows how little responsibility he has ever taken in his life.  There is a saying that goes something like : If you stand in shit to your neck, don't nod...   Something he clearly never learned....
How good is his weed that he smoked away all his memories
If that's the case then he should just come clean with everything.
even the mods know he should understand what he did wrong lol why cant he
Anyone that works with him moving forward can't claim any ignorance for who exactly they are working with. Mods, community volunteers. By continuing to engage and work with this person you are knowingly complicit and therefore endorse this person
The fact he's still in denial is laughable at this point. What a horrible human he is and I say 'human' lightly.
He 100% knows he has done bad things but probably doesn't realise how bad they are or is turning a blind eye for the sake of protecting what he has left in his career.  Glad people finally see the horrible things he said/did over the past 5 years. Hopefully the people he effected can recover and come back even better and stronger than they were before, meanwhile he gets what he deserves.      Another question is what were his old mod group, that he was wary of before, were saying about him to be honest.
I just want to get things straight. So he pretty much was trying to hook up with several women in the np player community, at the same time, and was pretty much on a search for nudes and seeing how for they would go? All this while he was dating 2 women within the community, at the same time, where both respective relationships had their own slew of issues alone. The women also felt pressure knowing what his status was for the server, and were scared to know what could happen to respond in the wrong way.   It's awful, but I honestly did speculate even worse, something physical perhaps, but I also think the deleted DMs must have been quite the sight to drive this all home. I watched him harassing Lyndi in her chat on a yt video, and the dude seems to be quite the sperg, specially if he was sober, which is somehow worse. I don't know how that went under the radar. This is not like an individual who was just trying to get to know \*one\* person and it doesn't go a their way, so they move on because they respect it's not like that for the other individual, that's healthy and what normal people do. This is just trashy, desperate, and expoitative behavior for the sake of himself. He also practically had power over them like how a boss would at a job, and used that fact to his benefit, which is no secret since he would never shut up about how he and his group were bigger than others. Dude was literally trying to minmax women like everything else he seems to do in his life, holy shit.
Wonder how deep he is gonna continue to dig his hole
SurprisedPikachu
oh whatever you pissbaby
oof
This guy verbally abused people in a video game on the daily and used them as props to his streaming "content" for years. The fact that he doesn't realize he did something wrong isn't surprising in the least.
“Yeah I’ve done shit things but not *that shit* to deserve to be punished!”
If he actually sees no wrong in what he is/was doing, he should consider therapy.  He can afford a good therapist to talk with, and dive deeper into what he was doing, and better himself for it.  He is still young, so he might not have that foresight yet, but he can change for the better.
damn  no guilt whatsoever in that skull
i only asked women to give me private cam shows. come on, mods, what gives?
Human filth.
Poor Lyndi if [this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jQHJZrECHV0&feature=youtu.be) was in public, what happened in private
He will never acknowledge or admit to any wrongdoing. Good riddance.
Sociopath.
All I can think of is "We're just normal men. We're just innocent men"
Still in full-blown denial lmao
The man literally shutdown any communication in his discord. He knows he fucked up.
That's going to be a yikes from me dawg
I am gonna judge this statement as, he doesn't see women as humans or equal and thus he feels like he has done very little to garner such hate.
For a person to not know his own actions and interactions with women and maybe men at times and not finding it wrong in any sense or shape is more worrying than a guy knowing what he did and still trying to gaslight... I'm hoping for the latter than the former mostly because this guy might need more help if he doesn't even know what's wrong.
Welp, here's a pretty big indicator that this garbage human isn't going to adjust his behavior.
Here's the thing.  If CG as a whole, who doesn't exactly have the best track record of treating people well and has protected toxic people in the past, says that what happened was even too much for them, then it's not just some little thing.  He knows what it is but he just doesn't think it's bad that he did them.
Guy needs to take a break and try to get help so he understands what he has done is wrong. If he genuinely thinks he hasn’t done anything wrong he needs speak out and show them discord dms
after all adam and rated were best friends so it isnt surprising heard his name was neil but not sure how accurate that is tho it’s a yikes him still thinking he didn’t do anything wrong andhsi hardcore fans still defend this guy
Ah yes. The classic "I didn't do anything wrong" response lol. This reaction right here just tells me that he'll never apologize and grow as a person because he is incapable of understanding his actions and why they are problematic.
He did some nasty stuff huh?  I was here hoping it was all Ramee's 5Head plan to finally get Rated out of CG.
I have not been following this much.   Has he done anything since the Xgirlfriend thing? If so what?
Rated is a pretty straight forward person and if he really thought he did something as wrong as people are trying to proclaim then he would just say it. To be honest there’s been no evidence that has come out up to this point that says he deserves this reaction he’s getting.
"So bad" bro really thinks what he did wasn't as serious as it is 💀
i wish he get sued ,and get a reality check
I used to be a sub, but stopped about a year ago, something just always off about him. Wouldn’t have thought it was this bad though.
Worst thing is he's already rich. Even if he loses this hobby (probably not a job after the fb contract and all these years of paid subs), he already have his life made. So I don't know why people would stick around him.
I haven't followed this closely, has there been a bomb dropped or is it a scatter shot of smaller offenses?
If he doesn't believe he did anything wrong, why did he insta delete the messages?  He knows what he was doing was wrong.  He just thought that he was too big for the rules to apply to him.
He's a fucking joke. Look at him acting like his is the victim. Same shit he did when things didn't go his way in RP. He's like a spineless little boy incapable of realising his actions have consequences.
The guy is LITERALLY in the denial stage of grief over losing everything in his entire life. His friends, his job, the thing he spent 7 years doing. All of it.
He actually might genuinely believe he did nothing wrong because people have enabled him and what he did for so long.
First off, I don't know Rated. at all. i've seen his characters from other people's streams, and that's it. I don't watch his stream, i certainly 100% don't know the person.  That said, as a general rule, men who are rapists, abusers, predators, etc tend to believe that all men are like this, just others are better at hiding it/getting away with it. So they often are righteously angry when they get caught - they believe they are doing no different than every single other man out there, they just were the "unlucky" ones who got caught or are being singled out for persecution.  It's why I'm always leery of the Dads who give their daughters "All men are pigs and they only want to get into your pants and they don't care if they hurt you" kind of speeches. It's not true for all men, but i promise you, those Dads know it was true for them, and they assume it's how all men are.   And that's why so many men who are awful/hurtful to women don't believe they're doing anything wrong. they 100% believe all men are exactly like them.
Actual sociopath, holy shit.
So as of right now he asked for women to post nudes in discord correct? Was there anything else?
[removed]
Didnt think my comments would end up here. I haven’t modded for about a year for personal reasons not related but I was often involved with the discord and community events and modding. I know ignored a lot and would like to apologize for not doing anything by being an enabler. I support women and all the victims.
Think you meant coworkers, where he has to shit on the owners chest to get in any real trouble.
FYI these are the five stages of grief. Often wrongly used to describe other things, and are wrongly used to describe grief in many cases too; because first they're not linear, second, they're interchangeable, and third they were actually originally coined to describe the five stages for people who are dying, not grieving. They can also manifest themselves in many different forms, and alternate quickly between phases. It is a lot more complicated than just those 'five stages'. I have a minor in Psychology.  Nope, 'Rated' is just an (*insert whatever word you see fit here*). My heart goes out to all his victims.
Sadly, If the internet has taught me anything over the last few years, it's that people never accept fault. They either double down or quietly pretend nothing happened. Hell sometimes they end more successful than before.
CG are already casting themselves as the real victims of all this, so take a guess.
Guys he’s not evil I swear
Some people have no self awareness man
unfortunately, getting to therapy (or doing any kind of self-improvement in general) means you have to acknowledge you have some kind of problem that A) needs fixing, and B) you want to fix. i'd be less surprised if he never changed.
not doubting but is their evidence of this being true yet?
[removed]
I don't think it was too much for them. If the dude never got backlash nor banned, and it got brushed under the rug, like how when his toxic relationship getting exposed did, they would still be playing with him and laughing everyday and talking about dumb shit like ordering doordash like before.
Yeah, some of those people on Twitter are really giving me Ryan Haywood flashbacks
>Rated is a pretty straight forward person  Based off of what, exactly?  >and if he really thought he did something as wrong as people are trying to proclaim then he would just say it.   People who do terrible shit very often think they did nothing wrong. His judgment of what he did means absolutely nothing.  >To be honest there’s been no evidence that has come out up to this point that says he deserves this reaction he’s getting.  I've been around this community for a couple years and have always thought he's a piece of shit that doesn't deserve to be on the server for how he treats others. Nothing I've seen has changed my mind.   We also aren't owed everything and what CG and the server admins have been shown is clearly bad enough to completely cut ties. Maybe read between the lines a little bit in addition to all the shit we have been shown.  EDIT: the big boss man just confirmed exactly what I said, what is being shown publicly is not the extent of what he did.  https://i.redd.it/81cq8eyg3jsa1.png
You are part of the problem.
"Hey honey, you wanna have a threesome with your sister? Haha just kidding. *Unless...*"
Because he's a sociopath. He understands that society does not like what he did. But he does not understand why.
This. He sounds like a spoilt brat who has been spoon fed his whole life.
Hes a coward. Idk how mfs still defend this guy
I watch GTARP sometimes but Im not familiar with everyone. What characters did he play?
Nobody thinks they're guilt free if they're deleting messages instantly after sending them lmao
Yea I sincerely believe he actually thinks he didn't do anything wrong. Meanwhile I've been listening to Kylie speak for an hour about years of toxic treatment.
Everyone does what is right in their own eyes.  Evil people don't believe they are evil.
That's such a strange equivalency to make. Dads give their daughter that speech because they were like that themselves? I just flat out disagree. Dads give that speech because they've seen how horny teenagers can behave both boys and girls and how it can get out of hand. If I had kids I would be giving the exact same speech because I've worked in the service industry for a long time and ive seen how predatory men can be so I would be advising them to be cautious, not because I was sexually assaulting women wtf.
Asked for cam shows, nudes, cheated on his 3+ year partner while being manipulative and abusive, even in her chat. Said disgusting things to others. Always said negative things about other streamers even when said streamers helped him in some way, shape or form to the point even CG or even his chat couldn't bother to be with him.  Probably even more that no one but a few people know.     He was a joke of a "man", knew what he was doing.
That is absolutely not what the message says. He literally says he knows he hasn't done anything super bad. Take off your rose tinted glasses.  Maybe we see it from different perspectives.
Why are you trying to defend him? We have more than enough evidence to confidently say that the reaction isn't unfair... Or are you trying to play Devils Advocate for the sake of it?
Hope you're doing okay through this, has to be jarring to be that close then have this dropped on you. ❤️
DARVO seems more Rated's style.
This is the bit that annoys me the most. It’s seems the CG boys only care about the brand and how this person isn’t a good fit for the brand. They couldn’t give a fuck about any victims. They only seem to be distancing themselves because it came out of the woodwork.

Can't argue with that.
This was always what annoyed me. I subbed to him about 4 years ago. When I would watch his streams he would go borderline OOC, get chat riled up, take it to the edge and then pretend that it was just a joke. When I would say something in chat about it people would gang up on me and call me slurs and say things like CG for life.   This is how he lived his life in every way. Take things too far and then when he didn't get the reaction he wanted it would "just be a joke" unless people were open to his "joke" being real. I don't hate the rest of CG, but they didn't help anything by enabling this behavior for years. Especially if they wanted to build this brand.   &#x200B;  In the words of my partner, "Jokes are supposed to be funny"
He spent so much time living in an echo chamber that he tailored around himself to be reality that he’s now scared and startled when the bubble popped and actual reality came flooding in.

Eh, you can think you might get in trouble for something without thinking you did anything wrong.  He might just be that delusional. In the end, it only affects if he can change.  But he still should've been removed regardless.
Was it at the beginning of her stream?
I think there's definitely a way to have conversations about consent and protecting yourself to your daughters without turning into "All boys are sick perverts who will do anything, including coersion and force, to get into your pants at all times"  So can you have thoughtful conversations with your daughter about the realities of dating boys? Sure can, and you should. But many men in real life, and often in the media, the talk turns into weird, hateful "All boys are just itchin' to rape you" kinda nonsense, and you often hear the reasoning "I would know, I was a teenage boy", and yeah, it makes me wonder about those men.
> Dads give that speech because they've seen how horny teenagers can behave both boys and girls and how it can get out of hand.  This 100%. You are a fool to not even consider this.

💜im not the one that needs the support, that is for sure. I dont want to act like i was effected when i never had any type of closeness. But i do appreciate the thought.
I mean yeah they all treat people exactly the same Way as Rated does. The only difference is Rated abused too close to the sun

Once I got a 10 minute timeout in his chat because when he was on AJ in a chase he pitted a car at high speeds then said "what is this bubble" and I said it didn't look like a bubble, it looked like a pit. Apparently any dissent is bannable
Yeah, reality hurts when it hits hard.
> , you can think you might get in trouble for something without thinking you did anything wrong.  like lighting a police station on fire or stealin bread cause inflation
Yea basically the first hour of stream
What are you watching where you hear people say “all boys are just itchin to rape you” often?? 😂
The garbage you're spewing is actually concerning. Like, holy shit dude. No one has said all boys are sick pervs. What the person said, if you learn to read, is that teenage boys are horny as fuck who only want into girls pants - WHICH IS TRUE. Thus, giving you daughter a speech about that and warning her is completely justified.  If you're a girl, I sincerely feel bad, because it's clear to me you've been around the wrong type of guys.  If you're a dude, you're probably the exact type of creepy guy we're talking about.
The way I interpret it is him saying he doesn't get what he did was so bad.
He's trying to play ignorant and manipulate his viewers into standing up for him. Anyone can say "I know I did wrong," but it's the follow-up that is a problem... He knows the punishment fits what he did, he just doesn't want to accept it. So now he's playing the victim and you're helping muddy the waters.  I'm not saying you support him and if the evidence wasn't so overwhelming? I would agree with you, but... There are only so many times you can fall for the crocodile tears after the sun of a bitch bites you.
It's crazy you dont see how this attitude is defending him.

its fucked that you will still see people in all platforms defending him.
This is not a summary since I feel like I can't give a unbiased one at this point.   Here's some snippets or notes I took down.   * They've been friends with Rated for 5 years and they're moving on from him as a group and as a individual. It's a hard thing to do, sometimes you think you know someone and then you don't know them at all. He feels betrayed. * They talked with Rated in private, Rated opted to leave and he needed to figure out things on his own and they don't want to do anything with him. * If there are things coming out on Twitter and Reddit from victims or people who want to have their voice heard, as a CG member and as a person, it's very important to listen to these women and hear their stories and hear where they're coming from. You don't have to believe them or say anything, just take what they're saying and hear them out. * "If there starts to have 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 18, and it gets to a number where it's getting a lot... yeah" (fucking yikes) * They didn't know much about "homeboy", none of them has met him. There's a lot of moving in shadows and secrecy. For 3 years, he told us a fake name, we didn't really know the guy. (I believe the story was that Rated gave them a fake name until they needed his real name to sign the FB contract). * Typically we come to the A and defend our friends and family but yea there's just some things that I can't put my reputation and brand and everything I've worked so hard for 12 years over something so unknown. * A lot of the boys would agree about how when someone is so secretive online, it's always a really weird thing. Like they knew him for 5 years and had no clue what he looks like.  * You were given the world, you were given a life changing opportunity with people you have known for years, and all along you were doing... it doesn't make sense to me, it doesn't make any sense. IDK IDK.

Hate the whole “this is good for our brand” thing.
The fact that "the brand" is mentioned so much more than the women who were victims of Rated.. 🤢🤢🤢
This is the guy who said if you get hate you probably deserve it. Now covering for his brand's ass pretending like they didn't know what was going on.
The most empty of PR statements.
For the love of God won’t people think of the brand!?!
"I think walking away from someone you considered so close to you, and then feeling that betrayal, is like, the worst feeling."  Some, uh, other things come to mind as maybe feeling worse.
They are BSing about them having no idea about how toxic Rated was, he berated people on the server regularly and the boys always had his back.
hearing a-lot of  CG trying to cover their own backs and "the brand" not hearing a-lot of sympathy  or apologies going in the direction of the woman involved in the abuse over the years. They might not of been the ones to start it, but they did a good job in sitting back and watching him mentally torture these women for no reason, in some cases even jumped on the bandwagon. I hope an apology goes their way either publicly or privately.  (Edit)   Just seen theres a part two to this, if CG have a PR team they need to fire them ASAP or get one. The large percentage of what he talks about is just him trying to save the brand that he made and worked so hard for... Then the line  "2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 18, and it gets to a number where it's getting a lot" motherfucker one is enough..
They probably had some idea of what was going on to be honest. Before 3.0, Rated and Ramee situation, probably showed his personality to others quite a bit. Even then they said they didn't know much about him, what he looked like, what was his real name and so on. They probably learned that stuff for the Facebook contract, iirc they mentioned at one point that because he was keeping his personal information as a secret to them he couldn't be in the sponsor deal, like the first GFuel deal they had.      Not to mention his constant shit talk about characters/streamers he didn't like in both of his characters and even in different games. He even started to talk about Ramee/Carmella and Flippy/Claire relationships in an ugly and weird way after the first incident. Also you could tell few months ago Ramee and others started to distance themselves a lot, only makes you wonder how much they knew and/or suspected.
If Rated was doing this for years and years.   NP top dogs and CG knew the behavior...Let's say they started talking down on a female cop on NP and say messed up things but they are are saying in game even though you can tell their OOC feelings were in that rant. NO ONE from CG nor NP said "Hey maybe we shouldn't talk like that even to a person" Both CG and NP are trying to get in front of this because it would effect their bottom line.  Since people are coming out NOW..NOW all of sudden they need to distance themselves.  Moral of the story. When you enable a certain behavior and allow it, don't be surprised that said behavior keeps on happening
The fact that he brought up brands was truly pathetic
They should start having monthly brand meeting to discuss how their behavior could negatively affect the brand. Everyone knows just how important the CG brand is. Hey Guys did I mention that CG is a brand?.
The word 'brand' was mentioned a lot in that clip.  Not once did he think that maybe having a brand within a roleplay server could be a problem.  It's like when it turned out the BBC was protecting people like Jimmy Saville and dozens more abusers, or the slew of victims coming out in the gaming industry, or the massive fallout from the Weinstein scandal in which it turned out Hollywood had systematized sexual abuse: when your main agenda is protecting your brand, people will be hurt and ignored to protect this bigger entity.  This is exactly what happened.  One of the key phrases you hear from CG repeatedly is 'the boys.' Their main prerogative has always been looking out for the boys. And in so doing, many women got hurt.
The CG brand guys, we did it for the brand. The brand is more important than showing any ounce of dignity towards the women affected by their godlike status on the server. The signs were everywhere and defended by them for years. Always remember rule number one of the CG brand, if you get hate, you deserve it.
The self insert RP character who belittled and berated so many of his community member(s) was a brand risk??? Next they will tell me the sky is blue.   How any of them can claim they were blindsided by this is absolutely unreal. Members of this community are renown for how they treat people outside their circle - so much so they are actively avoided.   They do little to zero moderation in their community and allow this behavior. I'm glad this is a wake up call for them but the damage has already been done for years
Every time he mentions the word "brand" I think it devalues whatever other sensible thing he may say.  Maybe it's just a pet peeve of mine.
Multiple truths can exist at once.  CG should have been more proactive in shutting down toxic behavior. AND   CG can be blindsided by the magnitude of the allegations especially considering how secretive Rated was about everything.   They should have done more, but I don’t think it’s fair to discredit their feelings.
Why can't everybody just think of the brand?!    Please be more considerate for their brand.
Not a lot of sympathy for these guys, they were part of some pretty shitty RP towards women on the server that they laughed off as IC when it blatently wasn't. They are not that good of actors. There's probably some discord messages that got hastily deleted when this news broke. Them saying they had no idea is a joke. Only sympathy should be saved for the victims.
It’s pretty clear CG isn’t going to change their behavior. Maybe they’ll be more polite to female cops for a while but they’ll still be posting drama YouTube clips to monetize hate and talking OOC shit on other streamers after a while.   And yeah, none of them have probably done anything as heinous as what rated has done, but their strategic behavior in wielding their clout, connections, and viewer base to attack other streamers for the purposes of giving themselves power, protection from consequences, and money when they spread so much toxicity is a calculated and intentional decision.   The fact is, one of their members used the behavior their group propagates on the server to cover up and protect himself from his private harassments and assaults. They won’t acknowledge this because it acknowledges they were complicit in creating an environment that allowed rated’s actions to thrive, whether they were aware of it or not. Now they will condemn, distance, damage control, and go back to business as normal as soon as possible.
Pretending to be completely unaware of someone's abusive personality and toxic bullying after spending 5 years together is ridiculous. Everyone knew, and they allowed it.  This is insincere damage control spin, 100%.  edit: typo
"Blindsided."
I love the “We didn’t even know his real name!!” Narrative. You spent upwards of 9 hours a day with this person for five years. As if that wouldn’t be more telling than anything else.
I honestly wouldn't be shocked if Rated and the rest of CG boys has some fucked up DM's with each other about female cops on the server. The way Rated talked to them openly on stream and them laughing about it.   Look at every reaction with CG and Lily Pond.
I’m kinda hesitant to believe that his closest mates had *absolutely* no idea about his behavior. Surely they saw signs, given how many people, who weren’t as close to him, aren’t surprised by this.  How much did they ignore and throw a blind-eye to???
Just stop watching any of these fools. this shit don’t matter anyways
"We had to do it." Yeah no shit, I feel like these organisation's that claim to be businesses should act a lot more professional and less like friends, even if they are.  There's a reason there is a degree of seperation in most professional settings, when you recieve a complaint, or even information like this you immediately investigate and don't protect that person until it no longer benefits you to do so.
Garrett is really bad with words. This just came off as protecting the brand rather than doing what's necessary because it's the right thing for the people involved in all this.
Can we all just stop for a moment and consider the real victims in all this: Chang Gang.  Jesus fucking Christ.
These mfs make millions as a group and expect us to feel bad for them? What about the women who are likely going to deal with this shit mentally for likely the rest of their lives? Whenever re-telling, have to go through all that pain and hurt again?    You honestly expect me to feel bad for people who were just as shitty to people on the server and helped Rated go off on people like Angel and Pond? Nah fuck that
I'm still shocked that a guy who was openly toxic towards people was also privately toxic towards people. I mean talk about being blindsided by the whole thing...
"It is what it is..." 🤷
Oh.  Garret is saying in that video that Rated chose to leave and that they had a conversation where Rated was aware of the magnitude of their situation.  But Rated also said he'll go live to "tell his truths" since he's still confused about what he was banned about.  So a bunch of bullshit from everyone involved, as usual with anything CG related.  Garret stretching this all this too much and saying contradictory shit. Classic Garret.
That was fucking horrible. Actually disgusting and yet, fully not surprising coming from Joblessgarrett with his consistently shit takes on CG's toxicity, fuck their brand.  I have 0 empathy for them what so ever.
I honestly can't tell if Garrett has terrible speech or if they really are a bunch of scumbag.   The whole 2,3,4,5,6,12.... statement in the second part clip is another reason why women don't come forward. Pretty much stating, yeah.... don't believe them until we reach double digits of women who are abused by the same person.
this just makes cg look worse, should've said nothing
The classic "It is what it is"

None of what Rated did is at all shocking or surprising. Saying they were blindsided just shows how much shitty behaviour they have excused and participated in themselves over the years.
As much as I want to feel sorry for the rest of those guys then I cant really feel sorry for them, they acted and catered that behavior for years and didn't do anything about until it was brought up by a 3rd party, they known, they just decided that profit was more important that other peoples mental health.  The entire group should have been dealt with years ago!
viewers saw how he was. Are you gonna tell me that their closest friends didn't see the things he did?  They share the blame, dropping him out was one step but they are still accomplices and enablers.
All these guys ALWAYS play the victim so, naturally, here’s ol’ “you deserve hoppers” spinning yarns about protecting their brand from this streamer who they suddenly have no idea about, it’s all “very surprising” and the most empty narcissistic nonsense. At least bring insufferable assholes is brand consistent.
What a fucking clown, "you really think you know someone", if you didn't know rated is a complete douche and asshole the way he treated people on the server than you're an oblivious shell of a person. No no it must be because everyone is just jealous of how popular you guys are, everyone else is the loser.
This is good from the brand now that it’s coming to light, but maybe y’all should try and think about what it says for your brand that you harbored Someone who actively hid their identity from you and was pretty openly a shit person. Wonder how many others will follow him if more people come forward?
I'm curious if at some point Rated goes scorched earth.  He has constantly stated, even today in a discord that he doesn't know what he did that was so bad.  So at some point, with seemingly his personality, he's going to feel slighted and that everyone, to include his gang, is ganging up on him and he kicks down all those "closed doors" in retaliation.
Bad takes when he brought up the brand and marketability. Business and PR 101 you just don’t say that. Lol
Imagine being a grown adult and thinking a fake gang in a video game is your brand. Garrett and everyone in CG should be embarrassed. They’re just grown ass men playing a video game while acting like tough e-gangsters and being super toxic.
They knew about this and did nothing till it all boiled over!!!
They knew what he was. This whole thing just feels like saving face
[removed]
Anyone using Rated's ABUSE allegations to validate their hate towards a groups RP need to get a life. Being toxic in a video game does not equal what Rated is being accused of. Sort out your priorities.
I feel sorry for Garrett especially out of this, the guy does so much behind the scenes for all the CG guys and people not in the gang, to have this come out and feel so betrayed must really suck
Literal trash can humans
What a clown. GUYS THINK ABOUT THE BRAND!
The cg witch hunt is strong but I can’t wait to see the mods do nothing about it lmao  All the cg hate talk but mods are fine with it, go talk shit about any other group you are getting muted/temp banned.
I don’t care much but I’m curious what could a faceless persona like Rated do to piss people off. Did he do something unacceptable in real life? Do people even know him in real life? Did he say some dumb shit over voice chat and now being cancelled for it? We don’t fucking know anything
It's also fucked that this has apparently been an issue for years now, but victims didn't feel comfortable coming forward because of how protected Rated was on NP.  That should be a gigantic red flag for NP that they are doing something wrong.

> Typically we come to the A and defend our friends and family but yea there's just some things that I can't put my reputation and brand and everything I've worked so hard for 12 years over something so unknown.   that makes me feel disgusted like I have more negative thoughts because of that.
[removed]
Time to pretend we didn't enable and hard press damage control.
>"If there starts to have 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 18, and it gets to a number where it's getting a lot... yeah  Jesus Christ how fucking many women were there?? And CG and NP Management had NO IDEA? This is a colossal failure by NP Management in particular
Yeah. That feels a bit icky to me. How about "this is good for being a decent human". I get what they mean, but there was a lot of brand talk where there could be just human feelings talk.  I'll give him benefit of the doubt tho. Regardless of how you feel about CG, this can't be easy for someone like Garrett...
I had the same thoughts when I was taking notes for the video and hated it too, which is why I felt like I couldn't give a unbiased summary. I didn't want to paint him as wanting to protect his brand.
Same, "focus on the good times we had"  It is all about themselves and how this affected them and their brand. What about the victims?
The amusing part for me is they are surprised that a toxic asshole has been outed as being a toxic asshole.
The PR Stunt isn’t working for me at all. Rated clearly was a POS and a compulsive liar, even somewhat to them (regarding his identity and real name). BUT these guys were “Boys”, friends and “family” (as they would always say). They 100% enabled some of his behaviour, I wouldn’t put it past them seeing signs of red flags regarding his treatment of women outside the server, but still allowed that behaviour to continue and didn’t separate themselves from the very first RED flag. They’re only now parting ways because somethings come to light. Sure they might’ve not known the full extent, but when someone seems like their a total POS.. 9/10 it’s usually true.
That stuck out to me too. Made it feel like "Well, we'd love to keep him if it wasn't a brand risk.".
I can see why it might look bad, but i think it's more like you usually don't give up on friends and you do what you can to get them the help they need to become a better person and whatever els might be needed to be done..      So i think it's more so to explain that they weren't really that close as friends, and trying to be there and get him help etc isn't worth what it would cost them..     That's how i interpreted that part, but i also come from a really rough background so to me loyalty is everything so that might be why i took it that way
CG turning this into a CG pity party is the most CG thinking I've ever seen. It would be hilarious if it wasn't so perverse.  Not a moment to think about the women who've gone through so much. Let's focus on the real victims: Chang Gang.
He was choosing his words *very* carefully. He caught himself a couple times just before slipping up and saying more than he was planning to.
There is almost no chance someone from a PR background wrote this. It's filled with self-pity and talk of the brand when a PR person would hammer into his thick skull that this is the time to spout platitudes about helping the victims, etc.
Well it's coming from JoblessGarret who said that if you're getting hate you probably did something to deserve it, so take that for what you will.
Those poor victims hearing him say that shit
There might be no proof of them being aware of sexual harassment claims but every one of those people took part in being openly toxic to fellow players, consistently, over the past 4 years while management protected them from being perma banned like any regular person would have been at least once or twice by now.  I don't see the point in trying to rate bad actions on some type of sliding scale where one is worse than another, providing a shield for players creating lower grade toxicity on this mystical scale of offenses.  If they're doing dumb shit ban their asses just like his.
It's actually embarrassing that they are trying to play into being "blindsighted" by their friend, the same guy who often acts like a pos and just so happened to turn out to be a complete pos... did not see that coming. Like how you gonna act like you didn't know he was a shithead but back him up everytime he was being a shithead.
Yeah the “we had to do it” comment too that was said multiple times was odd too, instead of saying they wanted to
Oh this was enabled long before this. Look at ESB
That's what I've been saying.  This didn't just happen but they laughed it off or whatever.  Now that it's out, everybody wants to scatter but they played a part in this as well.    The real question is what does sloths wife have to say about this?  She had a LOT of opinions on Penta's cop ban but now that it's a "inner circle" member with seemingly a lot worse actions, lets see what she as to say :P
No pixel management look terrible in all of this. They basically protected this group, obviously rated included, and engaged in reprisals against those who would report his bad actions.  This whole thing is a PR stunt on both sides to appear proactive. Especially on nopixels part, they're neck deep in all of this protecting the guy for years while he would go on public toxic rants against other streamers.
is it?
Can we just stop for a moment and focus on CG here guys?! They were the real victims in all this! The brand damage will take years to repair!
I think the Savile comparison of hiding in plain sight and people brushing it off as "run of the mill gamer toxicity" isn't too far off.  Louis Theroux's "Savile" documentary is a very good documentary on it.
> but I don’t think it’s fair to discredit their feelings.  They’ve based their business model on throwing toxic shit at everyone and everything so they can keep their fans overly invested and giving them views, follows, subs, donations, engagement, etc.  I’m sure as fuck going to discredit their feelings when one of their toxic sources turns out to be… super fucking toxic.
Lets not beat around the bush here, CG was proactive in ENABLING toxic behavior.  It just didn't mean *this kind* of toxic behavior. Thats why this kind of reaction is happening.    CG and their fans are SO CLOSE to realizing why so many of us are sick of the majority of their content because while they haven't done what Rated did, they most certainly drove away good people and good RP and made life measurably worse for the people they came up against, both in RP and out of it.   They have positive lights, they're not unfiltered, unmitigated evil and I'll tout their positives as well, but they are a net bad on the server, it just turns out that Rated was actually a net evil and that was beyond the pale.
> CG can be blindsided by the magnitude of the allegations especially considering how secretive Rated was about everything.  So much of what Rated did was in public, cheered on by the rest of his group.
>CG should have been more proactive in shutting down toxic behavior.  They don't, if you get hate you done something wrong and deserve it according to Mr Jobless.
> but I don’t think it’s fair to discredit their feelings.  Reap what you sow? Their entire "brand" is being extremely toxic with everyone they encounter in city and then spending 3 hours being OOC toxic about it afterwards because what goes on behind closed doors is way worse.  Turns out they were right, what's going on behind closed doors is way worse. Unfortunately, it's behind their doors
How can you be proactive in shutting down toxic behavior, when that has been your brand for the past like 2 years? Their formula for growth is to be toxic and then get a pity party together to farm their viewers into thinking they are the victims.  Getting hate = deserved if not CG  "You don't know what's going behind closed doors"  We didn't know how bad it was because he was secretive to US  Listen to the women, you don't have to believe them but when there is 2,4,6,8,10 then you know. So pretty much don't believe women stories until there is at least double digit victims.  The only feelings they care about is how much $$$ is in their pocket.
Glad at least somebody has a good take on this.   At the end of the day, they're people. I have sympathy if they're feeling hurt or blindsided or betrayed because of this situation. It's tough to come up with the right words to describe the emotional whiplash you feel when finding out that someone you have love for has been secretly horrible for years, right under your nose.   While their toxicity definitely makes me feel some type of way, I'm not going to put them all inherently in the same box as someone like Rated. That's just... wrong. If there's anyone else in that group doing shit like that then fuck them too, but what they do on the regular isn't nearly on the same level. Still bad, absolutely, just definitely not the same.   Still, this statement could have been better in a lot of ways. Talk about protecting the victims' privacy, make it clear that what happened was unacceptable, speak more about people and less about brands. It felt more like a PR statement than anything and I think that worked for the tweet but made everything feel a lot less impactful here.   Seems like a missed opportunity to draw a hard line for their community and let them know that certain behaviors are unacceptable no matter who you are or who you support. Whether they like it or not, they're influencers. They influence the people who watch them. Let everyone know that harassment isn't okay and anyone who thinks otherwise needs to get with it or get out of the fucking way.   I hope they all privately apologize to the women they know were involved. They and their communities played a large role in making Rated seem untouchable to the point that the victims' fear of retaliation eclipsed their desire to speak out. Not only CG, admins/owner/everyone on NoPixel needs to do better to keep this from happening again.
Doesn't matter, discord messages will always stay on their servers, if more information comes out that warrant's the rest of the boys having their discord logs checked, the evidence will come out whether they want it to or not.
What doesn't make sense to me is that he said it was information that "just came to light a few days ago", but that isn't true, there were major accusations that came out from 1-2 months ago, and again like you said people have been noticing certain traits in his personality for years now. I get it though it's a "PR statement", but they must think people are REALLY stupid, cuz anyone can spend 5 minutes to know that rated definitely wasn't found out only a "few days ago" lol.
It wasn’t even reactions, they very much joined in on harassing those women. They didn’t just stand and watch, the way they treated Pond, Vale, and Angel - they were very active in the way they talked about and to these women.
It really sounds like what they found out is much worse than what’s been made public so far. None of the allegations we’ve heard have really been surprising at all. The real bombshell is yet to come.
I don't doubt there were signs, but we'd all be lying if we said we haven't had friends do something questionable and let it slide at one point it another. You always try to give the people you love the benefit of the doubt.   Considering they also didn't even know his real name for three years, though, I kinda imagine he was incredibly good at hiding the more "obvious" signs.   CG as a group have a lot of toxicity and shitty behavior, but it's kinda insane to think somebody getting heated over make believe is going to go sexually harass (or worse) women in their free time.  Them being toxic AND them being blindsided by him being a piece of shit can coexist.
Well they have to play naive. They actively participated in a lot of the publicly facing toxicity and harassment of people on the server. You look at Vale, Pond, and Angel and Rated wasn’t targeting them alone, they were very much involved. Perhaps his motives were different (though Evee has mentioned others out there still), but they joined in on a lot of hateful tirades and general toxicity.
I don’t know mad “his closet mates” don’t even know what he looks like after five or six years. He wouldn’t tell them his name for years, and then when he finally did tell them a name it ended up being a lie. It’s not so hard for me to imagine that he just lied to them more. I can concede that they would likely turn a blind eye to him being a jerk, but that’s hardly the same thing as turning a blind eye to sexual misconduct. Which now that this has come out I don’t any of CG has done. They seem to have all rightfully parted ways with him.
They weren't 'closest mates' with Rated. They've never met with Rated in person or know anything about him as a person beyond their interactions on the internet. For years Rated gave them a fake name "Josh" and only finally gave them his real name (I remember K accidentally leaking "Neil" on stream while talking about the Rated vs Ramee drama in 2.0?) when push came to shove over being involved in the groups brand deals. Rated hid his face from even CG for years, and again he only reluctantly showed them so they could identify him before they involved him in brand deals. There was drama at the time (way back in 2.0) between Rated and the rest about leaving him out of brand deals. Then there was drama in late 2.0 between Rated and Ramee about leaking Rated's name among other things. More recently, some in CG were kinda a lil bit irked by Rated meeting up with other streamers IRL but never meeting with the rest of CG. I also vaguely remember Kebun mentioning something a while ago about Rated barely talking in their discord or something to that effect. He was incredibly secretive.
It's just another example of people ignoring the blatant shit in front of them because it's inconvenient because they're either friendly with the guy or because of business. This time it was both.   They had 5 years of red flags of him for some reason treating women like shit and holding grudges with them beyond what's reasonable.
I mean they're close, but Rated is definitely not close like Ramee/K/Taco/Shotz were close.  Even today no one knows what Rated even look like or what his real name is.  Apparently CG themselves were given a fake name for 3 years before they knew his real name.  It wouldn't surprise me if the FB deal never happened, Rated never would have needed to give his real name since Garrett probably negotiated the deal with FB on everyone's behalf and needed real names/IDs to get all the contracts done.
I think this whole thing makes more sense if you think in the terms of 'work colleague' rather than 'closest mates'
I think it’s clear that’s what it was
I don't think he's bad with words. I think he just thinks and says bad things because that's what he believes.
Let’s also not forget that Evee said that there’s someone still out there that’s treated like a god that has said things to her.
Dude I use to like Garret and thought he was really funny. But screw CG, they are selfish and their aim has always been about money. Making connections with OTV streamers, growing their youtube channel (by shitting on cops) and selling out to FB. CG has treated a lot of other RPers on the server like shit over the years. Not saying they know about what rated did or anything like that but I'm not gonna feel sorry for them being in this situation. I'm hoping they learn from this and change their behavior on NP.
Yes, because clearly rated hasn't lied about anything at all and there's no way he would say something to try and save face.
You do know the conversation could of come after the tweet?? Maybe that's why he never went live.
It does make you wonder how much earlier this couldve been caught if 1) his toxic nature was not masked by the constant toxicity from CG over the years and 2) smaller streamers had more confidence in management to be unbiased, which allow them to speak out on these issues.
Yeah this "let's just focus on the future" just doesn't cut it if you harbored and protected someone like Rated for such a long time. You gotta seriously selfreflect.
Dude there’s a difference in being salty in a video game and what rated has done, you can’t say they knew what he was doing behind the scenes to these girls
This is so ridiculous it's hard to even comprehend. There's absolutely no way for them to know that he would be some serial creep because you don't like some of the behaviors he displayed in game. The two aren't connected, at all. A lot of people can be ass holes and they'll never be a sexual predator or vice versa.   Even if they had seen some signs of this, not having any indication of the depths of it is an entirely different scenario. Looking at this in hindsight now and acting like it was so clear that he was doing something you had zero proof of is beyond ridiculous and there was nothing you or anyone would have been able to do about it. You don't just wildly assume someone is harassing people and accuse them of it with no proof.
From the sounds and looks of it CG might have publicly distanced themselves but they don't actually feel that way privately, Garret saying it was Rateds choice to leave and talking about protecting the brand as opposed to absolutely panning this shit head and talking about supporting the victims says a lot imo.
There's nothing wrong with people forming a brand around characters they play in a RP. Just like a YouTube channel based around dungeons and dragons might form a brand around the characters they play for the fictional world they play in. It's justa product like anything else consumers buy.  You're completely distracting from the actual issue, which is not a bunch of grown men role-playing in a video game. It's a bunch of grown men actively harassing coworkers, using their special status to create a hostile work environment for others who have no ability to report it. That doesn't even get into any of the sexual harassment claims of Rated. All of these guys have been openly toxic for most of their time on no pixel.  The fact they're adults raping doesn't prevent 99% of everyone else on NP from acting like a normal human being.
On both sides, tbh. NP and CG.

Instead of being abusive to someone in private, is it really that much better to be  1. instigating your followers, knowing they will hop to other people's channels/social media and send them death threats, rape threats, and other abuse 2. shit talking people to the owner, knowing it can jeopardize their IRL jobs (streaming)  3. intentionally abusive to people, knowing it will cause #1 and #2?  I don't think it is much better.
Ok. Sorted them. How about banning people that are abusers *and* people that are constantly toxic towards other players. That would be nice, right?
They are not sexually abusive but they are abusive towards many people they rp with. They are in a position of power in the server and throw endless torrent of hate towards anyone who slights them and because of their standing in the server they never face any real consequences. What they're doing is not simply being toxic, its mental abuse.
I would respectfully disagree here.The main issue is that he was a secretive predator and a lot of those traits were shown in his "characters". So much so that people like myself stopped watching him as an audience and others distanced themselves from him on the server. It just doesn't add up that the people he spent the majority of his time with were the only ones that didn't see it. Selective blindness is a thing, but that's also a form of enabling, whether you like it or not.
Kind of just sounds like you're trying to make a hierarchy of toxicity were anything below an artificial bar that you set is perfectly fine regardless of how much stress and anxiety having to consistently deal with toxic individuals brings to the server as a whole.  I have a novel concept, how about everyone just treats everyone else like normal human beings? There's plenty of players on the server who have  assholes characters but are actually nice IRL and get along with the people they role play with. Kyle and Penta come to mind. Many of the victims involved in this situation have remarked how they get along quite well with players like Kyle and Penta despite the conflict RP they push.  Maybe there's a reason this group consistently doesn't share that same relationship with other players.
Find it hard to feel bad for the guy who said (paraphrasing) "if you get hate, you deserve it"  The bags under his eyes in this clip are telling though.
> I feel sorry for Garrett especially out of this, the guy does so much behind the scenes for all the CG guys and people not in the gang, to have this come out and feel so betrayed must really suck  Don't think any of this is betrayal, it's very on-brand.   And Garrett has been just as toxic to others as Rated.   Also, why would anyone care what he does behind the scenes for CG? That's just trying to make money for himself.
After his rant about chat hoppers and other snippets I have no remorse for this dude. They enabled this behavior and yeah they may feel gutted but the way they've acted for years it isn't surprising to me at all someone in their group is like this.
You can dismiss it as hate talk but people have been saying for years that CG have gotten away with a shit ton of stuff that should have seen any one of them banned multiple times over.  So when it turns out that one of them became so used to being treated like he could do no wrong that he then used his position to abuse women, it is not surprising that people are going to bring it up.  The facts are that the warning signs have been there for years, people ignored them and it's only come to a head because some of Rated victims talked up about it after multiple of his previous victims were treated like shit by CG as a whole and the staff of No Pixel.
If that's your take away from all of this,,,, well I hope you like watching Rated do variety.
Ya fellow POS KhaosAdam knows him IRL.   Try reading the top posts the past few days.

I've probably been in the real world too long since this talk didn't even register for me. You get these types of conversations from time to time. It sounds callous but I don't think its intended to be at all. Someone in your group/business/office/school/whatever did some fucked up shit and there's still the reality that time moves forward and everyone else has to move on.   They're just in a business where they are oddly exposed to the public so its unusual to see that particular aspect of it in the open. So they're feeling and expressing the same thing everyone is on top of betrayal and needing to move forward as a group.   Its also important to remember they're steamers putting out hours of content at a time. They aren't going to express the same sentiment for that entire duration. Like any conversation it will go other places.
Their brand is they *are* the victims. Always has been. And anyone who attacks them is a hater who just wants to see them fall from the top.
Yeah, they weren't close friends. They only spent eight hours a day 5 days a week together joking around, talking and role-playing.  I'm sure the others were totally planning on getting him that help after they got done enabling Rates 4+ year by-monthly harassment of Angel/Mary, Pond/Izzy, Vale/Summer, etc.
Garrett (when PD gets death threats): “You probably did something to deserve it.”  Garrett (when CG gets death threats): “No one deserves to go through something like this!”
They've collectively made millions of dollars by being outwardly toxic to other people and now expect us to feel bad for them :)
Yea it was very clearly a PR statement.
I take it you don't have a pr  background either....
I had the same exact thought.  Seemed like a poor choice of words, Instead of "had" maybe it could of been  "This is what should be done" or "he's doesn't deserve to be apart of our group".
not really, all this is pretty good corp speak. some of their fans will have blind loyalty to rated and will want to shit on cg for making the decision. so its not they wanted to get rid of him because of their personal opinions, they had to get rid of him because of how fucked up rated actions were.
Ya
From what he's said recently, I think it's more that he doesn't believe what he did was wrong. Which is probably worse tbh.
> He is still denying he did anything wrong.  That's literally not what it says.  It says that he doesn't think the punishment is proportional to his actions. Not that he didn't do anything wrong.  Just because he's a bad guy doesn't mean people should make him seem even worse.  And nobody in here who will say anything about it knows the exact details, so it's hard to judge if he's right or wrong on that. I'm going to guess that the punishment is probably justified, but that's just a guess in the end.
I do think there's a line to being toxic in game (raging in league for example) vs being predatory/using position of power to try and gain sexual favors from others though.  Yes, being toxic OOC like CG is shitty.  But it is no where near the same as a Rated/Adam/Harvey Weinstein type behavior.  CG should try and be better but it's also not fair to lump them all into the same category as Rated/Adam when they're more of a Tyler1 type of shitty.
shocking the culture of toxicity and fear we build for YEARS is coming back to bite us in the ass and the people we antagonize for so long are coming out calling not just the guy but the group for their amount of bullshit thrown at them who would have thought.
They're not the same as Rated. They enabled Rated. Instead of acknowledging this, they're painting themselves as victims.
The stuff that came out even just a few months ago was only the sexual harassment portion of the buffet. Rated and the rest of them have been openly hostile and toxic to fellow coworkers on nopixel for over 4 years now.  Let's not forget, those publicly mald sessions and toxicity done by any other player who doesn't share their special protection, would have been perma banned long ago.    Had they been treated normally like any other group, it's very possible this guy wouldn't have even been around to harass the women he did.
And nopixel management help them do it. I'm sure all of the people involved are too afraid to call them out for it, but the reality is without the special protection provided by staff and the owner many of them would have been perma banned long ago.
Fucking called that one: https://www.reddit.com/r/RPClipsGTA/comments/12eznf0/management_on_recent_events/
So is your argument that a blind person can't tell what kind of personality you have after spending 8 hours a day at work with you, because they can't see your face?
How is any of this relevant to whether or not they can identify him being a piece of garbage? They themselves took place in many of the toxic outbursts and harassment that were done publicly during "RP", against characters / players like Angel, Vale,  Pond, etc. So if you work with someone 8 hours a day, joking around and interacting, talking and rping 5 days a week you're telling me you would have no clue what that person is like?    Or is it more likely that they just didn't want to do anything about it cuz it could potentially hurt their bottom line and they didn't really think it mattered that much because they also did some of the harassing.
Oh! Is this the part of the playbook where we pretend they were never actually friends in the first place to try to defend all their shit behavior for the last 3-5 years? Nice, I love this part!
Have you ever actually worked around people for 8 plus hours a day, 5 days a week? You get to learn an awful lot about how they act and what their personality is like. If I worked with someone for 8 hours a day and they were a toxic asshole towards female co-workers, are you trying to tell me I wouldn't be able to tell?  Are you for real?
Anytime you doubt that kind of thing, just look at how the Vale situation was handled.  Look at how anything with Kylie is handled.
Kylie also just said there's still multiple people who give her the same weird uncomfortable vibes she got from Rated, but just like with him there's no real way for her to prove it, and she has mentioned before this that some streamers who are seen as wholesome positive people can be pretty toxic people when there's no one watching
This has gone untalked about but yeah, it seems there's someone else on the server who might be as bad or worse
Hope she stops alluding to it and just says who it is with proof. Otherwise, it’s just words and words are wind.
>that has said things to her.  They said what exactly?
Ill let you in on a secret, literally every single streamer you watch is doing it for money
Garret said some massive horseshit in the past too in defense of "his boys".  Things like: "if you're getting chat hoppers, you probably did something to deserve it".  I wouldn't trust either of them. Hence why i said it's all bullsthit, as usual with anything CG related.
2:40 timestamp - They had the conversation before they made anything public.
Why would smaller streamers have confidence in management when management has openly stated they protect this group from severe punishment? In some cases they even seem to encourage reprisal by CG against people who report them and those people end up getting in troubled and screwed over.
They were/are actively fueling their audiences against others. They have contributed to creating atmospheres that encourage individuals to say hateful things (like death threats) and even to do things like dox or SWAT streamers. There’s clips from MANY of them blaming other streamers for being on the receiving end of their audiences. On many cases that happens to be women who have often gotten it worse than others (see female cops Pond, Vale, and Angel). They participated in many of these situations actively.
they must have experienced how he acted around people like in those clips with Adam. stop with the excuses lol
They aren't just "being salty in a game" though their entire gang is full of bullies who abuse people on the server. Multiple people on the server have been abused by them and their fans for years now and they can do nothing because of the power CG have over the server. They might not be as bad as Rated but they're close.
I mean there was clear evidence of other forms of harassment from all of them….  They weren’t just “toxic in a video game”, they knowingly went on regular tirades about people in the community to their large audiences that they KNOW will act out. As a collective they’ve all participated in treating multiple women in positions of authority like scum - and their audiences followed.
Its not really that difficult to comprehend, just don't treat people like trash.   Whether they known or not, they still were active in harassing people and being openly toxic towards people they didn't like.   There is a LONG documented history of this behavior coming from this exact group!
Good point.  Even seeing Shotz get emotional is a little weird for me.  Not that emotions are warranted but I know the emotion I'd have, and most reasonable people would have would be anger, not being sad.  But maybe that's just me.  I had a close friend end up being a closet piece of shit and I wasn't sad that our relationship was over.  I was furious that I was ever tricked into believing that he was something he wasn't and mad that I ever supported a piece of shit.
Agreed. Hobbit said it best, everyone knows the problem they’d just rather ignore it than deal with it
I think it's just as simple as multiple members of that group should have face several perma bans by now if they were judged the same as sub 500 view Andys. The fact that they weren't influenced how they acted  and created a hostile workplace for other streamers around them.  Someone like rated was protected by staff for so many years while he did all this heinous shit because his victims were too afraid to report. If treating CG like any other normal player ended up in severe punishments for several core members, it kind of tells you all you need to know about them.
Haven’t watched any of the cg boys in forever or twitch/streams in years but the constant hate this Reddit has for cg persists
bro pls 😭🤣
Ridiculously good comment!
[removed]
My only "rebuttal" to that would be he clearly set out to make some kinda of "PR" statement. I think talking more about the women effected (since that has already been revealed), and less about their "brand" would come across as way more human in a situation like this. Save the brand talk for the group chat. And if you have a brand, you should protect it by having people around who can tell you how to best tackle these issues...
The problem is that even if they didn't know the extent of his behavior they still enabled a lot of toxic behavior from him. I want them to move on from here, but it's not being a hater to realized they enabled him.
Even Ramee shared Garrett’s thoughts: https://streamable.com/k9eepb
He literally said you don’t have to believe the women. Of course you don’t *have* to believe the women but a PR person is not going to have those words leave your lips in a situation like this when your goal is to distance yourself from the person they’re accusing.
Nope, but had to deal with them a lot in a past professional life.
While it’s definitely clear that some of the statements are directed toward those people, those parts directly contradict the main points of the whole thing. “We told him” and “He found out” that he was being kicked out and then tried to say it was rated’s choice to leave.
Narcissists man. You can't win with them. It's best to just not play their game and walk away
well multiple women has come out about his actions. we dont know the ultimate cause of his punishment. but what we do know is this wasnt a one off thing. that there was like 6 women on twitter and reddit that has come forward about how he treated them or what he said to them asking them to cam for him etc. and i bet those 6 or so who came forward i bet you there 10s more that probably will never come forward and expose him for their sake and security.
The issue I have with what you are saying is that toxic ingame ends after that game. These people literally target and harass the same people because they support each others toxicity. Pretty much anyone with a spine that sticks up for themselves they instantly target with harassment.   "If you are getting hate you probably deserve it" is a literal statement from the group. They do not care if other people get harassed, they do not care if other people get hoppers and death threats. They only care when they can make themselves out to be the victims.   Just like this PR stunt. It was all about the brand this, the brand that with a very small statement about you should listen to the women, but you don't have to believe them. When there is 2,4,6,8,10... women then you know maybe then you should believe them. Prime example of why women don't come forward to begin with.
This captures my thoughts about this pretty well. Yours and another comment too actually. The other comment was about the effect of CG being basically untouchable. Or perceived to be untouchable, which is the important part. (They likely have been banned more than viewers are aware, but they never talked about it and just took "days off").   People on the server would see someone do X, Y, or Z and see that person get banned. Then they would see CG do X, Y, or Z and seemingly be totally fine. Now what happens when someone, who has watched this pattern, finds themselves in a bad situation with CG? They're afraid to speak out or report. What would be the point? It might even backfire. We've seen it before where someone reports CG and then both parties get banned. You might just be waved off. This Rated stuff started a couple months ago and has only now gained any traction.  I don't know if the other CG guys are in that Weinstein category. I don't think they are and without any evidence or allegations, it's not fair to lump them into that. But I also think their general toxicity and immunity to repercussions certainly played a role in creating the current environment where the people that CG bully don't want to speak out. And this of course carries over to women who are victimized which is what we're seeing play out.
Well it comes down to, would Rated have even thought he could get away with shit like that if his worst tendencies weren’t celebrated by CG and protected by NoPixel management?   It’s like that ironic racism/hate/Trump support/etc that used to be all over reddit and the internet. Eventually you get people coming in who aren’t joking and take it even further because they see other people “supporting” it.
Going to be honest, it kind of just sounds like you're creating some artificial toxicity hierarchy to defend your favorite streamers. Toxicity in game like CG has done should have zero place in nopixel. The special treatment and shielding they received from punishment created a culture that allowed rated a free pass to do what he did because people were too afraid to report him. His fellow members also fed into that toxicity and took part in antagonizing some of the individuals he harassed in private.  How hard is it to just not be a shit person? I can't even begin to think why you would bother trying to categorize or separate shitty people and try to say one is better or worse than another. Just don't do any of it. Not that hard, plenty of people have been perma banned off no pixel for just general toxicity.
Thank god he got perma banned and hopefully he gets even more punishments, but seeing people use this as an excuse to push their narrative is disgusting.   The guy is a predator harassing females off screen, and I kid you not I managed to see some people trying to link his behaviour to the fact that he hates Penta and that he trashtalked a cop in RP. Or any other thing that they may not have liked about him, but has absolutely nothing to do with what he got banned for and even mentioning it in this context minimizes the gravity of his acts.
Literally people on here seem to just lump everyone on what rated did which i feel takes away from who the real predator in this situation and minimizes it in some way just cause they have some weird personal feelings about cg. Sure, there’s some really toxic people in that group so are a lot of other streamers probably some that a lot of these people watch but Sexual assault and abuse and harassment is on a completely different level to just your normal shit talking toxicity in game.
CG acting like victims? Crazy.
It makes sense to view them as both.   They enabled him by protecting him and themselves from consequences both actively and passively, making him seem untouchable. They also participated in his on-server harassment of women for whatever reason.   They've also been "victims" which I'm putting in quotes because it's also not on the same level as the women he harassed. Their friend and business partner has been revealed to them as a shitty human being. I'm sure not everyone experiences the fallout from that in the same way, but I was in a similar situation years back and it fucking sucks. It hurts.   I agree that they should acknowledge their collective and individual roles in what happened but just because they're not doing that doesn't mean that they suddenly can't be hurt by this.
I’d say if I spent eight hours a day pretending to be a person that was just an asshole I wouldn’t expect people to also think I’m a sex pest.
The conversation is about whether they were aware of SH in his private discord DMs with women, not whether they were aware of toxic gamer babyrage tendencies ingame. There is a HUGE leap between gamer babyrage and SH dude, hindsight is 20/20.
If you and that person and your entire department in the office were blatantly toxic assholes to everyone that every committed a single self-perceived slight against you for years and you all did everything you could to cause thousands of customers to harass and threaten other departments over minor inconveniences in hopes that it would cause them to be afraid to inconvenience you in the future and had the cognitive dissonance to believe you weren’t doing anything wrong when people called you out on your toxicity and the CEO agreed with you, I could see how you might assume that anyone filing complaints about your coworker for anything might be just trying to inconvenience your department again. That doesn’t mean there weren’t signs that your coworker was a toxic asshole. It means your entire department is made up of toxic assholes and of course you’re not going to call out a coworker even if you notice that he seems to be more consistently toxic to certain other departments. Toxicity was the stated strategy of your department to maintain power in the business. But if you do it in a certain way and the CEO receives the threshold of 18 complaints that are needed to fire your coworker, of course you’re going to act like he was never *really* representative of the toxic asshole department because he always worked remotely and had never come into the office.
Oh there’s definitely a bunch more out there. Just last week some random dude (never saw him before) was a hostage at the jewelry store. Right from the start he’s demanding Libby take the lead on negotiations because “she was fit” and then got all excited about her frisking him. There’s been tons of situations of crims and civs speaking differently to Martell than male cops on the scene.   A few years back women on the server ever  tried to organize because it was/is such an issue. It’s said that in that time things have not improved.
It’s almost as though she said that Rated and the other person quickly deleted what they said to hide the proof and she didn’t come forward sooner because no one would believe her….  She’s trying to contact discord to retrieve the messages, but there’s no certainty that they will release them to her. But shit like this is why this crap is able to fester.
You understand it's basically impossible to provide proof for what's going on in someone's mind, right? It's very easy to tell that someone is a shitty person, it's not always so easy to provide concrete evidence as to their motivations.
I agree. I am saying that smaller streamers should be able to trust NP management to be unbiased. Obviously right now they are not.  If they actually enforced any of their rules fairly, maybe Rated couldve been cut out before hurting so many women.
Hey .. if you get hoppers... You deserve it. Who is that quote from.....?
> They were/are actively fueling their audiences against others. They have contributed to creating atmospheres that encourage individuals to say hateful things (like death threats) and even to do things like dox or SWAT streamers.  Ok, but maybe none of that is the reason why rated got banned.
[removed]
Maybe you can gain some insight from the megathread on why that might be the case.
Well they definitely have to do that. They probably should have just done it and gone on vacation for a week.
They didn't just enable it, they actively participated in some of those hostile situations where female players ended up getting harassed by toxic chat from stuff they spouted off.
Good lord, you can hear how tilted someone calling him out makes him.
He sounds 14 fucking hell
I mean, you hang out with people for nine plus hours a day and you start to pick up their habits, good and bad. Friend groups often have a lot of things in common, it's why they're friends.
Gotcha
> well multiple women has come out about his actions.   True.  > we dont know the ultimate cause of his punishment.  Well we kinda know.  > and i bet those 6 or so who came forward i bet you there 10s more that probably will never come forward and expose him for their sake and security.  Maybe.    But none of that has anything to do with the claim how "he thinks he did nothing wrong" ?
Oh hell no.  I totally agree that the enabling by CG/CG fans/NP Management played into the whole thing.  It's a clear sign that everyone needs to be better and hold themselves more accountable because they fostered a culture that allowed this to happen.  But at the same time my point is a ton of people seem to be saying stuff along the lines of "oh everyone in CG is just as bad as Rated for allowing this to happen" when the fact is you can't make a blanket statement like that.  We've all had shitty friends who we never knew was shitty until their closet was opened.  Hell I had a friend who was actively running a ponzi scheme for years but since we never discussed work and he never asked me to invest, I never knew even though we were in a fantasy football league together for a good 8+ years.  Literally everyone in our league was shocked when his wife had to let us know that he is exiting our league even though we used to hang out every Sunday to watch football together.  That's just stuff that kind of blindsides you.
I literally do not watch CG.  I'm like a 20 months+ Buddha sub lol. https://i.imgur.com/M73vBFP.png  I also agree that toxicity like CG has no place but the issue is people are taking advantage of a real situation in the treatment of women/sexual abusers to attach another agenda.  As far as we know, no one else in CG is a serial abuser like Rated.  You can acknowledge 2 different issues here.  One is people being shitty on a game causing OOC issues and enabled by NP management because $.  The other is a crime that honestly should land Rated in jail imo.
Permabanned should be the least of his worries.  I'm willing to bet one of the reasons it took so long for NP to make the move was because they had to check with lawyers (across multiple countries mind you since the server is ran by an Aussie and Rated is in the UK) to make sure if any real life charges might need to be filed.  Don't forget that out of the people who have come forward publicly, that's probably only 10% or less of the actual amount of women who Rated actually fucked around with.  If he can just disappear into the night with his millions without anything else, he should seriously be content and fucking go to therapy or something cause he needs some fucking help to get his head on straight.
The ultimate punishment for no pixel is to be permanently banned. You don't need to sexually harass people to be permanently banned. Many in CG have racked up enough points in the past to catch a perma ban, but staff have openly remarked how it would never happen because of their high views and the special privilege afforded them.  By trying to categorize a difference between what Rated did and what other members of CG do with their toxic tirades you're basically trying to excuse bad behavior that group because it's not, as bad as what Rated did. News flash it's all bad, there's literally no reason to even engage in discussion about who did something worse. They should all face equal punishment under the no pixel rules like any other player would.
Nah, fuck 'em. They're all shitty people in their own right.
In what delusional universe are they victims? Many of them actively participated in the toxic tirades and other harassment that happened publicly during roleplay to some of these women.   Reality is if management hadn't given this group special protection against punishments many of them probably would have been perma banned multiple times by now for points accumulation. Also does anyone actually believe these guys would face priority lowering like any normal player would? The whole thing is a joke.
Hopefully Discord is able to get her those messages. Gotta stop this bullshit from happening to others.
If you look at the below response from FedUpGrad on my prior comment. There is proof, it was deleted by the individual in question. Hopefully she’s able to recover that proof.
Or Ramee on death threats (that happened after interactions with CG): https://streamable.com/k9eepb
His victims have said that they were hesitant to come forward because he was in a powerful clique that objectively went after anybody who crossed them.
What are you even talking about? There are plenty of things that could have led to any one of these guys being perma-banned a few times from just 2.0 alone.  There's no mystery or crime to be solved they were already committing rule offenses on people that many others got 30 days for. Yet it wasn't going to be solved because management openly stated they protected them from being punished. Just because one person in a group commits sexual harassment, doesn't mean that all of the other harassment that goes on is somehow okay because somebody else did something worse.
Living is easy with eyes closed
Oh I’m not saying they’re the same as him. I’m just saying they shouldn’t pretend like they’re completely innocent.  To build off this thing you mentioned:  > We've all had shitty friends who we never knew was shitty until their closet was opened. Hell I had a friend who was actively running a ponzi scheme for years but since we never discussed work and he never asked me to invest, I never knew  It’d be like you and your friend were doing shady business stuff that was completely legal but entirely shady, then he gets found out for also running a Ponzi scheme. That’s kinda more like what’s going on here is somewhat what I’m saying.
Well their intentional toxicity leads to endless waves of harassment and death threats towards other streamers, to the point that people used to end their stream. Yeah its not the same as the Rated situation, but its still pretty fucking bad, and allowed someone like Rated to be openly toxic without others seeing the signs.   I understand they are upset, and i do not think they need to be cancelled or anything like that. However i do think this is the best chance they and NP have to turn things around and shed the drama-farming toxicity they are known for. Then for NP management to finally take OOC toxicity more seriously.
Your entire argument about trying to categorize levels of terribleness is a distraction and pointless. Who's to say endless waves of hoppers telling you in chat to end your life, sending you DMs that say basically the same thing and filling the comments of every YouTube clip video containing your content is better or worse than someone being sexually harassed.  Are you the one to make this completely pointless classification? Literally who cares, it's all bad.  It seems like you're trying to just defend people who are openly toxic and probably should have been removed from the server, or at least have the rules evenly applied to them like everyone else.
Well the announcement from NoPixel did point that they had to talk to lawyers about some of the claims so yeah it seems pretty bad.
Discord won't do shit unless the police are involved and even then they might very well be limited in what they can do.  People can think it would be good in this instance (and it would be) but the actual act of Discord going back and handing deleted logs of a private conversation without the consent of at least one person involved would be a massive privacy blunder on their part which could wreck their reputation.  When someone deletes their messages in DM's it removes it from not just the people in the DM's computers but also from the discord servers themselves so there would be nothing to hand over even if the police got involved.  This is why some people use 3rd party plugins for the discord app that record DM's and stores them independently so that someone later deleting their messages doesn't get rid of all the evidence.
It was always crazy to me how they would brush off death threats, swatting etc. when it happened to others, but when they were on the receiving end of it when they went after XQC, suddenly it was the worst thing in the world.  It's just so lacking in empathy.
This guy is high command? Lmao
Guys, the cg brand is now clean as a whistle. Nothing to see here.
Do you not know how reddit comment chains work? That's what we are talking about. Claiming that CG or anyone could just easily know this was going on because of some other, not at all necessarily related, behavior existed is a ridiculous stretch. It's very easy to say now, but there are lots of ass holes that would never do anything like this and vice versa.
You didn't answer the question. It was so clear to you, where are your accusations of sexual misconduct for rated? Why would you allow this to happen if you knew?
I guess you been living under a rock the last few years or just decided to ignore it, that's not really on me, but more on you!  And I don't owe you any answer, just spend 5min reading through the top posts that's been on this sub over the past 4-5 days and you should have all the answers you need!
What a joke. Literally no one has accused him of this behavior in the past. Just because you didn't like him or he was toxic to someone doesn't mean this was just automatically happening and clear as day. Feel free to shift history to try and fit your view, but literally no one was accusing him of this type of behavior because no one knew. That's the point.

220% pure Trooper material right there. Peach is fantastic.
This is precisely the kind of mocking humour that those petty bullies hate the most. Well done.
The guy is going to be a punchline forever
God I fucking love Peach.  Lol
Jenny is insane and I love it but my biggest takeaway from this clip is how absolutely infectious LadyHope's laugh is! Definitely up there with Bio for me lol
🤣 I was waiting for someone to reference it and ofc it’s peach
Lady Hope in bliss right now, everyone knows that Rated has been a prick to her ever since on both characters.
LadyHope's laugh is pure joy. Must be a massive relief for her.
[Peach had a pretty good one the other day too](https://clips.twitch.tv/ClumsyAmazingElephantJKanStyle-galtB_EtEKRtxjOQ) (after the Rated ban but before the details came out)
Jesus christ Jenny LUL
Troopers are Elite again Gladge
The thought of a particular person watching this clip and probably FUMING makes me happy :)
On a server packed with people who are treasures, she is an incredible treasure. Extra treasure-y.
You know he's gonna watch all this....and will have foam coming out of his mouth
She is a national treasure. Protect Jennybeartv at all costs.
Omg with all the negativity surrounding this situation the past couple of days I've been wondering how this was going to play out on NP. Like is everyone just going to retcon the characters existence or what? If it's just only brought up in meme form like this NGL, pretty damn funny.

She is so lovely!
She'll boost wherever she goes, content force unpaired
I suspect he hates it way more coming from women, too. So bonus points.
And he absolutely deserves it. The karma train is in full swing, as it should have long ago.
Wake up, babe! New Arcadum just dropped!

I cannot wait to see all the "I'm not evil" memes and pisstakes. It will be glorious
What did she say can't hear on speaker
Penta got in a [“I’m not evil”](https://www.twitch.tv/penta/clip/SpookyDeliciousYamPeteZarollTie-pImgHNDkCWtAIZyY) on Wrangler last night too.
I'm sure it's best for the people who were victimised by him that he's erased from memory. Just dunk on him from time to time to take any power away.
My favorite bit that someone has done when a player got permabanned but they’re slightly involved with a story, they bleeped the person’s name.

Have you not been on this sub in the last 3 days?
When you make an enemy and shit on everyone not in your in-group and *then* something like this comes out you bet your ass people will never let that go.
We can only hope that this also chastens the rest of that group, and they start treating people around them like human beings.

Perfect reply from Moose.
And people say Cerberus is evil.
i thought i was on livestreamfails until after i posted. i havent followed nopixel in a long time.
That there is trooper shit.  Peach is adapting way too well lmao.
Lmaooo
This makes me want a "Chase Clouter" day on the server, where everyone is just Chase Clouter.
Tobii or Nikez wanted to do it for Halloween, even worked on making all the NPCs Chase and saying actual lines. But they told him no.
Isn't a city full of Chase Clouters basically what the server is every day?
The NPC Chase thing would have been great (along with many others recording their own voices for voice lines)  That being turned down was so dumb and could have added much more than AI's calling you a "douche lord" or telling you to "fuck their ass"
Yeah but missing the irony

Lol "Why do cops struggle with this? We did it so easily"
That was an unusually clean box lol
Context: Ray rolled up and asked the Bondi Boys to help him box a cop they were having fun with in order to campaign for Lang. BBMC understood the assignment.
actually a god tier box. impressive for not being coordinated over radio
I did not expect to laugh that loud on such clip
Ah yes the "Bondi Bruvs" at work, BBMC's answer to HoA's "Worst Generation." Peter and Cap are a hilarious menace together.
honestly I wish rust and bbmc would become friends, they'd be so fucking funny together

Tacos are more important then shootouts tbh
This title is a bit extra but if you’re going to go that far to tell us he’s having tacos. Can you tell us what kind of tacos ?
I was watching Kevs stream during this situation, I thought it was hilarious. all you can hear was the tanker blowing up, but you couldn't see anything 🤣🤣
What was funny too was from K perspective you can hear Ramee and Eugene stressing trying to find where K and Miguel went down. They are lock picking cars and searching around. At one point Eugene says wait K might just be sitting in the car in his head. Little later K comes back and on radio is like wtf is going on?
Not sure if you were saying this in a bad way or not. Its not There problem is someone goes into there heads. How are they suppose to know lol
Have u ever had "Lengua"(cow tongue) tacos?
There is no issue, is just kinda funny.
Bro...It's obviously funny. That's why they titled it that way. No need to run to defend anyone, just a funny situation.
I don't think OP has bad intentions but I think his wording is just poor.
oo sorry didnt mean in a bad way. just that when K got back it apocalypse with stuff blowing up and shots fired and people dead. twas kinda funny
Think he's finding it funny since mr k was afk it was technically 3vs6 and hoa lost. Cops shot migl down and at least one hoa member. Migl and all of cg got away.
Indeed, especially with the hoppers who are/have been already harassing HOA based on this situation.
ye cops only focus hoa on that , they even left cg alone to chase hoa/ss XD
Cg got chased, ramee broke cuffs 3 times I think. Migl got shot by cops.
Mask + goggles + awful voice changer, the ultimate 2.0 experience
Niz's [thoughts](https://youtu.be/vq9PUJriLF8?t=267) on the rp and not wanting to play 2.0 anymore.
Feel bad for Niz. I hope he continues to play 2.0
Same guys that are using 3 9f's for shoutouts 4th day on server
This ain’t it
Jesus Christ that was a hard watch. Feel bad for aziz, just being talked over no give or take in the Roleplay scenario there.
i’m in a gang & i’m so cool & hard
This was the cringiest watch yet
Bro Niz is too sweet of a guy IC and OOC for this to happen. Honestly feel bad for him. But he handled it like a champ lowkey.
this girl is cringe af
That shit is jarring as hell
nothing says good rp like talking over the one person outside the echo chamber.
The problem is them fully taking over Niz gang name. If they were actually good RPers why not just call themselves Yakuza and fight over the dojo place?  A person who is RPing a gangster needs to know when to press someone and be able to have a conversation to extend the RP. Not just talk over a person and shut down any type of RP
What a weirdos 😂already found the weird when the whole gangton thing happend
"We are the best we have guns and are a gang." They legit talk over him every single word he says then tell him to fuck off. He goes to leave and simply says good luck and after all they do to him determine that was him talking back?  Honestly surprised they didn't shoot him for not barking when she was talking about how she would make him bark
I can tell they are self-inserts by their clothes.
imagine flying in your 10 online buddies one day with the sole purpose of being instant gangsters without prior RP.  When you get to meet the person who run that gang you are trying to forcibly take over without any previous interaction or RP behind it, you bad mouth him and disrespect him without any reason... because you gangster brah!    Then your group proceeds to RDM multiple times just leaving people wondering wtf is going on.    Oh yeah, bans are needed for sure.
Poor niz enjoyed his rp 2.0 hopefully these people get banned
I know I am prob going to catch flak for this...But Triads? And they are dressed like basic South Siders with some neon? WHERE ARE THE SUITS GOD DAMN IT?! Where is the class? The presentable look? Why does no one do that?!
2.0 was looking surprisingly promising, but it has really taken a nosedive these last few days.
Go kick rocks, god damn this was dangerously cheesy.
There are people from WL who actively affiliate themselves with these people. Leon, Ace and Paris from WL are in this gang.
these guys wont last long  , rdm, using 3 super cars etc etc  they act like they did on public servers
Jesus man that was just shit vibes from the start idk know who they are but they didnt even try im surprised they got wl
2.0 needs a large team of admins flying round 24/7 or things like this will be a common occurrence. Hope they get on top of it. Also hope players put in plenty of reports to help them out.
This is some super cringe second life shit.
public ain't it, there are good roleplayers but the rest....
That was the most public RP I've seen in a while
I just love how the girl made such a big deal that he was going to just talk to her, but then she lets everyone else in her group get a swing in themselves.   Tried to make a power play, but devolved into a group of seagulls squawking.
I want Jordan Steele to arrest them, that gangster girl never give him a chance to finish a single sentence...   Anyway, soon rather than later they will be banned and new ppl will join which means more money..
[removed]
3.0 GG members getting the GG treatment in 2.0. Ironic.
People are giving these guys a lot of shit but I think it’s mainly just people new to role play who don’t understand how conflict rp works
I don't really see the problem here to be honest. It's just a gang pressing someone about their turf.
She stinks
Same guys [RDM](https://streamable.com/0tmsgl) FDF and obviously [GC](https://www.reddit.com/r/RPClipsGTA/comments/12e5da2/curtis_jack_marcel_and_others_get_rdmd_in_drive_by/) from earlier.
Trued full take... but a risky one! 😆
y’all know her name or @?
Come on look at what the group has done, do you realy think theyre capable of something as low effort as that?
unfortunately, this thing is just gonna happen, esp on a public server  &#x200B;  The admins have been pretty quick to ban, which is nice, but theres only so much they can ban before some slip through the cracks.
It was good at the start because it had a lot of people from WL with frech starts and characters but now it seems like some of the WL guys are going back which means you will you see more and more people with paid prio so the qualituy will drop.     if 2.0 showed anything, it showed that WL needs a reset from 0 (doesn't have to be mechanics updates) it just needs a new server with new economy and fresh characters.
I'll be the one that says it.  2.0 was doomed from the beginning because all the WL people and veterans came over and just started doing 3.0 shit on day 1, like claiming turf and colors, grinding bench XP, being the ultimate criminal gangster badass 24 hours after character creation.  These motherfuckers set the tone for everyone else coming in behind them.  They speedran the part that gets them to clout status, and now of fucking course everyone filling in their absences is going to take a cue from that.
Some of them like Leon Ant and Ace are actively being part in these scenarios. They are just as bad.
2.0 is a public server....
Unfortunately Jordan Steele died by the ballers
Looks like we found a member of the triads, hello there.  &#x200B;  GG aint on 2.0, GG members are spread across 4 gangs, how does this have anything to do with GG
GG don’t talk like this they might escalate stuff or be ratty, they can make people mald but they don’t make rp uncomfortable and hard to watch.
if your gonna say something come with proof, this just sounds like your complaining for nothing
The GG treatment is having randoms pull up and claim that they’re your new gang and then shoot them til they stop coming around?
Aziz isn't gg
what do you mean by this?
I wish but like half of these people are literally WLed pretty sad ngl.
Did u watch the vid?
1 gang randomly pops of 10 deep and wants to take over another gang and name   Then decides to want to rep the color red and fight another gang for that color just because their bench has a strip of color red?     Then they are the same ones RDMing FDF (Forum drive families) and GC (Gangton)     All within 2-3 days
It's just cringey/toxic RP. Not necessarily a rule break in this clip. If a group comes down to talk with your group the worst way to handle it is to shut the other group down completely and hardly let them speak.
Fly in shooters 12 deep claim an already existing gangs name / turf.. bully them out by shooting them and when the conversation /"RP" time comes this is what they get.. Nothing wrong with it?
thats like what? 2 instances of RDM in 24 hours? hopefully these people get banned     edit: apparently some of em got banned. They went and RDM the ballas lol
Ahh man ugly johnson is rolling with this shitheads? Disappointing
Listen, when I read the title "Talk with Triads"  I AT THE VERY LEAST expected something with guys in suits, with maybe red undershirts etc. But no, all I see here are Southside idiots who are assholes sadge No one ever RPs Mafia/Triad shit anymore maan\~ Like actual crime family shit, it's all the same now-IT SUCKS
Yeah, it looks like the admins really have their work cut out for them.
3.0 should have a soft wipe. Take everyones cars and money, get rid of stuff like heroin and maybe remove some of the benches people have. They could honestly add in what their doing with 2.0 with the benches and make people have shitty pistols at first, like a diamond back or something.
That is to be expected. ST is the bottom of the barrel and anyone worth a shit leaves before long or gets bumped up to CG. I can count on one hand the amount of good role players who have been in ST.
several of that group members are in WL
Yeah but the people leading the scene are not from WL
Yeah I saw a bunch of people trying to roleplay as gangsters but failing because they don’t understand how roleplay works
I'm talking about this clip though.
>It's just cringey/toxic RP.  That's what "gangbanger" RP is to be honest.
Honestly with the amount of potential he has. That dude gets wrapped up in bad crowds way too easy. Firs the whole Mineo ranger issue now this
he isnt, he jumped in their car to hide from the ballas but never joined them as far as I know.
He isn’t rolling with them apparently. Some people say he was being hunted by ballas and saw them in the clothing store wearing red and tagged along to hide among them.
Yeah i saw the "attempt" in the title and knew what was up
yeah but part of what is making 2,0 good is ppl trying diff characters or at least doing different stuff. Liek jobn and ssaab with ballas, dean with z3 (tho he just permad and is now poo shiesty) and curtis.
Leon Von the leader is whitelisted LMFAO
Maybe if you have a really low bar for RP, sure. There's nothing wrong with pressing them but RP is always about give and take. Not allowing the other side any sort of quality interaction is incredibly low effort. At least they didn't shoot them without any interaction at all I guess.
yeah... nothing wrong with comming to an new server and saying we have your gangs name, another gangs color and dont think that this is kinda odd to do...

Some sort of hacker? Or did someone grind a bench to unlock grenades? Both somehow feel possible
Someone figured out that if you have your pilot license and weapons license while wearing all camo and Aviator sunglasses it unlocks the Air Force bench. Use that bench to craft 5 parachutes and then it unlocks to let you craft the AC-130.  I hope no one metas this after seeing this comment.
Are they really speedrunning?
Nah they haven’t even unlocked the SpaceX bench yet and it’s already been like a week.
well its an easy ban for the admins. just need to check the logs who crafted it and who rode it
Why would they ban someone for using a mechanic they added to the game?
Do not they hate when someone speedruns everything.
Someone’s gotta be the first one to Mars to start establishing the colony that’s going to be the lore for 4.0.
yea but not as fast as 5 days in the city
Obviously but they’re only up to the Air Force bench so far. They still have to unlock the Navy bench and the Burnt Sienna bench to unlock the hot dog cart and then they have to sell 1,000 hot dogs from the cart to unlock the SpaceX bench and the SpaceX bench just allows you to get to the moon to build the hydrogen mines and refueling station which is required to launch the mission to Mars and the flight to Mars itself takes 3 days so we’re still a few weeks from unlocking all of the mechanics on 2.0 classic. It’s really not speedrunning at all considering it costs $500 every two weeks for prio and not everybody is rich.

Swizz has some of the worst anger issues ive ever seen
Nothing bad happened here.

My KDA madge
I hate the immediate number check. People really do struggle to just take an L.
The classic "I just shot people but my gun isn't in my hands right now" defense
Basic Tennessee v. Garner moment right here.
What I don’t understand is… if he reacts = Swizz is just angry. If he doesn’t react and reports = Swizz is just salty.   Is this not what people have been clamoring for, don’t get toxic and just report if you feel something wrong was done?
They all will just start to turn and shoot the 1 cop car down when they do that.
This is why I don't enjoy war RP, it gets boring, real quick. Too many sweaty people, whether it be chatters, reddit commenters or even certain RPers themselves. The best part of the war was last night between HOA and The Angels...the dogfight! It was fun, not the sweaty bs...also, Silent/Flippy wanting to make things more fun with HOA was great because he knows they are a fun group who just like to mess around and enjoy themselves. Miguel having a hissy fit about it and sitting out just says it all really. He's down for the win and nothing more which is when war RP gets boring. It's just never going to end when you have that mentality.  Enjoy it and make it fun for all sides, not just only be about the W.  (for the redditers arguing amongst themselves) IT'S JUST RP!!! IT'S NOT REAL!!!
Eh, kind of on Swizz side here, like if he had his gun out I would have agree with shooting him, but he didn't so it that was a tad aggressive. That being said I think the cops were also shoot at, so maybe that why they shoot into him, but  otherwise yeah that just seem like excessive force.
Context - Seaside were suspicious of a vehicle and tried to press the passengers. This led to the Seaside vs CG/Hydra car shootout. Cops arrived and shot down Seaside members who were in an active gunfight vs CG. This led to CG winning the shootout.   I am unsure about the Rules for cops to engage during the shootouts but I remember there was a rule that cops need to announce their presence and then shoot. In this situation, cops shot immediately killing 1-2 seaside members and subsequently Miguel. Maybe RDM.  Cops saw Miguel shoot and when they started shooting him, he put his gun away. They asked him to surrender. Miguel lies and runs. Cops shoot which is valid IMO. But the first interaction is dodgy
Yeah idk the way hydra is acting right now just hunting for solos and breaching into LL with full 6 is just meh for me. I see a lot of clips where most title “hydra catches ***** lacking” they don’t even wake up at their prime time zone.
Ay… tacos come first
Professional call of duty player has issues with anger, more news at 11
im confused swizz didnt even say anything he just went quiet and took numbers
but he didn't complained he went quiet and took numbers isn't that what people here wanted?
[removed]
i know people here hate cg but didn't this sub reddit said in this type of situation if your mad just stay quiet and report?
True
Tennessee v Garner was ruled unconstitutional in 1985.  That case law has been dead almost 40 years
It’s the immediate going to reporting when he loses. He should have been shot, they saw he had a gun, he lies to them whilst running away - doesn’t have his hands up. From their pov it looks like he’s running to cover before he will likely shoot them. I’ve seen Swizz do this multiple times pulling up someone’s steamId when an interaction happens he doesn’t like. Why can’t he report privately as this clearly isn’t a ban worthy thing and would get dismissed without anyone getting tarnished. I’ve seen hoppers this morning bringing up this scenario with timestamps asking other streamers if they think the cop should be banned for it.
Yup lots of fun/great scenes from yesterday. All of the twitter banter leading up to and the LL push itself, Julio grabbing Mr. K's gun to shoot at Hydra/Angels on the building outside prison, the airplane fight with the angels, etc.
I’m going to excuse Miguel not wanting to have “fun” cause He is the target, so he didn’t want to do a very dumb push.  I’m happy they still did the push cause it was hilarious content, but IC that is exactly how Miguel should feel.
Bruh he literally blew up a fuel tanker in front of cops and proceeds to lie to them about not having a gun. If you are a cop you either don't chase that person or you gun him down there is nothing else you can do.
* They partake in Gang War Shootout situation * Seen blowing up the fuel tanker w/ group of gang * Keep running away even when order to stop. * Tennessee v. Garner existed in NoPixel as Case Law
This context is pretty inaccurate. It was primarily HOA that were hunting for hydra (they had two seaside rolling with them). They pull up on the vehicle, Eugene identifies himself (with three others who are unknown to them at the time and probably still), and the seaside involved made the call to start shooting anyways.   Cops passed by the convoy after the shooting had started and they immediately pursued and joined in the gunfight (shooting people on both side while it was only two cops there).   CG shot down some of the HOA there, PD shot down MigL, and the two seaside members fled and were eventually gunned down by PD alongside I believe another HOA member.
If I remember correctly, yesterday Baas gave the order to shoot immediately during gang fights while this super war is going on. No one did anything wrong, and even if they did it'd be an sop violation at best
Cops didn't do anything wrong tho. This is literally either in their SOPs or one that is just an unspoken SOP. Anything north of Olympic, you take out anyone with a weapon. If south of Olympic, you let it play out and then go in. Some cops will let stuff just north of Olympic play out too, but yea PD didn't do anything wrong.
Keep it in the southside if you want southside rules, cops handling shootouts with kid gloves are a courtesy at the officers discretion outside of it if I recall.
What’s dodgy about it, specifically?  This isn’t RDM.
They were all getting shot before cops said a single word, and they only had 1 cop car there.
> Maybe RDM.  lol
Weee woooo RP Police put your hands up!
people here will literally complain about things that even the streamer they are trying to defend enjoyed like ask yourself do they appreciate you doing this?
Might wanna pay attention to how the HOA was actively baiting hydra to breach the LL and they went through with it despite originally not wanting to because it was something both sides would and did have fun with. Also, they’re not hunting for solos. They’re just hunting. So was HOA and so was Seaside. If you’re gonna hate on hydra for it then you gotta say the same for everyone involved
HOA/Seaside in this clip with 3 super cars and a heli LITERALLY hunting cars going down the highway = Hydra hunting for solos? What? Also where was this energy when Ash got solo snatched? And to top it all off the entire car was technically CG not Hydra. And JJ gave the order to shoot knowing it was Eugene aka CG. So I don’t know where this narrative came from.
HOA wanted them to breach.. this is why conflict RP isn’t fun bc people like you have to shit on the fun aspect. HOA was having a blast.
I give silent credit for trying to make stuff with the HOA a bit fun and not sweaty. Someone had to be sent to sit out for it to happen tho.
Hydra are so eager to shoot ppl they shot JJ with a cop right next to him at a traffic stop, as well as shutting down Hayes cus i think seaside own it.
I see your point about picking off solos, but the breaching was encouraged by the hoa, especially when Julio egging on flippy with telling him to come play counter strike's new map de_ll
He was a coach not a pro I think

It isn't even about CG this time. Last 3 days this subreddit has been full of comments being toxic towards Swizz. Most of them are factually incorrect or written in bad faith you can't reason with them
Yes, people should stay quiet and report, but only when there’s an actual rule break.
Still in use in many states because Federal Court still uphold it. Winning on appeal court doesn't mean the law will be change at that moment, It still need to pass in Federal Court.  Also this is NoPixel Los Santos, they still use Tennessee v. Garner as a study case law here.
What?  Tennessee v Garner is not dead case law - its never been overturned. It’s still taught in American law school (in both criminal law and constitutional law). To this day it’s casually referred to as the “fleeing felon” rule.  Don’t spread misinformation.
Tennessee v Garner is from 1985. Cite the case law that overturned it.
because having peoples Player ID is pretty much needed to report , its either grab their numbers or having to back through a vod find out  who they are and then you have to find someway to identify them. management have encouraged people to report and move on without being toxic.   he did what management asked of him = bad guy     it might not be report worthy but if a player thinks it is  , he should probably report it
I’m not arguing whether he was right or wrong, I’m not an admin to decide.   Imo I see both sides, cops probably have every right to shoot. Miguel also put his gun away and was fleeing, cops could have chased.   I just hate that it’s basically if people get frustrated and talk shit they are being toxic, but if they shut up and just report they are being salty. He did what they are literally asked to do, shut up, don’t get toxic and report it.
I mean reporting is the healthy thing to do here. Even if it isn’t a rule break, it’s much better than the numerous other alternatives. People like Penta and many others also report openly and quick like this all the time, since there’s no guarantee the person stays there long enough to grab all the time (also I’d assume since grabbing a number is easier than describing the situation and likely faster than staff / admins going back and verifying the person described). And even if screen / sound is hidden, people aren’t dumb and can assume what’s going on.
how is running away saying "you can have my gun" lying about having a gun ??
Yea he did
if i remember SOP's right north of Olympia the cops are clear to just go in and take out anyone with a weapon south of olympia thats the south side and the cops will wait till the shooting mostly stops before moving in. it may have changed but thats how i rember it
They aren’t fighting any south side gangs lmao
Flippy wanted to breach because he knew he would have fun, but migL didn't want to breach what so ever, so he took himself out of the situation
JJ in a traffic stop with cops. Hydra pull ups and waited for him to get out. Yeah they surely not hunting solos.
Maybe because Miguel is the target for HOA. He is taking it seriously as he was the one that goaded them about Andi being tortured. So its easy to assume that should he be took down that he may then be tortured or whatever. It makes sense that he doesn't want to entertain the SBS stuff as he has more at stake.
yeah its not like someone leaked the entire plan of the coallition which included going after businesses and clean people to street team , who told hydra and cg:  "we are going to target clean people oh no they shut down our business HOW COULD THEY "
before that seaside shot a solo ash
Cos the entire coalition said they are going after hydra businesses so hydra are just giving them their own medicine
Coaches are usually just washed pros
[removed]
yeah im done i dont wanna get banned
Please name a state that upholds it. No.  There is no probable cause that a fleeing felon is a danger to the public thus being infringing on illegal seizure. This is why it's was ruled unconstitutional.  It is against the law to shoot a fleeing felon including los santos
No.  There is no probable cause that a fleeing felon is a danger to the public thus being infringing on illegal seizure. This is why it's was ruled unconstitutional.  It is against the law to shoot a fleeing felon
It was argued in 84 and appealed and ruled unconstitutional in 85.  You can find all the info here https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/471/1/
everything is logged its a server all he really needs to report is a time they can see his player number and when he was shot and by who. not even saying what he did was wrong but this argument needs to die thats not how logs work they dont need him to say who he was shot by  edit: just as an example by that logic 7th mans a sniper and no one can prove shit since their out or range for numbers. pulling up numbers is meant for like slurs like they need to go now cant read logs/ review footage  edit 2: people really out here believing free MINECRAFT servers have more features than no pixel..... you do you
That doesn't matter lmao. Southside is supposed to be the shithole warzone and people are supposed to keep it there if they want their deathmatch fps game rules. That's why you always hear people talk about south of Olympic.
it's ok for seaside to solo hunt ash tho?
seaside definately didnt blackout and shoot ash , nope they didnt do that nope nope nope.  lets initiate  5 vs umbrealla gang war but while we are doing that drive around solo in or own cars,   after we have tried to recruit every other gang in the city to help. "surprise pikachu face  the umbrella isnt going to be nice"
Looking for people doesn’t mean they’re hunting solos. They don’t know how many people are or aren’t around until they run into them.   Meanwhile, you had Ash on her own, Seaside pull up blacked out and refuse to identify themselves as seaside and try hard to keep themselves unknown, then kidnap and shoot her. They then hide and false flag afterwards. If you want to play the morale game you’re fighting the wrong battle.
So you also have this problem with Seaside solo hunting Ash?
No it doesn't. Everyone in a shootout risks 'death' in rp. Unless you're saying some people value differently?
[removed]
Okay at this point I can’t tell if you’re trolling. The case, Tennessee v Garner, has never been overturned. It is still in effect today.   The Supreme Court held that deadly force “may not be used unless necessary to prevent the escape and the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious bodily harm to the officer or others.”  That means if there is probable cause to believe that the suspect may harm the officer or others if he escapes, then it IS CONSTITUTIONAL to use deadly force.
Ok, I wasn't clear. Tennessee v Garner is not dead for 40 years, when people bring up this case law they bring up the new test that this case law created. Just because SCOTUS disagreed with the state doesn't mean the case law is meaningless. Because of this case law now the totality of circumstances determines if the officers have PC to belive suspect poses a serious threat.   Tennessee v Garner is also a case law in the server so the test is provides applies to the server's PD.
yeah everything is logged but finding the right time and people involved is way easier if you are provided information and what is needed is player id and a timestamp in your vod  most of  punishments are handled by vod reviews.  its not like a "log" shows you a video of what happened, its just text.     since the only people that have access to snipers are devs and admins your argument is kinda mute. i understand that people can potentially be out of range , but that person would have to be a admin/dev or their actions approved by someone
You’re super pressed about this.
[removed]
What new test that the case law created?  The case law is meaningless because it was ruled unconstitutional in the US and is a violation of the rights guaranteed in the constitution.  You also seem to be moving goalposts, first you argued it still is a law, then you are arguing about some test based on the case law you didn't cite

https://www.police1.com/legal/articles/tennessee-v-garner-the-enduring-test-of-objective-reasonableness-cYjlsV2eXSd7SbeV/  Tennessee v Garner ruling by SCOTUS is the law of the land. Yes, they struck down the Tennessee law and further set a new standard of applying the 4th amendment in those specific situations.
i mean we both not putting any evidence in any of our allegation im not gonna put any effort if your not aswell
Yes and that new standard is not Tennessee v Garner because it's unconstitutional
[removed]
like i said there is nothing wrong with pulling numbers. actually might be good for server health be it penta or swizz doing it. there are endless clips of people pulling numbers so not sure  why wont you post one instead of being standoffish
No, Tennessee v Garner was not ruled unconstitutional, the Tennessee law was. Maybe you mean the ruling by 6th Circuit? To overrule the case law ruled by SCOTUS you need another SCOTUS ruling. For example Roe v Wade was overruled by Dobbs.
Tennessee vs Garner changed the way the Tennessee fleeing felon law was applied.  It applied restraints on when police could shoot a fleeing felon but still allows them to shoot a felon if they have "good faith" the felon will get away and be a danger to the public.
claiming other people see it, is not proof of an allegation. don't wave the unsourced allegations flag against someone saying something you dont agree with if you are unwilling to provide your own clips as proof. it is very much as much of a rule break to do that as it is to use unsourced allegations

I also think Wiseguy stepping away from racing and development played a big part. A lot of racers have said they preferred wiseguy’s car development then what they have now. I felt bad for wg because he would spend a lot of time working on shit only for the big guy to come in and change shit.
A bit from the podcast: [OOC with AnthonyZ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdzaXoYt4xU)  **Summery on why the racing scene died, from the 2 hour podcast:**  No variety in cars  Car tunes  No controller  No nos  No PM rp
As a viewer full phasing racing isn't interesting to watch because it's like watching a bunch of ghosts on a racing game going through each other, no cool overtakes with risk involved.   From the cops pov it just looks weird , there was a clip somewhere in vinewood at a house robbery suddenly 20 cars come flying through full speed it was funny but looked stupid.
Was phasing brought up at any point? Feels like a lot of internal beef was lost when accidents didn't happen. Or not having any hard resets on characters, like losing their cars. Civil asset forfeiture got skipped hard.
Racing died when LimeLight stopped coming around.
Some of the comments in this thread are wild and clearly from people just sharing opinions on RP they've never watched.   I personally enjoy both Redline's and Yokai's racing RP. It's a bummer that commenters here have to find something to be so negative about especially if they are speaking from complete ignorance
Lack of options with cars can only be blamed for so much, even before they removed things people would only turn up with the same fastest meta cars at the time to races... the easy way for people to get challenged and be on the same level is removing full phasing from racing.     In the recent crew battle between Redline and Yokai, Yokai smoked Redline even without the fastest cars because they dont do phasing and know how to battle out positions instead of doing time trials and just driving through people.     Removing full phasing and raising minimum buy ins at races would higher the stakes and skill for people to want to do it more or at least feel accomplished.
The second phasing racing was added marked the end of street racing. It turned into a sweatfest of who could hit the optimal lines over curbs in a car that in RP shouldn't even come close to clearing a curb. Every bit of contact was treated like an act of war and we need to hop out and start shooting. Why not have a 1 v 1 and settle it on the streets like someone RPing a street racer would do vs pulling a desert eagle out of your ass?
Tbh I think there were two major points that hurt the racing scene drastically in the long run. The dispanding of the midnight club and phasing.   The midnight club caused rp to naturally happen cus they went around enforcing rules and made sure people stuck to them. They held people accountable and made sure people didn't do dumb shit. But it also made the whole scene a lot more interesting in general. Now, the only people I see enforcing any type of rules on their races are yokai which isn't that surprising considering yokai was essentially built on the remnants of the midnight club.  When it comes to phasing, I think it causes a lot more problems than people realize. For one, it is inherently anti-rp. It's turns every race into trackmania. If you enjoy that type of driving that's cool, but it shouldn't be on an rp server. Phasing also makes all the broken cars stand out so much more. If you want to win races you essentially have to have a meta car bcus otherwise people can just drive right through you. There's no actual racing going on there, there is no way to defend your position. It makes it extremely unfun for anyone who wants to drives something that isn't a meta car. And not very fun for new people trying to get in.
Phasing killed racing. You can't find a single cool or memerable moment from a phasing race it's just people driving in circles going through the motions
I actually enjoy rp racing arc stuff like some earl rp. Some challenger of hack such as death boost, night crew racing and other. Because its make enjoyable more need watching rp in comfort on tv. But its now just lot of car remove since got copyright, even wiseguy doesnt want forcing play lot pm rp. So its probably waiting right in time to see if this better. Right now its just more windy down rp like focusing mayor election and even some happening world war due happening with simones arc. So we gonna wait until if racing rp arc to bring back pop off
i was never a big fan of racing but when they added phasing i just hated it, without it at least there where some kind of RP in it and they had to respect eachother etc now it just feels like a game inside a game
The racing scene died when streamers realized viewers weren't interested in watching people race in an RP server.
There is puppet RP, there's actually been quite a bit recently but it's more geared towards Yokai because they are the only ones who really enjoy, embrace and appreciate the puppet RP. Redline only enjoy/get involved with it when they have the chance to get yet another car, and once they get what they want, they ignore it again and talk s\*\*t about the PM.     Also, cars getting messed with constantly really changed things. Most of the racers now only want the meta cars and not the car they once called their 'dream car'. Should just have all cars the same handling/speed etc and let the drivers talent/experience do the work with none of that phasing nonsense. I understand why phasing got introduced because bubbles are awful but that shouldn't mean you can just drive straight through everyone as if you're the only one in the race. You should still have to race as if there was no phasing if you're going to use it.
Yokai created a whole arc around no phasing races and working for the puppet master. The fact Vendetta and Redline couldn’t RP around anything but sweaty time trials is their own fault they didn’t get invited to the long term RP. Is what it is.
Good.
There's probably been some times since but I miss when Marlo would be setting up the big races, then Tommy T/Babyface would be running a lot of normal races through the week (that somehow he managed to make fun for people who didn't like racing even).
I personally think racing was the best in 2.0
Phasing is the biggest part the racing scene dieing. Wiseguy left because of it. Kylie only does private yokia races. Redline pushed no phasing, alot of people liked it for awhile but it was obviously gonna get boring fast. There is 0 RP in no phasing races.
Summit left...... let's be real if he came back there would 30 person races again
One issue I saw was hard hard the cops went on racers. They could barely get out of the gate with a bunch of cops already there, ready to arrest them. Not to mention you had some rpers using NoPixel as a racing simulator and that is all they did, so they could know the tracks and win every race. As for controllers, thats an entire separate issue they could have had both controller and non controller races.
Cuz summit hasn't played lmfao
Racing died when lime light stopped. No one watching their limes
I don't think he'd even want to step back in with free reign, considering they had to nuke all brand name cars that gave the variety to tune.
>A lot of racers have said they preferred wiseguy’s car development then what they have now.  It's because the "big guy" is a control freak and instead of letting other people actually RP their characters and positions like Wiseguy who's a dev and one of his jobs is tuning and balancing the cars on the server, or like people who are in HC positions having to wait for his approval on who to hire.  [It was a problem even back 2 years ago](https://clips.twitch.tv/ProtectiveSmellyWerewolfSaltBae-EiRcJ6hR6XMNKI4v), it's like we are in a repeat episode.
True, cars are given out without handling files today, They can be cracked or really bad and no way to get a tune on them. Hopefully a dev gets picked up for cars again. Would be sick to see more cars debadged and atleast give the "meta cars" a retune
The pm rp was always supposed to be a long term arc. I remember wiseguy saying if you see puppets and x class cars every day then it doesn’t feel as special. Kinda why I felt bad when the owner gave away Earl’s car. The bolide and jesko were special cars and when you saw them you know some sick rp was about to happen. When those 2 cars got handed out, it felt like it was a slap in the face or something
"No PM rp" - wdym, there is PM rp, only for a couple of specific people that is.
Guess this will be a hot take for AnthonyZ diehards, but if 4 out 5 of the reasons racing "died" were mechanical preference issues, then the rp back bone of it probably wasn't all that great to begin with.  Tony had better rp in Tori's Elegy with no nos than in any brand car short of MAYBE some early r8 midnight heat stuff.
Everything fun.
There's still RP in the racing scene but it's only pushed by Kylie and WG.  Redline just went full phasing time trials and forgot about the RP
That's why I enjoy watching Yokai race. Redline go on constantly about 'Yokai don't race' but actually, they do race quite often, they just choose to do their own races, their way, which is no phasing. Abdul joins their races any chance he gets because he enjoys racing with them...it's his style of racing and they have fun with it and it's never a sweat fest, especially when they mix it up and throw in some 'through the eyes only' races and 'off road' races. They are just constantly laughing with eachother over radio and having fun with it.
I know phasing is Kek. Feels like a Mario Kart ghost race.   I think it had to be done to stop bubbles and stuff like that. It has always been really bad and was an improvement. Still seems silly to just glide on through another car though lol
Rip eLime Musk
Lime Minister :-(
100% agree! I also found it quite funny and very telling when watching Tony's POV and Redline members were like 'with no phasing we're all gonna finish top 10'.    POV: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1780768530?t=2h25m20s
You act as if there's no "NO PHASING" option in the racing app.
Looking at it objectively there's no correlation between when phasing was added and when people stopped racing as much - it was only after the car changes that happened.
no way, Yokai is def not the only group that embraces and appreciates the puppet rp. Ive only heard 1 streamer say that about other ppl to her chat lol     I dont think just bc people rp a different opinion of the PM than yokai that they don't appreciate the rp. Ive heard people like lilac snow vindice neutren other cops and racers all be super excited and appreciative to get the opportunity to join the pm rp
I get what you’re saying but you didn’t have to go ham like that lol. Mary and yokai did it right and have been rewarded with the pm rp. Before the shootout with redline and yokai,they had conflict that had to do with hazel. Wg was setting up some sick rp with hazel and redline but they end kicking hazel and they ignored yokai until the shootout happened couple weeks ago. I think them kicking out hazel and ignoring yokai kinda killed where wg was going with the arc.
Why is this good?  Cutting off any Avenue of RP is SHIT.  There is nothing good about that. What If business RP was removed?  Or guns removed?  Or heists?  Or restaurants?  How about store fronts?  It’s downright comical to think removing a path for RP to be a good thing.
Didn’t Marlo stop the big races because everyone got too sweaty and only cared about the money races? I may be wrong but there was definitely a reason. Its a shame since he does good with making RP outta pixel money.
Summit is part of the reason racing is dead. His bitching and moaning is what got the owner to make some of the changes he made that killed the racing scene. He comes back to the server bitches about shit, gets the owner to make changes that cater to him then he leaves again for another 6-12 months. It’s bullshit.

Nah cuz alot of things that people liked about racing got taken away because of him lol   Dude cried about nos and boom got taken away from the server.  Dude cried about controller players and boom another change happened.
There were some cars that got taken out that could have been saved. I remember wg saying Mr. K’s bentley was an easy fix to debadge. I don’t blame him if he doesn’t want to do dev work again
The issue is he takes stuff over for a bit, gets bored and then moves onto something else. I don't think the changes he made were bad, the slower car speed is better, but the cars have been left in an unbalanced stare for 4 months. Now he's lost WG as a car dev and long term the server is going to be much worse.
Owner will just adjust cars to benefit his gang like he always does. It’s why GWG left the server.
[removed]
I feel like one of NPs biggest issues is how cliquey it has become.  Like, i'm not going the call anyone out, and there would be no point in doing so, cuz its such a widespread issue, but the amount of people roleplaying with like the same 5-10 people amongst all their characters is wild.  I get wanting to play with people that have become your friends, but common, dont do so over several characters. That destroys pretty much everything interesting there is about RP. There is no more suspense, cuz you know 100% that no character is ever going to "betray" another, or even just do something unpredictable, because in most cases the character traits are quite similar and it only turns into: This is my cop that is friends with these people, this is my crim that is friends with the same people.
Maybe there wouldve been more if wiseguy didnt get so burnt out.
This is largely because most people won't play into the RP.  The people who play into the RP and treat the PM like an actual shadowy figure that is a threat to them get the PM's attention and are brought into the RP. The people who are just completely unafraid and treat the PM like a quest giver at best and a complete joke at worst are ignored, because they have to be, because they aren't playing into the RP.  Tony played into the RP a bit Big M and got plenty of attention. Lately though, he's all aboard the 'I'm not afraid of the PM' train that almost everyone else is also on, but even so GWG still gave RL an S+ boost. And it just kinda strains belief when RL spits in the PM's face and gets rewarded for it. GWG doesn't want to use admin powers to punish people, so the only other option is to ignore them.
Who cares if Tony thinks a few mechanics made it more fun for that RP? That happens with every group. Civs getting less mechanics with restaurants and the removal of the farmers market also led to less rp and a lot of people hated it. Or flip side gangs have apps to do everything for them like banks, drugs and territory wars and rp still struggles a bunch there
Youre not nderstanding that a lot of RP was aided by the mechanics at the time.   There were HUGE story lines driven by specific cars being present. Big Ms hurracan, Goofys R33, ect. People had car show RP, and night cruises, photography, and events BECAUSE there was variety and the cars were fun to drive.   When cars are fun to drive, there's exciting visuals like nos, and there is variety, more popular participate. More people participating means more RP interactions, a culture forms, and it bolsters the reality of the scene.   A combination of those things all leaving means many people go play their other character, or shift their racer to a gangster, ect and you lose that RP in the racing scene
I would tend to agree, but i also dont think its fair to have ppl like abdul get completely shunned because their bubble is so out of control.
Enable phasing so bubbles don't fuck people over, but drive as if phasing isn't on. It is a simple concept, but as soon as 1 person starts abusing phasing, everyone does.
Yeah it feels weird to hear people say that "With phasing we are going to take the top 10 for sure" It just feels like when someone goes bowling and says with the lane gutter bumpers up im gonna get all strikes.... It's like winning with training wheels attached to your bike, isnt really saying much or speaking to your skill as a racer, its just showing you know how to drive a fast car.     I feel like people need to be aware that phasing isnt racing, its time trials.
I'm trying to think of when the racing scene peaked ( I mean number wise, I don't care about people subjective definition of what is or isn't racing, people are absolutely free to prefer racing where huge bubble, no drafting and more managable local when in front mean the first place advantage is incomparable to any race game/irl, while simultaneously somehow arguing that Rally isn't racing ) and it seem to me that the biggest one was before the GNE nerf, then possibly around the first couple MRL.    Timing wise it's hard to see any correlation with phasing.
Phasing 100% is what killed the racing scene...I mean there is no racing now it's all just time trials if they took out phasing the racing scene would come back stronger than ever.........copium
"RP"  Yeah ok
I'm not sure, I wish those two did more together both have almost infinite money and are good at coming up with ideas of events for others.
no other crews stopped racing at that time so it ended up being only friends of marlo showing up to races
Summit.....cg.....bitching and moaning.....owner changes things to appease said people......more people stop watching np.....I just hope the owner realises what he's doing before the server actually dies
Nice job copy and pasting my comment lmao.
Imo the bigger issue is car models. If they have to only deal with GTA cars it's probably a much easier job. If companies start to target car models you don't have many options
GWG didn't leave the server, his just not doing dev work for cars anymore big difference.
GWG just doesn’t do any dev work and also never plays Eddie anymore, other than that, he is still very much a part of the server. He’s been on the PM and earl a little recently and he’s been playing Igor a lot.
GWG didn't leave the server though. Do you even watch any of the racing crew RP? He's literally been on Earl recently
While GWG is still around, that is the reason the owner said pushed DW over the edge. Apparently DW was complaining that the controller changes were stupid and the owner told him something along the lines of, "you're just complaining because your boys are upset."  He said that probably wasn't the actual reason DW left, but probably what made him snap.
Wasn't Tobi meant to do car balancing now? But you're half right, the owner took the responsibility from GWG cause his gang wasn't happy.
TIL chasing yokai = sexist
How does chasing Yokai instead make Brian sexist???
I agree with everything except the last sentence lol. The pd really did look silly chasing Patrick with 3 air 1’s while Earl was able to drive by the pd without being chased.
This might be the dumbest thing you've ever posted on here holy lmaooo
Coolest part of 2.0 imo. some people stopped roleplaying with the same group of 10 people they rp with on all their characters in 3.0
What made you the impression that RL spitting in the PM's face and not playing into it = NOT RP? It makes sense for Tony as a leader to not be afraid of the PM currently since he wasn't around for MONTHS. Tony won't ever be friendly with the PM when his friend Big M got killed and he got shot. PM said it himself that it's harder to control Tony so he prefers to control Mary instead. Tony doesnt want to be a puppet, Mary does. Tony doesn't want power and ambition, Mary does. PM's manipulating Mary and taking advantage of her daddy issues.  You have to reminded that half of the Redline racers especially the zoomer ones, do not have any actual PM experience and they just treat him as some boogeyman. Stop spreading false narratives that Redline only gets rewards and treats the PM as some S+ contract giver. The S+ boosts they got have RP behind it.
I don’t know if it’s true or not but that’s a bad way to go about it. If they treat his rp like a sbs/joke then I understand why wg would drop them. But saying that “not afraid of pm= not playing into rp” isn’t right.
This comment ignores all of the context of Redline kicking Hazel and taking the RP route they did. Did you even watch the Hazel being kicked from Redline RP? It was some of the more emotional rp I've seen in ages and it came from Hazel, Kitty, Goofy, and Tony in particular.  Feels like you are only really giving one POV and completely dismissing what the other sides' might be
you have NO context from the Redline side, and maybe Kylie doesn't either haha
You're misunderstanding aiding. Aiding means it enhances it or assists it in some way, not that it entirely hinges on it.  Big M's car being special wasn't because it was a hurrican it was because at the time it was the first one and ended up being sentimental attached to a character. Goofy's r33 was a 1 of 1 with a boost where a perma was on the line, but either of those car models could be swapped out and the story stays the same for either. The car model brings nothing special into the story, that's players getting excited about name brand toys over story beats.  Car shows, Night cruises, and photography are all the same. They can still happen. Nothing stops that RP from happening except for the fact that it was never about the RP for its own sake and that it was about people's shiny toys.  Nothing about the racing scene that's talked about here besides PM HAD to change. Players let it change because they didn't like the toys. But it's all still there. Goofy still has his drone and photomode, kitty still almost died for the sake of a race, people can still drive cars together at night.
I didn't say he doesn't race with Redline aswell but racing with Yokai is a different vibe, Abdul has said so himself. I have no issues with Redline, I'm a viewer of them aswell, I'm simply just stating Yokai races are much more fun to watch. Good for them for hosting some no phasing and off road races, I hope they enjoy it and do it more often.
Abdul joins yokai no phasing races and hasn’t been yelled at once yet
Watching races with phasing on is so goddanm boring....it's just a bunch of guys doing timetrials together. It used to be so much more exciting without phasing but people with huge egos ruined it for everyone
I can agree with that for sure. It did enable that sort of behavior.  Of course NP doesn’t punish people for shit they should punish for lol.
Nerdge I only watch RP scripted by William Shakespeare
Just because you don’t like something doesn’t mean it’s not good. The racing crews were some great RP, especially when The Puppet Master was around. Big M, Earl. The storylines that came from that. The PM introducing the heists.  Not to mention the RP it gave the PDs  Yea it has some bad facets like GNE. I really wish racing was more of an secretive, underground thing.  It should have been more rare.   All this being said, to say it’s not RP is a joke.
Rp means role play. Do you think tony is actually a street racer?? Or it’s just that racing rp is not your preference?
ya dunno how to repost shit on this site :(
Tobii has done a few car tunes recently but he was learning how to tune on the fly. He can adjust tunes but he doesn't really have the experience to balance cars. Tobii's To-Do list is also massive and he does so much already. Balance is all sorts of fucked up right now, there are a handful of S+ cars that are tuned to S++, and a few S++ that are tuned as baseline S+ cars. Not to mention the S++ kanjo sj that barely makes it to 100mph.
Earl crashed into rhodes and both just drove away from each other
>What made you the impression that RL spitting in the PM's face and not playing into it = NOT RP?  Nothing, which is why I never said that.  What I said is it isn't playing into the PM RP.  If you choose not to get a bar license then you aren't buying into lawyer RP.  If you choose not to join a gang then you aren't buying into gang RP.  People choose what type of RP they want to engage with, and there's nothing wrong with that. You can't engage with all types of RP, you have to pick and choose.  There's nothing wrong with AnthonyZ choosing to have Tony react to the PM that way. But when he's obviously over the PM IC, you can't then say it's GWG's fault for not including him.  &#x200B;  >Tony won't ever be friendly with the PM when his friend Big M got killed and he got shot.  It's not about the lack of friendliness.  It's about the lack of fear.  &#x200B;  >PM said it himself that it's harder to control Tony so he prefers to control Mary instead. Tony doesnt want to a puppet, Mary does. Tony doesn't want power and ambition, Mary does. PM's manipulating Mary and taking advantage of her daddy issues.  The PM is manipulating both of them. Tony is harder to control because Mary is a believer, and Tony is a mercenary.  Tony has no fear of the PM but will jump to do his bidding as soon as a S+ contract is dangled in front of him. If the PM wants Tony to do something all he has to do is offer a car.  Mary is a bit more complicated. She wants a father figure more than anything, which is why the PM poses as one in order to manipulate her.  This makes her easier to control because she's a believer and will follow him without the need for material reward.  &#x200B;  >Stop spreading false narratives that Redline only gets rewards and treats the PM as some S+ contract giver  I never said, nor implied, that he only provides rewards to redline. We can have a conversation but it won't be productive if you don't stop creating strawmen.
Yea, maybe fear isn't the right word... I think respect is probably the better term.  They don't treat him like a shadow figure that controls GNE, Racing, and boosting and therefore can hurt them in various ways, not just physically.
perma on the line? what are you even smoking XD   pm rp works if ppl believe and care about the fear on the charecter , but when you have most of the city saying fk the pm why would he give them rp , why waste your time around groups that just want free S+ boosts and 5 min later are saying fk the pm XD
I understand the word "aiding" and chose my vocabulary correctly.      By all means, you are allowed to think physical items or mechanics being removed should not change the story, but it absolutely DOES for many of the players and story lines.  Which to the point that I was \*actually\* making: it leads to many players being less invested or interested in continuing those stories, some players move on to other RP or characters, and slowly the racing RP hits a lull in participation.  "The car model brings nothing special into the story." Big M's Huracan was a PD eye-catching vin-scratched Huracan, not a four door sedan. Goofy's R33 was a 1/1 being investigated, not a 1/25 R34s. The past stories stay the same, and those people continue to RP that history. BUT the continuation of the RP those \*specific\* cars died with the removal of them: being used as part of an identity for new personas, target for bounties, or as a focus for an investigations. Cars are part of a racer character's identity and story (think of Titanium's Banshee)  Car shows, night cruises, and photography all died down because there are only so many of those activities players will attend when the cars are not enjoyable to drive and the same 10 models available from the car reimbursement system with no history or character story behind them show up to every event.  Goofy and his son still do photography, Kitty still RPs that she almost died to a PM mission, people still race and drive cars together at night. BUT less people participating in the racing RP and unenjoyable mechanical changes mean less activity and enjoyment overall.
Dude, they rarely ever even talk to each other. Hell, their cars can't even touch. It's a joke.
Wait you are telling me his isn't a duck either
I think he's RPing that he's playing Forza. That's about it.
Isn't he a  sweaty malder?
I can imagine Tobii has alot to do. He's basically lead Dev now because of the DW issues, car stuff shouldn't be his responsibility.  The owner really has screwed this up. I can understand WG may not have been to everyone's taste or quickness, but he at least knew what he was doing.
not all of RL have the same opinion tho. Tony hates the PM, he killed his friend and isn't some mysterious figure. older racers like LJ, malakai and goofy are afraid of him bc they know what the pm can do but the new racers have never even seen or heard from a puppet. Even if theyre warned to respect him or be afraid why would they?
I agree but honestly PM needs to be around more or have bigger representation. He’s barely around therefore people don’t really try to be on pm’s side because he shows up once in a blue moon. It’s kinda hard to focus on PM’s arc and what he wants when he disappears without any follow up. Also people fear Lang and CG more because they have connections but most importantly influence all around the city, PM doesn’t really have that kind of influence. I would argue that even in the racing scene his influence isn’t as big as you would think. But honestly all these problems come from PM not being active, he can easily gain that influence.
Bucky never spoke before so his rp was bad according to your logic
Ah so you just don't watch him. Having an opinion is fine but it should at least be based on reality and not complete ignorance
Sure, 1 character nonverbally interacting with a bunch of people that do talk to him is exactly the same thing as a dozen people doing absolutely nothing but simultaneous time trials
Look, I got nothing against him. I meant specifically while racing. I have absolutely no opinion of him specifically. Just that racing is only racing.  Unrelated, but I also have no opinion on the PM stuff, because I haven't seen it. I've heard that stuff is cool, but idk. I just know the day to day is nothing.
>Unrelated, but I also have no opinion on the PM stuff, because I haven't seen it.   That is related. Again, I'm just pointing out your very negative opinion seems to be based on complete ignorance of the RP
What? I'm saying when they go from race to race without talking to each other (which is almost the entirety of racing) its not rp. Sorry, but it's not.  You can watch hours of racing and see almost zero human interaction much of the time
Is that what Tony/Anthonyz is doing?

It's been deleted, What did the tweet say?
Some of those comments are just ew
I feel so bad for her man. She (and the other women) deserve better.
Rated is a real piece of garbage. Dude did a speed run of harassing every girl on the server
Damn, Rated really fumble the bag and girl. WOW, what a downfall.
I'm a bit out of the loop, did they have a real relationship or was it online only like the other girl that had posted stuff about him recently? I saw she said 3 years which is a long time so was just curious.
[https://i.imgur.com/42QlAQI.png](https://i.imgur.com/42QlAQI.png)  Her tweet.
Something along the lines of don’t let people keep your relationship secret  And she just wanted to be loved
If that’s what he’s banned for that’s crazy not saying it’s good but shit happens not something for your so called family and basically everyone you know to turn on you
It's not a speedrun when this was happening for years.
Rated is an asshole 100%   You have an agenda 100%  I feel so bad for her and here you are using her tweets to try and attack other people. You don't seem like a nice guy either.
That last line, man. That's heartbreaking
She was kept a secret so he could try to get with other women and she just let that happen. Abusive relationships really do break people
That's sad to hear. I've never watched her apart from a video or two, I didn't know they were in a relationship with each other.
It's a speedrun when there's a lot of women to harass
[removed]
>you can't say because he was a part of a group that they know everything in his life  For real like do people tell their friend group about every message they send to everyone Or how they treat there significant other
This is a bit too much calling them human trash. You’re no better than them when they go on rants and do dumb shit.
The fact that she could do so much better too, dude probably never even showed his face to her. Crazy what relationship rp could do to a person
If I’m not mistaken, her relationship before rated wasn’t the greatest either
we could phrase it like that and put the blame on her, or we could hold the person actually responsible accountable.
You could phrase it like that, or could read a statement of fact
That's not logic, that's a false equivalency. Nice try though.
blaming a person's victims for them having more victims is always the most stupidest take you could have. why not just blame the person for being so terrible that they have victims? like it makes no sense.
Who blamed anyone? I swear as soon as the topic of abuse comes off people just turn their fucking brains off lmao

Watching this from Bloom's perspective when he and Rose first met up with Charlotte to now has been one of the funniest scenarios I've seen. Amazing job from everyone involved.
Wrangler and Charlotte together is amazing. They bounce off each other so well
Poor sweatbox, she flew too close to the sun.
Poor Charlotte, just trying to get her money back and she gets Wrangled again.
Isn't this the 2nd time Wrangler's done something like this to Charlotte? But that was back when he was under Pred.  Toretti's reaction should be interesting.
Rose is very quietly a huge griefer. Can't be part of the SDSO without it. Always great to see her around this
 YOU BETRAYED THE LAW!!!!
Sweatbox Madge
Halfway is a streamer who converted her chance and made something of it.  Penta interacts with a lot of relatively unknown streamers.  Most of them aren't able to carry viewers once their interactions with Penta end.  She's often able to carry 150 viewers on days where she doesn't interact with him at all and over 600 on Penta waiting room days.  She's super wholesome and I'm happy for all the success she's been having.  For someone with no RP experience, she really has been carving out a community for herself just like Moose was able to with his chance.
I am not evil!
Wrangler is misunderstanding constructive possession, I seriously doubt this stands if it gets appealed.  I also don't think he even had grounds to order Freddy out of the car in the first place, it wasn't a traffic stop where he can invoke Penn vs. Mimms nearly automatically and I'm pretty sure there's a carve out in the mask mandate for wearing it in your own car. He might be able to articulate his way into to the DL check because Freddy was driving earlier, or even that might get tossed because of the unlawful order.
ngl this whole situation explains a lot of the current USA cop issues  on one hand you have wrangler, abusing his powers as a police officer to rob a person of 250k USD, zero consequences  on the other hand you have charlotte, reprimanded multiple times for being friends with felons/criminals

You're not wrong
She's a gem
Wish a Rose POV was up. Seemed like she was the driving force for a lot of the "Wrangler owes 250k to Charlotte" narrative. Would have enjoyed to see how this all spun out and really getting to dig into the relationship that Charlotte and Wrangler have with one another. Because it's one thing to get the spun version from either side but it's a totally different beast seeing it all evolve.
Penta seems to really enjoy when Wrangler finds an excuse to arrest the same officers he trains/rides with.
I think Charlotte the character is a better civ/crim. She should join the HOA, perfect fit really. Make another cop character if she still wants to be a cop.
[LAAAAAW](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aaubVlhNK4)
Honestly she has gotten lucky with tons of things and for good reason. To think that with the new application system she wouldn't even be able to join the server is insane.  Wrangler finding her and getting her to be a cop   Her getting fired oddly saving her job the first time getting her picked up by the SDSO avoiding UPD   Halfway manages to really run with so much good rp and the opportunities brought to her. And it's really crazy seeing a roleplayer who sticks to their character even in OOC scenarios like today where she has the possible desire to want to keep being a cop but know Charlotte would be pissed enough to not want to accept this from wrangler again.  She knows Freddy would easily take being snitched on for her no problem but Charlotte not feeling like she should have to do that.  Honestly on of the finest roleplayers discovered this last year
She had years of grueling neopets RP.
Quick, get on the server and become a lawyer and get on this case!
Easy, Wrangler just says he knew he had a revoked license from the start and then has all the PC to search him and his car.   Also, constructive possession is if the person does not have it on the person but is aware of its presence, and has, both the power and intent to control its disposition or use. She admitted to knowing he was in a gang war, and from that, you can infer she knew he most likely had a firearm on him.
According to Freddy, he had left the car, ran around and re-entered the car while they were talking, therefore he was outside a motor vehicle while masked = frisk.
Wrong
No, it really doesn't. Both of the situations you described are so ridiculous and way beyond anything that could have real life comparisons. In real life both of them would have been fired without question.  Also, Charlotte isn't simply friends with like an ex-felon trying to their turn lives around.  She is in a relationship with someone with triple digit attempted murders of police officers who is still actively in a gang and participating in a gang war and he has committed many crimes since they got into a relationship including some while she was in his presence.

Your right...she truly is a gem
She's the one who heard about it first. Freddy Fastfingers and Rose are on good terms (maybe friends? Not sure) and Freddy told Rose about the fake kidnapping and taking of money. Rose then brought it to Toretti, and it all led to this. Rose was 100% in for the gaslighting all the way up to Charlotte getting arrested, then she started looking a little nervous about the demon she helped feed.   Great RP
You know damn well they are not going to hire any more cops any time soon lol.  Also Charlotte fits a lot better as a cop. She isn't good at mechanics/crime  Halfway is a great role-player and great at talking and creating scenarios through talking. Being a cop doing things like traffic stops and being a partner allow for that a lot easier than doing bank jobs or gang wars as a criminal. Even in a really RP focused gang like the HOA
Oh god, is this the halfway rp lore
So he can lie in court and win? Yeah, we knew that, which is why he doesn't.  I don't see how being aware someone likely has a firearm on them satisfies the rest of constructive possession. What was her intent to control its dispositon or use? Someone else has a better claim on the item, which usually demands greater evidence or precludes constructive possession.
look man dont know if we read the same news but cops IRL do some disgusting shit with disappointing consequences :(    how many characters on nopixel do you think have felonies on their record? bc for USA the percentage is \~8%, i would guess for nopixel that percentage is way higher    regarding the triple digit attempted murders, thats just not a thing IRL right, they would be in prison for life at least, or way more likely they would be dead by the third cop shooting    i dunno, the culture in nopixel-world is way different than IRL, and as such i feel like the general morals should be adjusted as well for the sake of RP, would you prefer cops and crims to be isolated groups or for interactions between them? a lot of cops go for the hardass approach, sympathetic cops feel nice to see just as a breath of fresh air (not to mention interesting rp as well)    also, on a certain level i am kinda disgusted by charlottes bosses trying to control her personal out-of-work life, if my boss tried to pull that shit on me i would be looking for a new job ASAP (sure the situation is different bc the job is being a cop, but still man its the nopixel pd baas tortured a person and wasnt fired, the entire saga of gunner is absurd, clarkson has done a lot of fucked up shit, pred is a serial arsonist ...)    i just feel like it doesnt make sense to think about felonies in the same way as irl since people are immortal and jail is 30min
All jokes aside, it is a real problem though. There are cops who has criminal friends but only a handful of them actually go off duty to spend time with the criminals. Wrangler always tested Charlotte on this because he noticed early during her cadet phase that she has a lot of criminal friends. Would she arrest one of her friends if they commit a crime in front of her?  I think she is very loyal and would never betray her friends so I can see Wrangler push for firing or cut off this relationship. Tomorrow will be interesting meeting toretti.
Yea, [check it out](https://youtu.be/Bw-7AKybE9c).
That refers to the ability to be able to control the illegal item i.e. it being in the glovebox where it is easily accessible by the party in question. It would be harder to press if the illegal item was inside the trunk, but when it's within arm's reach it can be a bit blanketed.  Also, Wrangler has been known to change his PC after the fact to justify his searches and stops. Should he be doing this? Probably not, but it's not really corruption just a bit dirty.  Just because someone claims it doesn't mean he HAS to only charge the one, but most officers do for a slam-dunk confession.
What you're describing, adjusting behavior due to mechanics and the fact it's a video game where there aren't any real consequences, could be argued to be FailRP.   Ultimately, different strokes for different folks, but I prefer when they at least pretend to act like it's a real city with real consequences.
The thing about Charlotte is she is one of very few cops who rp having an off duty life. Which is really hard to do in a server where 50% of the player-base commit crime at least once a day. She also set up with Freddy that he fully understand she will snitch on him if it ever comes down to him being investigated or her making a statement about things she witnessed with him.    She has seen him stab a cop and shoot another and given full accurate witness statements with zero lies or omissions. (Funny being both times the cops purposely egged him on to assault them)  I think out of a lot of the cops that do date criminals she is one of the few that make an active effort to try and avoid getting mixed into crime. It's just really difficult to know every single little thing. Watching a day of her off duty life you'd be surprised how many times she runs away from people about to do something criminal let alone the people who purposely do it to fuck with her.
https://casetext.com/case/us-v-bailey-210
i meant it more as adjust it according to behaviour of los santos citizens, everyone behaves as if getting shot is just a booboo, not a life-threatening situation    sure, i would prefer more consequences as well, but also the city is what it is, the citizens are pretty crazy, and the pd trying to be normal (irl-esque) is kinda jarring for me tbh    also again feels like preventing cops from hanging out with crims is kinda anti-rp imo
I think more cops would be willing to do off duty rp if they had actual prio beyond cop queue. You’re not supposed to use cop queue if you’re planning on RPing off duty for large stretches.
This guy thinks it's real!
So first off just because there is a certain case law doesn't mean NoPixle DOJ interprets it the same as the US Supreme Court.  So the caselaw you quoted derives its decision from an extension of United States vs. Birmley section 107-108, however, Charlotte's testimony in the interrogation can be used to prove that she MAY have known that the gun was there due to knowing that Freddy was a known criminal, gang member, and currently in a gang war. It might not land, but it is 100% enough to have it heard by a judge.  Let me read through Bailey again since I haven't in a few years, but I am pretty sure we have overcome the barrier that case law set.  edit I read through Bailey again :peeporope:  So in the end this is what Bailey comes down to; "\[t\]here must be some action, some word, or some conduct that links the individual to the \[contraband\] and indicates that he had some stake in \[it\], some power over \[it\]." This is where the confession can have a strong angle against her, but in general use, you can say every time someone checks their pockets in NoPixle inside a car they then have constructive possession of anything in that glovebox.
>i meant it more as adjust it according to behaviour of los santos citizens, everyone behaves as if getting shot is just a booboo, not a life-threatening situation  Yeah, that's... that's FailRP. It's just the current culture to accept it.  It's one thing to let standards slip, but then getting mad at someone for not letting their standards slip is another thing.  Like, if other people want to roleplay that getting shot is just a boo-boo, whatever, not my favorite, but it is what it is, but if I roleplay that getting shot is serious, I'm not the bad guy.  Or, to put it another way, if I shot someone in rp, and they fucking died, I don't get to go "But no one else dies when I shoot them!?"  Edit: Also, wdym it's anti RP? This IS RP, that's coming directly from her hanging out with criminals, something she is allowed to do. This isn't a dramatic thing ooc. This is good RP.
For sure. And it would also help the civilian life a lot more in the server. Right now the only option for cops it to choose from like 2 civilians in a crowd of 30 criminals half the time to match with. Which is a bit constrictive.
>Edit: Also, wdym it's anti RP? This IS RP, that's coming directly from her hanging out with criminals, something she is allowed to do. This isn't a dramatic thing ooc. This is good RP.  just in general such a policy feels like it would negatively restrict rp, though i might be too interested in the possibility of rehabilitation of felons, which feels incredibly impossible in such us vs them mentalities    >Or, to put it another way, if I shot someone in rp, and they fucking died, I don't get to go "But no one else dies when I shoot them!?"  wasnt there a law introduced that makes cop deaths mean less if it was during a call? in the sense of time for 1st degree murder is at most 3 years or smth like that, not sure
Yeah, but that's a server mechanic rule, not roleplay (the ping thing). And I don't think it's policy to not hang out with crims. It might be Wrangler's policy, but really, it stems from Wrangler being over-protective.   If they made it a rule that gunshots were nbd, then that'd be different. Until they do, I lowkey consider anyone who goes "Oh, just shot, nbd, get me up" to be failRPing.   And that's not like, the end of the world. That's just the culture on the server at the moment. It varies from time to time how much people roleplay their injuries.  But they ARE supposed to roleplay injuries.
Choi called this out early 3.0 too. The management was arguing with her about it too. No pixel need to look into their management also if they really care about this situation.
She is kinda right. NoPixel seems to only care about taking action if it hurts the NoPixel brand. Whenever something bad (i.e. the recent homophobic stuff happening on NoPixel Arab) gets posted on here (more so on LSF), they really start to do something before it makes them look bad. Yeah they got rid of Rated but it gives questions/theories/speculations on why NP took too long to make this decision when the evidence has been floating around from previous victims (i.e. Kylie & Cath). Why did they take this long to do it now?
Yeah, management did the right thing today, but the only reason that Rated was able to build the platform that he has is because his previous indiscretions were not taken seriously because NP is a \*content\* server and Randy was \*content.\*   The fact that Rated was allowed to get away scot-free with so much or with a slap on the wrist is why he had such unequal power over the women that he harassed and victimized, and why it took women so long to notify management about his behavior.
Glad it’s being brought up more by people. The ‘management’ at NP is absolute garbage. They deserve credit for taking the action they have against Rated but arguably only doing it because it’s public now. Hobbit, and some others have echoed. How long has this type of stuff been enabled by staff?
Rated should have been perma banned years ago on server rule breaks alone. If nopixel enforced it's rules equally think how many women would have been spared from dealing with this fucking creep? Hell, I'm not even against treating larger streamers with a softer touch. I'm aware Nopixel isn't in this for the good of their hearts but even in that situation Rated, and quite frankly most of his group, have wiped their ass with the servers stated rules and the people on it for years. Even if nopixel has a protected class there should still be a limit to how much that lets people get away with. Rated pushed well past that limit and beyond, he was given no limits and it HURT people.  If there was any time to turn this ship around, the time is now. Not that I expect any of it to change. Even today in Nopixels enlighted email asking potential victims of rated to come forward they referred to them as "females". Like JFC. We'll be back here again.
Maybe i'm wrong, but this situation is also partly NP manager fault. Publicly telling that some people and groups are untouchable and activly protecting them are enabling that's behavior.
Remember when Choi got her prio removed when she called out the admin team for being sexist?   She got removed because of allegations without proof sure, but what she was saying was also a brand risk.   Now look at where we are.
I mean she is not wrong at all. Rated have been treating the women of the server like dirt for years under the protection of management so no one could fight him back and it took until multiple people stepping forward for them to actually even consider doing anything.
Crazy that all the same people who have been complaining about this issue for years are all getting validated. NP staff needs to take a good long look in the mirror. Between 2.0 and the PD wipe, now is a great time for them to look inward and recognize the OOC problems the server has with the way the staff treats women.
Show me the lie.  People are giving NP credit for doing the "right thing" now but just imagine if they applied punishments to people that broke their own rules over and over again how many people could've been spared this type of treatment.  Time for an overhaul.
The fact they apparently needed to have a vote to decide whether to ban him should tell you there are MAJOR problems on the server. Why the hell would a vote be needed if it's this serious? If the vote wasn't unanimous would he still be on the server?     I sincerely hope this is a major wake-up call for both the server and the players acting like dicks.
When insertnamehere's entire personality when he plays on the character he hangs out with insertganghere, is gay jokes, it really isn't that hard to figure out. He's an enabler and it's only a problem now because a victim has threatened to sue.  EDIT: Thinking more, all of insertganghere are enablers. There is no fucking way they didn't know this, and of course they drop his ass instantly when legal action is threatened too.
isn’t she the one who outed a girl’s trauma without permission to get someone cancelled only for it to backfire on her?
Brings up an interesting notion, should NP management and "he who shall not be named" face some sort of consequence for allowing/looking the other way for as long as they did or does it just stop with his removal?
> I was ganged up on in Twitter DMS by three admins, interrogated by them about what I knew about the situation.  > It was made clear to me in the "conversation" they were only there for a PR cleanup, and I told them point blank I would not be removing anything from Twitter and that I would never return to Nopixel.    Sounds like another cleanup round is required.

i mean not to piss on anyone bonfire, but the 'interesting how nopixel is STILL dealing with sexual assault/harassment allegation after all this time' is the most disingenuous shit ive ever read.  News flash so is 99.999999999% of all other professions in the world.  its a massive fucking issue everywhere.  this rated dude, clearly a fucking disturbed grub of a human being, scum tbh.  but as ive seen some write in here, people IRL have done the most disturbed shit ever and the people who live with them, been married to them, the closest people have 0 clue.  the expectation we should have from the community is: if they have an incline is to investigate get proof and get rid.  being a malding idiot, is completely different then being a scumbag.
I never spoke publicly about the issue because it was such a traumatic event for me.      After speaking out about two sexual assault/harassment cases that the admin team swept completely under the rug for MONTHS, I spoke out for two friends on Twitter last year      The reason I left though was the appalling response that the admin team gave, even after being called out publicly.      I was ganged up on in Twitter DMS by three admins, interrogated by them about what I knew about the situation.      It was made clear to me in the "conversation" they were only there for a PR cleanup, and I told them point blank I would not be removing anything from Twitter and that I would never return to Nopixel.      I stand by what I said when I left. Admin team, do better.      Also last thing since I'm finally speaking up about it for myself- I cried for weeks when I left. I lost so much by speaking out. I lost friends, I lost fans, and followers. I don't regret a single thing though and I would do it all again because it was the right thing to do.
Will there ever be a #freeChoi movement? I don't think so.
I mean, and I'm not trying to discredit or try to make them seem less important in any way, but when you have so many people, some people will turn out to be shitty human beings. The important things are 1) how things are dealt with and 2) trying to create an atmosphere that makes people comfortable bringing up issues like this either publicly or privately to admins with faith they will actually take it seriously.
Rated is a loser and deserves to be gone, and the victims deserve to be heard.   Reading alot of comments I would be curious to the answers to an /Amitheasshole post of "some loser in my friend group that worked for my company was found out to have been a creepy dickhead womanizer online so am I the asshole?"   I dont understand why people are so quick to do the guilty by association thing. Let's celebrate this victory and celebrate the women who were brave enough to say something. Not condemn everyone that knew this guy.   There are people that thought Ted Bundy was a good dude, they didn't kill people. Subway used Jared Fogel as a spokesperson for years, they sell sandwiches, not pass around CP.  People, please stop taking focus away from the actual issue because you hate other streamers on the server. All these speculation, unsourced allegation comments don't help anything.   NP should be receptive to reports of this behavior, no matter the size of streamer, the end.
Yes he was very obviously a toxic piece of shit. Yes he probably should have been banned for the public actions that have been well documented and discussed. Saying that, there is a massive leap between toxic comments he's well known for making and the active sexual harassment he's been engaged in with multiple women.   While I don't think NP should necessarily be applauded for removing a serial harasser from the community I would say the claims that management/admins enabled this behavior aren't at all warranted. Until evidence is provided to the contrary I'm under the impression he was removed as soon as proof of the allegations was provided.  Let's just hope that the removal of such a big name gives other women the courage to come forward. That is really the only thing that should matter here, not trying to use hindsight to divvy up the blame for his despicable actions.
Not liking someone isn’t abuse, I wanna clarify that, regardless of gender or sexuality. So coming at people as a whole for the actions of a clearly demented idiot isn’t it.  I agree with a lot of takes, but to defend a little bit here NP here if they had no reason or very little concrete reason to believe this dude was a weird ass donny, then they ain’t at fault, they got the proof and got rid of his ass.
"interesting how nopixel is STILL dealing sexual assault/harassment allegations after all this time"  I mean these issues exists everywhere, it's a problem with society & people. The important thing is to take action when there is strong evidence, which they've done here.
Nah I can’t take her seriously when she also did some bad shit in the past with that leak and what happened with that. I’m glad Rated is gone, don’t get me wrong on that. Should have happened a while back.
That’s hard to police when there’s always two sides to stories and you have hundreds of different fairly anonymous, sometimes socially awkward people interacting from all over the world. There’s always going to be issues when you have a population of that size, It’s easy to throw stones when it’s you’re not part of the team having to sift through the mess, before making a life changing decision.

Thought I was the only one who remembered her getting banned for calling the enabling out. https://i.imgur.com/k0tyH19.png
I miss Choi
Choi, Suzy, LuckyxMoon, so many women have left the server because of management defending the garbage that happens. The fact so many have complained about it but stuck it out is a testament to how great the community is as a whole. But management has to do something about these people, because we’re at a boiling point.
They should learn a lesson from this. Rated was always a toxic shithead. Literally always was and always has been probably always will be. Toxic people do shit like this ALL the time. This is what happens when you enable and empower terrible human beings. He should have been permabanned years ago and none of this would have happened.
couldn't agree more, well written!
[removed]
I’m betting that they’ll have some big “This kind of behavior should never have been tolerated, and will not be tolerated going forward”, then for like a month or two everybody will chill with sexist and harassment shit, before starting to backslide, until a few months from now the only difference from before this happened is Rated is no longer on the server.
It absolutely fucking was part of the problem.     Some people are so fucking catered to and handheld, and then worshipped by their stans, that they feel like they're immune to any and all consequences.    This subreddit and others have numerous posts documenting misogyny in the server, with nothing fucking done - sometimes even encouraged or participated in by some staff.
Enabling the behavior is a HUGE part of the problem.
You're definitely not wrong.
Not only did they protect them, but they also went after women who did speak up. Look at the stuff that happened to Vale. They fucking demoted her and gave her SWAT unit to fucking AJ Hunter.
Bans and prio loss getting dished out to some people who have complained about this stuff before... yea, spot on. You can argue that they went about it poorly all you want, but its pretty hard to know the line.
there has been accusations about him for over a year with 2 people coming forward but he was fine until now so you're not wrong
this is absolutely part of the problem. Management caved to people throwing their clout around to avoid consequences to their toxicity. The current situation is the logical conclusion and completely enabled by numerous people. Only once something happens that puts the brand at risk are actions taken.
you are 100% right they allow these toxic groups to stay on their server and get away with all kinds of bullshit getting rid of just 1 of them isnt even scratching the surface
I don't disagree, but the second best time to start making a change is now.
what do you mean it took multiple people stepping forward, are you seriously suggesting that NP staff knew about this going on and only took action when more women came forward? since when? The "proof" the original woman gave a bit ago was hardly proof of a one sided abusive relationship.
When “females” are asked to come forward management ain’t doing shit until it’s a brand risk.
If you’re talking about the incident that got her banned, the person she tried to expose was a small streamer. The shitty part is the “victim” didn’t want any of it out in public but she leaked it anyway, doing a shoddy job of “censoring” names and not deleting her post even when people called her out on that.  Turns out it was a toxic relationship on both ends and was something that both sides wanted to keep private.
This isn’t it bro lol. Suzi went to Twitter without the victims permission and couldn’t even censor the names right.  She caused way more harm than she did good.
Nopixel is a business and that would be their standard process. It was unanimous anyways. That’s the smart way to handle things rather than just leaving things to one person with bias. Obviously this was a easy perma ban but that doesn’t mean they wouldn’t still follow their normal practices.
The voting was to remove him completely from the community not just a perma ban. NP/CG let this guy off the hook for years and thats on them.
Also, in that clip, he fumbles saying something like "practically everyone, well everyone voted him out" so it seemed like there was a minority that had been overruled.
This might end up saving NP. The last few months in my mind the server will reach a point where major streamers will leave like what happened to familyRP.  But this ban might help them make positive changes at the top. I just love GTA RP and the streamers I watch all play on it. So I'm hoping the server improves and streamers don't have to deal with all this drama in the future.
So there’s no power abuse? Why would you not vote
They took part in a lot of the on server/stream harassment too. Look at how the rest of them treated Pond or Vale or Angel. They may not have solicited women (who knows though!) but they definitely weren’t treating these women well publicly themselves.
Chances are they didn't know about the WORST things he has done in detail, but they were right there alongside him doing countless shitty things.
[removed]
Probably why the information was so vague untill they were forced to elaborate.
Might be about time NoPixel Management take a long good look at the other people that are under their protection and consider doing something about it because they are enabling the wrong people with it and have for years now.
Has any woman came forward and said NP ignored their complaints about rated in regards to this? If not why are people acting like NP is to blame for any of this. I haven't seen any proof, or anyone mention NP was silencing their allegation.
She leaked private dms and made a poor attempt at hiding the names, yeah.  It wasn't even a Nopixel thing, it was drama between 2 people who had just broken up.
Yeah she's fighting the good fight, but she did mess up in that instance, and kind of double downed rather than admit fault.  She leaked a letter from the admins that they would not be taking action on a case because the accuser had made contact with the accused after requesting there be no contact, so that it wouldn't be reasonable to ban the accused for making contact back. I don't remember it verbatim, but it was something like that. She did a very poor job blacking out the accused's name, so she also leaked who the letter was about.  She got defensive when people were asking details about what the person did wrong, because all the admin letter ultimately said is they found no wrongdoing.  She then shared images of sexual harassment DM's that a friend of her had gotten. She did not clarify that the sexual harasser was a completely different individual than the person who's name she leaked, which lead a lot of people to believe she was providing the evidence about the first situation.  It was a mess, and during the whole thing she never took down the tweet that leaked the guys name.
I mean if there’s evidence that the admin team knew what was happening and looking the other way it’s a completely different story. But like others have said, toxic behaviour in game is very different to SH out of the game. A lot of people are assuming the admin team knew about his behaviour outside of the game for months/years.
They didn’t treat many of the women much better themselves. Pond, Vale, and Angel - all female cops they consistently treated like dirt.
This is a prime example of why, hating a group is stupid.  Are CG angels… no  Are they all rateds… no  People IRL hide the most disgusting disturbing shit from there closest love ones with no signs what so ever.  But you expect, a group of people to see what he was doing and his true disgusting self, when they never met him, and more then likely 99% of the conversations with him was over discord or in gta?   Be realistic please
Very disingenuous imo. I think they have shown to take stuff like seriously when it comes to light and there’s evidence of that. Unfortunately it’s one of those things that can only be acted upon once someone comes forward to them and even more unfortunate, is that people don’t often come forward straight away and I totally understand why it’s not easy. A lot more people started talking in regards to Rated once the first women went public about their relationship and now this happened but the first person got a backlash and she can’t even have comments enabled on some of her Twitter posts.
CG Participated and enabled his behaviour. Their entire gang has bullied and abused people on the server for years now and if anyone says anything they get banned or punished to an extreme degree in RP. Just look at Vale, she had everything taken from her and the SWAT command given to AJ Hunter. CG and the server management created the environment that allowed him to abuse those people.
Just because his associates didn't partake in the private sexual harassment, doesn't mean they weren't part of the very public and documented toxic behavior they were openly doing together. Behavior that made many players time on the server unfun, was covered for by management and helped foster the environment where his more private and heinous garbage happened because his group scared people into not reporting them.  Keep in mind that the public harassment they've done would be enough to have any normal player perma banned from the server years ago. You're acting like pkayers should only be punished if they're sexually harassing people in dms.
Yep. At this point, the admins here are just allowing rampant hate. It seems like “unsourced allegations” just isn’t a thing.
When you allow some people to break the rules or not punish them like everyone else you're making a precedent for bad behavior and that is on admins and staff.
Because it got to the point it could possibly bring lawsuits against NoPixel and you know who.  This could be the main reason it finally happened.  Rated was protected.
Nopixel gets them out after damage is done. Ideally Nopixel would work on making it so there weren't so many people on the server running around abusing and harassing people in the first place. Its hard to give props for actions when those actions tend to coincide with a potential threat to the business, as opposed to actions taken for the right reasons.
It’s wild man lol.   It’s like people here on this Reddit think that NP wants this type of stuff on their server and condones it. It would be insane for them to want to deal with this stuff.
im already way more successful on fansly than I ever was on twitch, so there's really no need for me to promote it LUL

Hon replying yikes there is just so awkward. If you have no counter argument that is probably the most pathetic reply you can come up with if you are making one. Such a childish response to someone providing you with an argument and honestly just disrespectful.
That’s a *yikes* from me Hon… hope these guys learn something and try to be better going forward, because the way they’ve been doing things up until now fostered such a cesspool of toxicity in the community.
Hon and owner replies are 🚩
I mean Choi is right here but I remember her getting banned for something completly different. I don't know what exactly it was but I think it was some OOC Rant/Tantrum or Powergaming
He could have been permabanned before he even got a chance to do this shit by his toxicity alone.   He wasn't even the biggest fish in the pond in terms of lucrative benefits! Why he was kept so long is something I don't want to know.

The chorus to their anthem: “Tell that bitch that I’m Chang Gang”  Edit: I wanna make this clear, I don’t think that PMoney has anything against women. I really like PMoney and he seems like a cool dude. I just think it’s ironic that their anthem literally uses the derogatory word bitch, and given the way CG treats women, it’s very telling they love it.
Dude!!  I forgot that it was given to AJ of all people.  Such a bad look and lets not pretend that there weren't TONS of signs before this.
holy fucking shit i forgot they did all this and then gave it to fucking AJ
Remember what happened to Kylie in 2.0? They grinded her into submission so hard until she got to the point where she’s maybe fired 50 bullets in the entirety of 3.0. She literally let Izzy get fired from VLC because she didn’t want to upset Ramee. She’s so whipped by CG she doesn’t even realize it anymore. Her tweet about Rated has maybe opened her eyes, but how does it get to this point?
Hopefully it doesn’t stop here because it never should’ve gotten to this point in the first place, which is the point Hobbit was making. Management needs to stop coddling these millionaire man children who use their clout to bully and abuse women on the server.
Hey, you must protect the golden cows. But as management they did what the could to make everybody "and their money"save.
I think the implication when they say “females” instead of “women” is way more nefarious than you understand. Take note that Ollypop, one of the other people making twitter posts, ERP’d with Richard, without knowing he was underaged. Now you get the implication of the word females instead of women.
Did he say everyone on the team voted? It could be some people didn't vote for whatever reason (could be a time thing, maybe they were busy OOC) but everyone that voted, voted him out.

just so you know, none of that is what happened- I never spoke publicly after that about the issue because it was such a traumatic issue for me.      After speaking out about two sexual assault/harassment cases that the admin team swept completely under the rug for MONTHS, I spoke out for two friends on Twitter last year      The reason I left though was the appalling response that the admin team gave, even after being called out publicly.      I was ganged up on in Twitter DMS by three admins, interrogated by them about what I knew about the situation.      It was made clear to me in the "conversation" they were only there for a PR cleanup, and I told them point blank I would not be removing anything from Twitter and that I would never return to Nopixel.      I stand by what I said when I left. Admin team, do better.      Also last thing since I'm finally speaking up about it for myself- I cried for weeks when I left. I lost so much by speaking out. I lost friends, I lost fans, and followers. I don't regret a single thing though and I would do it all again because it was the right thing to do.

It's just RP.
Bigger streamers are given more leeway than your average player and I'm sure streamers you like have been protected by this as well, but nopixel has always tried to stop sexism and sexual harassment against women in their community. A lot of these people that are so vocal against sexism now were probably the same people getting upset when Jordan Steele got banned for being sexist.
The source is the tweets. Unsourced allegations means you personally made it up. That’s literally how it’s always worked here.
Rated is fucked, but I just see a lot of people trying to use this situation to push their own agendas and it’s weird. Edit: Also where is the evidence of any lawsuits being pushed against nopixel? This is a wild assumption.
You do realize that there is no such thing as a psychic right?
Maybe credible evidence was presented to them and they acted on that. Where’s the evidence of the potential threat to their business?
Lemmie save you a few years of your life, they won't learn shit. The server will just shut down at the rate they're going and people will eventually move on to another gta server which will blow up and become the next big thing, and the cycle will repeat again and again
The O has always been a pos to women.
This was the ooc rant lol
He was kept around because he was one of the boys.
You mean like 100s of rap songs?  Do you listen to rap music?  Also, there are streamers who make a character with being a b\*tch as a characteristic and even self describe themselves as being one or can be one, then get mad if the term is used. That is....yeah
It's a systemic problem, look at them reading Nick Simones texts with like...every woman (Bunny, Nancy, Andi etc) and immediately assuming it's sexual or romantic.  Men and woman can be platonic friends, to jump to the sex/romance opinion is sexist as hell and problematic in the extreme.   It needs to change.
Have you ever seen the clip where Ramee is talking about how they beat the PD into submission? They're all in on it and have been doing it for years.
[removed]
Seems like a lot of people were effected by this dudes actions; but didn't want to say or doing anything about it due to the tsunami of hate that would come with it. Someone broke the damn dam and now others will feel more comfortable to come forward. It's pretty standard when toxic people are exposed.
Welcome to life.  This happens everyday, with any situation.
Didn't know you needed to be psychic to pay attention and take seriously claims from women going back years.
The announcement made that they had to get legal advice?
Have you heard of Public Relations? That credible evidence would be evidence that if they didn't act, they had a PR timebomb on their hands. Of course, they have had credible evidence that Rated was a sexist piece of shit for years, but that wasn't enough to matter.
I thought it was about something else though? IIRC Choi was using Twitter *a lot*  I went through reddit and yeah it was that rant nvm to what i said
Andi is fucking her brother because that’s what K believes. How can this man push this narrative when his boy is doing what he does. Stop with this IC stuff when no one can believe anything you say because nothing you’re doing will ever be considered IC again. CG has no credibility. Ever. CG is now and always will be associated with abusers. Not that we didn’t already know that about them.
I think it is more of a symptom of people saying "love" and also the crazy nature of relationship RP and the ERP stuff on the server.  I don't see how that is sexist in any way.  Some of the messages and such between them did give off a romantic vibe, which there is nothing wrong with if there was. Whether you read from Nick's side or Andi/Bunny side, it can me misconstrued by people who don't know them to seem potentially romantic to some degree.
There was a clip about ramee talking about how he sends all these clips of what he considers bad cop rp to the high command discord, due to the UPD and not rehighering..  Talk about bullying, just grinding them into a toothless npc.
first thing that crossed my mind when i was reading that too and yet the rest of the CG core will continue to get away with it dispite their own non stop    and very targeted toxicity over the years.
[removed]
Yes they had to get legal advice because the claims were severe not because it was a threat to their business.
Let alone that if it caused a huge legal thing Take-Two would delete NoPixel faster than Rated did discord messages.
Seems like nopixel can’t win in your brain. If they act they’re just doing it because it’s a threat to their brand. If they don’t act they’re defending sexist in their community. It can’t be that they just don’t want people sexual harassing women in their community. It’s not like nopixel has had a history of banning people for sexual harassing women in their community .
[removed]
I think I was pretty clear on how NoPixel can win. They can act before the harassers have left a path of victims. They can take seriously all the complaints women in the community have, and not just blow up at them when they bring up sexism on the server. They did the right thing banning Rated now, but the question is are they going to in the future only do the right thing after the next Rated has done their damage, or are they going to try to stamp out the culture on the server that has protected abusers?

This stuff reminds me of the early 3.0 HOA casino shit. It’s pure HOA suffering.
Basically, Heroin is way too OP and they combined with Flippy pretty much means HOA can't win.  At least the push into the LL happened and everybody laughed it off. Nico got absolutely blindsided downstairs though haha
It sucks that such a 'meta' drug is exclusive to ONE gang now. I know they're attempting to outsource it to others, but I honestly doubt any middle men would WANT to deal with the HOA because it would look like they're going AGAINST CG. 'Meta' drugs shouldn't have ever been given out like this, it's the whole reason why it was given to an unbiased group beforehand. They can't even do a Heroin Run, if the HOA couldn't do a simple House Robbery without getting gunned down. I honestly doubt a fucking H-Run would be possible either. Hearing that Hydra used about 40+ syringes and they STILL have more?   It's like giving the brick wall another layer in front of it, HOA stands almost a 0% chance. They are running war kits literally a 'meta' ago. I fucking hate that there's even a META to begin with. Drugs that have an absolute 0 drawback, it's fucking amazing having to deal with that.
i can see this war shit end in the next day or 2 , chatters have be comparing hoa to esb even before this war started, they are getting alot of hate because they didnt just fold, them you have infinity battle/hunting partys everyday and alot of members are just icu or not waking up
I feel for the HOA.  Benji and Nick really do be all fart, no poo.   I could have seen it staying less hunt/shoot if it hadn’t been for the reverse umbrella. Hydra were arguably just looking for an excuse but they did kinda play into their hands.
Its why no one cares that hydra snitched to the cops. What are people supposed to do? Might makes right. If you have the strength you are correct and if you are weak, you were wrong.
So all the gangs that SS/HOA/The Lost invited to join didn’t follow through. And all the people Hydra/CG invited showed up for them.  Tbf right now HOA/SS have it easy, they are fighting Hydra/Angels (and Curtis) instead of HYDRA/CG.
The headache is not worth it even if the reason behind the RP calls for war. Face it, there's some people you can touch and then there's some you can't. CG/Hydra umbrella is basically one of those that you can't touch. At least not in this manner because war is their bread and butter. Benji really silver tongued them into believing there was ever a chance when it's obvious that there wasn't. I'd just fold and proceed with something else because no one will remember this by next week.
When a Gazebo is made of plywood, it’s bound to break…. But in all seriousness, the LL smoke shootout tonight with Hydra and the air battle with the Angels was top notch and fun to watch. Also seemed like both sides had fun during those specific fights as well. Still interesting to see how this all plays out.
What are these 72 other gangs?
People really need to stop saying this was all about Andi's relationship with the Simone's, it straight up stopped being about that the second they started asking about Lilith and then MGL making sure Andi knew he was involved.
This is why Julio didn't want to just go after Hydra in the first place, and why there was like.. general bad vibes in the meetings that followed with Andi and others who were like "But they took our OG, we have to clap for it!"     Julio knew and knows they were going to get bent over. They have like half the A-team missing. I don't even think they run their B team.     Siz has been gone for months, Kermy won't touch the war, Stanley has degen hours, DRL has been cooked and May only showed up for like one day. They're missing so much of their like leadership and good 'war' type people. Trying to go after MGL was just going to get them bent over.     Julio tried to at least get the gangs that got ocean dumped to try and help mitigate some of it, but in the end, it's just been literally like HOA and usually 1-2 people from Seaside, not even Benji, having to fight the A-team of Hydra and they've had scenarios where K and Ramee have been helping protect Lilith and stuff from getting picked up at the prison.     In a world where Siz was at least around to wrangle the cats and ADD people of the HoA, they'd at least have a much better shot, but as it is? Andi can't lead a war and has been basically MIA the entire time, meaning all general leadership on top of war stuff fell on Julio who is malding and burning out for obvious reasons.     This all started over crazy dumb shit with the Simone stuff. Andi doesn't know anything special or relevant about the Simone's or whatever CG is even trying to find out about them. Got ocean dumped anyway.     Hoppers have been absolutely awful in HoA chats too. Like 1k+ hoppers every engagement, usually at least some of them talking shit, accusing of meta etc. So it's funny when people are like "Bro HoA is getting rolled and smoked, CG/Hydra on top" like no shit? Not only is it like the B/C-team of HoA, who honestly stands a chance in a long term thing against the Umbrella? Even if CG don't get fully involved, it's not like Hydra doesn't benefit from CG shit. All the benches, connections, knowledge, info.     No one wants to deal with that. Not just because they're good, but because hoppers and shit always get so toxic. Cops don't want to deal with them, because of incidents in recent history where people get 3-days for standing up to a guy that got perma banned for being toxic not long after anyway. Gangs try to avoid them cause of constant war baiting and toxic hoppers.     You don't just fight against the Umbrella type and have to go against honestly good war people who will have every advantage, you also have to fight with mental stuff OOC that goes along with it, and walking on eggshells so certain people don't call you weird and go on a rant about you and get a target painted on you.
A bigger realization is that more RP focused gangs vs CS GOPRO need to make is that this 6v6 hunting party or pushing locations like its an Esport stuff is never going to work. In the end the RP is "kooky crackheads try to dive headfirst into a firefight with battle hardened Spec-Ops soldiers who actively train for this exact thing"   Asymmetrical warfare is the only way to go, and its much more in tune with "RP gangs." Catch people lacking, isolate targets, disrupt supply chains.  This head to head shit against some of the most well trained people on the server is a recipe for disaster.   Off the top of my head I can see certain spots in the supply chain that HOA could disrupt. Hydra is obviously using a shit ton of Heroin in their fights from an IC perspective assuming they know how it works. Staging a fake H dropoff and pinging Hydra to it and ambushing them would be the sort of thing an "RP Gang" should be able to capitalize on.  It comes down to a battle of their creativity vs the opponents skill.  But all I see is HOA/SS trying to fight the battles Hydra excels in. They need to be creative to do any kind of damage.
It’s sad but HOA/Seaside are the main ones who wanted to destroy Hydra….
The only time HoA never suffered in 3.0 is when they did the Casino and the microwave blew up Espinoz.
hoa has access to heroin as well so no matter what Hydra wouldve won with or without it ...the fact is you cant win with a team you have no synergy with hoa X ss
The correct take.   SS/HOA/Lost invited 6 other groups and most of them backed out or haven't shown up to help. Rust was obvious and Benji knew they weren't going to help. Biggest shock is the Ballas to me, but they might be playing a different angle by trying to cozy up to both sides.  Hydra invited the Angels/VFT who obviously came. The rest of the groups this other guy mentioned aren't fighting yet, hell even CG wasn't fighting till JJ said "it's CG I don't care shoot them" and shot at Eugene, K, Ramee and MigL. And even still, K told Ramee not to be involved yet.  Clowns just fight for the highest payment. MDM said no. ST are staying out of it until they are hunted/shot at. CB/Guild are not warring, it's just a funny "let Harry come out to play" situation.
Pretty much and now people are upset that the groups Hydra invited showed up. If the roles were reversed you wouldn't have heard a peep about this and they would've justified it by "because all 3 leaders got kidnapped". Which is true but 3 groups vs 1 group is still 3 vs 1 regardless of how many members are waking up. It still counts as we're fighting SS, HOA, and Lost, not we're fighting some members of SS and some members of HOA and some of Lost. They just messed up the approach because they fell for Benji's whispers. HOA would've been fighting only Hydra rn if they didn't fall into the alliance trap.
And then you also have CG saying this arc has too many people involved and they get more involved .
HOA were always going to fight. Hydra/CG kidnapped and tortured their OG.  It's never about if they can win a war against shooter gangs, it's the principle of "You did something to hurt us or piss us off, We're not gunna be door mats".  Nothing to do with Benji's silver tongue lol
HOA were always going to fight it had nothing to do with Benji and everything to do with CG oceandumping Ant and HOA blooding out Lilith
They can't end it either way until Flippy comes up with his ending terms, Julio asked for it today since HOA tries to set terms immediately when conflict starts but he didn't have an answer.
Hydra, CB, Guild, Angels, VFT, Mandem, Ballas now, main CG, Clowns, and Street Team all working against them to varying degrees. I'm probably even missing some more not to mention the 50,000 satellites they have.  Flippy is also planning on talking to Mayhem.  Meanwhile, it's literally been HOA and 2-3 members of Seaside and that one Balla for one day.   To be honest, both the Simones have just disappeared and been worthless to the HOA/Seaside. I would be utterly pissed off at them at this point if I was those two groups not that they're exactly fighting for the Simones. The HOA definitely isn't. (Tobii and Nikez might obviously be busy with dev stuff OOC though of course)
It all stems from Mick's beef with MGL and Lang's beef with Nick lol  Considering MGL told everybody it was between him and Mick alone and then got everybody involved when Mick outsmarted him with that sniper ambush. Still funny to me that everybody is blaming Ant, even though she's stated so many times she's staying out of it.
Andi was in the ICU while Julio did the planning for the coalition stuff / war and made the decision to roleplay out her injuries/trauma from the torture before she was even informed about it, don't think it's fair or accurate to imply she influenced him to do it or is shirking her responsibilities to the gang. All the choices that led to this point were made by Julio and his appointed command (Nico, Luis, Stanley who hasn't shown up at all for anything). Saying that Andi can't lead a war and is MIA when she is roleplaying out the consequences of being targeted specifically for torture (and has been around helping Julio anyways aside from yesterday) is kinda wild.
Their original plans were to do more fun/creative stuff before open hunting parties type shit happened, but it got leaked by various characters (Fred/Julio being a pepega/etc) to the other side so it pretty much immediately went to standard gang war stuff. They are at least getting to do some more fun/creative stuff with the Angels now so that's good.  HOA/Dragon (people say SS but it's really Dragon holding it down in NA lmao) are doing what they can with what they have. They can't get heroin themselves since they are cut out of the supply chain for it, and HOA at least don't really know much about it. Afaik they've never actually ordered it from the source (they tried and got donowalled in the past) so they wouldn't know about how H purchases or drops work. The only times I remember the HOA getting it are via Yokai connects and Andi getting it from Yaeger, and she was in the ICU for a while -> in a wheelchair with both arms in casts from the torture so not really participating in the conflict.
They 100% knew they'd get destroyed but still wanted to make an effort to avenge their OGs.
Destroy Hydra? Nah they wanted to get back at the people who kidnapped their acting leader and attempted to ocean dump her. If they don't take action they are memed to death, if they do they want to destroy Hydra?   That being said, adding Angels to the groups and letting there be some fun things like the de.LL was cool. Flippy seems to be doing what he can to keep the RP fun for HoA
You obviously haven't watched a single second of an HOA POV because that is literally not the case. All they wanted was MiqL and Lilith but they knew the umbrella would retaliate afterwards. Everything they've tried and admittedly failed at since has not changed their end goal. They don't care about Hydra in the slightest. They just want revenge for what happened to Ant, and MiqL bragging about it afterwards.
Literally not at all, HoA just wanted revenge on MGL/Lilith. That's it, all they wanna do is gun them down ONCE or kidnap them, and that's it, they want to end it after that. This notion of 'destroying' Hydra is pure bullshit.
No they're not lol HOA have literally said so many times they just want to down MGL and also Lilith, who isn't even a part of Hydra.  They don't care about Hydra.
There was much suffering when doing the casino.
I don't think they have access to heroin right now. Heroin is controlled by Lang & co and CG. HOA is trying to find someone who is not known to be involved to get some, but I don't think they managed to do that yet.
I'm aware they have access to it but It's still OP as fk lol Julio shot one of Hydra like 4 times, in the chest yesterday and it did nothing.  And that push into the LL yesterday was literally just HOA lol well and Oscar, who used to be, after Flippy made the palest guy every dress up as him.
>hell even CG wasn't fighting till JJ said "it's CG I don't care shoot them"  Ramee and K have been hunting when Lillith was at the prison and have been very much involved since the beginning even if mostly 'behind the scenes' and Curtis has also been involved shooting with Hydra before last nights situation.      Also, it's only been the same few HOA members and 2-3 members of Seaside, mostly Dragon until JJ joined last night for a bit (no Lost in sight). It sucks that Benji was the one starting this 'coalition' but hasn't been there once to help in any way. Same goes for both Nick and Mick really...it's all about them but they have made zero attempt to help in any way so it seems kinda pointless. It's just a war that's going to continue with no end in sight until noone bothers to wake up anymore for it.  I understand why HOA want revenge on Lillith and Miguel but it's obv just not gonna happen. It should have just stayed as HOA trying to get Lillith on their own and then go from there.
Cg did the kidnapping hydra just took the blame
He gave them terms hoa rejected them he said they leave Lilith and Miguel alone and it’s over
Flippy/MigL should gigachad the ending terms by twatting Julio with the ultimatum to deliver Michael Simone to them. This puts pressure on HOA to publicly flip on the Simones and Seaside to end the war.
Why do gangs go to war without knowing what they want out of it? Same thing happened in the HOA/VFT war.
Mandem? Since when.
CB and Guild might as well be combined into one group since CB by itself isn't really a thing. And none of the combined CB or Guild have helped in the fights they are talking about here.  Also why shouldn't Hydra gather as many allies as they can when HOA and Seaside were doing the same?
simones can't really help for obvious reasons. if they suddenly start providing hoa and seaside with the things they've always been able to have access to, we know what would happen. benji is still able to craft guns and that is through his connection/partnership with michael. diamond dogs are also meant to be providing weapons and that is through their partnership with michael. any other thing he and nick can do would not go well.  they knew it would be tough during na and the hoa and seaside have been working with what they have. we'll have to wait and see if others like the lost start doing something but timezones make it so tough. like seaside has had their people around but it's during au and can only have smalls and dragon during na and we've seen their inexperience at play. just gotta wait and see now if things stay the same or if other groups will step up.
Weren't Mayhem going to join in on HoA/Seaside's side? This is getting a BIT out of hand.
>(Tobii and Nikez might obviously be busy with dev stuff OOC though of course)  or dealing with the shitshow drama.
CB hasn't existed for like... a year now lol.  Yuno's gone, Tony's with Redline, Mickey wakes up once a month, X is gone, Donnie's gone, Ray's with RUST, Denzel is back but not a gangbanger, Lang is around but is full business/politics these days, Saab is awake occasionally only on Fridays.
She can say she’s staying out of it, but the fact is she got really close to the Simone’s to the point they are now family, which now puts her in the middle between her HOA family and her adopted family.
When Siz was around, they did 3 heroin runs, mainly because of Erin wanting an adrenaline high and something to do. But that was before CG became the connect.
I hate to say it, because of how immersion breaking and sad it is... but if HOA don't have Heroin meta they are just fucking doomed. Hydra guys could possibly even have timers set for when the H wears off. Sweaty shit vs more RP focused stuff is going to create a huge difference in experiences.  It is such a game changer for fights. And that's before people even get into Heroadrenaline
I'd feel the same way if Hydra were just robots... I don't watch them, I watch BBMC and a few cops.  When I do see hydra on a typical interaction, theres some great RP. So I won't discount their RP simply for the sake that the members are just really fucking good at clicking on heads. Hydra is basically an army of highly trained killers doing what they do, and what they do isn't very nice.
Yeah, they wanted nothing to do with any of this. Then Miguel kept pushing Mr. K to kidnap & torture Andi. A gang can't just do nothing about that. They have to respond, even if it is e-sport pros vs. roleplayers.
As long as Flippy is leading Hydra it will stay as fun as can be. I watch Silent a lot, and he is being very chill about the whole thing.  Ya they’re hunting, but they are doing crazy stuff for fun.  Today was a great day for war RP because I didn’t see anyone get super tilted or anything and people had fun.
Yeah Flippy a real one for trying to make things fun at lest and not full on "take sprays" like Mgl wanted.     Glad Angles are getting some fun too.
But isn’t Lilith/Miguel a huge part of why HOA is fighting hydra? Why would they just leave them alone all of a sudden?
The problem is that the vast majority of the HOA has zero contact with Michael and most of them haven't even met the dude more than once.  They aren't in the war for him. They're in the war for Andi.
I feel like the HOA just flat out won't do that. Probably rather just fight until Hydra gets bored.  Also don't think they'd side with Lang/Umbrella/Whatever they are for the simple reason that they tortured Ant and ocean dumped her.
Yeah that's something that could happen, just dunno how Julio would deliver and he's in charge until Andi recovers. He has no contact with Michael at all except through Andi, and I don't see Andi ever selling her family out; if that really got forced not sure what would happen. Would also kinda dump on Mr. K's attempts to find and catch him himself, imo.
Its because this war is only to keep the attention on Hydra so that CG can continue to look for the Simones without having to fight the war.
Hydra went to war because they learned from multiple resources(mostly Fred and Julio) that Seaside/HOA/Lost were bringing gangs together to attack Hydra + HOA Was already in a 6 car convoy hunting for Miguel and Lilith the day before Hydra "started" the war. Flippy did give them the war terms which was they stop going after Miguel and Lilith so basically they can end the war whenever they want without giving up anything
Earlier today. Patar agreed to it.
Yeah CB to me is Cerberus + Guild
I mean because the gangs that were joining HOA/Seaside had their leaders/members tortured and kidnapped lol. While on the other side they are just joining in for what reason exactly?
no?
Yeah Tobii and Nikez don’t like getting involved in war. Tobii has never liked it and Nikez got so much shit when he joined in previously, accusations of using dev menu, spawning etc it’s not worth it one bit for them.
She's close with the Simeones yes but she's closer, well was until now, with Jaeger; Bjorn, Stag, Alex and Lando. She's just literally in the middle of the two lol Impossible spot.
Julio had an adrenaline syringe on him today I think, from the drop they got (Bane maybe?) when it was first introduced, but they don't know how to get more. They do know what they do since they tested a bunch of things with the other one they had until stumbling upon it working on downed people. Both heroin and adrenaline are kind of the perfect storm of being in the hands of people who avoid/hate the HOA + the HOA being very rarely at war so not sought-out customers.
MGl's odd grudge to HOA to 'humble' or whatever, that's all this is over. HoA didn't even WANT to be in on the Simone stuff.
Yeah I mean for months Benji and Nick have preached ignore Hydra, ignore MigL’s stirring. Benji’s number one rule is don’t fuck with CG because he knows that this is what happens, he saw it in the Vagos. But lately he’s been like how much can you get walked all over before you stand up for yourself. He sees them ocean dumping leaders of gangs to get to Michael and knows they will only stop when Michael is dead so what can he do? Michael has been Benji’s oldest friend, he introduced him to gang life back with the BBMC. He’s not gonna roll over and give him up.
Flippy get's a lot of flak but today honestly showed his fun side.
Yknow they tried to wipe a hoa spray today? Flippy was on the phone with julio debating if he’d go to liquid library while physically attempting the spray wipe. But there wasnt 6 in the hoa app awake so it didnt work.
Because these are WAR terms. Of course one side wouldn't like them.
Because they are losing the war and want to end it?
that is why hydra term is they stop hunting them
Tbh, the whole point isn't actually delivering Michael to them, its to paint the picture publicly that for HOA to end the war, they would have to turn their backs on the Simones. It stirs the pot with their relationship w/Seaside because even if they stick with the alliance, they (SS/Simones) have to always think about the possibility of HOA backstabbing them at any moment. If word gets out that Hydra and HOA stop fighting each other, then everyone would assume HOA turned their back on SS/Simones. That alone would cripple the public image of SS/Simones because it would prove how little power they actually have in the city.  Andi's real family is the HOA, not the Simones and she would always chose HOA over anyone else. So, if she had to make the call to setup Michael somehow to protect the HOA, she would do it. Mr. K doesn't have to be excluded from the RP of this happening, Tobi would just get on the server during his timezone so the RP can happen. The detective arc would probably end though unfortunately, unless they decide to continue digging into Nick more to bring him down as well.
Did Patar have a proper meeting or was it just the phone call with Miguel you're talking about. Plus Mandem have mostly been on 2.0 so doubt they'll actually be involved much if at all.
Well I have no idea about Mandem or VTF because I haven't seen anything about them at all tbh. Clowns were paid to fuck with them by CG, Ballas flipped for some reason but I don't know the rp behind it, I don't watch Ballas. I'm assuming ST is still under the CG umbrella with Hydra so that brings them in. CG and Langs crew are obvious.  But honestly no matter what the reason is, from Hydra's perspective, once the other side starts allying and adding numbers, it makes perfect sense for Hydra to do the same. People are really running on the "not picking a side is picking a side" theme.  Everything that has happened makes perfect sense based on the rp from the last month
Her relationship with the guild is most likely ruined at this point
When did she turn it down? Cause I haven’t seen that anywhere.
It's actually fucked if they don't know how all this stuff works, while the more militant groups theorycraft every possible advantage.  I still consider militant RP to be actual RP, at this point someone needs to offer a branch to equalize the disparity.
From what I have seen of Flippy through his interactions with multiple crews is that he offers a lot of good RP, but the man is a demon when his gang starts getting pressed. It's sweaty shit, but if his RP is ruling over what ammounts to a paramilitary organization... then how is that so different from any other RP?  Hydra is just really good at straight up 6v6 fights. For people trying to do other kinds of RP, they need to find different ways to fight him.
Most of the HOA haven't even met the Simones LOL that's why it's so funny. The guild asking Julio about Michael was hilarious because he has probably only seen Mick a handful of times.
Yep. Andi told them repeatedly they were staying out of it, it wasn't their business.
Saying this is all over Miguel's grudge is just ignorant. CG was going to go after Andi no matter what. Andi was listed by multiple people as being in the top 3 most important to the Simones.   Andi's relationship was always going to drag the HOA into this conflict.
Half the HOA didn't even know mick was dead in the first place, that is how much they don't care
Flippy wanted to wipe the spray to lure HOA out of the LL
They were going to have a proper meeting later that day but Flippy decided to keep it only the Angels to officially bring into the war. It made more sense for the angels because they have their own previous beef with HOA and Hydra are already winning all their fights so didn’t want it to be overkill. Patar did say he will help hydra with getting them supplies if need be though
VFT got involved because Zoey (Leader) and Mia (2nd in Command) are both Angel Associates since before VFT. Angels in total have around 15 and most are civs or inactive plus later in the NA time they aren't really around so they called Zoey and Mia to assist and said they are backing as Angels but if they want to back up as VFT thats on them.   Ballas jumped out this morning when Flippy/Miguel met with John(?) and ODogg from the Ballas. Their beef was more petty than this bigger conflict so they settled on some cash and a spray.   Flippy really only asked gangs (Angels/MDM/BBMC) to join when Hydra wasn't really around to just keep the pressure on and hopes to speed up a resolution. Angels have so far been the only ones to fully agree to joining since they have already a long established relationship. Flippy spoke to Patar sounded interested but nothing was confirmed and when he spoke to Barry he said he'd rather stay neutral. Flippy doesn't have any real desire to add anymore to the mix as of now.   This feels like a server event that occurred from really just pure RP. It's been exciting to see and really not toxic either. So I'm happy to continue to see where this goes!
VFT was because of the Angels.  ST isn’t getting involved unless they’re shot up and have told their members to stay away from hydra so they don’t get caught up in it. Ballas only because MigL and a Balla got into it and they decided why not.  But they fixed it, and the Ballas didn’t want in in the first place.  They are actually talking about delivering Benji to hydra lol.    The only CG involved in Curtis, and CG right now is a bit scattered.  I know Ramee K and Eugene got hunted down doing their own thing and I don’t think they’re riding out yet either so its Hydra, Curtis, and the angels that I’m aware of.  And realistically it’s just a squad of HOA and a squad of Seaside.
Why does the disparity need to be equalized? The current situation is the result of tons of RP
The biggest thing burning out HoA members right now are hoppers and youtube hilariously enough. Hoppers got BAD today.
For me its the training... Hydra goes to the Arcade(and probably offstream, Arena servers) Every time a character I watch decides to go to the arcade some Hydra member is there.   So its tough. If people are spending IRL hours trying to become a super soldier, do we just ignore that for RP?
Really!? That's a bummer. I primarily watch Banana and we were keeping it cozy and sending some love to the HOAers Claire interacted with. Bummed we didnt see the Pink Slip Wheelchair race today but hopefully SOON! Either way I'm sure theres always folks who take this too seriously but I hope we can all have some fun.
This is hilariously wrong Hydra almost never goes to Arcade. I have watched Hydra for close to 8 months and amounts of times I have seen them go to arcade is around 5-6 and even when they go to arcade they mostly play capture the flag(car racing) instead TDM because Susie likes it. And I am 100% sure none of them plays Arena. When they want to play FPS games they play other games
Yeah, Chalupa got a few, and Luis seemed to end his stream after seeing some Youtube nonsense.
\*sigh\* :/
Just from the 2 screenshots of different girls. You can see the pattern: Type message. LUL emote. Delete message. Continue conversation.   Its kind of funny considering how a lot of excuses people gave after he did/said something toxic was "but he was laughing". And its just same to these messages. Cover up toxicity with a laugh.
Also, the woman she replied to had her own screenshots that match the behavior Evee said he was doing.
My dude disappearing from the community faster than his messages to all these women...
Damn July 18th 2021 was a hell of a day for him
Damn thats wild.
This guy is really out here spend his free time looking into the past of the women streaming on nopixel like a creep.
Deleting the messages is really effective because I really have no clue what happened here. Hope she can just reach out to discord and get the full logs instead of this.
good riddance
NAAAAH HELL NAAAAAAH
The replies to her are so disgusting.
https://twitter.com/hobbittrash/status/1629627644760453120?t=IeK7Y2x9z8zjKZ1XPbiT-A&s=19 Hobbit saw the pattern after all...
dude the replys to these tweets are fucking wild CG fans are actually mental
i dont really understand what theyre saying in the discord screenshot?
Please, Women of NoPixel.  Do not let this happen again, talk amongst yourselves, set up something as a support system for each other.  I know it has been tried in the past but the women of NoPixel need to feel safe and right now I highly doubt they do.
This is way more confusing than it is informative.  So he is asking them to do sex stuff and then deleting those messages?  Is that the take away or am I understanding this wrong?
[removed]
On the same day too. Just hit up every girl you interacted with that day and see who bites.
Makes the "HE WAS LAUGHING" meme even weirder
There are plenty of people on the server that do the shit rated used to do that's like Grade A manipulation.  Say toxic shit > fake laugh .  or my personal favourite  Say toxic shit > immediately say its all good and continue making sly comments about it for the next hour in a neutral, borderline sarcastic tone.  As a CG viewer I have to say he was hands down the fakest person, I realized that after the Ramee incident and how kebun came out saying it was mutual arguments / shit talking between them and rated was blowing it out of the water. Also just how he handled his anger, immediate passive aggressiveness, which has always screamed manipulation to me.  I've also seen some of the women hint that other big NP streamers (apparently as big if not bigger then rated) have done similar sex pest things like rated was doing to some of the women, so we'll see if the trend follows as more come forward, I doubt rated will be the only one now that the flood gates have opened.
That sounds a lot like the pattern of penta. But since this is the penta cocksucking fest no one will point that out.
I was wondering about that. I checked and saw he moved to facebook in October. Maybe he signed the deal in July and was really feeling himself. Tinfoil hat theory of course.
If you read the entire thing, it's not that hard to figure out what happened. At some point, it seems like she was doing cam girl stuff,then she stopped doing it but rated found some of her vids online, linked it to her, and finally  he deleted his message
Its never a surprise women are reluctant to come forward when they will always get that type of response
I wonder why Kylie and Cath were [especially targeted for vitriol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmisogyny) from a certain segment of the community....
We've known this for a long time.
[removed]
She mentioned that he used to ask for certain things and then delete the messages , given the flow of the conversation it kind of hints that he removed stuff he mentioned and obviously didn’t want to get out
He deleted his messages. That's why it looks like she's responding to a question without there being a question.
This is probably where he asked her for the cam stuff, which was deleted and that's why the conversation looks a bit weird.  &#x200B;  Also, July 18th 2021 seems to have been a busy DM day. Both Evee's and Ollypop's screenshot are from that day.
Deleted Messages before the "might be tripping tbh" line, asking her about her Cam shows before she joined Twitch.
As others have already pointed out but to be really specific, if I had to guess where he asked for a cam show, it was when she replied "Was definitely not expecting that lol. Yea, but quit when I started on twitch." which also lines up with her saying she wasn't open about doing cam shows in the past etc.
The problem isn't that they don't talk to one another, it's special treatment given to players like Rated. They're allowed to basically get away with murder and never face any serious punishment or scrutiny because of the high views and influence that comes with it.  You can have the entire female population of nopixel in a discord talking about this stuff and it still wouldn't undo the culture that management created by making a group untouchable regardless of how toxic they get.  In return players are too afraid to report them.
The women of NoPixel shouldn't have to do this, management should be looking out for them and everyone else in the community.  Male, Female, White, Black, Caucasian, Autistic etc. no one should feel unsafe or unwelcome in the community and to turn a blind eye or go easy on your money makers lets this type of behavior fester and grow.  How could any woman realistically stand up against this behavior when the literal owner of the server is buddy buddy with the one doing this behavior and has gone on record before stating he gives leniency to certain groups.  How can any of them feel comfortable going to anyone from staff with this when it's against the owners golden boys?
He asked her to do a cam girl show for him then deleted the messages.
>If this is all that there is on Rated then wow.  Why would you think this lol.
If I asked your mom to give me a cam show out of nowhere you wouldn’t think I was harassing her? lol
HEY LADY DO YOU DO SHOWS THAT SHOW OFF YOUR BODY, DO YOU HAVE AN ONLY FANS? maybe that's normal to you but it's fucking weird and creepy to normal thinking humans.

Dude was horny and decided to harass women over it.
**[Transmisogyny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmisogyny)**     >Transmisogyny, otherwise known as trans-misogyny and transphobic misogyny, is the intersection of transphobia and misogyny as experienced by trans women and transfeminine people. The term was coined by Julia Serano in her 2007 book Whipping Girl to describe a particular form of oppression experienced by trans women. In an interview with the New York Times, Serano explores the roots of transmisogyny as a critique of feminine gender expressions which are "ridiculed in comparison to masculine interests and gender expression". Transmisogyny is a central concept in transfeminism and is commonly referenced in intersectional feminist theory.   ^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/RPClipsGTA/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)

Yeah specifically in this case in context with her other tweets he asked for a cam stream and pretty quickly deleted it but she saw it and she responded that she used to do that but doesn't anymore.
Jesus, I just read that 15 times and didn’t see any issue. Had me thinking I was the problem
Wonder if he and Violet/Lyndi had a fight that day or if he took that day off to go out. Would have to go back in the VOD machine and that just seems like too much work, but it’s a legit question.
[removed]
Rated is a pile of trash 100%.  What I got from these though, is that this doesn’t seem like this was the first time they were talking lol. Doesn’t make it right. Just doesn’t seem like an out of the blue type thing to me.

Which makes me think he's just going to end up on Kick and still have a fanbase playing on the District 10 server.
Him harassing women is a pattern of behaviour. Maybe individually they could be excused for him just being awkward and socially inept, but for how many people coming out and saying he was a creep to them? Clearly practiced behaviour and obviously not someone anyone wants in the community.  I mean keep in mind the things that other people have been (actually) perma banned for. Metagaming? Powergaming? This amount of harassment and his history of toxicity is absolutely more than enough to get him out of the community. He’s not being sent to prison.
Almost all of the women that have spoken out about him have stated that his mo was to message them and then delete it so they wouldn't have proof. Evee is working on retrieving the logs of their conversations. The victims don't owe us anything, they don't have to release anything to us. The main point is that the nopixel staff have seen the evidence and have removed him and now they are at least a little bit safer. Maybe more will come out, or maybe we'll never know how deep it went. But given the entire context of what's been happening, the least we can do is believe the women that actually lived it.
Oh, okay. Well then fuck it, let him come back to the server because whatever he's doing doesn't seem to meet your standard of creating a toxic environment for people.
I'm confused, what's your point? So the player in the original post saying she felt harassed isn't actually being harassed because it doesn't meet your standard for harassment? Is that the argument you're going with?
bravely skipping over the part where it was said in earlier tweets that he deleted those msgs and ignoring the fact shes replying to msgs that are not there anymore actually huge brain on this guy
[removed]
Not what I said at all. He should be permaed. He should be banned from twitch.   I just responded to the comment (think I responded on the wrong message but whatever) that he seemed to just msg randoms when it looks like a lot more went into it than that.
[removed]
Yeah except instead of getting blamed, people are praising them for cutting ties? Am I just missing something or is that not commendable? They are only cutting ties because it would hurt them otherwise.
"i already talked about the deleted msgs"   "where in those leaked msgs can you find any kind of hostility"   "looks like a couple of people having cordial coversation"     there is no shot you are this stupid
Its about what i expected from their community the whole "wow i feel so bad they had to do that to rated" response, now you got people commenting on the screenshots asking where the evidence is ignoring the fact the msgs were deleted. Also just to be clear im hoping they piss off to kick and play on D10 so we never need to hear from them again.
[removed]
Key word USED TO, even if she did it in the past, using past knowledge to sexualize a fellow streamer/ role player because you can’t get it from real people is sad. Stop defending a creep who has to take advantage of female streamers because unless he’s playing Randy Bullet no one gives a fuck about him.
[removed]
Some random power lifter paying random cam girls is so different than what Rated did and to try to equate the two is very sad. I don’t know if you real have real social skills but this is not how you interact with woman in a community.My Fedora fits just fine thanks for the recommendation though. Please use more petty insults to defend a asshole like rated

this same group that RDMd gangton goes by the name “triads” they showed up randomly one day 10+ deep, bullied Aziz and his small group out of LS cubby, while taking over the name. After that incident Aziz decided to take a break and go back to 3.0.
3days in they decided to pick a color that was already taken and eventually came for a "convo" pretty much saying we dgaf this aint over until we take red they get shot then they decided to RDM, bring supercars, relentlessly keep coming back without breaks and then realize how bad of a look it is and go full damage control mode by talking to curtis/ming etc in jail about how this cant keep going theyre not trying to lose their life over the color red. 5minutes later ming etc return to their block and those some people not trying to lose their lives are already circling with 5 cars  thats just so trash they all logged out after that jack didnt even want to continue his lockpick arc because they keep returning
This group had already ruined some interesting RP arcs brewing with Aziz running the triads. They just came and brute forced them out, after recruiting their friend group from arena.
Kinda sucks to see day 6 and, this "Triads" gang is using super cars and being sweaty in war. I wish more groups looked up to Zone3 Ballas etc.  Roleplay > Gunplay.
The fact that some of those people are apparently WL is mind blowing i hope Curtis and the boys go ahead and just report them it aint worth fighting a bunch of sweaty fivem arena players.  Unfortunately this was going to happen at some point since its a public server but damn i hope that the boys don't get discouraged because of this i've been really enjoying watching the Gankton boys.  Looks like they also made Aziz quit 2.0 which sucks because Wayne and them tried to cheer him up and tell him to just ignore those idiots.  But yeah this just shows that the server needs to be WL even though i am sure the public admins are fast as hell on taking actions things like this will literally ruin your immersion in rp for the rest of the day.
Admins are quick with the banning so this guy probably a o7
Hope admins don’t give up on 2.0 it has potential
There are many people from WL that are having fun with this server.  Unfortunately there are also groups of even WL people that are not about rp and break rules like this. They skip rp and race to the finish line where they are someone that deserves respect outta nowhere only due to having 20 randoms from another server to back you cause of whatever reason. That's not "rp" its not "organic" like they might describe.
Imagine flying in a whole gang from another server just to shoot at people on an RP server. These clowns came in ten deep together, made aziz leave 2.0 by belittling him, pocket wiping him and bullying him out of LS. Use super cars to shoot and RDM people not even a full week into the server. Wait for people to leave prison and spin the block before they can even get back into the city. Great RP right there folks, terrific experience for everyone and the funny thing is some of those morons actually have WL access.
Some of these are even on whitelist. I guess it's really easy to be accepted these days.
Pls save Marcel from the public hell hole he deserves WL, the cringe arena warriors have arrived, pulling up in bulletproof supercars too. Apparently they kicked out Aziz's group out of the triads traphouse for nothing too and ruined all their rp.  Edit: they meet in prison after their 3rd fight after this thread was put up and finally the Leon guy who is WL too, finally remembered to RP 💀
It  is somewhat a pubic server isnt it? Shamepeople still do this for no reason
Honestly they may have found a 200IQ method to help clean up the server. Just stand in the open next to a street lol.
I knew WL streamers wouldn't want to play on a pub server for long even if it was 2.0. There's too many weirdos to ban. Also 2.0 came out at the worst time ever, 3.0 was popping off with the arc that's going on that involves the whole city at this point. People were getting businesses that they wanted.
its facinating seeing the difference in groups that see the server as Nopixel Classic and those that see it as Classic Public.
Why is iut so hard to do the exact same thing, BUT just drive up and say somthing first. Say what ever generic gangster line u want then shoot
I was watching one of the cops cleaning this up, and these Triad dudes were relentlessly robbing every kill they could.  Clear to me the goal here was to get things and not beef, pretty shit way to rock about on a roleplay server like they are killing mobs for loot.
People just really don't get that this stuff is supposed to be RP, not just shooty shooty bang bang.  These 2.0 clips have been eye opening to the absolute ignorance of a non whitelisted server.  (Meanwhile Beerman banned because of standards or some shit)
They already crying lmfao
this is the kinda surprising shit that made 2.0 gang wars entertaining though instead of the lame “yo waddup i’m going to shoot you”
The ballas have been dealing with some guy trying to do lockpicks and when they question him he shoots and doing drive by happened twice now
This is just how to kill the server 101.
At these hours it seems to be a lack of admins, seen some really good on the spot bans since release but last night was a bit of a shitshow.  &#x200B;  Red guys (Curtis crew) RDM'd again from orbit, not sure what happened from that.
Apparently they are in ST on WL smh
think the big streamers are already getting sick of the shitlords... people are already going back to 3.0 now.
Luckily aziz is on the server saw him for a bit on fyz stream but yes the amount of shitlord s man
Yeah i was watching Trav rolling around with Marcel in the morning the other day damn that dude is fucking hilarious i've never laughed so much in a long time. Cheddar and Marcel was such a fucking s tier duo.
Cause that would mean there’s a possibility they shoot you first lol, you’d be surprised how few people are willing to put themselves in a vulnerable position even if it means following the rules lol
Watched a lot of ESB back in the day?
They can literally do the element of surprise thing while still initiating, 4Head done it to Dean and it was fine - this isn’t it’s not hard to understand
Happened again but got 3, luckily seems like one of the ballas got  their state I’d but getting ocean dumped most likely  Update they got banned
Yea
was there initiation prior to this or
Proof? Most of ST on WL is in FDF and it looked like they also got RDM'd at aparrments by Skull Gang.
RIP 2.0 Cheddar
Lmao wtf is that guy smoking?
they shot someone across the street as their way to initiate on a separate group and think that is okay.
Leon, Ace, Paris, and Ant are all ST on WL.
Bro I was sad af he permad he and Marcel going around doing hood patrol was so fucking good :(
If im ever having a bad day, ill remember this clown had everything handed to him and couldnt be a decent human
Holy shit this weirdo was horny as hell all the time….won’t show his face and who he is but expected woman to do cam shows for him…what a creep and you get what you have coming to you moving forward…bye bye rated

https://twitter.com/ollypopau/status/1620210837150658562  She actually alluded to some toxicity in the community a few months ago when she announced that she was quitting NoPixel. Here is the reddit thread from that time:  https://www.reddit.com/r/RPClipsGTA/comments/10q8my3/ollypop_ivy_poppins_left_nopixel/  It was lacking context back then, but this comment, coupled with some other recent comments, paints a pretty grim picture of the NoPixel community.
..Well the tweets start coming and they don't stop coming
and this guy was in a 3 year relationship too … wow.
Jesus it’s gets worse and worse
This is for everyone confused out there. A woman being nice does not mean they are flirting and want to get with you. There is also this thing women unfortunately have to do which is called placating to avoid riling up unwanted attention and having them turn on you and be aggressive and/or vindictive because you outright reject them.
People are going to just stop getting on after this shit, the fact he got away with this for so long AND the fact that other people are apparently doing it too or just as bad? James was already a foot out the door, he has to be totally done at this rate.
Asking “friends” for a discord cam show has to be the most 4chan basement neck beard things you can do. No wonder he always hid his face
I think I understand why ramee wanted him out of cg like 2 years ago
Just add him to the list of men who have the world and still abuse their position to abuse women. Entertainers, politicians, executives. It’s all the same. Give a man a bunch of money and power and he’ll show you his true colors. Inb4 not all men, like of course not, but it happens way too much.
He's also still dating Lyndi at this point, while asking every girl in the server that he interacts with for nudes/cam shows etc.
With how it's come out about how he behaves, there's probably a reason he didn't want his name out there.
yeeeeesh
Not sure if I’m just dumb and not seeing it but would deleted messages show as something like [deleted] or just vanish with no trace?
/u/lordofkhatoicstorms nailed it with their comment in that thread, but people in staff and this sub like to pretend it isn’t a thing. Now we’re at the point where it’s boiled over when it never should’ve gotten to this point in the first place if the staff just stopped people from being pieces of shit.
and they don't stop coming and they don't stop coming and they don't stop coming and they don't stop coming and they don't stop coming and they don't stop coming and they don't stop coming
Yeah he probably isn't in a rush to hop back on at all.
I am sorry, but who is James?
Between people baiting conflict and shitty people just everywhere he will never come back, he try to avoid shit like this like the plague.
Lmao you the type of mf to think someone calling you hun means a woman fell for you huh?
You've never heard of the phrase "Suck it up, buttercup"? Buttercup isn't always used flirtatiously.
I haven't posted on this subreddit for years but this comment made me do so.  This is one of the stupidest things I've ever read and you should feel dumb.
In the south, we call that a term of endearment. It doesn't mean we want to fuck you, it doesn't mean it is flirting, it isn't a invitation for anything else but friendly conversation.
what's even the point of this comment? You said it yourself, he's a piece of shit. It doesn't matter if she used a term of endearment towards him or not.
You've clearly never heard the phrase "what's up buttercup?"... Unless stated otherwise let's not assume, surely you've heard that phase before at least right?
bruh, you actually look like a idiot
You think calling someone a buttercup is offensive?
I call my male friends buttercup as a straight man. Am I flirting?
It did come off a bit cutsey I guess. The point is to know when to back off though. I'm assuming he didn't
Yep. It's a pretty sobering thing to talk to a woman that you're close to and hear her tell of all the times she was sexually harassed. Let alone sexually assaulted. It's not a rare thing, it's terrifyingly normal. It's something that women experience from childhood into adulthood. Constantly.  Adding power dynamics just makes it even worse.
[removed]
Not to mention the **insane** implied power dynamic. CG are pretty much untouchable on the server and this could make women scared to outright say no to him. I'm not surprised that CG as a brand dropped him.
Discord messages just vanish
On Discord they just disappear. If you're in a server, you can audit and see when a message is deleted... If you're lucky? You can catch them in your mobile alerts.
Honestly I think it's done deal and he's never returning over this shit. It's been NON-stop the past 3 months. No way in fucking hell is he going to want to associate or even have his name attacked to NP or management after this.
Uberhaxornova, he plays Siz Fulker.
Yeah, I think his GTA and possibly RP days are over.
The most terrifying thing is that it doesn’t matter what occupation you’re in. I was in the army, went to college for aerospace, worked for a pro sports team, worked in esports, worked in tech, worked in marketing. Literally doesn’t matter where you work or what you do, men will always use their power to abuse women, sexually or making them feel like they’re lesser. Every occupation has the same problem. But NP sweeping it under the rug, consistently, has always irked me.
They don't truly vanish. You can contact support to retrieve them.   Especially in cases like this.
Yeah i have a bot on my discord that record every message that get edited or deleted by someone and post them in a private channel so moderation can see what was changed. Came in useful a few time.
I think this is the best take. James loves RP, just like Aleks does. Just like MoonMoon does. Why would they ever come back to the server when the staff operates the way they do?
Ooohh, yeah haven't seen him for a while. At first i thought it was Zeerka.
They will never give you deleted message logs, unfortunately. They claim that the deleted messages are not held.      On the support website it even says "Trust and Safety will have a significantly more difficult time investigating and there is no guarantee that action will be taken against a violation."
He's also an Admin AFAIK, I bet he'll resign
Yea he moved to Austin and like.. has no desire to get on from the Adam stuff, then al lthe other drama came out.. now this.
Who’s Adam and what did he do? I took a year and a half break from watching maybe more
...Id just search "Khaosadam" here.

lmao I knew a war between the angels and HOA would be fun. Im not really a fan of war RP but I'll probably watch some angels/hoa fights lol
I mean I wasn't a big fan of hearing about all the different groups involved in the "war." Normally, that's a pretty great recipe for drama. But I mean de.LL earlier, then the Angels standing atop the building talking trash to HoA while they were in jail (which lead to Julio shooting at them) then Julio taking Baby Alex's knees, talking about pink slip wheel chair races, and this.   Been a pretty fucking fun day
I know Flippy invited the Angels into this war because he knew they would have fun with it. And that is exactly what is happening. Angels are very unserious in conflict and HOA like to be as well.
This was too much fun to watch
This entire Angels war with HOA has been so unserious. This dogfight was a fun change of "war rp"! Kudos to all RPers !!
Don't let the YouTube Andy war commenters know that anyone is having fun.  I made the mistake of searching "HOA nopixel" to try and see some other POVs and good god are those people unhinged. You'd think the HOA was shooting them IRL.
Alright now I’m really excited for the Angels war, this is great stuff
The first time HOA/angels were at war, it was a melee only war, so not surprised they are trying to have fun again this time around  Funny thing is Siz doesn’t like the angels and both times HOA has gone to war with them he has not been around, lol.
1916 WW1 dogfight over the los santos front colorized
This makes me miss the HOA vs SDSO battles. Good fun times.
HOA AIRFORCE UNDEFEATED\~
Jesus that first person recoil 😵‍💫🥴🙃
Angels do not do war for a reason, but they know HOA, and they know they can do fun things like this.
Flippy knows the HOA. He knows it's not like a super try-hard thing.  Him trying to get that into Miguel's brain earlier was hilarious.
Until the other gangs hear they are apart of it now and go hard mode lol
Honestly, in general it best to avoid YouTube comments, especially during war. It can truly be a cesspool.
The HOA make it really hard to take this war to seriously. They are clearly having fun as well as everyone else. I laughed when Miguel and company visiting the jail and Rod no bad attitude waved back.
Migl was not having it lol, was pretty funny
It seems like Hydra is kinda over this shit with Mgl too.
Got any examples? Kinda curious about that
I don't have the timestamp atm but when Mgl subbed out after Flippy accepted Julio's invite to de\_LL.
I don’t know what you’re talking about lol, it was one instance. They just wanted to have fun with it, no need to overthink it

She is 100% about the behaviour not being called out ultimately leads to all of this.  It's the issue when these gangs essentially become a brand and therefore the main source of income for the streamers. If you break away from the group you will probably lose 90% of viewers, if you call it out you have thousands of angry hoppers hurling abuse to you.  KA and Rated both at many times had a lot of tension within members of their gangs. But ultimately had a big influence in a community where the solution always ended up being to hop off or do something different to get away.  Hopefully in the future people pay more attention to the signs. The admins need to be quicker when it comes to bans for toxic shit, the streamers interacting may be uncomfortable to deal with it due to the repercussions, so it is on the admins to enforce it properly when they see it.
You know when there's a point where you have to sit down with your trusted friends and give them that talk.. you know like actually reflecting once and for all about how you, as a collective group, are going raw on a whole revamping of your image going forward.     I feel this the time for that
I believe that abusers usually have enablers. People that see it, may not agree with it, but turn a blind eye, laugh it off or explain it away.  I imagine there are some very nervous people in the nopixel community, hoping they don't get caught up or called out.
the dog good?
AJ 911ing he was happy martell was dead. Really makes you think looking back. What was AJ, the character motives on doing that.
yeah I only watched one clip and knew to never click on KhaosAdam's stream https://old.reddit.com/r/RPClipsGTA/comments/wt5ky4/carmen_one_lifer_killed_at_apartments_after/   it was even worse from his POV afterward, you can hear his anger .
Something I wanted to highlight/discuss from her stream (I'm not sure if its included in this clip):  One of the things Hobbit talked about was how Twitch has a insanely heavy Men demographic and how she lost a lot of potential viewers by always calling out bad shit that she sees as wrong and screaming about men. She pointed out that she's probably the only person who's outspoken about a lot of these things and how she's not going to stop.  Chat pointed out that Cathfawr and Appleshampoo are also pretty outspoken, and she instantly agrees.  Appleshampoo was hanging out in her chat at the time and she said that Hobbit is a lot braver than she is, and that she has to hold back from saying things a lot because she's afraid of getting in trouble.  My take:  Can we talk about how absolutely shitty the server culture is where you can't speak up for yourself without the fear of getting in trouble and getting banned/punished and potentially losing your income for speaking out?  Like how do they expect people to report these things when people are legitimately scared of being punished for speaking out?  Take Cath, she was one of the outspoken one and she instantly got hammered down and was made an example of. Cath posted a tweet about Rated today about how shitty of a person he was, it feels like she couldn't even have posted that until Rated was outed as being a dirtbag.
I love that her dogs are on the same energy lol
If I said Rated was a POS abusing creep in a discord or reddit id be banned by every community on No Pixel. I can't imagine what the *women that had to endure it on the server in fear of losing their WL and income.   Props to No Pixel for taking the first step but there's more than just one in your community. We've seen people of power use that power. Rated *HAD that power on No Pixel, it's time to set up a way for the powerless to feel like they have some power against the powerful.  Edit: well a couple discords have now banned me for these comments. Yikes
Anyone with a single brain cell could see what Adam was like irl but if you dared to question the quite blatant anger towards people in rp it was always brushed off as a character. Those people in his stream who done that are morons of the highest degree and they continue to be on a power trip in other streamers channels as well, but you can’t say anything because they’ve got a little green sword 🤔👍 ……  I won’t forget their names though 😉 they’re followers and pussy ones at that.
I truly hope that because of this, people start listening to women on the server, and call out toxic behaviors they see from their friends. I also hope everyone who was close with rated/enabled him in some way take a look inward at why they enabled him and not let it happen again.   This is such a shit situation, but so so common. Hope it was a wake up call to those who are in positions of power in the server, and it will never happen again.
Honestly the big guy should be held more accountable since he stood up for rated and allowed the blatant toxicity to exist for so long. Let's be real the only reason he got banned was cause he launched himself across the line instead of simply just crossing it like he normally did.
I hope NP looks into Chelb (Rateds BFF who plays Alan and Josh Kade) as well. He Rated and KhaosAdam were besties would play valo everyday. Theres clips of them on YT or twitter (someone has screenshots) berating girl valo players.  And I agree with Hobbit, the way Rated would talk about women or just people in general, his group had to know he was like this. Even Ramee Miguel Alan would laugh along and join in.
It's always wild to me the number of people that claim to not have seen obvious signs that shit was wrong with people.  There's potentially three things that happened:  * The person was a master manipulator that was able to hide all of it  * The signs were there and people somehow are so bad at reading people that they miss the signs   * The signs were there and people ignored them  The first one rarely ever happens but the most notable examples are always like cult shit. This isn't an example of that.  The second one sometimes happens but the vast majority of people are able to at least read others a bit. Maybe like one or two members of these groups can claim to just not be able to read people at all.  The third one happens when people are invested and like someone and ignore the shit they do. This happens most often. People ignore others flaws consciously or unconsciously because they don't want to see what is obviously there.
I truly hope NP admins, like Saab and Nakkida, actually take this to heart and don't allow it to happen again (or still). If the big man isn't doing anything about this kind of stuff and turning a blind eye, then you MUST do something as an admin - not just sit in the corner and watch the world burn. Or what the fuck do you need admin for unless you actually do something, is it flexing? Fuck off.
Management seems completely fine with certain people who are abusive to others. Clearly a whole different line was crossed.
Hobbit is so real for this.     Every time something like this happens, the men around them just start saying "They had no idea" and act surprised. Yet people on multiple occasions have questioned their actions and its always the same response "Its just rp." How can you spend so much time with someone that is saying the same things no matter what character they are role playing or if they are even role playing at all. Because lets be real Rated, Randy and AJ were all the same person.     How many times do women have to voice their concern, how many times do they have to distance themselves from certain people/areas in NP because they fear interaction with a person / the repercussions of their toxic fan base that think what they are doing is ok.      I'm glad to see one less person on the server that is toxic to their fellow role players, makes women feel uncomfortable and using being gay as the butt of every joke. NP Administration are getting W after W this year and its great to see the server healing.
I refuse to believe the people up top didnt know.
Hopefully this is a reality check for no pixel & they become more strict ab bullshit like this. Dozens of women have to be abused & mistreated for this shit to stop , it should only take ONE fucking person. Holy shit it’s a small step but i hope it continues……
I wonder what Coop would say
I have been in a couple threads saying NoPixel needs to do something about cultivating this type of culture.  I really hope they release an action plan to prevent these situations in the future.  They also better be consistent and not favor view counts or clout.  Like seriously NP, step your shit up and be better.  It's already have a reputation where women can't even speak openly and freely, as well as others in the server.  Edit: Hate do drag her but the way Tessa brushes off the toxicity of members from the clique is very wrong.
YES! GOD, if you even SUGGEST, "Hey maybe examine that," people jump on you and DEMAND, "Are you accusing them of *<x>*??!"  Can't people just have an ounce of introspection without retreating into that shell?
Said this in a previous thread but have to agree on the way people are acting sad for 'his boys'.  They are the people that threw a tantrum and threatened to leave the server leveraging their audience to get special treatment. They've been protected from the consequences of their toxicity and that has enabled Rated to do the things he's done. They and the 'higher ups' who've protected him are complicit. If he hadn't overeached the limits of what is defensible by the amount he did, nothing would be happening still.
Why is it that if you tried to play a racist character you'd be banned immediately, but blatantly misogynistic characters are allowed?  Really makes you think, doesn't it?
She got that DOG in her. Love her so much!
A parent of a child who murders someone "he was a good kid" *had clear signs of that kid ain't right*
The first bit of this clip is, imo, the most important part and is what everyone continues to dance around just like they've done for years. That group all have the same problem. We all know. They all know. Streamers know. It goes beyond them, of course, but there's deservedly a spotlight on them right now. They dropped him quick and~~, for some reason, that's all anyone is talking about.~~ I've read more of the threads now and, thankfully, dropping him so quick doesn't seem to have saved them from scrutiny.  The toxicity goes unpunished. It's normalized. It festered. And now we're here. Staff and admins made the right call here, but they were forced to. They enable this environment where certain people are untouchable and women are afraid to speak. Accusations are blown off for two months until more women come forward.  Are the other guys as bad? Are they also abusers? On camera, they're all the same pieces of shit as each other. Are they also the same off-camera? Probably not, I'm not out here to make wild, unfounded accusations. But they were, and are, just as bad in terms of run-of-the-mill toxicity. And they foster this environment where toxic behavior is okay and is performed for "entertainment". Where this individual was one of 'the boys'.
It's crazy to me that the rest of CG are basically getting a pass because they removed him so quick.  He has been friends with them for 5 years. They absolutely knew he was a scum bag.

Most of it's about her being mad about how obvious a lot of it is but still ongoing and people not confronting it.  Obligatory Disclaimers: Streamer mentioned this was not negative towards NP mgmt or specific persons besides those mentioned.
Didn't the person who RPed Dreah try to call out Randy?
wasnt Rated the reason when she took a break from RP after an interaction with him on Martel
What i wouldnt give for a dog cam. LOL. Jokes aside I think she is 100% on the mark here. I wish there was more I could do as a viewer to point out these things and help the community.
This whole revelation really is just putting what the issue of nopixel as a whole has had for the longest time and really making seem like this was bound to burst when u build a toxic culture and then it thrive over the years and enforce it nonetheless your gonna be the one at fault you made this (looking at u devs and cg) your gonna tried and fix this to or do as much damage control as u can but people are going to remind u and even remember u or go even hold u this for the longest time u cause this and just didn't do anything even tho there was so many red flag's and warnings and u still push over so many people for your own sake SHAME ON YOU
What I don’t get about this clip is Hobbit’s criticism towards MDM. When she played crim she hung around with MDM and Adam was one of the individuals she was closest too. She obviously didn’t play crim much but she had a better relationship with Adam then a lot of people within nopixel. I’m also pretty sure she FTO’d his cop on numerous occasions too. By her own admission she should of noticed something no?  I’d also like to add that these types of people build relationships with people over time and subtly normalise their abusive natural by gradually getting more and more abusive towards people. It all so obvious with hindsight but it’s so easy to miss that behaviour at the time when that person has been spending most of the time you’ve known them tricking you into thinking that is normal.
I remember a co-worker of mine that would bag the groceries flirting with the customers. Which whatever I thought, until he started flirting with potentially underage highschool girls. I started talking about how weird it is that the bagger keep on flirting with people, but the manager paid no mind, so I just decided okay I just try to avoid having him be my baggers. To no one surprise, he eventually got fired for being a creep but he stayed at that job longer that one would think as finallly customers started complaining. I guess to be fair the person was a bit autistic, but still I wish I made a bigger fuzz about how much of a creep the person was instead of just shrugging my shoulder as none of my manager care about my complaint and neither did the customers who usually brush him off and smile away.
A reason why so many women don’t speak up about things like this publicly is because viewers and streamers alike will almost ALWAYS believe the man first. I’ve literally seen so female streamers apologize for getting upset over men in rp making sexist comments to them because they’re tired of getting hate from the males fan base. What sense does that even make? it’s 2023. The sexist jokes haven’t been and will never be funny.
On that note, can streamers stop calling people retarded, and referring to bad things as being aids or cancer, and can they stop joking about doing demeaning gay things. Just a suggestion.
Common Hobbit W
I agree with that dog too Rated is an asshole and fuck that cunt.
Yeah when Adam got unbanned I started watching mdm way less and was happy too see Zerkaa streams bc he was hardly around at the same time as Adam. There’s definitely people like matt for example that felt forced to not confront him in RP and it sucks that there wasn’t an environment there where he felt safe to call out the behavior bc of so many of the others just following along and saying “that’s just Adam”
Ego.
Can't say she's wrong, but, as someone who used to have a toxic friend and didn't really notice. Sometimes the signs are there, but, they don't seem like stop signs. My old friend was a dickhead, but, I never would have seen him do anything in the Adam category (he was also just kind of an ass to everyone) then one day we go to the bar, have a couple drinks, and on the drive back (we had a DD) he chokes me out til someone else stopped him.  I never watched Adam, and barely saw any of Rated so I can't say how obvious it was, but, people never assume its, sexual harrasment bad. Usually its oh they're a dickhead bad. She isn't wrong though it should be brought up and people should feel comfy saying something about it.
Here come the vod skimmers.  Real fans watched this live
Hobbit should be an admin
what did she say i couldnt hear over the dog and the clapping no offence
Faxxxx .
When a woman starts smacking her hands when she's talking you know she's speaking truth.
Maybe I’m misunderstanding what she’s saying but the way it sounds like she’s blaming the MDM boys for not calling out Adam is weird af, unfair to blame it on them but aswell as that downplay the Rated situation
Shit argument by her. I get she's pissed but having a feeling about somebody doesn't mean you know exactly what's behind the mask and should be judge and executioner .  I can take somebodys bluntness for being rude and weird. Doesn't mean he's got this deep secret and he's this or that.

That the dog doin
I agree with her 100%.   Besides that, she needs a good suppressor/noise gate. Please if this is your job to talk into a mic all day the technology is very easily access able.      Specially if you have a high end video card (she does)     [https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/broadcasting/broadcast-app/](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/broadcasting/broadcast-app/) is all it takes now and a few minutes watching videos on how to set it up well. All of that dog nonsense woulda been gone in the background.
When did she become a K9 officer?
Most hectic clip I’ve ever watched
The main issue isn't with staff being quicker on the draw but on them not protecting larger streamers who are toxic because they make money for the server.   Until NP worries more about protecting it's reputation over short term money nothing will change.   They don't seem to understand how enabling toxic players does way more damage to their brand then any threats a group makes about leaving if punished. Much like the second half of 2.0, no  new large variety streamer is going come and bring fresh viewers if NP is know to be a toxic shit hole of sexual harrassment.
Yeah pay attention to the signs instead of making them untouchable on the server lol
The behaviour was called out multiple times but admins chose to protect their golden boy and created an environment for him to harass women. They only acted when his actions became completley indefensible.
"the streamers interacting may be uncomfortable to deal with it due to    the repercussions, so it is on the admins to enforce it properly they see it."     On a game like GTA and nopixel these things do not align, it's as much of a responsibility for the streamers/players involved as it is for the admins/staff. The staff is simply not going to know everything and every context of a situation. It needs to be more of a norm to call shit out and then the staff can much easily enforce the rules. If the community are not doing much, then the staff cannot do much either. So it goes both ways.  As someone who has watched nopixel since the start of 3.0, I have never watched Rated, as such I have never known of these issues, if you're outside that bubble, you will barely know these problems. So it's up to someone who's involved to spread it and make it known.
I mean, when you have the supreme enabler on your side, only having him stop it when the evidence is too much of an overwhelming tsunami... 😒 People acting like that's some paragon of morality, but this type of shit on the server has been mentioned and discussed for YEARS.
So true
people would rather be enablers than get labeled a "white knight"
We probably **c**ouldn't begin to **g**uess who might be nervous after all this.
The enablers were no pixel management. They very openly created a environment where rated and the other members of his group were free from any serious repercussions for their actions. We've all seen the numerous Clips posted on here of borderline harassment and toxic encounters with fellow players. If anyone else on the server had racked up as many points as these guys many of them would have been perma-banned at the very least once if not multiple times by now.  The culture of fear surrounding this group was cultivated by staff and spoken about any times by players before. People were afraid to report anything that happened because they were worried about reprisals or getting in trouble themselves. The situation that helped make this possible came from more than just people passively sitting by and watching. Many actively took part and helped maintain it.
shes got two dogs, one of which is a new dog, so they just be teasing each other its good
She has a new, very energetic puppy.
prob sensing her vibes and getting hype and angry lol dogs do be hypemen
I rewatched that part like 4 times looking for the start point but didn't even notice. I got no idea what's going on lol
And the usual subjects here and on the server defending it. Shocking.
That was a hard... Telling on yourself moment...  The. He asked another cop if he was sad that she's dead.... And that response was another telling on yourself moment
As a viewer I was glad Martell died, and I'm not a toxic abusive POS like Rated, it's just the Martell character took misandry to the extreme and it wasn't fun to watch.
It's not just on Twitch, it's the entire "gaming" sphere, for lack of a better term. In any online interaction, from COD to OW to GTA, 90% of the time a girl or woman is in a lobby someone will make a sexist comment. It's actually insane how many people think it's funny and acceptable.
"Like how do they expect people to report these things when people are legitimately scared of being punished for speaking out?"  That is the result of the server playing into a streamer's level of popularity for profit, while simultaniously having a toxicity rule that ultimately applies to everyone except the bigger streamers, so that's a nope on speaking up about something just in general, it probably feels like a coin toss. If the server banned them like anyone else and removed them from the community when initially deserved, all the potential for corruption is minimized. Instead, these types of people are harbored and given a position to abuse others in many ways. THEN, the server only does anything once shit goes down, and is praised for it when they had an indirect hand in it in the first place.
I still feel bad for how Cath got done on Vale. Even the big man himself would shit on vale while riding with Hunter and Clarkson. I’ve never seen someone get done so dirty as Vale did.
NoPixel needs to Stop 👏Normalizing 👏Toxicity 👏Towards 👏Women
somone has an unwarranted toxic OOC rant about you on stream you watch a clip and call them a dickhead for doing it and both of you get banned for the same length of time, i wonder why people dont want to speak about the things that happen.
Cut to how SDSO handled the Rose being targeted by that cop character... Who I Believe was self admitted sexist (the character)... Martell was trying to point out to Toretti how shitty the response was.... Toretti wasn't getting it. Rose even said... That she would never come forward again on something like that l, because of how it was dealt with. Very much imitation of apparently actual OOC server behavior
The trouble with Hobbit is she doesn't make it terribly clear when she's ranting about men that *not all men* are a problem. It comes across as a blanket ALL MEN ARE A PROBLEM and for some of us, who are nice guys and actually respect women and don't treat them like shit, that's really disingenuous and it's off-putting. I've often tried to watch Hobbit but I can never manage it for too long. People are making a lot of Rated 911ing that he was glad Martell was dead, honestly as a viewer I was glad Martell died because that character was just massively toxic, especially for a cop. A male cop character as toxically misogynistic as Martell was a misandrist would have been shut down pretty quickly, hell Jordan as cop got shut down and he wasn't nearly as bad as Martell.   By all means when a point needs to be made, make it, but when it's all the time it's just really unecessary.  (Inb4 my opinion doesn't matter because I'm a MAN)
Yeah. I was surprised how quickly everyone decided to take his side and forget about that whole mess a couple months ago. Didn't make sense to me.
*I meant "Rated HAD that power*
Please try and avoid using female as a noun for people; it is often dehumanizing, and often used by misogynists to degrade women. Female adults are women, female kids are girls. Ladies is another term used, but not as often anymore.
Can you link me to the clips/whatever else of Rated being abusive? I've never liked the dude by how he's treated people publicly but also don't believe that shitty mentalities/toxic relationships are automatically abusive. There are levels/degrees to it. Could it just be the case that he's just a guy with a shitty mentality whose fame and fortune got in the way of growth like so many other streamers?  Also, I don't think you should commend NoPixel staff because his attitude has been awful for a long time now and there are others that were around him who act the same. This is far too late of a decision and does not extend to enough people IMO.
Honestly just having it be a voting process every month on who should stay in the server or not would the good. And no matter that result, that person is banned.
He liked to gaslight too. When he first got perma banned he wrote in his discord how he was getting hate because he was the same OOC as he is IC and he actually tried to brush it off as he’s still playing a character even while playing variety (which should have been a big red flag in itself) and then clearly getting OOC mad at a situation with Whippy (He took his numbers) and trying to brush it off as well as it’s his character so he’s allowed to be angry
Allowing the ooc toxicity like we have seen him perpetually ignore creates an environment where these mind of people can stay in the server indefinitely. He is certainly part of the problem. He absolutely enables it.
I think someone in one of the other threads put it best:  NoPixel mgmt is good and acts decisively when there is a clear distinction between right and wrong.  But anything below that, especially when it comes to creating an environment that could help preventing something like this, they are just awful.
The same guy who uses male homosexuality as a joke, has punished female cops for not kowtowing to his clique, and who has been called out for misogyny on his server? And whose partner also has a fascinating history on the server?   No way.
This 100%. Obviously management does a solid job of handling this once it is in the light and there is enough proof to have 30 trials at the same time, but nobody should be acting like them not handling him (or anyone on the server that acts like this) earlier wasn't full blast enabling him, encouraging him and worst of all - shielding him. People like this not getting punished and removed earlier just makes them braver, bolder and more active about doing it because it gives them a shred of "The people above me don't care so I'm not doing anything wrong" light.
He is 10000000% a gigantic part of the problem.  Seems to be somewhat coming to his senses a bit lately. Like three years too late and still not enough though.
Yeah, the line where nopixel could have it's image tarnished. They aren't the heroes here neither, they enabled this behavior for making a profit and server clout, and then suddenly they want to get away from it once the monster they helped grow has been doing gross shit.
What’s the context of never calling the owner by name on here?
>I hope someone looks into Chelb (Rateds BFF who plays Alan and Josh Kade) as well. He Rated and KhaosAdam were besties would play valo everyday.  For me, things started to become pretty obvious when Rated started playing with the pair of them regularly. They all have that similar playground 'humour' or little boy 'humour' which isn't humour at all. Its just people being fucking idiots. Its hard to know how long this stuff has been going on for, but to me at least, they found these immature things hilarious and kind of egged each other on.
Chelb will get the same treatment sooner or later, some of these clips on valo and rust are a sad thing to witness but deplorable c\*nts always get what comes around
I watched those three play valo together on their streams. It made me realise something was off with Adam and Rated but Chelb always seemed like a third wheel and was usually the subject of the jokes. Chelb also carried them in valorant which is probably another reason why Adam and Rated kept bringing him a long. Considering what has come out about Adam and Rated you can’t fault people for pointing fingers at Chelb but I would be very shocked if he did any of the shit those two did from what I’ve seen of him. Also by your logic you’d have to point fingers at Zerkaa and Swiss who were an extension of that trio.
Did CG know he was an asshole...Yeah probably they all have that same tendency and you see it quite a bit in the server with other RPers, but did they know how deep and fucked up he really is? Probably not in my opinion. Like I said before they didn't even know his legit name until like 2 years ago maybe? I remember K saying "I don't even know his name despite knowing him for 4 years". If they knew he was this messed up I highly doubt they would have risked their entire brand for him for this long.
I really hope so that dude chelb gives me the creeps. I’ll never forget his tangent at maldinis basically confessing that he doesn’t view women as equal and said he could never befriend one. It was so uncomfortable as a woman to hear that. Especially through the pov of a woman streamer who’s spent a lot of rp hours with the dude who probably thought of him as a friend at one point. So disgusting.
A silver lining could be that he at least has shown his face and a lot less private than Rated or Adam which in hindsight seems really convenient for them
Add power dynamics to it and you know why it took this long.
You'd think that "veteran RPers" who pride themselves on "reading the room" would see at least *some* of these signs and start to ask questions about the person, themselves, and even ask others of what they think.     Being completely shocked and surprised is both disingenuous and not enough.
It could be (this was the same with KhaosAdam in MDM) that they wanted to believe he was a good person but when insurmountable evidence comes out to the contrary a lot of other things start clicking that they previously overlooked or brushed off.
They probably didn't. They did create an environment in which this type of thing can thrive. Like the power dynamics on this server are insane. Abuse thrives in unequal relationships.
Yeah, they need to proactively work towards making sure that someone like this doesn't manage to weasel their way into the same position again. It definitely doesn't help when admins listen to people spewing their toxic shit and just giggle along with it and brush it off in game, and proactively punishing people that do that in front of them would be a good place to start
The owner and his partner have a history with misogyny in particular. Quite a bit of dirt on that on Reddit.
This has to start at the top. Perhaps this was a wake up call for the upper tiers of leadership.
Yeah I do feel like Tessa and Baas have the same approach of settling for a middle ground which really sucks when only one side is the aggressor. You’re basically saying they can still be toxic, just maybe half that, and the victims can just keep taking it because “they’re not as toxic as they were!”  Like that Gable ban with Taco. “Well both sides were in the wrong”, but only one side was the aggressor. You’re telling people that if you don’t shut up and just take it, you’re gonna be punished just as much as the aggressor? Great message dude.
In fairness it basically is an accusation. While I do think introspection is important, it's also completely understandable to have that reaction.
isn't Martell's whole shtick misandry? I thought it was a meta joke about what you're claiming but at the same time she didn't get banned for it which ironically defeats the point.
I mean in complete fairness there is such a thing as circumstantial evidence. This is not the case with Rated obviously, I'm just pointing out why your example would be flawed. If you started judging people because of circumstantial evidence instead of actually solid evidence, it creates an extremely dangerous precedent.
The people saying "They didn't even know his name, how could they know this extent" Like ya, after you get passed the "I don't your name" You are still friends and you are still talking about your relationships, friends, activities, etc... Just because they don't know his name doesn't mean they aren't personal with him.
True, like with MDM I think the group needs to do some heavy self reflection.
You want people getting banned for being friends with a scum bag?
That’s not what caused her huge break from the server. Her break was caused by a huge argument with top members of the SDSO about a self-proclamation sexist character by the streamer himself that was a member of the SDSO named Jeff Waters. who chose to quit blaming bullying while he actively made a woman in the SDSO feel unwelcomed and uncomfortable.
pretty sure yeah
Saying he was one of the individuals I was closest to is just strange imo. I hung out with anyone who would interact with me on that character and I would say Aja hung around with most active members pretty evenly. I don't know where you get off saying I had a better relationship with Adam than other people in NoPixel.. huh? I can count on one hand how many times I have spoken to him outside of NP. Also, his pattern of abuse was to act "sweet and nice" to women to lure them in, which is exactly what he did to me. He came to my chat to compliment me, sent me "love raids," often, DM'd me hearts, etc.   &#x200B;  You also acknowledge in your comment that these type of people build relationships prior to starting their abuse. So I'm confused by your entire point. I also even said on stream I called him out everytime he did or said something I found sexist, which was rare because he was smarter than that to say it on front of me. Anyway, I'm going to assume you are making an earnest effort to understand so I'm just going to explain it:  &#x200B;  It's clear my statement isn't "MDM knew he was abusing women, fuck them." It was that there were moments that the community saw that THEY pointed out of his sexism (shit I never personally saw) for months and that all fellow MDM members saw it and laughed it off or didn't acknowledge it as weird in any way. Yeah, that's an issue. They aren't perfect but an unfortunate example of my point which is if you see something, say something before the person finds themselves in a comfortable environment to start abusing people.
[removed]
In fairness, they're playing the video game Grand Theft Auto. It comes with the territory.
And?
> My old friend was a dickhead, but, I never would have seen him do anything in the Adam category (he was also just kind of an ass to everyone)  I think you are kind of proving Hobbit's point here, you obviously saw the signs if you think he was a dickhead and an ass to everyone, you just didn't take them as seriously as you should have.
Difference is in real life, you're living it, then move on  Online everything is documented, imagine randomly the next day, a week later, you see a  clip of your interactions where there was drama, where your friend is being toxic  very hard to defend
during the day, on a thursday
Intent wasn't supposed to be negative
>If she became an admin you probably wouldn't be seeing AnthonyZ playing on NP for too much longer lol. Though that would probably give him more time to do more celebrity selfies of him and his fiance rolex at a dinner for 1.
it's ok, same. do you want a dog asking for a friend
I guess you are misunderstanding then.
Her point is that people notice these signs in people they know but they don't say shit until it's too late. Behavior like that needs to be called out early not ignored and enabled.
I mildly agree, but I do also think even those aspects of bluntness and rudeness should be called out or a sign to avoid that person, which is different than assuming the worst of them.
shut the fuck up
That's the other part of why the admins probably haven't really done anything to enforce their own rules.  Like i can understand why, the shitstorm this would have created in the CG community if they just banned him for IC reasons 6 months ago may have caused some issues they didn't want to deal with, both monetary and even more hoppers.  But at this point they need to decide what they want to be, enabling this behaviour or cracking down on it even if it costs them some money.  The answer should be obvious, crack this shit down even if its someone massive and get the server in a healthier spot for the future.
It was something which was known to the admins, Rated would have been banned years ago and 100 different times if he was a smaller streamer for his OOC toxicity.  The admins aren’t viewers who pay no attention to the server, they literally oversee it.  The difference in this case is someone influential in the server had different rules, which if they enforced as they would to others people like Rated wouldn’t be in the server.  And the reason I say it isn’t the individual streamers fault largely comes down to power dynamics. KA and Rated are very manipulative and controlling people who have large and aggressive audiences which made them untouchable.   The only people who could realistically action upon it and have the responsibility to do so are management.  It’s their role to protect the streamers on the server
I think this is huge and really underscores the point that hobbit was originally making. It never should have gotten to this point. There wouldn’t be such a power imbalance if not for people enabling the behavior, tailoring the server to the behavior. It’s all well and good when you can leach viewers and financial benefits from someone, but when things become too damning, you don’t get to wash your hands of it and pretend like you had no part in propagating the behavior, mentality, and overall culture.
dog got that dog in him, dog
“He was being sincere!! People just misunderstood his first 911 so he clarified!”Some idiots on here actually said that in that thread lmao
She was a caricature of the male characters doing the same thing in the opposite direction. And it still exists.
My girlfriend has stopped playing many games because of the behaviour directed towards her. Blame will always be assigned to her, even if it's proven not to be her fault (WoW, logs etc.). It's just defaulted to her. People are just assholes for no reason.  Anyone who claims they haven't seen that type of behaviour is either blind or the ones perpetuating it.
Women, people of colour, queer people, anyone who has a behavioural or cognitive disability or illness...all the prime targets for these losers to bully.  Look at all the baboons who use autism, ADHD, homosexuality, etc. as jokes. Look at how women, especially the trans women on the server, are treated. It's pretty fucking foul, yet it's been mentioned and talked about for years.   This is just a tidal wave of incidences that  staff and the owner could no longer ignore.
It needs to be called out more to be honest. I know it's hard to do because the instant you call it out you become a target, but it needs to be called out by people who aren't the victims of it.  I just stopped playing online games with a mic unless I'm also with friends who will shut that shit down. The best I got treated was when I was doing a Destiny 2 raid, turned out they thought I was a teenage boy a few years younger than them. Then I said I was going to grab a beer. One of them said "aren't you a little young to be drinking" and it all sort of clicked.
It's absolutely disgusting.  Like full grown ass men feel comfortable and empowered enough to go complain to management about how Cath would go too hard on arresting their make believe character in the game.  but meanwhile it feels like women does not feel comfortable to report abuse from OUTSIDE OF THE FUCKING GAME.  Just how insanely fucked up is that?
As a crim viewer I didn’t particularly like vale as a cop. I thought Cath played Summer very well but I always thought Vale was a bit too aggressive and trigger happy. With that said I don’t think Cath deserved the treatment she got from the NP staff and was most certainly made an example of. The fact that no one has had even half the punishment Cath had despite people doing very similar things and some doing worse is just baffling.   What Cath seemed to do very well was rile up abusers. KhaosAdam despised Summer whilst Rated hated Vale.
Woman + not afraid to speak up is what put a target on her, 100%. She could have kowtowed to the problem people, and they still would have gunned for her.  ETA: I was mistaken, Cath is cis.
This is either amazing satire or a complete lack of understanding satire.
bruh did you just really just pull the "nOt AlL mEn" card
dude unironically just called himself a nice guy
You just described exactly her point lol.  IMO if Hobbit played a "safe" character on NP instead of Martell, she could have easily "piggy backed" (I hate myself for using that word) off Penta during the 3.0 boom and her viewer count would have been much bigger and she wouldn't offend or scare off potential viewers who may find Martell offensive.  But nope, she still played Martell the way she did, even though she knew it was fucking over her view count/income.  I don't want to make Hobbit sound like the fucking Rosa Parks of RP/NoPixel but I think it is very commendable to stand up for what you believe in especially when you are knowingly fucking over yourself over when most people would sell out for like 50 cents.
What? Martell was pretty beloved. You're just coming across as woman = bad
Bro did you not realise that Martell’s character involved satirising the treatment of women by flipping it?  Also Jordan Steele was satirising the extreme of the shit, Martell was showing the sort of day to day shit, you know like what she is talking about it the clip?  Maybe spend less time going ‘not all men’ and more time listening to the frustrations being spoken about.
Yeah no shit if a man does the same thing as a woman, he might get shit on more than the woman. Same thing as if a white person calls a black person a slur vs the reverse. One side is historically and systematically more oppressed which makes it more ok to “punch up”.  I’m not denying that overzealous sentiments that “men bad women perfect” turns off a lot of people in the middle of the feminist/misogynist spectrum, I get that it can come across as pretty much baseless victimisation. But when the server is so heavily skewed towards “women bad”, we need an extra loud “no, men bad” to make sure it’s heard.   If you’re personally offended by a woman calling all men trash, that’s something you should reflect on. If the shoe fits.
Holy shit please let this be satire LMAO
Understood. Thank you for letting me know.   I've edited my comment.
Never thought I'd have to remind HulklingsBoyfriend that a small percentage of females don't ID as women.    I haven't read a comic in ages, are Wiccan and Hulkling still a thing?
A lot of times, viewers or 3rd parties won't know what's abusive and what's just general assholery until parties involved declare it as such. We all set our own boundaries and consent to situations entirely different so it's tricky.  These clips by themselves aren't abusive, but they can show a pattern of how neurotic or emotionally unstable rated seems from the outside looking in. These clips on top of him screaming at cops calling them dogshit people clearly out of character  Rated aggressively misinterpreting everything Lyndi says to a point where she has to log off her character  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCfPSDxuw8  Rated demanding she shut down her stream to address him OOC  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQHJZrECHV0  Rateds also made Valkyrae cry once or twice when they had quasi IC beef, but I can't find a video of it so I can't remember just how bad it was on his part
From the looks of some of the tweets of people coming forward, he seems to fit the bill of being an abusive POS. Harassed and is hateful towards women who show strong wills and personalities such as Hobbit, LadyHope, Cath, etc.. and from other tweets it seems he used the power he had on the server to prey on those who would be afraid to go against it.
I commended No Pixel for taking the first step. Also said they have more work to do to keep a power vacuum like this from coming up again.   Also just watch any Rated VOD on FB or Twitch with ublock. There's playing a character and there's using a character to cover up your OOC actions.
He who shall not be named is a banned term I'm pretty sure. Your comment will get nuked. Basically the Will Smith to our Chris Rock
Adam used to switch up massively (or by the end log off before or just after) Zerkaa would get in the server, he also seemed to get jealous that Louu/SK became Zerkaa/Tommy's go to guy instead of him.  I don't think it's fair to lump Chelb with Adam and Rated, he's probably said some things he shouldn't (wrong yes but nowhere near the same level) and people will have suspicions but unless anything comes up its not fair to just say he is like them 2. Zerkaa has been "famous" for well over 10 years now, obviously it's still possible but, if he was really shitty there'd probably have been some rumourings by now. Zerkaa has played Tommy as a toxic pos at times before but there was a clear difference when he was in and out of character whereas with Adam and Rated they seemed the same IC and OOC often.
even if they didnt know he was SH/SA'ing people hes still an asshole to everyone but so are most of the core members of CG and they have a deep history of doing so thats the type of friend group that allows people like rated to exist.
You don't need to know what exactly is going on to know when someone is a POS or is acting like a POS. You don't need to know someone's name, if you spend enough time with someone there are clear signs that people just choose to ignore. These people were more afraid of losing $$ than calling out one of their members on the shit he was doing and the problem just isn't with him. They all refuse to call each other out on their bs. It may not be any where close to what Rated has done but they are all just a bunch of "Yes men" who care about $$ and nothing else.
> but did they know how deep and fucked up he really is? Probably not in my opinion.  The only reason I can agree with "probably not" is because they are equally as toxic and maybe that causes some sort of weird group lack of awareness of what they are doing being similar levels of extreme toxicity. Not specifically with women like Rated, but I'll very easily reference the Ramee clip of him bragging about mentally berating cops into submission so he can get his way on the server. This activity is EXTREMELY rampant amongst CG and it is not surprising in the least that Rated might actually not think he did anything wrong because that entire group does it at a high level and intentionally. The core of CG are all abusers in some way shape or form, that is how they got views, them going extreme about it is how they continued to rise in views and those views are how they kept it "safe" for them to keep doing it.
Not knowing someone doesn't stop you from at least recognising problematic behaviour though. With all the recent tweets describing the experience women had with Rated I refuse to believe that not a single person from the group of people that arguably spent the most time with him was able to see any of that.
Misogyny and queerphobia have been known to be server issues for years, with only this freak and Adam being banned because of the insurmountable evidence that formed a fucking tsunami. Other shit is ignored.  Quite a few queer players no longer on the server (but still watch it) have spoken about it. IIRC a PENTA or Hobbit viewer was one who got a fuck ton of queerphobic language directed at him.   Women on the server who play stern, not SBS cops have been routinely degraded, punished, and outright harassed for not enabling shit RP by men, or for having "attitudes" (translation: having strong spines).
It's one of the main reasons having the lil' man in CG was such a horrible, horrible idea, even without knowing the impact it would have.  Up until these last few weeks you could see clips of him repeating a variation of so many of their usual semi-OOC'ish talking points.
What a useful comment, thank you.
I can't claim to know Hobbit's motivations, but I always assumed the point was to reverse the roles, exactly because it would make people feel uncomfortable and force them to confront the fact that it's really not fun interacting with a character that is sexist against you.   I wouldn't say Martell not being banned defeats the point but rather proves it, that you can be blatantly sexist to the point that it makes people uncomfortable and get away with it.
It's self depreciating humor. You could say misandry but that's simplifying it a bit.  Like Penta arguably plays the most misogynistic character on the server with Jordan. But Hobbit and Penta have been friends for years
Martell's misandry was absurdist satire.  People who didn't understand that should stick to Blue's Clues.
Most of the time,yea
I understand that. It's just it seems that when someone is publicly shamed as a weirdo of some sort, they do have these examples of past actions that make you go, huh.   So it's hard to act on those actions if it may not have crossed some line. That was on of hobbit's main point, if no one (in perceived power) say something, more and more things pile up until this happens. Who knows, maybe if harsher punishments where enacted years his behavior changes  edit: nvm this person I'm responding to is a weirdo as well
Their most toxic ones from the original gang were kick out basically.  The big egos mostly were proven to not be good people.  With Adam it was really hard because he hold power over them being in leadership role in RP and he would use it to barate them or make sure they go to jail and other weird shit. So even if they knew something is off with him, they couldn't do much.  Multiple MDM streamers complained about him and had talks but basically had to go into "we don't need to like him, we need to work with him" type deal.
Nah fuck em. They're all adults and millionaires.  Edit: if CG were in their early 20s or something I would be ok with using this as a learning opportunity. Shotz is almost 40.
Yea
thats the recent one. I am talking about her break before CPD was even a thing she had an argument with Randy then Rated went on his ooc rant
Is there any way to watch those conversations?   I know she referenced it when writing about toretti for Martells funeral
Or, in the case of most people on the server, instead of “see something, say something” you back up your boys statements because you’re incapable of critical thought because the only job you’ve ever had is playing video games and when it comes to interacting with an actual woman you have no real skills aside from what you’ve created in a video game that’s 10 years old. Not saying. Just saying.
You obviously know how you feel on people within the server and those no longer on it more than me. I just felt like what you was saying was kind of describing yourself to a lesser degree. Also I worded a few of the things I said wrong. I meant to say that you were one of the people who interacted with him more so than others within rp. I did see you call him out but at the same time I’ve seen you call out dean jokingly when he’s riding with you on den and it can be difficult to distinguish between the two at times. You aren’t wrong though. There were opportunities to call him out but I genuinely think a lot of people where too scared because of his viewership. The reason I think this was because the only other person I saw call him out prior to his ban was Zerkaa and Garrett who are much bigger than he was. I think one thing we can agree on though is that the women who came out was incredibly brave and because of her NP and Twitch in general is in a much better place without him. Same said for everyone who has helped to expose Rated.
Second time posting this... what is your point? That I knew he was abusing women & was sexist (he hardly ever said anything sexist in front of me or I obviously would have said something) and decided to help him get hired anyway? Who got Rated hired? lol
[removed]
Powerful. Love it.
I disagree with that. Plenty of people are assholes but not to the degree of sexual harassment or worse. And imo it's actually very harmful to just jump to thaassistant. Of assumption just because someone is a verbal asshat. It doesn't create a particularly good mindset or attitude.
True true
Exactly. Real fans commit time fraud and watch her on company time
i have one already thank you tho so do you know what she said or...
It's an roleplay server and that makes it 10 times harder to figure out if it's the character of the streamer's actual personality especially if they only play GTA RP.
I love you, i'm sorry <3
People were quick to launch into Evee for "snitching" to Baas about it too (on youtube).
A male cop character acting the same as Martell would get shut down pretty quick. Jordan Steel got banned from being a cop and he wasn't nearly as bad as Martell
It's almost as if there's an opportunity for roleplay there. There's a command structure, but they took it OOC and went far too heavy handed and personal.
Correction, Cath is a cis gendered woman, just unapologetically gay
Cath has never stated that she is trans just to let you know. Not that it would matter
Those usually especially don't enjoy being just deferred to as female.
Trans women are not female, and we do not refer to them as such in literature. We usually just say "people with breasts/mammary glands/uteri/vulvae/etc." as required for things like a medical paper, or just say "women" if referring to misogyny. Them being trans does not disqualify from them being "female" to the vast majority of credible scientists and groups.        Trans women are "female" by numerous definitions, and the term is incredibly contextual. We also try to use that term for non-human organisms.
It appears he is possessive and overbearing
Yeah, I think all these people need to show proof that it's beyond his usual assholery. Either way, I am glad he is gone, but given that it's taken this long to get rid of him I don't think we can trust the NP staff judgement so I want to see the real bad shit myself.
From how he's acted publicly, I would say that's being a dickhead, possibly even a misogynist, but I wouldn't say it classifies as abusive in the way that people use it these days. Pretty important not to conflate these things even though both are not okay 😬
That’s the point I trying to make with bringing Zerkaa into it. Just because your associated with someone doesn’t mean your just like them. Zerkaa has been in the limelight for long enough for people to know he is not abusive. Swiss too.
Oh I 100% agree they feed off of each others toxicity especially when it comes to RP. I was just saying I don't think they knew about how bad Rated was when it comes to this. No way especially someone like Garrett would have risked the entire brand on him. He always seemed insanely closed off even to his own group that he knew for 5+ years which made it suspicious imo.
I don't even think most of the time that the toxicity that you see from them in rp is from them "lacking awareness" more so they just don't care. You have seen them get banned and then essentially make jokes about the ban and then get banned again. As shitty as they may be in RP and to a certain extent OOC I don't think they are on the level of Randy and the pathetic stuff we have seen from him. \*If Randy doesn't think he has done anything wrong I can't put that on CG more so him just being a terrible person. Being toxic assholes IC and with OOC comments isn't the same as what Randy was caught doing. We haven't seen CG defend him in this situation in the slightest. Seems like the minute they found out what happened they took action. Obviously part of it is their brand is at stake, but I haven't seen them condone that type of behavior at all. Randy started hanging out with Khaos and Chelb more than CG it seemed which is more telling than anything.  Which hey I could be wrong about it because at the end of the day feeding off of each others toxicity just makes it 100x worse. Gives me flashbacks when the whole Ramee and Saurez thing happened. Guys in the group would say "Saurez isn't that bad" but after awhile they all started to hate on him because Ramee did.
You are 100% right that they should be able to recognize his problematic behavior but they are all also toxic in their own ways. As for knowing he did any of this behind the scenes stuff maybe you are right, but I believe if they did actually know how deep this was and fucked up this was they would have cut him from their brand a long time ago and not risk damage to the brand. Just because they do RP with him every single day doesn't mean they actually know who he was because clearly he tricked multiple people into thinking he was some good guy and even thousands of viewers daily that he was. That was my point if he hid his name that long who knew what else he hid from the group and if anything he ever said was true.
Just so you know I wasn't saying he said this recently about this whole situation. That was said about 2 years ago.
This was literally the point of Martell. Men get SO close to the point when they call her a misandrist... so close, yet so far :) She also didn't start as a misandrist, she was formed into that due to the constant sexism she saw and dealt with in PD. I decided to reverse the roles and make a joke out of the men doing it to others. It was really never deeper than that.  &#x200B;  Also, I dropped the "I hate men" rp like, months ago. I then simply switched to calling out men for sexism, but that was still considered "misandry"... I wonder why.
Bingo. And not only that, but that characters like that can rise to power in PD, while women were always belittled. I’m always reminded of Baas’ chat with a bunch of the women in the PD and how he just ignored all of them bringing up the issues they had with men treating them like they were stupid because they weren’t as good at driving or shooting, or making them do paperwork so the “men” could go back out there and get to work. Problems are all the same and Baas has more power than before.
&#x200B;  >that you can be blatantly sexist to the point that it makes people uncomfortable  Well your original claim was limited to "misogynistic characters are allowed", which implied that you were claiming that misandrist characters wouldn't be allowed. If that's not what you meant then we are sort of in agreeance.  &#x200B;  As far as whether these types of characters should be allowed in the server, my opinion is that yes... as long as people aren't uncomfortable with it. There should be some sort of line where you get one or two warnings and after that you have to eliminate the trait or else. There are ways to be entertaining/funny with misandry/misogyny without making people uncomfortable, I've seen few characters on the server achieve this successfully.
I would say the huge other difference is that Hobbit calls Penta out when he goes to far, he listens to what she has to say, and learns from it. That's the major difference. The rest of these groups are just "Yes men" who turn the other way because of the $$.
I always thought it was wild. Jordan was banned for saying the same shit 100 self inserts say every day. The character is misogynistic, i don't think it has a place on the server, ban the other fucks too.
If you have a point, you're not communicating it clearly. Everybody knows it's absurdist satire, I was making a point because OP seem to imply that misandrist characters aren't allowed.
Wait I'm a weirdo? Why? What'd I do? I was gonna say I agree with you mostly. Imo if misogyny wasn't allowed on the server as a character trait, it would probably do a lot to curb these issues.
Adam would hold power for most of the time and Zerkaa is so busy with Sidemen etc he obviously didn't see as much and others probably didn't want to bring it up to him unless there was something  more than "a feeling" and by the end Adam would basically completely avoid him by logging off very early and if they were together he'd try to copy Zerkaa more.
Ah I know what your talking about yeah that did happen you’re right.
Nah unless hobbit’s YouTube channel uploads the vod of that stream which doesn’t seem likely at this point.
[removed]
>And imo it's actually very harmful to just jump to thaassistant. Of assumption just because someone is a verbal asshat.   I have no idea what you were trying to say here.  Sure people can be assholes without being sexual predators, but they are still an asshole and you shouldn't be surprised if there behavior gets worse if you aren't willing to call them out on it.
When I got that live notification last week after her break I quit my job I got while she was on break to watch.
she said that she have big boob and big wet pussy over and over until twitch cut off her stream
oh wait 💀
Like I said, Baas/Ssaab was quick to defend it, so was Tessa. Shocking, really.  Edit: the only thing the PD shakeup did was put people in power who will allow CG to do whatever they want to cops and women. That’s a fact. Maddy is a part of Hydra. Mantis lives in a bubble. Ssaab is a CG apologist. It was clear what the goal was. Sock is so sporadic and out of touch he’s functionally irrelevant. It’s a CG server where one of the members was outed as a serial abuser when they’re all functionally serial abusers by allowing this exist.
The difference is, as a woman cop, she was repeatedly walked all over, even as a HC member, by her subordinates. If you do that to a big tough guy streamer, you get shot or fired, depending on if you’re a cop or crim. It exposes the duality and hypocrisy of the way women have been treated for years.
Jordan was a lot worse than Martell, wtf are you on.
Are you fucking pretending to be dumb I legit can't tell
I must be too tired to understand your post, lol.  I read it a bunch of times and it isn't clicking.  I thought female was a specific medical term and woman was the social term?
yep, very sensitive, controlling, and a lot of insecurity   And this is just stuff he **CHOOSES** to broadcast. Imagine what he's said to people through a 1-1 voice call or dm.
It's taken this long not because there hasn't been real bad shit, but because there hasn't been a tsunami of bad shit. What you are stating is the problem in itself. The NP staff and the NP environment in general does not hold people accountable until there are multiple victims or years of trauma.  The favoritism treatment on the server enabled this guy to abuse that power in order to target these women on the server. Hopefully this is a wake up call to the Big Guy and NP Staff that in a sense they failed these women.
I think you're right in terms of not conflating those things. Would be nice if just being a misogynist would at least get you banned though.
Bad behavior is bad.  Not sure a pedantic level of clasification is needed to judge if bad behavior should be punished.  Even without the sexual harrasment aspect of the claims Rated should have had multiple perma bans long before now.  Plenty if lesser influence players have been for doing the same OOC malding shit he's done many times before.
Obviously can't say for certain (certain celebrities spend decades in the spotlight before things come out) but especially with the Internet age everyone has a voice and ways of raising it, you'd imagine there'd at least be rumblings if something was going on behind the scenes if someone has been "well-known" for a long time.
Sure but they still enabled him and should probably reevaluate what exactly it is that they're doing imo
[removed]
This is a prime example where the power dynamic between men and women is painfully obvious. You could have 100 men being misogynistic and then 1 woman has the courage to throw back the same energy at those men and she gets piled on since there are so many more men in this space (gaming, reddit, nopixel, etc) and they have likely never dealt with that type of resistance to their shitty behavior. They just dismiss it as one person being wild. Misogyny is so normalized and I’m glad people like you are willing to challenge it, I just wish more people, men included, would stand up and call this shit out.
I was gonna type a buncha bullshit here about Martell making me uncomfortable and it just clicked lmao. Literally as I typed this I realised holy shit.   If you make "jokes" that are targeted, even if they are funny, people will probably be slightly miffed. If you continue to "joke" after that point people begin to feel unwelcome/unsafe. Worse still is that the culture shifts to being more accepting of those jokes and eventually people accept abusers because the vitriol isn't perceived as abuse.
Always loved the nuance of this character. The absurdity and over the topness, that still whooshed past so many people while hitting them in the face along the way. An absolute force of nature that will be fondly remembered.
JW, where does Penta fit into this? I saw Steele was on 2.0 the other night.  I just know by watching his chat that they revel in the misogyny when he interacts with most female characters. It's gotta be doing something to normalize the language, and I feel like these reddit subs give him a free pass on a lot of stuff while calling everyone else toxic.  His excuse seems to be "it's RP, just because I shoot cops in game doesn't mean I do it IRL, it's the same thing with the language".
>There are ways to be entertaining/funny with misandry/misogyny without making people uncomfortable, I've seen few characters on the server achieve this successfully.  Can you elaborate with examples? Just curious.
You aren't wrong at all. Obviously Hobbit and Penta share a wild sense of humor. It's clear though that Hobbit can tell Penta when he is stepping a bit too far
Chase got banned for making fun of the fact that CG got a bunch of grinders to do work for them.  Jordan isn't even banned. People just dislike him
You have this way to slightly defend the accused and make these generic responses that are kind of sus  A lot of your comments are "I agree but...." Insert excuse about why they did it, which somewhat validates why they did it. I liked the Finland joining NATO one.  I only checked your history since I saw you responding to a lot of posts.
Yea makes sense, thanks anyways tho!
[removed]
Sorry, I'm on mobile. And I agree, that was my main point. I was giving a counter argument against making the absolute worst assumptions just because someone is a verbal dickhead.
i saw the user LOOOOL why u trol me 💀💀💀💀
as brutal as this sounds... I agree.
Last week I was watching 2.0 right before the Shotz outburst.  I kept thinking, damn, these guys are gonna be PD leaders on 3.0 and crim leaders 2.0.  Kinda glad they are branching out but, hopefully it doesn't turn out this way.
You're missing the point. It's a double standard to allow it with one character but not on another
Nope. Female is VERY context specific, and field-specific :)
Do you think it's strictly directed at women or people who find themselves at odd with him in general?
I think he and a whole lot of those around him and people from other groups should have been removed a long time ago, hence why I don't think anyone should commend NP staff for finally removing some people. I think it's pretty clear that Rated has been removed because multiple women have said that they don't like how he's treated them even outside of the game and not because of his ongoing attitude IC and OOC as a whole or else they would have removed more people. I do think there could be an avenue for misogynist characters and vice versa, but I don't know how that's actually possible without attracting or enabling people who genuinely think that way (whether it's fans or other RPers)
I am not defending him - I have even said that he and multiple others should have been removed a long time ago.
I mean while yes bad behavior is bad, there absolutely is varying degrees as there should be. I would not treat someone who was just a verbal asshole to people the same as someone who sexually harassed or worse. They're both bad, but they do not deserve the same treatment.
I think accusing the group of possibly being this fucked and doing this kind of fucked thing is a little bit of a stretch. Not sure a quick statement of releasing him from CG gets interpreted to them saying he just shouldn't have been caught or been smarter about it. It almost seems like you want that to be the case more than anything...

I don’t really feel like Jordan is toxic or particularly misogynistic compared to someone like Rated. His behaviour is slimy and messed up but it’s aimed at everyone, and Jordan feels like a character that’s made to be a bad person that will constantly get beat down, literally and figuratively, but never realize it might be his fault.   He is, by all accounts, a loser, and I find those streams entertaining because something comes out of losing, rather than it turning into OOC ranting, malding, and insults.  Dunno, it’s just a character I love to hate. He’s not someone you’re rooting for to succeed, it’s someone that you can’t wait for them to get their comeuppance.
jordan kinda feels like parody like you arent supposed to laugh because misogyny is funny but because this kind of person exists laugh at them kind of thing   and penta in general with jordan (well mainly all RP) is its all RP to him its not uncomfortable ooc its uncomfortable RP, he ate a week ban because of that and talked to hobbit and others in a just chatting stream to understand what went wrong what are the lines and I think he has kinda learned to nerf Jordan to draw a line
Martell is a decent example, I found her funny in small doses. I'm not sure whether she made anyone uncomfortable but me personally didn't find the shtick entertaining in the long term.
I see, and I guess that's understandable, though I didn't think any of my takes were too outlandish or crazy. Imo, I don't defend the accused, I do call out or acknowledge when the accused is wrong and should be treated as such, like with Rated. But I do try to counter dog piling, particularly whenever I see stances that go just a bit too far. Usually when it comes to generalizations. I also think it's important to consider why someone does something that they were accused of. I'll also admit, I like to rile people up when it comes to political stuff, it's a bad habit.  Edit: I'm a big proponent of judging people individually, and that causes some conflict sometimes in threads.
[removed]
Maybe don't be a dickhead.
No, you’re missing the point. The power dynamics are completely shifted in one direction.
I guess Chase died for this...
Obviously he would be toxic towards men and women when at odds with them. The differences came from how he would treat them on all of his characters and the resent he would keep for them for months or even years. The way he treated Cath on Vale and also recently the way he was going about treating Hobbit with the RP around Martell.
That is pretty much exactly what I was thinking so I'll just sit back and look at my thoughts written out in a well organised way :)
[removed]
I believe you in that’s how you perceive the character, but if this is more generally true, how do you explain Penta being asked/forced to stop playing Steele as a cop in 3.0 because he made some of the other players really uncomfortable with the forced interactions? I even saw it on 2.0 the other night. It was pretty clear that those other people shut down their own RP and started asking for other cops to process them once Steele started saying things like that they sell themselves etc.  My only point is that just by watching chat you can see that when Penta plays Steele, you’ll notice a lot of misogynist/gross messages fly by during these moments, and it feels like the character does something to normalize that.
People are sometimes dickheads. Tbh I think everyone can be a dickhead now and then, and still be overall fine person. "Just don't be a dickhead" is not useful in any way.
I'm not missing the point that *I'm trying to make*
They cover up stuff like this all the time? No one is denying that they aren't toxic as fuck and enable each other constantly. I have said it in every post here, but I am solely talking about this type of situation and until we hear they have covered this type of stuff up I am not going to sit here and throw accusations like that around because that's pretty serious.  The proof is in the pudding that they are only upset because he got caught or that he should have been smarter?  No, there is no proof towards that being what they meant behind their release statement. Surely you don't want that to be the case as you continue to say that is the case with zero proof despite the proof being in the pudding. Their blatant toxicity isn't what I am talking about in this situation.
How do you feel about Borat, or satire in general? I think the value in comedy is the release it offers to people fed up with assholes. Being able to laugh at them is very healthy.  I think the tiny number of assholes who actually agree with Jordans behavior and dont see the satire arent worth losing the relief and comedy and sometimes even healing for victims that can understand the joke.
I can only speak of my own RP experience playing other games, but I find it that often times when you play a character who’s a hard ass and has power of any kind over another character, others will react much more strongly because we as people don’t enjoy authority over us. In my experience, whenever it came to the risk of losing something, or dying, it would semi-regularly turn into an ooc bitchfest after, even when I was not playing a character that levied insults or was rude in any way.  But Penta is a pretty witty guy and can pretty easily win verbal sparring, and knows the laws of nopixel pretty well and how to make use of them. So now you have a character that knows how to fuck you over, will flaunt his authority over you, and the only recourse you have to vent that frustration is to verbally spar with someone that will have a comeback for anything you say.  I think this would obviously lead to a lot of people feeling frustrated because they don’t feel like a main character anymore. Doesn’t help that Penta’s RP with Jordan sounds so real and convincing, either.
What did Martell do that deserved a ban
Here's a power dynamic that is awkward af and if she did anything to push back, she would probably get shot then banned: https://streamable.com/ih7zaj
> They cover up stuff like this all the time?  Who said this? The entire basis of both your responses are you putting words in my mouth.
I feel like live-streaming RP is a bit different than other forms of media.  When you watch a movie, you can’t go directly message/interact with the recipient of the “satirical language” live in the moment.  It also goes out of character all the time, even in lighter situations, the fourth wall is broken constantly.  Using abusive language in the way Penta does with Steele is the only thing you can do in RP that can actually be as bad on the server as if it were done IRL. That’s why I find the “it’s just RP” defense to not make much sense in this case  I feel like the evidence of the impact of that type of RP is pretty apparent when the person Steele is interacting with changes character abruptly and shut down their RP.  Just my two cents
too sexy
He won’t answer because he’s a MAN
Chang Gang is so cool
>I think accusing the group of possibly being this fucked and doing this kind of fucked thing is a little bit of a stretch.  I said this and then you proceeded to say "I'm not really accusing, they do."  You also are insisting that their release statement was only because they are sorry he got caught or wasn't smart enough to not get caught. Did you not say that? It literally says that in your post \*Either way we will argue until we both are blue in the face so no point in continuing for me.
It depends on the space you are in and the rules you set. Not every place is meant to be safe for victims, or people uncomfortable with things that are wrong. Like murder, theft, torture, terrorism and so on. If you are clear on what is allowed or not people can make their own choice on wether to be there for it or not.

"You sound like you're from the south side 5 years ago." Holy shit so true. At least it's not as bad as Burn's Sanic. Haha
Mickey, Denzel, Leslie, Ellie, oh my god this is way too much COPIUM for me that the boys are all going to come back.
It was indeed not all love
Man, The feeling of relief that these people have coming out and expressing themselves is so overwhelming, I can not even imagine how liberating and free these people must feel having just that one individual off of the server.  The problem is, the behavior has been known and it seems no effort was made to prevent issues like this spiraling out of control.  Will NoPixel make an effort now? How complicit were they with the information they had on Rated? Some things kind of do not add up from behind the scenes.  If there is any one person on the server that makes people so uncomfortable that they have to back away, should be dealt with ASAP.  The power dynamic that Rated had with CG connected to the server and the owner is outrageous, there has to be a way to prevent this from happening in the future and I hope NoPixel comes up with a solution.  Otherwise I can see this type of stuff happening in the future.
The interactions Randy and Mary had where Randy was pissed at Mary even tho nothing affected him was pretty crazy. He was pissed at rpg incident and shit talked mary on twatter even tho he had nothing to do with the situation and the whole s++ incident. It was obvious mary always tried to avoid him. I remember even Violet hated Mary because of Randy even tho Violet never interacted with Mary
I remember like a year ago when Randy was on his "I hate Mary" Arc pt 27 that came out of nowhere Mary called him to try and settle the conflict. It got to a point where she just straight up asked him why he doesn't like her and he legit could not provide a SINGLE reason why, just fumbled a bit and said some shit about how he didn't like her because he didn'l like her.
It wasn't just RP, they weren't friends OOC and it wasn't all love :/
I remember seeing him going out of his way to aggressively treat Kylie like shit and drag it out for as long as possible in RP, just absolutely unprompted. And nothing was done about it. Fuck him and his enablers.
This is why when people target certain people on their different character, even though it doesn't make sense to their character. It should not be encouraged or laughed about "It's just jokes", because what if?   As you see with Rated, all the times he would be on AJ and talk shit about certain cops. Turns out he was being OOC
He was probably the main reason she stopped playing cop in NA. Good riddance
rated is the guy in the spotlight but you can honestly say this about many people on the server. it doesnt feel like rp sometimes
None of it?? Half the people on the server are playing as themselves. It’s not difficult to see. It was deserved and should have been done a long time ago.
Can't wait until the next time a horribly toxic weirdo everyone knows is a horrible toxic weirdo, gets outed as a horribly toxic weirdo and the people who continually protected them will act all shooked
Very little. And if anyone here is thinking, 'phew thank god we got rid of the creep'. He's not the only one. I promise you that. If there was receipts and proof on all the abusive creeps actively on the server we'd be seeing massive bans coming down. Like 20% or 30% of the server.
None of it? I never thought it was even questionable, I thought for years it was common knowlege that he was a shit self-insert, and that he just had clout so it was pointless to fight it, so everyone put up with it. It's only the deflectors that ever say "no man, it's just rp, all love".
remember stuff like this next time someone says they hate someone "ic" but the only reason they can give is "shit cop"
I guess the signs of [OOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6rzXMtFEF0&t=602s) remarks are seen everywhere
Ngl this Tweet made me crack up   Poor Kylie though, she gets abuse every day by pieces of shit who come in her chat and spew transphobic and general shit towards her, whenever Rated was mad at her he would go out of his way to make things as shit as possible for her and send a bunch of chat hoppers who said even more vile shit    Kylie's one of the pillars of the LGBT representation in this community and glad to see her still going strong
[removed]
Self inserts doing self insert things. What a surprise
So this is what happens when you let a lowlife of a human roam around the server never being punished whatsoever a full load of toxicity and culture of fear around group (CG) enforce by the admins
Relentless aggressive interactions with her on both Mary and Angel and if there wasn't conflict he would throw in a bunch of passive aggressive digs. Any of the bigger disputes they had he would run off and whine to his boys and half the city making sure to ratchet up the stress and turn people against her. You could call this conflict RP or whatever but if you watch over a period of time you know it's something very different and it dates back to a beef with Angel from early 2.0 which it's not even worth getting into. He just couldn't let shit go. Fuck him.
Seeing how many people are popping up with stories.  None of it.
God damn the tea keeps on getting better
Time for NP to do a little spring cleaning. Still alot more weirdos and wackos that play in the server.
Everybody new the "It's all love" was bullshit. That's why it was such a great meme here.
CG haven't been playing characters for a long time
New Meta Unlock: People that are constantly toxic OOC are quite possibly shitty people irl as well.  Considering he wasnt even the worst in his group, maybe it's time to start looking at the rest
Find out in roleplay I guess, wait…
The idea that Rated has the mental capability to RP has always been wild.
The way Rated talked to women on this server was belittling. He was very toxic to them. Especially to the female cops.  We all know Ramee is true good guy, but I hope he treats the female cops better. Double R and the way they talk to the Lily Ponds, Demi Blacks, Angel, Vale.. was not always nice.
Rated really failed with the "PUH PUH PUH".... among other things like being a decent human being.
so many people are mad that kylie is successful, it would be funny if it wasn't so sad. Keep sitting in her stream and trying to clip things out of context you lifeless goblins XXDXDXDXDXDXDXDXDXDXD Permanently mad 24/7 because she exists XDXDXDXDXD
🌎 😮 🔫😎 never has been
Watch the rest of them all of a sudden love Demi, Pond, Vale, Angel, and all the other women cops they used to hate and shit talk any time they saw them.
You telling me all those clips that spread all over to multiple YouTube channels with titles that farm inbred comments for weeks wasn't done with love in mind? Crazy 💀 or as they would say  "Classic" 🚬  +certain rpers that react to those clips and upload them on YouTube to push their own narratives
This actually made me laugh too hard.
Well tbf their ordeal isn’t over and the torment will get worse for a time. Cause his viewers are gonna lash out against them.
Yeah, I've been commenting this. Nopixel should actually follow the morality of upholding their rules equally and strictly, and stop letting clouted streamers off. The pattern of rulebreaks and toxic rants shows where a persons headspace is, and giving them special treatment and high place in a big community is dangerous.
I remember one time Mary talking to him very calmly about how he shouldn't hate her, and she is on his side with the tuner shop, she managed to get him to agree but in the end he still stuck with hating her.  No matter what you do with these psychos, all it took was her beating him in a video game for him to have his sexist ego shook and to hate her no matter what.
It is kind of weird when characters seem to hate Mary or Angel having never interacted with either character before. She's had  extremely weird interactions like that with multiple players before. They usually turn out to be pieces of shit.
And he dragged Violet into it, too. Which sets off massive red flags given what Lyndi has implied.
Weirdest thing I saw  was when he randomly started shit talking Mary on Twatter after they had not interacting in months. When she called him to find out why it eventually came down to "I just don't like you". No idea why but it  was obviously ooc motivated.
yea fr he would always find a reason to talk shit about mary or angel which egged on chang gang to do the same
Shouldn’t we say the same about Ramee? But also we can’t compare hating on someone publicly to what we’ve seen about rated ( private dms, abusive relationships and a lot of other stuff)
I mean, same
Kylie confirmed that on stream this morning.
Because its not, so many are just self inserts being themselves and hide their shit personality behind the rp excuse
Yeah, suzy_q went about it the wrong way but she was right in the end.
[removed]
Yeah that happened. I think it was the "way" she accused them and led to it being ignored.  I don't remember how it went down
I miss her, she was always so positive. Every time she called Lang you would always get a smile on your face.
She was done dirty for standing up for people and having a backbone.
Which is sad , because they used to be some really good characters.
What if Rated decides to just go full scorched earth and out a bunch of other toxic people as well? That'd be interesting.
"Will I be a higher rank than Pond"
This is not me hating on Ramee or even suggesting he’s done anything but we don’t know that “Ramee is a true good guy.” We don’t know these people.
Do we know that... not specifically about ramee, we take for granted that the streamers we watch are good people. generally we have almost no actual evidence they are. Im not saying to attack them or whatever. Just to avoid parasocially defending them like chatters are prone to do,
> We all know Ramee is true good guy  Do we? I know barely anything about Ramee's inner beliefs tbh.
"Ramee is true good guy" * conveniently ignoring all the condoning/encouraging death threats twords his peers, going miles out of his way to harass people "in character", and nonstop toxicity for the past 3 years *
How do you see all that’s happening and still say “we all know Ramee is true good guy”? You don’t know him. Nobody here knows him. He could be a good guy, he could be worse than rated, we don’t know.
[removed]
*A true good guy.*  *Please,* even without going over all the other incident, the "Ramee reacts to Goofy proposal to Kitty" should be enough to prevent anyone from saying that with a straight face.
This is why I want Ramee to RP solo, when he's with 'the boys' it's the same shit
Remember when he got shit when on Conan and immediately switched to his crim and started bitching to K about it on radio?
I've had plenty of IC sexist interactions with penta characters over the years and we're legitimately good friends OOC because funnily enough he isn't a piece of shit.   Don't make dumb accusations purely on the basis of not liking someone who's willing to push the line further than others in rp for the sake of entertainment. Because with penta, that's all it is. That's all it has ever been.
Weirdly all of the people who have issues with Rated really love PENTA. Makes you wonder what the difference is. Oh wait, it’s because PENTA isn’t actually an abusive piece of shit and is nice to all of those women outside of RP. Really makes you think.
Well, Penta actually plays a character when he roleplays which is the difference. You can argue that he shouldn’t RP like that and that he truly is an asshole if you want but to try to equate Penta’s RP to a guy who actually abused and harassed multiple women in real life with actual malicious intent is a bit of a misunderstanding of the issue on your part.
*~~Jimmy is a fan of Andrew Tate after all~~*
Penta has undeniably had problems with taking things too far in RP and making women uncomfortable. And, like, I do think he's a bit of an asshole. But I don't really think that's at all on the same level as Rated, or at all on the same level as the way many many other people on the server treat women and LGBT+ people.
He doesn't know you exist lil bro
I'll take fake love over actual abusiveness.
I don’t think there’s anything that can make Ramee like Lily Pond lol
Gay will still be funny tho. That shoe hasn't dropped yet
It’s on the core CG boys to come out and make in clear how much they condemn Rated’s actions to prevent that though. That’s why it was so important for all of MDM to come out and criticise Adam when he was exposed. Even if it does come across as a PR stunt it sends a message.
It would be one thing if someone malds about how a situation turned out once in a blue moon but is generally a decent person the rest of the time. It's an entirely different thing when someone or a group of people are consistently toxic on a weekly basis and barely even get three days for it.  The frequency of incidence should have been a gigantic fucken clue that staff needed to take care of this a long time ago.
That shit was surreal. Then he dragged others into it - I want to say Wiseguy, poor bastard - and it turned into this weird thing where he was just saying awful shit to Mary and I dunno, expecting Wiseguy's character to apologize for associating with her or something? All while Kylie is staying as calm as possible, trying to just placate him enough to make him go away. It was so far beyond the pale and was clearly OOC.
His YouTube channel even calls her crim char Lilly Pond. It's cringe af
Yes. The same can and should be said about Ramee. Saying that Ramee holds OOC grudges against several people on the server and that he is regularly making in character OOC jokes about them is the mildest take ever.
I’ve seen a lot of people jumping on Ramee. I watched a lot of MDM so saw when KhaosAdam raged and have seen clips of when Rated has raged. Those two were a lot more personal and unhinged in what they said. From the clips I’ve seen of Ramee he just vents his frustration and forgets about it until the next time he feels that person wrongs him. Adam and Rated held grudges and genuinely hated people.
Love to see you so candid.  Very entertaining.  Edit:  at the same time things are very serious and I hope the people of NP use this leverage to chase out more abusers
\*sighs\* These boys can't handle a real woman sadly. Hope you're doing well, Cath!
Makes you wonder if Rated was the person she was talking about in her tweets.
you're a wretched person
I think she was speaking for some other woman but that woman didn’t really have any receipts to show and everybody said that she’s just doing it for attention or something like that.
She was very active and always created fun events, especially at roosters rest.
Kebun is the reason I started watching nopixel
Rated: "Oh you think I'm bad?! *Let me tell you about TheChief1114...*"
If he has anything he’s def gonna leak it.
Guy said this to Baas 15 minutes into his first shift in like 4 months.
>condoning/encouraging death threats twords his peers  Really want to see the source(s) on this one please
[removed]
Its why his Yokai arc has been so entertaining. He's just off making rp with new people and having a good time.
The ramee harry content has been too funny.
Wasn't Shotz just whining about this the other day?
The important difference is that when people like Penta and Kyle play sexist characters, the punchline is their characters, not women.
didn’t Penta get banned before because of his treatment towards female roleplayers?
Ayo

Everyone in that group has used their influence with management / owner to be shielded against punishment for public toxic behavior.  The special treatment was so well known many have made comments about never reporting CG for fear they would be the ones getting punished.  Basically forcing victims to remain quiet and endure harassment any smaller streamer would have long been perma banned for.  So long as anyone on the server has rules applied unevenly situations like this will continue to happen. It doesn't have to involve the more private sexual harassment related shit he was doing either. Creating a general toxic environment for fellow players is also something that shouldn't be tolerated form repeated offenders.
They're complicit.
Part of me wishes Wiseguy would’ve built Kylie her WB C7 on Mary instead of building Randy his Lexus. He would’ve had to deal with less bitching about how it sounds, constantly asking WG to change the engine sound on it, asking WG to change how it drives because he didn’t have an OP car.
“Dog shit aids cops”
Agree, but the problem here isn’t that, the problem is Rated harrasing women privately, being abusive and a creep
It was really clear when they were on GoldRush. When Ramee was malding he would vent but cool down. Rated however would not only vent but triple down and find ways to attack whoever it was and push the envelope even through rule breaks
If you watch adam or rated you’ll notice they’re actual the same, the way they talk and act. Ramee just malds that’s the worst part about him.
She accused RatedEpicz of sexual harassment at one point and tried to get his sponsors and NP admins to drop/ban him but everyone called her an SJW and crazy.
That rings a bell
It's insane to think about how many smaller players have left the server because of toxic interactions with the same repeat offenders and how much talent and interesting story lines have been lost because of it.
fuck yea, same here. He was teh roleplay to watch when it was 32 people.  I remember him talking to yung dab about going to the power plant, and he introduces this random ass guy named bobby brown.  Holy fuck was it a disaster and great.  I miss chang.
I can criticize Kebun for a lot but god damn if I wasnt there at like 5am when he broke out Bovice with Uchi and Snake by taking EMS hostage. That entire situation was just so good. And it was even better because Chang and Uchi were enemies at the time and Snake forced them to work together.
Same here. I started watching in 2020 during Mr. K’s trial and the group was fun to watch.
Literal cannibal and serial killer thechief1114?
Here you go :)   https://streamable.com/k9eepb
"I'm done with 2.0 and wont play it again"  Proceeds to make a new character on 2.0 after he claimed he was done with the 2.0 server.
He got banned because Jordan, the *character* \- an intentionally vile piece of shit - would use over-the-top sexist rhetoric, which upset people. The issue was largely that people who didn't know Penta took his dialogue as OOC hostility or toxicity, which baffled Penta because he assumed the other party would understand that all of the IC dialogue was, well, IC.  "Jordan is a misogynist, yes. This character is supposed to be pathetic. He's a fucking loser - he's a fucking drug addict that beats his wives and gets power-hungry over a parking lot, he's supposed to be a fucking *loser* \- that's the joke."
Bloom? Dogshit cop.  Wrangler slaaaaaaander.
I think the point OP is tryin to make here is *not* that regularly going on OOC rants automatically means that you are a misogynistic abuser, but that among a pool of people showing problematic patterns you may very well find a couple of them and that it may not hurt to kill two birds (OOC ranters and potential abusers) with one stone.
No I think the problem is that nopixel won't do anything about toxicity or harassment unless it's of an extremely heinous nature. Otherwise it's totally cool and the people who do it shielded from punishment.
Who did he play on goldrush?
I would also suggest that Ramee has become a lot calmer since the f8 with Penta. It will be very interesting to see how he is moving forward because I always thought Rated brought out the worst in Ramee.
TheChief has Youth Pastor energy. Without any of the diddling vibes.
People like you make me laugh. The guy had expectations of his 2.0 days and was hoping to relive some nostalgia. Then said some stuff that really isn't that interesting. When he had cooled off and time to think. The mans out here trying something else. Just because you say something doesn't mean you can't change your mind. You're holding such a petty thing to someone trying to make them look bad when you just look like a child.  &#x200B;  Grow up.
Cmon man he isn’t rated but the shit he was saying can’t be excused with it’s all ic.
https://streamable.com/4kxfqk
I understand that CG were together for so long and they might know to a certain degree but you literally can’t know the specifics specially when it’s like private dms and stuff. K literally said it’s been 4 years and i still don’t know this guys ( rated) name.
Look man, I was just making an observation. I'm nowhere near as invested into this as you.
I mean sure, that's your prerogative if that's how you wanna take it, but I'd argue that his conversations with Hobbit about this exact subject are pretty relevant. Her characters were on the receiving end of some of Jordan's most abhorrent shit, but she and Penta are close friends and there was an implicit understanding there - she pointed out that people who didn't know him personally might not give him the same credence of it being entirely IC, which is something that Penta seemed to just not understand whatsoever, because for him the RP was completely removed from reality. But if you wanna doubt that then sure, I don't know where you go from there lol, Penta bad?
I haven't watched RP in 6 months just the last couple of days these threads been recommended to me. No investment just clear thinking and trying to ask the right questions.
You just made the point I was trying to make. Your comment made it seem like you thought it was all ok because it was ic.
You're chastising people and writing paragraphs about someone you ain't watched in 6 months....seems pretty invested to me.
Guys like the Mandem, Curtis, Jonthebroski, Ssaab, trying to switch things up, and Shotz crying cause he can't relive the glory days is why he got shit on.

Would be funny if Mickey does the Ray part 2 arc on him
This is some CG RP NGL. So they all are acting like shooting and killing someone from your family has no consequences. The Ray shooting Mickey arc was good because they RPed the consequences.  Here everyone even Jon was laughing. Sadge
Do you not see the difference between the situations? It didn't start as serious RP in the first place
there are lighthearted situations and serious ones. good RPers know how to read the room and distinguish between the two. there's room on the server for sbs funny content and serious storylines
CG does this on the daily for shits and giggles lil bro, the last time bjorn did cucumber order was like a year ago and there's lore why he's bound to it.
You clearly don't know anything about this group because this is a very old bit.
Were you involved? Probably not, so who cares. Just watch the show.

Also if Mickey/Blaustoise took it serious IC and wanted to go further with it, there is not doubt it would have been taken seriously and taken further... Bio is playing his character, it wasn't some fucking around shit, and Lang thinking it would just be a beat down or whatever isn't unreasonable. (things can be funny ooc but serious ic if they want, breaking because something was funny or shocking isn't some crime against rp)
The guy probably didnt watch the what lead upto this just commented lmao
Jesus. That Discord message was a dam-buster, smashing open the 'closed doors'.
Her followup tweet should be read as well.  Server still has a problem even with Rated gone.
Jesus what a creep   that makes sense why Demi got on his shitlist
I hope this makes all the female players feel more comfortable playing on NP that this piece of shit came in contact with. She is right as he was untouchable.
I fear we will be getting more tweets and stories like this. And I am saddened that people had to go through this but couldn’t say anything because of his pull. Glad people finally feel safe enough to come forward.
Her follow up tweet   "I’m no stranger to men trying to sexually harass me on the server and then getting mad when I shut them down. It’s happened before and the person is still treated like a god. Their word against mine just means I’m the one who would be out."   https://twitter.com/EveeTTV/status/1644118521767501824 Interesting
Woah wtf actually Arcadium creepy levels
he was enabled by No pixel Management to the point he thought he can do anything without consequences. I remember when Lily Pond was demoted in the same week she got promoted because Randy bitched about her to Bass.
What the FUCK????
Cam show dude is weird.
Wonder if people thought "randy" had a legit reason to be hating on demi all this time with his weird remarks "ic" that directed his gang and fans to be doing the same thing.
The fact that SO many women in np have had experiences like this and are scared to speak up
WTF THIS GUYS IS A CREEEEP
I hope all this create a domino effect and people call out the rest of mother fuckers that do this shit. When people like him demands a girl to film themselves 99% of the time they share the videos with other people that do the same shit and use them to blackmail them and get more videos. Giving him protection and a free pass to do and say anything he wanted in the server gave him power to do all this shit.
> Made me uncomfortable having to placate this creep because of how much pull he had on the server.  Thats just the sad truth when it comes to NoPixel. They have enabled Rated's behaviour by placing him above the rules for years and punished the people calling him out for his shitty behaviour instead of the actual offender.   It's no suprise people haven't dared to come forward because they would have been the ones getting punished for it.
Yikessssss
YIKES WTF IS WRONG WITH THIS GUY?????????
Yeah there’s no way he’s recovering from any of this and that’s how it should be. This dude is a straight creep.
Yeah, yeah, he's still trying to figure out what he did to get banned. Uh huh.
I feel like there's a whole ''metoo'' bubble waiting to burst on NoPixel and this is just the start of it.
NGL the people that turned a blind eye to obvious OOC abuse is just as bad as Rated.   As a former Rated viewer and as someone that's been a viewer of "Randys" anger from other POVs, you could 100% tell it was OOC and he had a major problem.   However, other streamers, admins, and management, all turned a blind eye in the name of "server health", aka they didn't wanna lose CG by banning Rated.   With that said, props to No Pixel for actually getting rid of that cancer, but it's not the only one still in the server.   So keep that same position when another highly viewed streamer does similar shit!
WTF dude is rich af and they make sites for that, like go there dumbass.  Edit: Oddly enough I posted this tweet on CG reddit and someone reminded me he joked about chaturbate a lot on stream, guess like someone said below it's not just about the hot girl on cam and more the control aspect. What a loser.
All the warning signs of an abuser has been full on display and empowered for over 5 years. He got off on belittling people knowing he could do it with impunity. He did it to all smaller streamers who have no power male and female. But he especially fixated on women, going on tirades about them. Which was rewarded by getting them removed from whitelists, groups and demoted. Let’s hope ramee was just being influenced by his behaviour because he also fixated on the same people. Ramee wasn’t anywhere near as bad and I don’t think he’s one to sexually harass people.   Fixation of hating lily pond, hating every evee/cath character, the Carmella twatter post in game, Mary/angel hate and kayden being removed from CG and martell 911 relishing in her death. All defended by the big man because it happened on the server. All the signs were full on displayed and protected with impunity. All were rewarded by removing them from position outside of carmen who went along with their BS. There’s probably more examples that were swept away as IC conflict.
How could this piece of shit be allowed to operate like this for so long.  Im actually physically sick and its now time to ask questions about how he was allowed to exist in this community for so long.
So dude was a serial predator on female playing on the server. I see why the Big boss and admin team had unanimous vote kick him from the community.
Who would've thought that the top dog protecting openly misogynistic streamers would lead to this? No one could've seen this coming
What the fuck
Now all the chaturbate stuff makes sense 😬
holy shit
It's ok, I'm sure he will be live any minute now to clear this up guys.
What a fucking rat
Really sucks to see this happened to Evee. She seems like one of the most upbeat and helpful people on the server. I mostly watch Kyle myself, but she is always there in the PD meeting telling cops to join for some law studies and such. Even after all this kind of bullshit. Big respect.
Rated has done more good for this server today than he has ever done for the years he's been in NoPixel.  Thank you Rated for creating a mini #MeToo movement in NoPixel.
That's a fucking omega yikes asking for cam shows.
Damn the floodgates are opening with people coming out...Good 4 them.  Glad people are coming out....No one should go through what these woman have been through.  He's a dumbass..Play stupid games and WIN  a stupid prize( looks like he did)
I'm so glad the women of nopixel are starting to feel safer to speak out about this stuff and tell their stories. Fuck that guy, what a disgusting pos.
Ok, I think I'm going to go watch RDR2 RP now, fuuuck this this is weird.
Jesus Christ dude it just keep coming this dude is a piece of shit! I wonder how long he was doing this kind of stuff and nobody did anything about it.
It's good that np is actually doing something about it instead of ignoring it, but they still had a hand in keeping him and others around for profit when it was clear they treat others like garbage, and that tolerence has been for years. I think a lot of this could have been more prevented by np actually removing these people when the signs are clearly there that they're not good, with constant toxicity and literally dozens of rule breaks, but clout and money I guess. Now nopixel's system is fucked to the point women, or anyone, are intimidated to not speak out. That's where favoritism gets you.
yiiiiiikessssss
I think the worst thing about this whole situation is you had this piece of shit out here doing this shit and the people he was doing it to felt like they couldn't report it cause he was seen as untouchable...on a fucking RP server.  It's actually mind boggling. Like people in the real world wouldn't believe it. Hardly from a position of power but rather some guy who played videogames for a living.
“I’m no stranger to men trying to sexually harass me on the server and then getting mad when I shut them down. It’s happened before and the person is still treated like a god.”  Curious to know who she’s alluding to..
Almost need a thread with all these twitter links.
Damn that’s a weirdo good riddance
WHY ARE PEOPLE ACTING LIKE THIS ONLY HAPPENS ON NOPIXEL???????????? NO ONE WILL KNOW UNLESS YOU SPEAK UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WOMEN IT'S YOUR TIME TO SPEAK UPPPPPPPPPP <3
i mean to people starting to have a go at the server, its more then likely like evee said that the piece of shit was covering tracks plus with how private he was and he scrubbing his discord as we found out in the megski screenshots, and without solid proof, and how big of a streamer he was, people didnt wanna risk going against him without it,   &#x200B;  after the megski expose,i bet people wised up, and obviously probably lyndi had shit. just thankful that the server took the cunt out and made the community a safer place for all women, deserves fuck all. this kid, no sympathy, no chances, hope he never streams again, its actually fucking annoying that this dick got the bag.
Owner actually being helpful in that thread!
Let the women of NoPixel have their Me Too moment. Drag these creeps into the light.
cam shows the fuck? bruh evee is attractive but cam shows?? this guy is beyond messed up. i would LOOOOOVE to see him justify all of this. i wanna see a rated hodor moment
WHAT !
wow...
What a loser
[removed]
Hopefully this opens the gate and more people come forward and a big cleanse happens.
 Now what’s the deal an abusive or sexual harasser ? Later it will be a human trafficker serial killer
Was she the one that got that vagos dude banned for him asking to hug it out after holding her at gunpoint? Now it makes sense why she felt a type of way when she had to deal with this in the background.
Devils advocate and I’m sure I’ll catch some flak but is it wrong to ask for a camshow from someone that does camshows. I mean unless he was using his influence to get one for free or just mocking her for doing camshows. Not trying to defend him but there will always be people trying to get their 15 minutes
Glad he’s gone many of us suspected it was something this bad and at least now he can F off with his buddy Adam far away from this community
i hope shes able to recover the discord messages. hes such a creep
Shame she didn't feel comfortable naming them. I'd be interested to hear who exactly it is given her qualifier. Not that it should matter how big or small they are. Hold em all accountable.
Wow. Yeah, I hope she feels comfortable enough to come forward at some point... What the fuck.
Very true but I think a lot of people will be taking a rethink in their behaviour after this.      It will be like the me too shit a few years ago on twitch.   Now one in instance has happened others will come to light or people will be more forthcoming.
[Tweet and a reply from a month ago probably just as important...](https://twitter.com/EveeTTV/status/1631878270022041600) [screenshot](https://imgur.com/ig290HC)
 And Cath. And Hobbit. All of them coming out to dumpster this scumbag while the higher ups all ignored it despite them begging for something to be done about it for years.
Is it really going to make women feel more comfortable that someone can get away with being sexist and horrible to women on stream until the absolute worst possible things come about about them? If anything I think this is disheartening,  Rated was allowed to get away with so much blatant toxicity for so long.
> She is right as he was untouchable.  Which highlights another problem with the server in general, and why treating people differently based on their viewership causes problems.
It was so nice seeing [this](https://twitter.com/megski_/status/1643644826276048897?s=46&t=6e-vc79gW-4yUiR51UjSkg) yesterday
Im confused so he was asking a cam girl to do cam’s for him? Help my boomer ass out😂😂it says in the discord she was a cam girl
But hey he honestly doesn't know what he did
what can you expect? most of these guys have a low level of social skills. that plus their having an inflated ego from popularity produces massive clusterfucks like this

The trans women on the server get a looooot of shit offstream. Several "chatters" who are queer, and of any gender, have mentioned similar behaviour by other players.  Rated being gone is great, but there's a lot more to go.
Not just the women, NP has put this group on such a power pedestal for years and struck down anyone who has stood up to them. They helped create the monsters and the culture.
This is a problem anytime there's a power structure that goes unchecked and moderated, unfortunately. Its everywhere where there's people in positions of power where it seems like very little can do anything to punish them or challenge that power.
What makes no sense to me is why admins still baby him and his...associates.  Dude was far from the #1 NoPixel stream in views. Many surpassed his. Even XQC didn't have as much sway, but nope, he and others got/get their boots licked.   This clique shit needs to die.
You underestimate how easy it is to just ignore something like this and continue streaming.   I think a guy named Giantwaffle got accused of actual rape and still just streams with a strict chat.
I took that statement as he knew what he did he just didnt think it was that bad.
It clearly needs to happen
Misogyny and queerphobia have been noted for years on the server. So much of it is enabled or even directly encouraged.   Look at the people who still bash many of the women who play cops, or the morons treating male-male relationships and sex as some funny haha butt of a joke.   Rated is far from the only loser on the server, he was just one with a lot of evidence that could not be ignored.
He was entitled as fuck, probably thought it was an honour for the girls to be even asked by him. Thats how it goes with these guys - the privilege of their attention should be enough.
For these guys it's not about just seeing naked women. What excites them is exerting control over women and forcing them to do something they don't want to do.
THANK YOU. People congratulate the admins and owner, but they've allowed misogyny for SO LONG on the server.
Huh ?
Evee even alludes to it in her second tweet. They let way too much of this shitty culture fester and they gaslit folks into thinking shit like this was just character traits despite multiple women coming forward for ages (even organizing as a group!) and stating that it was an issue.
Who’s some good rdr to streamers. I’ve been watching middleditch a bit and loving it but need some alternatives
she used to work as a cam girl back in the day, the guy was just using that as an excuse to be a fucking creep i think
They didn't know his real name till recently, he lies to them about it till he had to sign papers for contracts stuff.
That's kind of out of pocket.  I get hating on CG, but it's something different to push that narrative on people.
are you really this fucking dense?
Huh?? You accidentally post this on the wrong thread? Evee certainly does not do cam shows
She may now. The boss man just replied saying discord can retrieve DMs in these kinds of situations. So she may have a way to get proof of the incidents now.
When Choi did she got flamed by management and banned :/
it always bothers me a lot the tone the owner uses whenever someone comments about sexism on the server.
How is that just as important?
Devil's advocate here, but it needs to be said. As Evee said here, he covered his tracks to a point where she couldn't prove it. At that point in the eyes of the staff it's their word against his and it becomes a very hard thing to pull the trigger on.   In the same breath, that also explains the very sudden execution they pulled here. Likely because he fucked up in covering his tracks and got concrete proof.
This is part of why it is so shitty. He should have been perma-banned long ago just for overflowing toxicity. If they had done the bare minimum of holding Rated accountable for his bullshit, he wouldn't have been given so many opportunities to harass people.
Hold up someone is being sexist my lil heart hurts or just fucking ignore the dude tf
Because nopixal is a business at the end of the day
That doesn't really apply here because I'm pretty sure once what he did came to light he got kicked to the curb. Being a cry baby when arrested isnt anywhere near as bad as what rated did.
Jordan Steele picked her up from the airport I think haha
[removed]
This is so awesome! I haven’t seen this. Thanks for sharing :)   Edit - she is prolly 100x the RPer he is too!
I don't know this streamer or her background. But if she chose to do camwork on her own time, that's not an open invitation to her coworkers in a different job to solicit her for cam shows. That really shouldn't need to be explained.
I think she was a cam girl but has been on twitch 3+ years now,
Dude deleted the messages out of his brain too
Ssaab and most of the admins are fence sitters when it comes to big streamers. they do nothing until someone defend themselves against them then they ban both of them to keep everyone happy. happened twice with Ramee and Penta ( they waited until Penta defended himself then they banned both of them ) and recently it happened with Gable, Taco, and Rated. if Palin and Penta didn't defend themselves then no one was getting banned.
Yikes, imagine having to placate to a sexual abuser as well as hold their hand in a video game.   The projection from Rated is crazy too, "There is something wrong with your head." It's crazy to think Nopixel management protects people like this and make sure they are on top in RP at the same time.
yea...
you know kylie gets shit on and would get a ban on cop so much its memed on   yeah who doesnt see the fucking target on her back and the reason that I at least thought of was lgbtphobia and sexism.
> The trans women on the server get a looooot of shit offstream. Several "chatters" who are queer, and of any gender, have mentioned similar behaviour by other players.  You said in another comment that it came up on pentas stream with some of his queer chatters, do you remember when it happened/have a link to it? I'd definitely like to hear that
Yeah many low viewer count streamers are afraid of speaking up because they know what will happen if the offender in whatever situation is someone who holds just a lil bit of power on NoPixel - it's scary
What? You can't be serious...Waffle form all of the people?!
I mean, if he didnt think it was that bad he probably wouldnt have said "im not an evil person"  You dont randomly say that in a public statement before any specific accusations are made if you dont think the perception of what you did will make you look evil.
It's not only about minorities. People on the server turn the blind eye on any toxic behavior - almost no one is speaking up.   They are silent during IC meeting and they do this during OOC meetings that used to be streamed as well.  No one wants to be a change they want to see and they are just silent until toxic or vile shit is happening to them. There is no comradery and support and it's a sad truth
Probably liked the feeling of power to control and dominate people in the community as well
Forcing them to do something they don't want to do is definitely the key in your statement which is so sad. Tip a girl on a cam site and they will do whatever, but hey they expect and/or enjoy it.
It's always control. Using things like "sex" or bodies is just one method over that, and a lasting one at that.
Randomly used to say it on his streams
MrMoonsHouse. THE OG of Rpers.
Zetark vertiigo luka_24 to name a few grigorypeppo is another one
Atopderekmountain is fucking solid. Stumbled upon him when Chief and the Chucklefucks were playing RDR2 RP
you hit the nail on the head on the last part. doesn't matter if someone's doing sex work its still disgusting to ask for shit like that
Ramee called him out 2 years ago  and there was drama around it due to him finding out he lied about his name also Kevin while he could get mad and turn bad he doesn’t like that stuff the other thing is they wanted him to meet them but he didn’t want to which is a red flag
I'm not pushing any narratives onto anyone it's simple logic to get to the conclusion i'm getting at.
Not at all, I’m just trying to have a conversation
How about you provide a counter argument then. Absolutely worthless response.
https://mobile.twitter.com/EveeTTV/status/1368785323027730432
She may not anymore but she certainly did. She’s talked about it on twitter before
That would be incredible. Seemed like she was talking about Rated with the deleted messages tho so no telling if the other offender did that.
Find it hard to belive that discord will give out logs to users requesting them, maybe authorities.     Just some quick googling shows that discord has publicly said that DMs are deleted instanly from their servers (might not be true and just flagged as deleted)
I don't think discord would give her logs UNLESS lawyers are involved.  However, she does have grounds to have discord investigate said deleted statements and possibly get him removed from discord.
Because the owner is scared to be put in the same box as people that are named in such situations.   Unfortunately instead trying to encourage a positive change owner just brushes off stuff and moves on hoping people like her will never come out with evidence against most important people on and for the server
How do you expect women to come forward about harassment and sexism if this is the reply you’ve gotten in the past?
> Likely because he fucked up in covering his tracks and got concrete proof.  You can figure out the chain of events if you follow some people on Twitter. Gets revealed Rated was dating one of his viewers in January for a few years, but he was also dating Lyndi at the same time too, so he was cheating on them. Toxic towards both of them based on the messages.  Angels had an IRL meetup last month, they all unfollowed Rated during that trip and left his Discord. It's likely where the other Angels finally convinced Lyndi to speak out.
[removed]
Why would he cover his tracks she was a cam girl ? What is there to cover its normal to ask
Sure, but controversies that are created because of letting some people essentially be perceived as untouchable like this really isn't good for business either.
A poorly run business at that. This is once again another great example.
yeah and if it was a good one they wouldn't let people who are openly toxic in public represent their brand.
I fail to see how it doesn't apply when we're in a thread about a woman who said she was afraid to speak out specifically because she knew he was "untouchable" on NoPixel.  If NoPixel didn't have the tendency to enforce rules based on popularity, perhaps these events would've come to light much sooner, and he wouldn't have gotten away with it for as long as he did and apparently with as many people as is shown by others who now feel they can speak out as well.
Damn that was her? She played off him really well for that ride to the barber
[removed]
there is a huge difference between talking to chat, acting and doing improv in a game and actually socializing. not everyone who comes into content creation are well-socialized and are decent people. that's why drama channels on youtube and reddit itself exists
I refuse to watch them or defend them. Like you said, they watch and fence sit. If they're not allowed to do anything and hate that, then they should step down and say why.  The fact that Gable was three day banned, or that Ramee barely got anything for numerous OOC things of his, is just gross.
He did not discuss it on stream, the chatters have mentioned it before and have PMed several of us about it. :)     Not my story to tell, they can do so if/when they wish.
Well that's been clear of others in the group....like the famous Ramee controlling PD clip.
Literally the first thing that popped into my head while reading this. Those little sayings make a lot more sense now
Thanks!
For context  here rated https://youtu.be/XTtWLNFWHvQ Ramee https://youtu.be/Tf9cFNQxHcY Kevin https://youtu.be/aI8-gAE87so
That's dumb as fuck man. People like Rated compartmentalize their lives in a way that even the people he's closest to IRL would have no clue what he's doing, let alone people he only has a relationship with online.  He's obviously very good at hiding his tracks and is extremely manipulative. Suggesting anyone was not only aware, but actively covering up the shit he was doing is such a bad faith interpretation of a situation. Just because they're prone to being extremely toxic doesn't mean they're complicit in covering up prolonged harassment of multiple women.
Would you walk up to a pornstar and think it's appropriate to ask them if they would have sex with you on film? Being in the sex industry is a job, that doesn't mean you can just treat those people as sex objects.   The worthless and honestly uneducated response was yours my friend.
You want me to provide a "counter argument" about why you shouldn't sexually harass somone?
You’re wrong but whatever. To your OP though, there is something called consent. Even if someone engages in producing sexually suggestive content or even sex work doesn’t make it acceptable for someone to harass or attempt to take advantage of them.
Second tweet said: "It’s happened before and the person is still treated like a god. Their word against mine just means I’m the one who would be out." So definitely suggests someone that is still on the server or streaming at least and people are unaware of what they are like/turn a blind eye. She did just respond though saying she is going to try and get the messages recovered. So likely not the end, as if it was just Rated no one would have issues believing her at this point.
All in all, it doesn't really matter to me what caused his demise, I'm just happy it happened.
Did they come forward though? From the context I'm seeing, many of them didn't come forward, because they didn't have proof.  In this very tweet, Evee says: "I could never get proof and I thought no one would believe me."   This implies that she never came forward before now.    And even if it's 5 people's words against others, it certainly builds up a pattern and puts you in a spotlight, but it's also very understandable within the realm of human nature to not pull a trigger on that without any tangible proof.   It metaphorically places the finger on the trigger, and when something tangible hits them, they pull without hesitation.    This both explains the very sudden execution of the ban, and the perceived confusion from many involved parties.
When has she ever been a Cam Girl? It is never normal to ask for Cam, it's just cringe AF
Not that bad for business tho, dude should have been banned a long time ago but he gets banned and now nopixal is the good guy in this situation.
Victims don't have to be great people to be victims. Even bad people can be abused, assaulted, etc. Fuck off with your victim blaming shit.
Ahh that makes sense, I never really chat because it's just not for me so I was curious, thanks for the reply tho!
Have you been living under a rock ? he met with Merjald,pmoney,chelb, sincere and son and you're telling me his "boys" don't know how he looks like. It's pretty clear they know much more and you don't want to accept it.
Wrong? I linked the proof. And asking would be consent. I mean it’s creepy af either way but in my mind a cam girl saying someone asked for a show seems like the expectation.
>person is still treated like a god  That's pretty damning to say.
Yeah I read it. I'm saying her second tweet reads like it didn't involve discord. So I figured the ability to pull discord messages that were deleted may not help.  Hopefully, if the other person did use discord (based on her other tweet) then we see another ban on the way.
Of course, more so just pointing out it's very likely she got support from the people around her which is important too. They helped this happen.
She says in the logs that she used to do it, but quit when she moved to twitch.
[removed]
>but in my mind a cam girl saying someone asked for a show seems like the expectation.  Do you think it's appropriate to sexually harass someone just because they were/are promiscuous or once engaged with sex work?   You acknowledge that it's creepy, but did you just forget that she no longer does cam stuff?   Even if she still did that, does that make it the "expectation" to receive those types of messages from coworkers/fellow roleplayers?  Cmon man.
He also asked for "other weird stuff" and the post doesn't really imply he asked once, got told no, then fucked off. Also cam girls, strippers, porn stars, etc shouldn't have to constantly wave people off if that is no longer their career. Like I said in another comment here, there are millions of cam girls out there, why did it need to be his coworker?
Someone's definitely shitting bricks right now.
Oh, absolutely.   I'm honestly pretty certain Lyndi will get support from the Angels either way, and I'm very happy to see it.
ok, but asking anyone for cam is still cringe AF
[removed]
"You dont know what goes on behind closed doors", Rich considering neither does Kebun clearly, Do you think we'll see CG publically come out and condemn Rated for his actions?, Hell no they will stick to their little statement and that is it because they have to protect the "brand".  You know who does know what goes on behind those closed doors, Rated, You think CG want to risk Rated bringing them all down with him?, You think CG have'nt said some dumb shit that would get them in hot water when discussing things in private that Rated was privy to?, You think CG want that kind of stuff coming out?.  Everyone has seen the way CG speak about other streamers ON stream they are toxic as hell, Just imagine the kind of shit they say/do behind those closed doors, They have not condemned his actions at all, They have offered ZERO support to the victims, CG care about CG and that is all they care about.  By no means am i saying CG knew what Rated was doing and covered for him however CG will 100% cover their own back and distance themselves from this as much as possible while making sure not to publically attack Rated because if anyone is going to have anything on CG that is going to damage their brand its going to be Rated and no way in hell they would want to risk that happening.
Oh, absolutely. Just because someone is currently or previously did that type of work, doesn't mean that you can just creep in the DMs for something.

>I sat there and heard HC parrot the same twisted shit his hoppers said to me for months.  oof.
People sure have a weird mentality saying "I feel bad for ___ toxic streamer for being banned for abusive/manipulative behavior! I hope they stream again soon!" Yet no one bats an eye for the people who are victims of their attacks. People need to be held accountable for their shitty toxic behavior and the friends who stay silent for them need to stop enabling them too.
Turns out growing up acting like a gangster online and being enabled and praised for treating people like shit as a part of your brand and targetting women at every turn all the while making millions irl does not turn you into a healthy well adjusted adult. huh. who knew.
>I dunno. I guess surviving people trying to kill you with heavy weapons has a way of bringing things into perspective.  >Little men roleplaying as tough guys from their bedrooms and making women feel less than dirt, sexually abusing them? Sit and fucking spin.  Lol get em cath
Vale literally got hamstrung and lost all of her certs because of popular clips of her shooting this specific guy on the server and him ranting. Here's hoping she can come back to fair treatment finally, when her time is served in Ukraine.
Glad to see Cath's spirit hasnt been broken
The replies on this tweet... pathetic little incels standing up for their streamer lol... actually disgusting.
Dropping bombs from a war zone, ironic
Common Cath W
Gigacath
Let him be the first to go but not the last to leave. And good to see Cath pulling 0 punches here.
yeah it should be a fat RIPBOZO from everyone   The server's better off
Yo imagine getting shit on by everyone, sucks right.   Imagine getting shit on by someone you ostracised to the point they lost enjoyment in their job and chose to volunteer in a war.    Lil bro just got roasted by someone in a warzone.
Love Cath  This has to be so cathartic for so many on the server
> I'm beyond minding my words because the environment I'm in and the work I'm doing eclipses the importance of gaining or losing streaming clout for me but fucking hell.        Can't argue with that. That's for damn sure.
God damn you love to see it.
These comments... YOU JAILED MY FAVOWITE STWEAMA!!! You WORST cop EVA... Are people after today and everything said really going after a Character in game, Vale, completely ignoring why this happens and not talking about the true acts that caused the ban? Holyyyy...
Need her home ASAP

When she's taking some time out from fighting a fucking war to drop some truths you know people are fucking done with that guy.
God I miss Cath so much
Unfortunately cutting out this bit of necrotized flesh doesn't do much good for the big picture, as others are still making it a rotten experience. That being said, good riddance to hot garbage and I really hope the trend of kicking assholes out continues.
As a woman who has experienced a very emotionally abusive relationship that almost broke me...my heart goes out to the victims. A lot of ppl down play how much words hurt but ultimately those words are a catalyst...a starter fire that turns into a bomb. So glad to see the toxicity removed...should have been sooner
What the fuck with the weirdos in the replies.. Bunch of "He abused you because you deserved it!" andies...
[removed]
Glad someone has the courage to speak out against other people on the server as well. CG and Management fostered an environment that allowed this to happen by having the gang be put on a pedestal to the point where no one could speak against them without being banned or having everything taken from them in RP.
Gigafuckingchad. Cath is awesome.
One thing that will burn forever in my Soul...  CathFawr Lost EVERYTHING on NP. Her certs, rank, position, white list privileges, EVERYTHING! And for what? Some bullshit accusations of "aggressive role playing"? Kinda makes you wonder on who made the accusations, and how many people got away the same sort of thing? r/CathFawr, it's good to see that you healthy. Get back to your home safely, my dear.
All the little incels and boys with those Twitter replies, trying to defend Rated…yikes. I love that one of their arguments is, “well you don’t have to abuse HIM now”. No fuck that. That man deserves everything that’s coming his way.
Holy shit actually gigachad
I really miss Cath being around; absolute savage. Hope she's doing well out in UA.
Love that fact of people speaking on rated right now, the scary thing is they arent talking about people that are scumbags in the server or just streamer interactions in general.  Just think of alot of people are being silent when it comes to others being assholes in general because they are scared to speak out incase it fucks up there future of being a streamer.  All i can say is SPEAK YOUR MIND !!! Dont let people control your actions
CathWawr
I really hope this opens NoPixel managements eyes that Rated is by far not the only problem on the server and actually does something about it. The people he was associated with on a daily basis are in ways just as bad as him but will probably get away scot free.
a certain animal that wont be named defended his boys for awhile I dont doubt he wasnt aware of this.
Some of those twitter replies, though.  Imagine telling someone who is literally putting their life on the line to volunteer to go to a warzone to defend a foreign country that they aren't a good person because you disagree with how they played pretend cop in a video game.  Fucking unreal.
Imagine being this based and you’re fighting in a war zone. Cath a real one.
I miss her so fucking much, hope she stays safe and can eventually come back better than ever. Legit my main reason for falling out of love with RP/Nopixel.
Sing it Queen. Fuck abusers.  This guy cosied up to people with power, became their "Friends" and then whispered in their ears for YEARS to further his own agenda. They might deny it but he's manipulated more then those he abused.
You are really cool cath! I hope you stay safe!
Nothing but respect to Cath, she is a total galaxygiga chad.   Once she comes back, gets on Vale and gets the Swat leadership position back from that vile man is gonna be glorious.
Damn she killed it with this tweet and her replies. I’m a fan now!
We’ll not that anyone was unclear on why he was banned, I think it’s pretty clear now. I personally feel dirty for ever watching the guy. I guess I just never paid close enough attention.
God I love her.
I feel like this is leaning dangerously heavy in sweeping all the problems onto one guy rather than addressing the widespread problems and many more that engage in this behavior. Sadly one of which is the owner of the server.
They should rename Bullet Club in honor of Cath/Vale.
I fuck with Cath and agree fully with their takes.
Big Cath W
That's my OG.
Go off Queen!

Is there a post showing what he actually did or what?
[removed]
he should get sued ,otherwise same shit would happend to other woman in the future.
I don’t really watch rated but I remember like quite a while ago he got into some drama with Carmen about slut shaming her on NP Twitter but they squashed the “beef” immediately. He didn’t really apologize he said it was all jokes and all love lol. And this was just one thing I noticed and thought was wayyyy outta line (but obviously he didn’t face any repercussions). Kinda not surprised at this now, but glad it finally happened.
Let's pretend I'm a streamer on NoPixel. For a couple of years I've watched people like Randy and Ramee never face any real consequences, while at the same time, I see other people getting banned for doing those same things. Now Randy starts doing some shit to me. What the fuck am I supposed to do? They don't punish him, so why would I report him?  OOC toxicity needs to be handled immediately and without tolerance. Toxic environments breed even more toxicity. If they just banned Randy when he got his 30 warning points, none of this shit would have happened. Well, it at least wouldn't have happened here.
Looking back at the people who always laughed whenever Rated & Ramee berated specific cops on both their characters...
Crazy how that works and people who bend over backwards to keep the "peace", but in reality they make it worse in the name of "peace".
Thats pretty bad isnt it
Dude, Blau was talking about the situation at the beginning of his stream and a donation came up talking about "I feel for the victims, but I hope Rated is also okay. He is still young... blah blah blah". I almost lost my head. That mentality is so triggering. Rated hasn't even apologized and was actively trying to keep gaslighting people. But someone comes in and says "he is still young". Fuck anyone who brings up that narrative.
On the bright side, judging by the CG sub, most people have dropped him besides a couple complaining about cancel culture. It's a bonus for everyone if the ones complaining continue to support him and leave nopixel with him
And he probably isn’t the only one either.
https://youtu.be/ljZVBf9G-QM
I take offense to this because I had a toy called a sit and spin as a kid and that shit was fun as fuck.
Pretty much this. She's doing something most of would never do, ever, unless forced. Meanwhile people are bitching about roleplay cops v crims while living in the comfort of their homes.   Have fun with your lives people.
Eeeeeh, same energy different people.
I mean, management basically protected this guy for years despite constant toxic outbursts until the evidence became so overwhelming they're forced to boot him.    Lets not act like this is some great awakening for NP  staff and all wrongs will be made right. This seems more like a covering their asses type deal.
If anything it's stronger than it's ever been, and fuck yes
She's a soldier, literally...
haven’t been around no pixel in ages. but wasn’t she going to help in ukraine? or am i mixing her up with someone else?
Andrew Tater Tots
Smoking Russians and pieces of shit like Rated on twitter from a Warzone. Iconic shit right here
Same shit they've been saying for years without basis in reality.
Coming to the end of a few free days right as this shit dropped
The website is ran and owned by a transphobe this is objectively a waste of time.
As I said in another comment, choosing to speak out at the wrong time allows someone who is abusive and manipulative to change the narrative and paint the person speaking out in a negative light. It's called DARVO- deny, attack, reverse victim and offender.  In a david and goliath situation, if you get DARVOd by a larger creator it's very easy to have your existence on twitch/np crushed by a dominant narrative, irrespective of facts. Because "everyone is saying it!"  My shit is entirely insignificant compared to what the girls he directly abused went through. I just spoke my mind on my tiny slice of the shit that got thrown my way.
As the first tweet already kinda hints at, NP management needs to realize that when a player "acts" toxic in-character that might very well not be an act and just who they are in real life. If someone in-game turns into a toxic asshole whenever they come across a female character, a homosexual character, a muslim character, a black character or whatever, chances are that's just a reflection of who they are as an actual human.
All we can hope for is that they stop enabling this type of behavior. It shouldn't have had to get to this point for them to finally act.
Blaming cg for what rated did is a terrible take
Quote:  "They'd have to shit on my chest to get permabanned".  That's what he said about Rated & Ramee.
don't beat yourself up, many watched him.....ultimately he has to own up, not his viewers. and sadly i don't see any apology from him yet. that alone speaks volumes imo
The Bullet Club has already been removed from the server. It was pretty much instantly removed after his ban. Probably hard to notice since no one used it anyways
YES!! Make it "The Vale" Perfect name since it implies "veil" Putting a veil on gun sales?
This. They could make it the new HVTU office or something. It already has the gun range.
I'm sorry I arrested your streamer and/or they are now banned for sexual abuse, or said something you don't think a woman should say
*Dense fucker alert*
Staff was basically complicit, even if they didn't know the specifics of what was happening.  A highly divisive  person being openly toxic to other players and getting "protected" by management from the types of punishments anyone else would have faced.  Of course that's only going to encourage them to continue behaving badly and dissuade anyone from reporting the player.  Players have openly talked about being scared to report CG for years.  Could staff have known he's be this much of a piece of shit? No, but they still sat by while many other public displays of toxicity towards players continued year after year.
That entire gable and taco and rated situation was the shining example of why it's just never worth it to engage with certain crowds that don't get punished. Since the only person getting fucked for that is Gable who probably won't be rehired to PD because someone went OOC on him first and ripped him out of RP.
It's always too crazy seeing people try to protect the way some people shit talk cops and say it's just fun criminal rp. There is a very clear tone of voice people use when they are just rping and when they actually mean what they are saying to people.
“Dog shit aids cops” aka the cop wouldn’t play stupid to my 100 attempt at doing the same thing
Yes, I hope the people who coddled and encouraged people like Rated take a good hard look at themselves.
I said it earlier and Ill say it again now. CG had to know something was up with this and its insulting that none of them came forwards and only did something when shit hit the fan and even that was just a simple he's no longer with us while they keep quiet. Fuck that shit
“I hate pond, I need to be a higher rank than her, fuck her. Actual AIDS cop.” - rated, ramee  “Hahaha those silly kids” - saab
Nothing is more yikes than ramee coming around on Conan just to bitch about cops that he have barely even interacted with on conan. Both Rated and Ramee have been shit talking Lily pond for years since that prison incident back in 2.0 that was like 3 years ago.   Ramee is just as bad as rated when it comes to calling people weird ooc and shit talking them isn't it crazy that all these weirdos that type in the twitter comments all follow the same people and stem from that specific community??
I wonder if Ramee thinks those walls are closing in.
Rated should just double down at this point and bring everyone down with him cause you know it wasn’t just him talking to himself behind close doors ..
its so weird when people feel like they gotta justify it with "its RP :Smile:"   you dont go its RP for everything but this and we know why and you dont have to laugh : )
It's one of those things where I am conflicted. Many people have been beaten down by them over years to the point where they feel like they have to keep their head down and just let them get away with shit. Very few people have the clout or the mental fortitude to have kept fighting back the whole time.  ~~At what point does a victim become an accomplice? It is easy to sit on the side line and say 'If I was them, I would rather quit than sit there and enable the abuse'.~~  EDIT: Sorry for wording this horribly, obviously it has given people the impression that I am victim blaming.   Let me reword the last couple sentences: Not everyone who people might claim is an accomplice is one, they are likely victims. Us on the sidelines can easily sit here and cast judgement on people claiming they are accomplices, but so much has happened to people over so long, plus things behind the scenes, that things are a lot more complex than people might like and we shouldn't be as hard on people who have themselves had to deal with this bullying.
But not surprising.
People have been using the “he’s so young” excuse for Rated since 2019. You would think after years of repeating it they would get the hint he just won’t change.
Bro he's so young though. He's got so much of his life ahead where he can prove to be an even bigger shithead!!!
Not gonna lie, it was pretty funny to see how upset his chat got when he watched Penta's clip.
Saying someone is young only means they hopefully can still grow the fuck up and become better, but a fact like that alone doesn't just dismiss what they've already done, nor does it mean they get credit for that still being possible. When you mess up, you actually have to do something about it and take responsibility to get to that point, and trying to cover stuff up, deflect, and downplay your actions to salvage your career is not that.
Yea that shit is wild to me. I can't imagine my mind defaulting to that kind of thought process when reading about stuff like this happening. It's like we live in different worlds.  I'm hoping Blau ripped into the guy that donated that message.
That excuse is valid but not for anyone over 18 to 20 years old imo. Rated is more than old enough to know better.
There’s some underlying truth in the statement that people deserve second chances, but it’s very different from having the platform and opportunities you had before.  It’s very clear that he has underlying problems with women and I hope he sorts them out and goes and gets a job at McDonald’s
Most of these streamers are all swimming in the same piles of shit and groups/cliques off stream, just different areas of the same pile of shit that's all. They can try and mask the shit with different vocabularies and ways of delivering it, but it's the same steaming pile of shit at the end of the day.
I hope rated goes into retail and gets the worst customers ever
These people are redeemable only if they find religion or a spiritual awakening from psychedelics and lose their ego, IMO. But not starting a cult, that'd be even worse, to be clear. No amount of apologizing will make up for it. Source: more life experience than Blau.
Lmso no joke I cleaned out my grandparents house over the weekend and found.one
My sitter had two but the ball was half deflated under the one (if im thinking of the same thing) half the time since i was younger i got the deflated one and had to pretend to have fun :)
"Sit and spin" reminds me of an epithet my stepdad was fond of, which was "Sit on a pair of secateurs and twist."
Dude those were the shit! Used to make myself sick daily on that fucker.
Oof
She is, apparently shes currently on a break according to what she posted in this thread
She's been in Ukraine for months now I think.
RR getting all the smoke
same old shit, cops are AIDS....my steamer was shot by cops but they didn't do anything...nevermind the constant ramming and head ons etc. i respect both sides but  the struggle is real.
Stay safe, stay strong! Miss you Cath!
When you’re done being a hero come home, you’re missed.
You guys should cancel rest of the toxic individuals too, thank god he is gone
Please tell me you yell "EAASSSSSTSIIIIDDEEE" when clapping Russians.     /s (kind of)
I noticed over the years a few other manipulative people who is still on the server right now in powerful positions. One of the main problem is having gullible people at the top who easily trust people. They get manipulated and easily trust 1 narrative.  Something major like this happens, I hope these people look at themselves and their behavior. Fix this shit moving forward.
Yeah i posted this and i didnt see ur comment on reddit but i was speaking out on your tweet, Honestly i feel so bad for the people that dont want to speak out because they are scared, Cath you are a legend and i 100% agree with you.   I just hope people will read everything today, understand from all the tweets and other social platforms that they are not alone.  Also PS. Cath be safe <3
>It shouldn't have had to get to this point for them to finally act.  This is essentially the NoPixel slogan.
I think they are blaming CG for what CG does. Rated wasn't the only one doing the things Cath is talking about to cops on the server.
Bullshit. They leveraged their presence on the server for special treatment. Their toxic behaviour thrived under that protection from the top and it's only because one overstepped by an unignorable distance that anything is happening.
[removed]
How's the saying go?       >Tell me who your friends are, and I will tell you what you are.
Rated IMO was one of the less toxic members of CG. So...
I give the admins a little bit of leeway because, be honest, if <insert admin> tried to ban him what do you think would happen?    The toxicity starts at and is approved by the owner of the server.
Honestly, this whole thing probably gives him a better chance now. He might get rehired as damage control.
When those people also say the exact same thing on multiple characters AND OOC to their chats, its very clearly just OOC toxicity.
“Bloom? Fucking dog shit cop. Only gets promoted to corporal because he comes on duty.”
We all know who didn't:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4x6iqW5wPY
I think it'd probably better if those people were removed from those staff positions.  Obviously their judgment is questionable.  Even without these more heinous allegations the guy had been openly toxic for years and allowed to be.  Only now that stuff like this is coming out, that could devastate NP as a business, is something being done.
[removed]
Looking back its obvious, sure. However i think so much toxicity came out of that group, that it was impossible to know back then. Ultimately the toxicity should have been stopped a LONG time ago, maybe then the warning signs from specific people wouldve been way more obvious, instead of being lost in the waves of hate.
"oh no shes crying chat" - saab   this quote will forever be why I think hes part of the problem because he can shut down the situation that leads to crying but no he lacks that type proactive thinking
You know he's been shitting on Bloom as well and the only reason probably Bloom didn't get Vale-d is because Owner actually likes him.   Bloom, Pond, Vale, Dan, Wrangler and Suarez in the past, all living rent free in those heads.
[removed]
i thought ramee and rated had serious beef in the past, not sure if it was about stuff like this, but in CG, ramee seems to be the one that should be least called out over this.
Speak out and get your career bombed  Or   Grin and bear it and survive, because its not 100% of the time and the rest of the time is great  That isn't being an accomplice and you are victim blaming
What a terrible take. Literal victim blaming
> they would get the hint he just won’t change.  More that enabling that behavior means he can't change - or has no reason to change.
I understand and genuinely agree almost times when people say ‘he’s young and has made a mistake’, but that’s for your everyday shit not being abusive, the fact people use it in that light is fucking crazy
Somehow I made it through my entire youth without harassing women :o
"He's a promising athlete, it was only a little rape"  Same energy
They were clutching their pearls acting high and mighty. "I hate Penta omg he's gloating about it!"   I wonder why people might be happy an abuser got yeeted. what a mystery.
There was probably a lot of Rated/Certain Gang viewers at that time. Usually chat likes Penta.
I keep forgetting Blau is like 32. Dude looks perpetually stuck as a 21 year old.
He kind of just said "yeah nobody should be harassing Rated." and how he doesn't revel in anybody's downfall.  Blau always kind of RP'd Mickey as idolizing Randy and wanting to be close with him. His community followed suit and found the friendship endearing. So i'm sure he's trying to navigate this carefully.
its blau he rips into chatters for the mildest things he must've
I mean I do agree a bit.  I'd assume any reasonable human has hope that he can learn from this and refrain from ever hurting someone again. If he suffers from this long enough to eventually turn his life around then good for him.  But as of right now, he does not deserve anyone's sympathy or thoughts. Really feel like people need to re-check their priorities if their first thought is "damn I hope he's good tho". At the very least people should keep those thoughts to themselves because I can guarantee it hurts the victims seeing that.  Personally I hope the victims are coping, and what Rated is feeling currently shouldn't matter imo.
I hope all the woman he interacts at that mcdonalds job are Karens
I got my 3 year old one for Christmas this year because I remember having so much fun with one as a kid. They’re still exactly the same 30 years later, he loves it.
ah fair play. wish her all the best.
Yeah like that POS Putin
>few other manipulative people who is still on the server right now in powerful positions  You dont need too but if u think people are being that way then speak ur mind  But you should just mention the people if its wrong. Im sure in this reddit thread and other threads, Ppl in the nopixel community could agree or disagree with you ... but again if u want to be silent then do it i guess.
[removed]
Hopefully this is a wakeup call for him then.  Protecting openly toxic players allows them a shield to do even worse shit **behind closed doors**.  All because he wanted to protect the "money makers" he created a situation where a truly garbage person could harass others and they were too afraid to report him.   These high view players wont be making him any money if NP gets banned from FiveM for being synonymous with enabling sexual harassment.
They got this one right. I guess that's the point in the end; it's a change that can encourage more decisions like it when appropriate, regardless of a player's standing on the server.   I do agree with you, mind. They're ultimately responsible for the culture of the server.
You know I always got the impression that DW was getting real real tired of CG getting kiddie gloves all the time. I remember the whole Ramee meta gaming the casino stuff and he never got banned for it... ever since then DW was always very stand offish with CG.
Yeah when you hate a character OOC and so does your crim and so does your cop. It starts to line up a little bit that you might just really be an asshole
I better have a higher rank then Lily pond,
Dont forget Dan faily and Lily pond that they have shit talked for 3-4 years now on both their characters
That's my sheriff
*You wish you were a cop like Baas*
When it starts at the top, will them leaving really matter?  It's not like it was some low level admin that swept minor toxicity under the rug.  It was blatant, continuous, and allowed by the owner.
> I think it'd probably better if those people were removed from those staff positions.  That would mean removing the owner.
What sucks is that this isn't the first one and most likely won't be the last. NP seems to have a problem with empowering sociopaths who feel that dejecting others is totally normal. Management needs to start looking deep on this one before the next one comes out and is even worse.
Crazy, been a member of Saabs community for 3+ years and I've been banned from his discord and twitch for my comments about Rated in these threads.   To the rest of this thread, when you try to play middle man to appease both sides you just enable the abuse, because it's a simple "call Baas" or talk to Saab Ooc.   If you're a man you shut down any abusive treatment of women no matter if it costs you everything. Have some principles or you're no better than Rated or Andrew Tate who you've said on stream you despise.
Saab is a major part of the problem. He's one of the biggest enablers on the server. He is way out of his depth as both an admin and his position within the PD.
Not only him but a lot of other guys on the server are the problem just by not defending girls that are harassed openly without any IC reason.  So many people on the server hide behind "Im not an admin it's not my place to say anything" or "Its just RP" clearly knowing it's not.  HC defending or doing nothing with people like this is just cherry on top.
Moose only has his whitelist because he plays WoW with the owner, CG hates his guts
You guys don’t get it Saabs just a nice guy who wants everyone to have fun. Huge /s.
Go do his job then if you are so high and mighty that you think you have a say in the situation. admins aren't just one person either you know.
but ramee has been on the vale hate train wagon for a bit, so who knows.
I don't think they mean Ramee is gonna get flak over protecting Rated. Just that he used to or still does act fairly similarly to Rated in-game.
You are awesome. That's all I got.
I want to profusely apologize for coming across as an asshole. I fucked up my message and feel really bad for posting something that seemed to support victim blaming. I hope my edit clears things up.
I'm saying it's easy to feel like people are accomplices for not standing up to the bullies, but that doesn't necessarily make them an accomplice. That the lines are grey and it can be hard to tell which people are just keeping their head down, and which people are enabling the bullying themselves.  Us viewers don't see everything and it's hard to know what people are going through. I'm just being honest here and admitting I have conflicted feelings about things because it's easy to be mad at people that enable bullying, and it is hard to know where the line is between enabler and bully itself.
Please see my reply to Cath, I am not trying to blame any victims for being bullied.
[removed]
As one NFL scout once said, "If Hannibal Lector can run a 4.3 40, they would diagnose it as an eating disorder."  Also, hope you're staying safe and kicking ass.  Glad to see you're still hanging around here occasionally.
"I know he committed sexual assaults but he's only 22!"  That type of shit is so wild to hear said
I wish this wasn't so accurate. Shit is infuriating.
I've stopped watching NP entirely but every so often check the reddit to see what the current shit storm is.   I am *living* for Cath's replies. This right here, Andrew Tater Tots; non stop bangers.  Fuck Rated. Not the first and certainly not the last shithead on NP.  There's something incredibly funny of her dunking on fools from an active warzone.
Reminding me of Mason greeenwood defenders
He's my favorite straight twink
Yeah. I didn't want to bring up how Blau responded to it. But it also kind of annoyed me. It felt like he was trying to give a 'both sides' view-point. Yes, no one should harass anyone. That's a given. But why the fuck are you trying to garner sympathy or even allow it to be garnered for someone who hasn't even acknowledged what he did wrong yet. In fact, Rated is still trying to gaslight people about it. Idc how he feels and Blau shouldn't be sitting on the fence about it either.
yeah, she's literally there now.  She's posted pics in her frontline gear.
There is no real proof. This comes from my experience over the years dealing with liars and manipulative people in my life. As a viewer we can watch multiple perspective and get a lot of information. You watch what happen in RP on multiple characters from the same person then you see what happened OOC. Some of these people is too smart to break the rules.  Nothing like what rated did to women. I only wish the admins tighten up and this in turn will improve everyone's experience on the server.
That group has spent the last 6 years protecting and enabling eachother. How on earth would they be ignorant of his hate when they spend at least 8 hours per day together?   - Hutch only dodged a twitch ban because someone he targeted refused to report him   - Jobless "If you're getting hate then you're probably doing something wrong" Garrett   - Ramee, the other half of R&R   - Vader who spends hours shittalking other streamers in twitch chats   - Judd who thinks hate brigades are OK as long as he profits of it
Wtf are you on about? That entire group is responsible for treating people like sub human trash when shit doesn’t go their way.
>this sub hates CG  MY GOD man, you're like a hair's breadth from making the connection.   Have you wondered *why* this sub hates CG as much as it does?
No actually fucking clueless fr
He will always be my Shriff.
Your only hope for the "top" seeing the light is the realization how quickly his money maker could be shut down if it became synonymous with sexual harrashmant and abuse of women.
The owner is motivated by money at the end of the day.     Hopefully he sees how enabling toxic players, like this case, can spiral into something much worse.  NP only exists because companies that help enable it's existence, Rockstar, fiveM, etc, allow it.  Becoming synonymous with enabling sexual harassment or even protecting the person doing it isn't something I'm sure any of those companies want associated with their products.
IT SIMPLE IF YOUR AN ADMIN THING YOU SEE IT YOU DONT PLAY FENCE SITTER YOU SHUT THAT DOWN BEFORE REAL LIFE SHIT HAPPEN YOU STEP UP BEFORE REAL HARMFUL SHIT HAPPENS.  like man we all know what would happen if the woman were mentally unstable and have to be thankful nothing physically harmful happend  cant say the same for mental scars

Saab got harassed into submission by the CG hate mob just like 99% of the server. You are blaming him for at least trying to play middle man to make interactions between people better and lessening the blow.   People on here always act like Saab somehow enables them when they would be here and doing the same shit with or without Baas in the middle. With Baas there he at least gets to talk them down sometimes. Without Baas they would just go straight to the top, there wouldn't be someone to say "I will talk to them, I'll get them to change", the people CG want gone just get banned/fired straight up.  Also you people just clearly don't watch any of the interactions from Saabs POV and just go off off meta chats and reddit comments. CG always clown on Baas for not fixing the PD, because he never actually does anything to the cops they complain about. He pushes back often and always praises the cops that get shit on by CG to his chat, he also shuts down CG hoppers that come to his chat to complain about cops. Pond is one of the cops he praises the most.  Maybe direct this energy at the people with 8k+ viewers that actually have the clout to pressure NP staff into changing things for the better or could endorse a different server to get people to move, who all just sit there and watch and do nothing, apart from throwing sarcastic jabs from time to time, instead of the 1k-2k viewer streamer that got harassed into alcoholism when he tried to stand up against CG.
Yeah, you are.
It was unintentional but you did it. You know the immense amount of power these people have over the owner. You also know that without NoPixel these people would have to get real jobs. Not everyone is willing to make that sacrifice, and I don’t blame them for it.
was a dono, not my take
It was a dono message not him, but idk what Blau had said personally about it, would be a disappointing take if so tho
If? Isn't that the entire story of Ben Roethlisberger?
Hutch already attacked Blau for his 'take' few days ago, when Blau literally just saw the post saying Rated was banned, made 'wtf' face and didn't say anything for 5 seconds. I don't think you know how much shit he gets from cg viewers - go and read comments under any Mickey/CG video. They're toxic, delusional and dedicated, I don't blame Blau for navigating this one carefully.  Edit: also op misquoted the donation. That person said 'I hope Rated doesn't do anything drastic, he's young and just lost everything'.
Hey the way u mentioned before was experiance about people in the server and heyy im so sorry for the situations you have dealt with ... all i want is people to speak up, as a older male viewer and seeing all the stuff thats being brought to light... everyone needs respect, woman on twitch 100% they have the worst encounters... All hearts at this moment <3 <3
A regular rash is bad enough, but a harrash? No sir!
If you think he actually gave a fuck the entire time, you must be living in lala land lol. As always, people only "NOW" care because they don't have a choice but to care since it's now in the public eye, otherwise no one on NP would've given 2 fucks and would've allowed the "joking around" to continue.
Thing is it doesnt help. Nothing changes, it just enables more toxicity instead of shutting it down. A group like CG just assumes Ssaab got shut down OOC by cop-loving admins, and thats why he cannot do anything, so they just keep complaining to their chats. They do not see it as Ssaab trying to talk them down or curb their behaviour.  >Maybe direct this energy at the people with 8k+ viewers that actually have the clout to pressure NP staff into changing things for the better  None of those people are in the position Ssaab has decided to take. The closest are Kyle & Penta. Look what happened to those two.
Saab absolutely enabled them. You can't be an enlightened centrist with abusive pricks. Saying "the alternative could have been worse" is not an excuse. He was put in a position of power and failed to stand up for his own. Nice guy, not the right guy for the job.
Yup hes absolutely gotten his good nature taken advantage of and bullied by all of CG
Saabs a nice guy who does his best to make sure everyone has fun and just giggles at everything. Don’t say anything remotely critical of him.
Your first reply to me almost echoed exactly what I wrote but in simpler terms and claimed that message was victim blaming. I am really sorry if the way I worded it made it seem like i was saying that, cause that wasn't my intent. I am honestly confused. I was just trying to bring up the fact that the horrible situations people are put in can cause conflicted feelings. I hate seeing people getting bullied on the server.
Yeah I see how what I wrote came across that way. In reality I was trying to say the exact thing that you have. That people aren't wrong for having kept their heads down. And that more specifically, a lot of the criticism people on this reddit, myself included, have had for some of the people in nominal positions of power who kept their head down is misplaced.
Deshaun Watson, Ben Roethlisberger, Brett Farve, Ray Lewis and Ray Rice....  The list is very long lol.
Yeah cg viewers somehow think Blau betrayed their streamers by having mickey leave CG, because many of them cannot understand what "roleplay" is. Several cg streamers have made it worse by basically implying Blau made a bad career move by not staying with the cg brand. (I disagree)  The decision made sense in character, but I do sometimes wonder if he made the choice ooc a bit too after seeing some of the toxicity within cg. But maybe wouldn't want to say so publicly to not get even more on their bad side, not to mention toxic fans.
Same problem I have with Nakkida. Great person, enables terrible people. That round of staff has only increased and enabled the worst behaviors of the server. Hell, Pezz literally got banned for less than what Rated’s been doing for years and he was a part of that admin class.
Yeah nice guy like the non jew, non nazi, germans that just sat back and watched
Then don't call them accomplices for choosing not to risk self sabotage. Speaking out at the wrong time allows people like rated to twist the narrative into purely "this person is toxic and hates me". DARVO.  I didnt have the gall to take that risk and neither did most other women. He's gone now, and in my lil bit of free time I figured I'd speak on my tiny, comparitively insignificant slice of the shit that he did, that everyone could see, but mostly ignored.
Dude, you are trying to gaslight her into being a victim, it's gross man, just stop.
Deshaun Watson had all the accusations came out and THEN THE BROWNS DECIDED TO TRADE FOR HIM AND OFFER HIM A LUCRATIVE AS FUCK CONTRACT.  He is the PRIME example.
The Ray Rice wife beating was what pushed me away from the NFL for good, I watched every Ravens game from about 2007 until 2014 when that happened.   The concussion stuff was bad, and the Ravens winning the Super Bowl but ESPN spending the whole offseason talking about Tom Brady and Mark Sanchez disillusioned me, but then it came out that the GM of the team had seen the elevator footage of the event before it got publicly released and wanted to only suspend him for 2 games, and I straight up dropped my fandom on the spot
CG viewers were blind to the fact that despite Blau small viewer count, he's heavily connected, he was CG ticket out of GTA Rp  Thats why CG have been so salty over it  As in game relationship breakups also would mean them not having access to variety streamers  Lucky for them Valk and Fuslie came along.  But having seen some of the variety streams, they still can't transition
I was unclear with my message and it obviously came across terribly, i am sorry to have caused any hurt. I never meant to imply any of the victims were accomplices for not having spoken out. In my mind at the time was the people who sat and watched the bullying take place, not the people who received it. My writing gets away from me at times and I see how i fucked up turning my ideas into words. Im a huge fan of you and your roleplay and the last thing I wanted to do was insult you or any other victim.
I'm sorry, I really am not trying to do that, and the fact that is how it is coming across makes me feel like shit.
Cleveland isnt a very classy city to begin with anyway
CG viewers right now are on the "Blau is a creep/sex perv" train and expect him to "be the next to go". Seems crazy to me. Blaustoise seems like a good guy.
Where the heck did they get that from? Is it because he drank milk in a cat girl maid outfit? I get the vibe that he's sex positive and kink positive but not a creep or anything.
Hoping Lyndi and other victims are able to come together and help admins work on giving support to any future victims from anyone on the server
Glad shes out of that relationship with rated and she should take all the time she needs away from streaming <3   Must be a cluster fuck for her and dealing with chatters non stop asking shit recently must be draining.
Wait a second. These two actually dated IRL ?   That makes it 10 times worse.
I hope Lyndi gets to move on from this without any issues, she deserves peace after all this bs shes been through.
So he was dating Megs and Lyndi at the same time and she found out through her Twitter reveal in January...  The signs were there but I am honestly sick that I supported this guy for so long man...
He would constantly tease Ramee for the RP he had with Carmella and even down talked Silents & Bananas RP saying it was cringe but this dude was literally doing it too! but to the extreme LOL in game & IRL, 😭😭 The audacity.. Sad situation all around hope every one involved has peace now with him gone
Who else remembers that long period a couple years ago when lyndi and rated completely avoided each other.
Damn, XQC was right. RP relationship do become real.
Rated has always seemed like a wild card. The way he would talk to alot of the girls on this server was not nice. He'd put them down and make them feel small.
So much love to Lyndi right now
and he was making fun of others being in e-relationships
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQHJZrECHV0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQHJZrECHV0)  This making sense now
I don't understand how he stood to the side and let her endure all of that harassment for years... people are so nasty to her on twitter over speculation about their relationship. I hope this puts the weirdos to rest.    I understand valuing privacy, but I don't think it was worth either of them having to put up with that. I feel terrible for her. Glad shes out of that relationship.
I remember back when Randy first start disliking Mary basically out of nowhere that Violet started having alot of issues with her too. I wonder how many relationships got soured for Lyndi because of the stuff he would spew about people.  Wishing her well and hope she doesn't have to deal with too many obsessive defenders.
Love to Lyndii. I found her when she used to play with Brett she is one of the funniest people in Angels
Lyndi deserves better, glad she's free of that relationship.
Jesus christ, I wonder how many victims there are?  I hope it ends at just those two women but, I don't think it will.  That's scary shit.
[removed]
Sucks they were repressed for so long but super glad all these people are coming out now and letting others know it’s okay to come forward.. really hope people can see how trash he was to all of them and not attack the victims especially Lyndi because she’ll probably get the brunt of all it, glad she can finally move on from it all
Glad she’s out that toxic mess, IMO hardly surprising people end up ‘dating’ from no pixel when they spending 6 to 12 hours on the server,   hopefully we don’t ever hear from the lowlife again,
Lmao and he was making fun of relationship rpers like neutren n kitty
Lyndi seems like a pretty good person and deals with a LOT of hate and shit that's completely unjustified. hopefully she gets to clear her mind and comes back in a good place
Yeah I doubt we see rated again. I guarantee lawyers are telling him to stfu and keep to himself. Hope Lyndi is okay
 Memory is fading but... Mid 2020?...Violet and Claire @ the golf course? , after getting some item to help cg/randy on a bank truck job? , when randy shoots violet in the head for not  'respecting' him or talking too much, or some other nonsense...   That event 'could' have been rp... but... the irl reaction was shock, not funny...   That's when I got 'bad feelings'.. And noticed more and more certain 'undesirable' traits from said streamer to others..   'my friend, my friend, wo wo wo, chill chill'    I wondered why I didn't see as many interactions between once friendly gangs... (From just before 3.0)  Remember 2.0  angels and cg waking up at the apartments and friendly fucking with each other?..   That seemed to disappear entirely almost overnight.. I thought it was facebook/twitch issues re interacting together but...
The biggest F YOU she could do to this guy would be to post a picture of him. I would be that petty.
From outside perspectives no pixel seems like such a shit show place. So many allegations and drama from the server.
💖💖
[removed]
Jesus thats rough I hope she gets better
Man i could never have a online relationship, my hair would turn gray in the first month.
I cancelled my sub to Rated and reported his page for harassment on Facebook. I recommend you all do the same. It's the least we can do to support the disaffected from this scumbag.
I was watching lyndi the other day and she was hanging out with rated
Wait they were dating?
Did they ever met? No way they dated for three years through skype :DD
Werent they just rp’n the other day on 2.0
Ngl I myself thought it was all In game,
This dude gets more vile by the minute jfc.  But hey "i'm not an evil person" lmao
Yea , when the second set of ss came out , that’s when she tweeted getting cheated on
She also tweeted something about cheating a few weeks ago, thats so disgusting.
But they still spent a lot of time on server together after that, no? Even in the new 2.0 server  I think this is some new stuff
The more stuff is coming out, rated’s stocks in the piece of shit charts are rising tremendously
Who is megs?
Who is megs? Sorry to ask
What is wrong with dating 2 people?
I remember there being some weird situations between them and people around them, like some of the CG guys or the angels. Would all kinda just get quiet and get them away from each other.  Best example would be like the black card for the money truck situation. That got really weird really fast. If you know. You know.
Ricky getting Ellie addicted to crack and crime? Yep, Penta and Soda are together. Al Saab and Brenda together when Brenda was working at Pillbox? Yep Saab and Ashlynn together for ages. And that's just 2 examples
best part is xqc was talking about them when he mentioned that
It has been a known fact forever, way before XQC said it. The % chance of an RP relationship becoming real is through the roof.
This is why I can't watch relationship rp. It's so clear it's ooc eventually which gets uncomfortable. Like way too voyeuristic. I don't want to watch something that private/intimate play out
Another example is Lunaoni and Kari.
kyle and meka
Ive seen this happen through DnD too tbh. Its not just a online RP thing
Well they hid it well tbh
Not super surprising because if they see each other everyday on the server, spend time together, and since np is their job, there's bound to be some real feelings involved. They live in the city, so most of their social interactions come from who they interact with in rp.
I mean i post that clip few month ago, its would predict that relationship rp is became way cringe bit.
people have no lives and make RP their life
the only 'famous' or well known "relationship" rp that are not real is when fuslie-ramee and even valkyrae-rated doing a bit of their relationship arc..like those two were having pretty good chemistry but they acted the same even outside of rp so you know they were really just friends. I start to watch gta through fuslie and rae so going through the arc, i thought everybody else was just as good as them doing the relationship rp..turns out valkyrae and fuslie was more pro then the veteran rp-ers 😂😂
Here is the clip https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO2SRTxX8wQ
Yeah it was always something off about him. Like at first I thought it was a joke because he’ll just laugh it off but it got more and more repetitive and aggressive.
Pretty brave to address it publicly given who it is. Massive respect and I hope she stays safe and mentally healthy through this.
The first couple chat messages genuinely made my spine tingle KEKW, such odd behaviour but I guess it makes sense now.
They both have been fighting these stalkers for years and enduring the harrassment and abuse from these deranged individuals. No matter what either of them said, they were never stopping. I do agree revaling their relationship probably would've made things better, but with these stalkers who tried to dig up any info and doxx them, rated tried to play it safe to keep his identity hidden. They already exposed rated's first name, so yeah..
He made lyndi stop interacting with kyle and penta. I remember that one time lyndi had drinking night and played games with penta and other nopixel people. After that she stopped drinking alcohol in general. And megskii pointed out how rated shit on her for drinking, so probably did the same with lyndi
[removed]
naah not necessarily..like fuslie has spend a looot of time with ramee and valkyrae literally spends 80% of her playing gta with rated..both of the girls even went as far as doing somewhat a relationship/flirting rp with them, but they still able to separate their rp and real life. Even though they acted basically the same and still have same interaction outside of gta. And then sadly they got a lot of people from the nopixel community giving them flaks for being "cringe" doing relationship rp when these girls are more proffesional lol.
Wasn’t he gonna stream today ?
That was the first thing that came to my mind when all of this got released. The vibe was so different after that happened.
Not wrong. Its basically just like EVERY other community in the online content and streaming spaces.
She only stopped talking to him for abit, but at the end of the day he was still going to be in her daily life as they are both full time gta rp streamers. She didn't wanna make it weird or awkward and wanted to move on.  Whoever spoke up did alot of good tbh.
cmon now, her expression through all that was so blank.
Context https://youtu.be/XlSa8KY56DE
They met , she’s said she flew to Europe and they have taken week breaks at the same time. I mean they made it so obvious
Yeah any long time fan of them basically knew for awhile they were together
That was exactly my thought with the Khaosadam stuff, is it how people "date" nowadays ? No wonders why these people get upset over what happens to their fictional characters, internet is actually their life.
Unless I missed it the only time they spent together on 2.0 was when she was at the bench and he found her, as well as Trill, Alex, and Xav during that he just kinda yelled at them for a bit. Idk about 3.0 though
First person to come out about Rated in January.  She was a mod in his community that he dated.
Individually is fine. Two at the same time without every party involved knowing and consenting is not (which is the case here).
Yes
The Big Man and his woman met on ARMA RP
since we're on the topic, does anyone know if meka and kyle still dating?
Gable and Penny are another couple to add to the list
I never knew Penta and Soda are together. lol
I miss Braab
To be fair to Penta and Soda, they never had any relationship RP. Also they fit together so well it's just too damn cute. Happy for them!
[removed]
I don't know why people always act so surprised lmao, hey 2 nerds who have things in common like: liking videogames, roleplaying and share similar sense of humor end up together after meeting in a videogame.  This isn't even exclusive to roleplay, how many people have gotten together after meeting in mmos dating from all the way back when they were first launched.  Also how many actors have ended up dating their co-stars in movies/tv shows/theater, etc.
I mean the vast majority of RP relationships don't become real. It's just that 5% that do are very visible.
I mean, it can be good. Like Pred and Angel. I doubt Kylie and Kyle will ever date irl or make it weird. I guess the less serious the players treat the relationship, the better. Angel and Pred's relationship was just lewd jokes and funny drama.
I agree to a certain extent, is fun to watch when it looks only like good chemistry between friends playing it up, but then you notice it kinda got a bit too real and it stops being fun and diverts into uncomfortable lol.
Same. Hit the nail with the voyeur description. It's even worse than watching actual couples on screen in a way.  Relationship RP only works if it is cartoonishly out there for me.  Edit: Also sometimes people become weirdly clingy and possesive about eachother when they're doing it. It is just not my cup of tea.
Isn't DnD roleplay?
[removed]
"Passive aggressive" was the perfect descriptor for that behavior.   And that + the accent seems to have been enough to throw most people off for years.
[removed]
Fuslie and Valky were in irl relationships back then with Edison and Sonii
Yea i would definetly call that "hanging out".../s  If thats the actual "context" of them hanging out... then idk man... its looks very much like he heard Lyndis voice, and forced that whole interaction by holding them up with a knife... but hey that might just be me seeing that.
It’s makes so much more sense why they were so toxic to Rae. It’s because Rated and Lyndi were together irl. I just always thought viewers were just being weird.
Y’all never heard of long distance relationships obviously people will move once they get closer but I ain’t moving country for some just because I started seeing them
TBH I don't really watch rated or lyndi, so I don't know everything, but I've seen recent clips of them spending time together on server and being friendly, so I assume the recent stuff is new findings.
So did buddha and abby
She inspected his infected asshole. Now they have 2 kids Classic
Yup
wouldnt count on it tbh.
They kept it private for a while, Meka called him drunk one stream and he had her on speakerphone and she leaked.  If I remember correctly, in retaliation, Penta later leaked that she was dating Kyle who were also private about it for a pretty decent amount of time.
It's why Penta calls Sodapoppin Daddy instead of Chance
Same with Ziggy and Curyllama.
Yeah that's true. No romantic relationship there w the characters
Bruh hobbit been in a relationship for awhile, even engaged I think
I mean, for the majority of them it is technically just "we met at work", but with extra steps.
Met my wife in Guild Wars 2. For the exact reasons you stated. We had a shared hobby that we could hang out in.
Yeah I think people seem to forget that this happens with actors/actresses ALL THE TIME. Especially when they have to create a “bond” for a movie. Some literally go on “dates” to build the chemistry and obviously it can carry on after the movie is done filming.
The total cartoonish disfontonal nature of the Pred and Angel relationship is what makes it watchable, like a sitcom.  Pretty sure Kylie has said she'll wont do more serious style relationship rp and I'm sure Kyle feels the same.   It can get a tad weird.
Kyle was talking about exact same thing 4 or 5 days ago that both of them can say whatever without it becoming weird and they have same wavelength of cringe making a toxic relation the most stable one
Ramee and Carmella's is good too.  I think they both know they can trust each other in RP because they'd never end up together ooc.
>I guess the less serious the players treat the relationship, the better.  Harry and Penny in early 3.0 were the perfect example of this imo
Yeah but Xs arguement was about GTA RP relationships becoming real. I was expanding it
So glad Rae is done with RP
this is just not true
noo they were both singles when they active playing in gta
Nah Violet called Randy up a few times during 2.0, he gave her lockpicks to sell and they had other interactions too.
Personally dont understand online dating in general but people can do what they want
I was just saying for the 2.0 server, they had one interaction, IDK when anything came to light for Lyndi, and it could also be Lyndi just trying to not cause strife when they "work together" and the awkwardness it would cause if Randy has to come around Violet for whatever reason. I get along with my ex who was abusive due to the fact I have to, same idea kinda thing.
I mean they broke up but does Tony + Brit count for a while?  Hell they got engaged at one point so it was definitely pretty serious until it fell apart.
I thought they met in Runescape
Never would have imagined that prostate exam would lead to a relationship. That is going to make for such a funny "how I met your mother" story some day, though.
how come?
Damn I had no idea, good for them!
Yup, they're two peas in a pod too!
I thought Llama was with the old Minecraft YouTuber
After Ryan and Reed broke up, I think they now have the longest running relationship on the server and it works because it’s never serious.
Thats not what happened in the slightest. Kyle's one of the oldest NoPixel mainstays as he didn't like any of the other big servers and Kylie is from TFRP before NP.
lol no, only Luna part is correct Kyle was slim, Wyatt and Rory main before playing cop pred
Whoa what, when did that happen?
Ziggy and Ramee met in RuneScape I think
Nah, that's just an old meme. They met on Arma back in the day.
My bad, I must have heard wrong then.  I thought Kylie found Kyle and that's why they were playing cop together early on.  I know the Luna part though which was pretty cool for Kylie.  Luna was like one of my favorite new RPer in 3.0 and all of her characters are funny AF.
Quite a while ago, tony is in another relationship now
he isnt in another relationship, he mentioned on his podcast with lysium yesterday that he had been talking to someone but that it didnt work out  edit: typo
dang i didn’t know he was in another relationship, do you know who or is it private?
Private i think

Tiny Peets is a small fuzzy conduit for chaos
what a clusterfuck LMAO
honestly just a normal day in the billabong
Lol, Julio had me dying. "I got one. THATS RIGHT...AHHHHH!"  Second funniest part was Flippy screaming laughing as Alan got popped in the head right in front of him.
Hydra battled the idea that this was very stupid to do, but they could not get past the idea of how much fun it would be.   So happy they decided to do it, this shit was hilarious.
Wtf I wanna push de_LL with smokes. This looks fun as hell.
ngl this looks super fun.
They also sent in Oscar a bit before to pretend to 1v1 as Flippy, but Julio didn't take the bait.
Incredible B site execute from Hydra
watching both sides of this was amazing. finally some all around good vibes
The use of smoke was cinematic as fuuuck
They tried to go for sprays first then Julio invited them to de\_LL. Was really funny and enjoyable to watch, like how HoA is still trying to make some fun in all this mess.
Finally some rp clips
I feel like pure rp driven wars like are 10x better than warring for shit sprays
Map is ct sided not looking good for hoa esports
The definition of starting to celebrate half a second too early
The HOA would be getting beat regardless but god damn is heroin so OP.
wtf how many Hydra members were there xD
Hydra are insanely good. This is the second time they pushed into the turf and wiped them out
Ever since the HoA vs BBMC war, Silent has mentioned how fun it'd be to have HoA style war fights. This was his first chance to finally get to do so. Next up, de_powerplant???
Well... 1 person was very much against it but whatever, it was suuper from the rest of the Hydra. Finally shootouts with less tryhard attitude and more fun.
The Invite was first, the try for the spray was an attempt to force them out of the Library, But the HOA didnt have 6 app Members around so HYDRA decided to accept the invite and push the Library.
6 pushed in from front door, Alan got shot by Julio rest made it
It was a 6v6 I think.
They are definitely the better shooters. Though I think they also have the heroin advantage, which helps.
Well flippy was right, migL was acting like a child
I think it's okay for someone to be taking the RP more seriously than others and not wanting to kinda throw. The same way that it's okay for the rest of them to take the RP less seriously and kinda throw to make it more entertaining. It's just that classic "SBS vs serious RP" line that is defined differently for every player/character once again.
Can't really blame miguel for not going along with it. HOA has been mainly after him and lilith specifically so probably not wise to just barge in, go down and hand urself to them
The 1 person absolutely against it was the one who instantly started malding and had to stop himself from going on an ooc rant when HoA found them up in Paleto. I'm shocked.
>HOA didn’t have 6 app Members around  Lmao once again HOA being the usual HOA somehow saves them during a gang conflict
Yeah, yesterday Flippy said they've used over 40 heroin already across the various fights.
Oh yea. Without H they weren’t making it very far in there and they knew it.   I didn’t watch the actual fight but did they use more than one syringe?  When they were planning it was use one to get in to the left area and whatever happens from there happens.
Silent wanted to keep the rp light and fun while swizz was getting tilted, so he decided to take himself out of the situation
Well there is serious rp and there is bm you definitly can just stand outside and wait for 3 hours with your 30 heroins 10 granades and ooc superior shooting skills, but it isn't really matching the energy and that's what RP is all about and not about winning...
Deservedly so?
He stopped himself from ranting about Dan faily not the HOA
yeah flippy said hydra basically used the entire heroin stockpile in the first 2 days to do maximum damage to the coalition(risky move but paid off). knocking out gangs and in some case turning them to their side.
No, they went barebones into LL. 1 syringe each that they popped for the initial push, 4 smokes, and basic essentials. They dropped off their big $ items because they knew that it could go very bad if HOA had shotguns.
when did i say it wasn't deserved? pipe down lil bro
Cg/hyrda viewers making themselves to easy to spot .
answer the question tho. when did i say it wasn't deserved?
Rated probably going apeshit watching this.  Lol
The anti-Penta youtube comments are lol.
The Rated experience:  > Says or does something fucked up and inappropriate.         And then...  > People react about how what he did was fucked up and inappropriate.          And then...  > Rated on stream, "Brother, I was just kidding. Why are people so weird. You can't joke anymore. Idk man. It's just weird. It's weird. It was just a joke. I mean come on. It's weird.
"I'm not an evil person" is going to carry on in the server for a long time and I laugh thinking about it.
"Turns out Rated was the real Jordan the whole time" HAHAHA
When Randy got shot down by a female cop like Lily Pond, it was always uncomfortable to watch him mald. I always was like "dude chill out it's just a game."
Taking out the trash is nice and all but it is sorta sad NP just waits till some abuse or explicit transphobe/sexist/homophobe/racist etc shit comes out to ban people when they act like garbage people ooc consistently on stream to the point many roleplayers avoid them or the server. If they are being garbage people on stream... maybe they are just garbage... there is no reason to give passes on "they are just heated" "that is just how they are" etc. Basically ooc shit should be taken more seriously with fat bans into perma bans if it is consistent (they create an unfriendly and negative environment for everyone else regardless if they are sexist pieces of shit etc)
i also thought it was funny that everyone was surprised he got banned. he was very toxic for years (towards roleplayers ON STREAM : pond, kylie, penta and others..). i didn't have a doubt on my mind that he did all those tribble shit he was accused of on twitter, yet people brushed it under the rug like it was nothing but i guess now more women came forward and it became too much for people to brush.
hold your horses   Ur telling me the guy that gets OOC toxic for no reason does to same irl 😧🤯
Penta not holding back. Jeeez
The glorious Chase stream we could've had doing awful things and saying "I'm not an evil person" that we've been denied kills me.
I want that shocked face as an emote
Lily Pond eating good tonight. One less abuser who keeps OOC attacking her for no reason
Ratedepicz really isn't a name that rolls off the tounge
Gotta admit that one single Ball is pretty damn big
PENTA saying what everyone’s thinking 😂
Damn, Penta looking slim compared to what I remember. Good for him!
Can't go OOC on someone that's not in the server anymore PEPW
Im sure this was the first time this was reported to the NP staff team, and they would never overlook a claim like this because the offender was a large content creator on their platform..................... /s
As someone who watched a lot of Rated, He's not wrong! The warning signs were pretty obvious and I like a lot of people kind of ignored them.
Que the mighty Metallica - Am I Evil?
Pretty much. Someone keeps showing you that they are a piece of work you better believe them.   Just because you or your friends aren't the target doesn't mean shit. He used to be my fav when I started watching, oof!  Until I saw the way he spoke about and to other people in the  server.   There was no justification to keep watching such a person. For those of us that weren't in denial, that is.
You know, it was a full moon last night/this morning. Somewhere, chase is running free.
I hope that after all this they'll stop tolerating people that treat everyone else like shit in the same way Rated did. But I don't expect anything to change and I'm running out of copium.
How could reddit do this?!
You can always count on PENTA to call it how it is.
That's pretty much the only take to have in this lol. It's not at all surprising that he does that shit.
anyone whos ever watched a cop stream and seen them interact with certain gang isnt even remotely surprised. next up the other half of the R duo and the rest of certain gang
It’s just my character. And my other character. Oh and that one too.
Rated hated Jordan Steel because it was like looking in a mirror
I'm shocked. SHOCKED. Well, not that shocked.
rated may be a bad guy, but penta will always be a fucker KEKW
ShockedPentaFace
What a FUCKER.
This man has an incredible beard
PEPW
The thumbnail for the clip really sells it lmao
Penta Ulted, I like that fuck Ratedepicz and trying to downplay the situation.
its actually insane how rated could have EASILY hid all this if he didnt play the "i dont know what i did" card. Although debatable, NP was trying to in a way help rated by not fully exposing him. Now cuz of rated's ego he is 100% going to lose his FB contract and prolly wont be allowed on twitch either. Not only did he lose his job, but most likely gonna fight these charges in court and possibly go to federal prison if found guilty.  ALL BECAUSE OF HIS EGO. RIPBOZO U WILL NOT BE MISSED AT ALL.
This is so good lol
Gosh, I do love Penta
PEPW i knew this was coming.
Solid take, I just worry about repercussions when the big man sees this.
Yeah in hindsight its also obvious why both Rated and Khaosadam never showed their faces and skipped their groups IRL meetups. Well we should be more careful with streamers who don’t show their faces and play “aggressive“ characters.
Ngl the emoting got me good this time
I’m confused and disappointed. I used to watch Rated quite a while ago, like in 2021. But I stopped because I just got busy with life. He seemed nice mostly. Now I’m seeing all this?? I saw Chang gang post on Twitter and came to investigate and wow. I haven’t watched him enough or kept up enough to have seen this coming but somehow I’m not fully surprised/shocked.
Oh god the You joke put it into the perspective exactly how deluded and fucked up the Im not evil thing was
"Turns out Rated was the real Jordan the whole time" has to be the funniest shit that could come from this situation.
Anyone have the link to the video espn made about cg from like 3 years ago?
Why is penta drinking vodka from a straw and has his chaser in an opened topped cup like that. So weird.
i knew that something was wrong with him, but the day where he on the server started to abuse the pet dog of another player, shoot it multiple times, laughing his ass off then went and rp'd to try and skin it while he thought it was hilarious then wanted to go even further and burn it, all that in front of multiple people send me over the edge. his was laughing his ass off and the people in chat did too. everyone calling him out got banned and barraged by him and his chat.  &#x200B;  literally f this guy

Comparing toxicity in a video game to real abuse is so weird. Epic dunk I guess? but come on. Are we really saying everyone who gets toxic over rp is abusive now?  And no, I don't give a fuck about Rated. Using this as an opportunity to farm your chat is fucked.
I can think of countless times people defended Rated for some RP moment that has happen on this subreddit but now the majority suddenly think he is a POS.  He has always been this way and I'm just laughing at how long it took everyone to finally realize it.
That man was probably so positive Penta would be banned before he ever would get banned for anything
And the poor little guy doesn't have a platform to rant about it now RIPBOZO
Are you even a penta fan if you don't type comments against him?
and his fans come in saying "but he was laughing/giggling, he obviously wasn't being serious" like okkkk
Rated used "PUH PUH PUH", it was NOT effective
"It's all love"
It finally caught up to him. No getting away from it this time.
as a CG viewer I always knew he was fake,  the way he would say toxic shit while acting like he wasn't bothered always rubbed me as gaslighty and manipulative as shit.
guarantee you mike or jordan drop it ingame within the next week
Too bad Chase is a banned character or we'd be having a real good stream tonight.
I need the next serial killer that gets arrested to use that line at some point. Preferably in court after they're convicted of murdering and dismembering 10+ people.
Waiting for the moment someone with a small following says it and gets 3 day'd for "ooc memes ic"
I have a feeling people would get banned for this since nopixel prob wants to distance themselves from this whole situation
But Mom I want Jordan Steele!  We have Jordan Steele at home! *points to rated*
Well Jordans Steele's name isn't even his real name. Coincidence? I don't think so
Need a new PENTA character called Mr. Projecto or something.
It's probably why he rated hated Jordan so much, is cause it was a projection of him.
Honestly yeah, he would always become extremely hostile towards women who gave him the slightest bit of pushback. Whether they were a cop or in a gang, any woman that talked back would make him rage. It was not great to watch.
Imagine being the recipient of it and being blasted by little Andrew tate stan-esque hoppers for days afterwards  And having them go around the whole community saying how terrible you are and how much you ruin roleplay  Yeah that never had an adverse effect on anyone, no boy howdy  We deal with it a lot from particular people every single time we interact with them on our cops.
Lots of people are like that sadly. The server needs to do better in every way
I’m absolutely not giving NoPixel a pass on this despite the discord post, AJ was hired as a trooper barely a week ago and looked set to get at least one department lead back. This stuff doesn’t just come out of the blue and key staff were just rolling with business as usual despite the PD reset, despite Rated still continuing to be toxic and antagonistic towards multiple cops OOC.
He would go on Tirades against copRPers in the Cells and it was just brushed off as In Character.
How strange that many people he had problems with are women Kappa
Of course people were surprised you know those toxic tirades have gone on for years. Guess what they still go on by certain people.
People are surprised because he had gotten away with it all so far.
brooo Pond can be any rank now and won't have a fucking asshole malding about her being higher rank than him.  She is fucking free of that at least!!
Ughh imagine her having to deal with all that shit and hoppers and he always got away with it. Feel for any cop RPers and especially the women that had to deal with him.
The fact you have to say "One less abuser" is just so sad. All of them should be dealt with.
Rate D pics?
I hope not, thats what got him in this situation the first place
You think Penta was going at it you shoulda seen Hobbits stream lol
He hasn’t been eating as many bans recently.
They discontinued the quesarrito (to be eaten over the sink).
He is still fat in my heart :(
Legit, man turned his diet around and started working out. It's a nice transformation from when I first started watching him during the SOE days. No more ordering Jimmy Johns every stream.
Yeah I know he rolls with the "fat" jokes, but sometimes I wouldn't mind seeing that joke die. Dude is in visibly better shape and has been working hard at it. Love seeing him doing well, especially with all the health issues he's had in the past.
He only gets more handsome with age. It's fucked up
He's still the fat fucker in my heart dammit
ya wtf, he used to look like 35 now hes looking like 27 or something, delighted for him
the warning signs were glaring. It was so awkward for him to fake like sykkuno/yuno when they interacted, he def didn't respect sykkuno but didn't want to step on his toes like he could others, but his acting was p-rn level bad.
The company you keep. His whole crew is suspect, imo.
Imagine watching CG LMAO. What are you, 12?
I've learned that no matter how bad people act in public, they're even worse behind "closed doors".  It's always right.  If you're willing to be a terrible person for all to see, you're doing worse when they can't.
Swimming free.  AWOOOOO
Wait, other characters?  They have CG and CG Cop. Do any of them have more than 2 "characters?"
It is called narcissism.
It's honestly one of the dangers of playing RP and the type of character he did and being untouchable on the server no matter what you did.  Gives them a sense of invincibility that trickles into RL.  Crazy to think that if NP had followed their own rules, he would have been gone a long time ago and maybe some of these people he constantly harassed, never had to go through it in the first place.  It's great they're doing the right thing now, but would have been so much better for everybody if they'd done so before.
Out of your damn mind if you think he actually has a feasible chance of going to prison
Abusers are manipulators and have massive egos, he probably thought he could play the victim since there would be legitimate reasons for victims to fear speaking publicly
Big Man aint gonna do anything for a man he unfollowed on twitter lmao
Well if the big guy starts defending the person who just got perma banned and kicked out of his gaming team gang, it would be even a worse look at this point.
I wouldn't make that blanket statement. Some people just value their privacy. It's less about them not showing their faces and more about their blatant disregard for others.
I disagree with the first 2 things, tons of people don't show their faces (for very obvious meetings) and also don't show up to IRL meetups (for also very obvious reasons) - and the most obvious reasons aren't even bad or evil, they're mostly just privacy or shyness reasons.  &#x200B;  >play “aggressive“ characters.  This though? I kind of agree with this - people should watch out for people who play very aggressive characters, obviously it's not all but it is a possible indication if you can't play a character who isn't a terrible person...  *I mean Kyle plays like the most aggressive character on the server (Pred) but seems to be a real nice guy IRL - so it's certainly not all aggressive characters who are played by wacky people.*
It's not so much the anonymity in itself that was odd, it was how aggressive he was about it.
I just liked to assume based off a few people I know that he just had warrants.

Penta can seperate RP and RL.  That is the difference.
Why?
[removed]
[removed]
I mean you could say him being ooc toxic really showed how he actually treated people. i dont see why you're mad about this.
It's funny his haters think that cause in reality Penta is actually a very liberal person
I mean he is a fucker.
FAT
"Can't even argue with a cop anymore"
he does the same awkward giggle that Vader used to do after saying something dumb.
I don't believe you and I probably never will. This has been going on for years and suddenly CG watchers knew all along? He has been defended hard every moment there was some drama especially in this subreddit. I can not believe you guys were just biding your time to collectively hate the guy.
My bet is on Peter Parker. We won't see Jordan for a long time if ever now that he is dead on 2.0
Update: It was Wrangler, tonight.  https://www.twitch.tv/penta/clip/SpookyDeliciousYamPeteZarollTie-pImgHNDkCWtAIZyY
Wrangler dropped it last night PEPW
IM NAAAAHHHHT AN EVIL PERSOOOOONNNNN, ON MY DAHTAAAAA
if you remember the final chase stream he was making fun of the powergaming/ooc bullshit rated had been doing at that time too o7 chase
I'm thinking someone will be arguing charges in a cell and the cop will be like "You shot cops, what do you expect?" and the crim with a 5 second pause ... and then "I am not an evil person" haha
He's not the only one who's terrified and resentful of women on the server. There's a few of them.
💙 I'm sorry y'all have to deal with this shit
It's still a fucking travesty how you were treated. And yet you're still here standing up against abusers while also standing up for Ukraine. I respect you so much for that.  The server really isn't the same without you.
Hey Cath! Hope you're doing well. :3
Hi Cath, off subject but hope you're doing well!
Shit I see you're still getting it from them on Twitter.
Cath, good to see you!
<3
Fighting a battle on two fronts. What a legend you are. Stay safe out there.
[removed]
Everyone he was associated with has enabled this shit for years, but now they want to be offended..
The moral of the story is nopixel basically got caught with their pants down. They probably wouldn't have done fuck all to this guy but the allegations became strong enough to potentially threatened the NP brand / business so they begrudgingly took action.  We don't even have to get into all the weird sexual harassment shit he did. Just look at the openly toxic situation he's created over the past four years. Any regular player would have been perma banned long ago.
Yeah I love Pentas huge badonka donkas
I hope they can come up with ways to avoid this type of behavior to play out on the server more in the future.  Sad thing is... people knew about this stuff for at least 2 years, so idk what the NP admins and management were doing to combat it.  Right now it seems they just let it build up until there were multiple victims.
Or her twitter the last couple years
Any timestamps to start looking for in her VOD? Because goddamn.
You can't say that and not provide, friend.
I need a timestamp too because that sounds like a good night with a couple glasses.
4/19/23 all of chat is getting them in remembrance. It's the final day
you're not a real penta viewer until you eat a rotisserre over the sink with him
quesaritos are fucking amazing.  I don't know why they got rid of it.
The joke dies when he stops telling us that he eats rotisserie chickens over the sink
I mean, fat jokes were never funny in any sense, regardless if someone is slim or fat. It's just low grade edgy humour that somehow is still acceptable to do.
He’s aging like fine wine, I swear
The beard is doing tricks on you lmao… jk
Yeah losing weight tends to have that effect.
Why did rated dislike sykkuno? I never notice that
like what would he do that was weird with yuno? i usually watched random povs so i couldnt really tell shit was weird with him
I'm not 12 no, I'm 8.... 8 inches inside your mother.
You have intimate details of what’s being accused and what evidence there may or may not be? Or are you just going with your gut and telling people they’re out of their minds on a whim?
Not doing it for rated. But it's an easy excuse to ban Penta by saying he shouldn't comment on bans. I don't think it will happen but it's a possibility.
This. There’s sometimes a need or requirement on privacy but the constant disregard for others should be a quick red flag.
Nah, Kiwo has *got* to go. She is obviously just hiding it better than others I just know it!  /s
Bench guy monkaGIGA
I only said we should be careful. Especially with the combination of not showing yourself and being aggressive. Not saying everyone without facecam must be a bad person.
100% agree with you.
Yeah i agree 100%, with kyle you could tell that hes playing pred as a character, and if you watch his streams you could see a change when he's talking / playing pred, and interacting with chat/ ooc.

Raging and crying over rp being compared to abuse and sexual harassment is insane and it's literally all over these threads now. That's why.
Truly. Honestly the way you know that this shit doesn't happen with Penta is just because Hobbit is friends with him. Likely wouldn't give him the time of day if he was a shithead
You do know PENTA is extremely right-winged right? He's also a avid Trump Supporter, he is not liberal what so ever   We need more right-wingers on NoPixel like Kyle and PENTA      To much fucking snowflake, liberal stuff on NoPixel
the fuckiest fucker
It's all love
That dude is always in PENTA's chat unless he's streaming.
Ah, I haven't watched penta (or any streams outside moon on occasion tbh) in months so I wasn't aware 2.0 jordan was even dead.
You can tell hes been waiting for the opportunity to do it lmao. The way he snaps to attention with the camera spin and then walks into shot a little.
Really, really?  I'm an evil person for this?
trying to dictate how and when a victim opens up about the abuse they have experienced is some ignorant shit. lucky you to be so privileged that you can be this nonchalant about criticizing her actions.
Whataboutism is dumb
Every member of that group along with administrators on NoPixel have enabled this behaviour for years *and literally* endangered women in the process, never mind the hundreds of examples of OOC toxicity towards both male and female users. Buck has to stop somewhere and as Hobbit said, it shouldn't get to this point for it to be acknowledged or actioned by NoPixel.
[removed]
>Sad thing is... people knew about this stuff for at least 2 years  This is why I have a hard time feeling sorry for other cg members who are shocked that this was a close friend of theirs. Not that anybody could have predicted anything specific but surely at least the idea that something like this might be a possibility must have crossed their minds.
They weren't doing anything.   Had this information not come up, or multiple women reported him he'd still be on the server having a decent amount of influence with management.   The rest of his "Gang" might not have known about any DM's or IRL relationships he has but were right a long side him for many of the more public toxic outbursts on the server.  They never did anything to help him correct his bad attitude, many of them can also be toxic at times.  It's good that he's gone but lets be real, this doesn't magically absolve everyone for enabling it for 4+ years or staff helping him evade punishments for things that any other sub 1k streamer would have been perma banned for years ago.
Yeah sadly I think in these situations the worst things don’t happen on the server. I just saw that video where he was spamming in Lyndis chat just now. Imagine if he was that comfortable in front of people what the DMs would have looked like..
It's great, during the stream, [she tweeted out](https://twitter.com/hobbittrash/status/1644074012241436674) that she would often get random guys DMing her asking if she's trans on twitter. Whenever she checked who they are following, she would always see Rated was on top of the list.  Even better, there was someone who immediately responded back saying "this means nothing". Hobbit checked his profile and found Rated on his following list lol.   Literally can't make this shit up.
She keeps starting and stopping but most of it starts here:[https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1786353289?t=03h41m57s](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1786353289?t=03h41m57s)  Sparse Takeaways:  \-No ones willing to confront anything: "We don't have to get to this point we allow it to get to this point by perpetuating it, and allowing it, and saying it's okay, that's how we get here, by laughing..."  \-People noticing/around them know but not saying shit. "...Sick and tired of everybody acting like they're blind as shit. You're not blind you can see it"  \-Everyone waiting to say something till it affects them  Bad transcription watch for full quotes lol. Might be worth it's own post.
And that joke will never die because he can't stop eating rotisserie chicken over the god damn sink
He needs to steer into the curve and eat a whole turkey over the sink. Then stop completely. I call it quitting Hot-Turkey.
I never really took that a fat joke. I always took that as making fun of that absurd Tyler1 article where he talked about eating cold chicken over the sink.  Either way, I know he has thick skin. I'm not trying to be offended on his behalf or anything. He's the last person who needs it. But I like seeing him get some props for getting into shape too.
Moose joking about eating over THE sink was fucking hilarious
Beards are actual fuckin magic for some guys' appearance. Shame I got the hobo beard genes.
I’m not sure if he disliked him, but he definitely was trying hard to be nice (same with Rae) for the cloud. I mean, half server did the same which is kinda sad considering how much Sykkuno appreciated that GTA phase and all the “friends” he did by his own
Nothing. Dude is talking out his ass.
Ah a Cyr viewer.
I feel like silencing people who talk shit about people who are banned for being toxic abusers could be seen as a win for the abuser.
all of chang gang have already said more, penta pretty much said nothing on it.
The idea behind not commenting on bans is to stop people starting witch hunts like if a player with many viewers came out and said "I caught a 30 day because "Streamer A" reported me then Streamer A is going to get harassed to hell and back.  In this instance it's someone who is properly banned, someone nobody is going to be defending and no accuser is being outed by someone like Penta dunking on Rated and effectively saying "Told you so".  It's like when ESB got banned back in 2.0 and everybody took the piss out of ZB and co getting banned and being objectively horrible people. Nobody was catching shit for that.
I hear you and that was also my first thought, but, I think in this *one case*, people are gonna get a pass on the ban jokes.
Hopefully there is an exception for the super ultra giga ban since that person is no longer a member of nopixel
Kiwo *is* everyone...
Kiwo's done face cam small handful times.  She's very pretty.  maybe too pretty, that she hides it cause she's op.
>It's not like Penta hasn't caught similar accusations, the difference being all his were in character.   That HUGE difference is why it's inherently not similar in any way...
When has Penta ever caught similar accusations or harassing women or doing weird OOC shit?  The only time I've seen threads on here is self inset players who can't take conflict rp with him.  Penta seems to get along on an OOC level with most people on the server, especially all the people rated didn't.  Kylie, Hobbit, Ladyhope, Cath, etc.   The difference is Penta plays asshole characters, he doesn't continue being one outside of RP to random people just interacting with him.
[removed]
What he did wasn't role play, that's the basic point of all these threads, in case you missed it.  Somehow trying to pedantically categorize different types of harassment to obfuscate his behavior is just another form of defending him.
Nobody is comparing it, both of those show why hes a shitty person you nonce.
and OOC toxicity is not RP dumbass
He spends a lot of time in Kyle's too.
Died last night to Jon's Balla character
All good. It happened yesterday 😂.
Blooms follow up was great
Would an evil person take 14 people hostage to rob a taco stand? No? Thats what I thought.
Ignorant shit to say that Big or small, now is the time to **qualify** and hold others accountable?   Give me a break, dude.  The real ignorance is pretending Rated is the only name that is known.
Do you have a link to that at all? You can DM if you don't want to post it.
Damn some of the responses she received are so wild though, woah. I suppose that's twitter for you
I'm so shocked that the fans of men who use queer men and their sexual acts as jokes are transphobic and misogynistic. Really, I am. I'm very surprised.
I don't mean to make ya work lol, the link you gave is already good enough.
Remember the portable sink during the subathon
Ya I get you. Only reason he has thick skin is cuz he's fat tho :)
Tbf I think one of the reasons the joke lives on is because he is looking healthy. I think chat would feel worse a about calling him fat if he was gaining weight. It all started because hoppers called him fat and everyone called it out for being inaccurate then memed on it.
You're right, we should all switch to making fun of his head dent instead.  He seems more insecure about that.
I'd assume so honestly. People have been giving their takes on him already. Plus people have been doing the same to ZB for years without issue. I just get flashbacks to some weak bans Penta has caught in the past 😂
(Except Kermodo)
So everyone who who rages on stream is an abuser now? Is that really what we're getting at? It's not defending or obfuscating. Implying that type of behavior correlates to what he did in secret is ignorant, plain and simple. There are better ways to look at it, like how Hobbit explained that his pattern of getting let off easy led to him feeling untouchable.
I love how Kyle always calls him out on his one sided takes. They all seem like good friends though unlike the rest of Vaders gang.
Not to be confused with John Balla (ggqf's) character 🤣
Jon the perma king.
God dammit I read this in his voice and I can't stop laughing
https://youtu.be/jQHJZrECHV0
Yes, but in this case it's safe to say they are just Rated's core fans who stand behind him and his uh misogynistic behaviors. Literal closet incels, I guess, human trash if anything.
That shit had running hot and cold water.
that was top tier for sure
💀
Yea, Zooma tweeting out that picture when he was going through Chemo puffed up. Bulk of CG was quick to defend him as a good guy as well even as people he was affiliated with were threatening to beat him up or pay viewers to beat him up. Class acts all around.
Yeah, I don't usually agree with Vader's takes but I certainly respect that he's willing to discuss them with people he knows will probably disagree with him instead of just staying in an unconditional agreement bubble like a lot of streamers do these days.
Eugene and Slim ran together for years before Eugene joined CG.
Correct 🤣
I mean I dunno, she was called transphobic for "overreacting" about being asked whether she was trans or not (when we all know it wasn't meant to be legitimate questions). She's being attacked from all sides.  But yeah most of them are just Rated's disciples.

The Harry X Ramee arc is something I did not see coming out of all this, but I'm here for it!
Two of the most powerful men in the city and everyone thinks they are morons. Man I am loving cb+Cg the role play has been great between them.
The "HR" Duo. The call Ramee had with Lang before this was priceless as well!
Rameo and Harriet
Ramee and Harry are both the walls holding up the roof of mr k and lang.
it's awesome that the CB fam and CG fam have finally found a route to RP together where they're not competing against each other, cause that shit gets toxic as hell.
HarryxRamee, The Wall and The Roof
I don't view NP that often anymore but Ramee has really changed for the better in the last 2-3 months RP wise and toxicity wise. CG really does have some "strange" things that only seem to happen to them (in game). I see him reacting to that with laughter more than anger/ toxicity.
All I really want is a day where Harry and Ramee are burning the city down and K and Lang are having to clean up the mess all while blaming the other's right hand for it happening
H&R Block LFG!
If you really think about it, these 2 are the foundation of most the city.
2 Pepegas LUL
wanna go do karate in the garage ?
chatter said "two Ls making a W" i am dead
Rameo and Harriet. Cutest couple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3WAndBTK4U
The call yesterday from ramee to lang "Can harry come out and play"
The most recent development will hopefully catapult his potential even further. I would say in the last 2-3 months he had already distanced himself from a certain individual purely by being involved in more serious RP. Which that individual would usually walk away from as it clearly bored him.
No one can deny that Ramee is incredibly talented as a roleplayer, I would say most people in CG have that potential.

That was well played the management, this dude really tried to highroad the living fuck out of it. He could easily just have been silent.
This be even more funnier if he ends up not streaming.
In the words of the great Sergio Lopez,  &#x200B;  >Good one.
Three-toed sloths aren’t known for their quickness but this one kneecapped Rated’s attempt to blow smoke at lightning speeds.
These doors are opening up today
Fucker was actually going to try and control the narrative, not even surprising either.
Good on God. He doesn’t fuck around with this kind of stuff and puts his foot down real quick if he comes across actual evidence. FAFO moment for rated
drama lovers eating good tonight
when a few weeks ago ex girlfriend stuff came out he brushed it off and said "we were both toxic"  johncenameme.gif
He should of just been silent about it and join another rp server.
Its all love.
did he go live?
The simple fact is that it took something like this from CG to get someone banned and the most disgusting part about it is the fact it had to be fucking voted on, Yes that is how much the rest of the community mean to the nopixel management that something this level of fucked up from a member of CG has to actually be voted on........Yes that means if people had voted against it he would not have even been banned, The value the nopixel put on its community members especially its female members is clear for all to see that something like this had to go to a vote to ban someone from CG.  You have to question just what level of shit they deem acceptable for CG to do on or off the server if THIS had to go to a vote.......Everyone knew CG were untouchable but this just goes to show just how much power they have and how much they can get away that something as fucked up as this has to actually be voted on to get one of them banned.  The fact that this level of behavior has to be voted on before a permaban is issued to someone because they are in CG is.......I would say shocking but it does'nt shock me at all that the management of nopixel puts so little value on the rest of the community.
Quick recap is only when the NP brand is threatened, action is taken.
NEEDS MORE JPG!
'SHOULD' have been silent but couldn't.  Rated has a bad case of 'double down' syndrome... as well as a lot of others.  Hopefully it's finally going to catch up to him.
He worded it well too.   Didn't say what it was about directly, but eluded to it to stay out of legal trouble. Smart play.
virgin media and their darn outages
He’s not gonna show his fucking face, cowards never do
He responded this fast while being on vacation too.
Fbi open up!!!
Thank God someone put out more info than just we don't want to talk about it and will are parting ways  with no comment.
The hate never stops bro? The server and CG themselves have condemned this shit so why do you still despise these people. Stop caring about your weird narrative and care about the women that were and still are impacted by this guy
Yeah I can't read this at all lol.
Can't wait for Judd or Hutch to pop out of the wood works and say something again after the comments during Summit's stream.
Plus his ego is tied to his fame and success online. Don't think he can survive hiding in the weeds for a few years,
Well he never has tbf
*FIB
"In light of recent developments, Chang Gang as a collective and its individual members have made the decision to part ways with RatedEpicz. We respect the privacy of all involved parties and will not be sharing further details"  Yes TOTALLY condemning the actions as a brand are'nt they?, I am i missing the part where they say anything about him being in the wrong?, Do i miss the part where they say they support the victims in this?, Maybe its just me who is missing that from the post put out by the guy who seems to handle their PR.....Its almost like he is trying to protect the brand and distance them from it and not wanting to discuss it because it would be bad for the brand.  You forget Kebuns comment about behind closed doors?. CG will not come out and condemn what Rated did because Rated knows everything CG have said behind closed doors and given how toxic they are known to be in public.......How do you think CG behave behind closed doors and do you think if Rated was to open those doors it would be good for business for the CG brand........Use your brain Rated is a brand risk for CG but he is one of the few people who know everything CG say about other people behind closed doors.  As for "The server", You mean management?.......They took it to a fucking vote!, Do you honestly believe if this was anyone but a CG member that the management would have needed to vote on it?, Hell no they would have been banned on the spot........Heres the part you're missing about that vote......If they had not voted in favor of banning Rated he would STILL be on the server the fact that was even a fucking option should tell you all you need to know about that management team.  "Made me uncomfortable having to placate this creep because of how much pull he had on the sever"......HOW is that a thing?, How did the management let it get to that stage where ANYONE had that level of pull on the server........It took something like this for one of CG to catch a permaban and even then they had to VOTE on banning the guy......A fucking VOTE........Let that sink in just let it sink in go on........This happened......ALL those women that were and still are impacted by this guy and they still had to VOTE on if they should ban him or not......Do not tell me the server condemned him at all when they had to take this shit to a vote......Seriously a vote to see if you keep a sexual predator on the server you believe that is condemning his actions, REALLY?!!.
With how much he was losing his shit playing CSGO yesterday, today is probably gonna be a solos DayZ day for Summit.

Yeah cant wait for Judds wise words, maybe this can of worms is too big for him lmao
Well Hutch can always say that dumb shit on his own stream. Never stopped him before. If anything it’s more opportunity to go on about the topic even longer.

How could Osvaldo do this???
That was too fucking funny.   For context, Lang's car has miniguns mounted on the front which he can shoot with right click. When throwing money from a car, you right click to aim.    I'm sure you can see what went wrong here.
Is there a megaphone on the car also? How are they talking through bullet proof windows?
same way anyone talks out a car window on nopixel
don't they usually roll down the windows? just curious
Who are you, the RP police?
nah not all the time mainly at traffic stops
It's sort of a loose thing. Depending on the cop like wrangler and such they will heavily want you to roll down the window for rp sakes. But windows are usually an afterthought for people
I just started watching gta rp, just curious
ah that makes sense since I see a lot of wrangler
Absolute horse shit. You've been commenting here for a year
what a fuckin weird thing to lie about with public comment history lmao
There isn't actually a mechanic blocking voice so you don't have to roll down the windows to talk. People just do it for good RP
 Almost no-one does because of bad memory/laziness
Completely wrecked.
ah

It's still so wild that Barry & Andi came into each others lives at the exact time they both needed someone who could understand their views on leadership, gang politics, etc. They both know how each other thinks & where they stand or would stand for any given situation - it's a beautiful amount of trust.
Context: Earlier today Barry and Andi caught up to discuss everything that has been going on across the city, the HOA’s issues with Lilith, the Simones and how they’ve sorta adopted Andi as a sister, Andi’s kidnapping and torture, etc. It was a really good conversation (and Barry enjoyed getting all the tea) and once again showed just how similar the two siblings are. [If you wanna watch it, Barry’s pov starts here.](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1785805742?t=01h25m56s)
If you guys haven't yet I highly recommend watching the whole conversation between Andi and Barry, it's a good watch and adds a lot of insight to this whole coalition war thing going on. Barry's takes on war is honestly refreshing and a big step forward from the whole "shoot first and deal with it later" mindset.  You might need to skip the brief 5 minute period of Bazza mocking a weird loser in his chat though (or not, honestly it was pretty funny).
Toxic hoppers have been going into hoa chats and other gangs like seaside to talking crap. Toxuc hoppers don't realize no one likes them.
Barry and Andi touched on this as well, how people have to adapt to other people’s style of war. Hopefully we’ll see both sides adapting and trying something different (like when CG and BBMC were at war and they organised a helicopter battle).
It’s also how do you avoid all the RP that has been built with all the different layers and relationship conflicts that was accumulating into a cat and mouse game with the Simones and all the various parties after them, becoming a casualty of war RP. We’ve seen things get all about the competitiveness of war RP and it become who wiped who rather than actual RP. How does the story progress from hunting parties and wiping squads of 6?
No one was saying this when the big coalition was forming to gang up on these groups. Everyone was excited to hopefully see CG/Hydra's demise. Hydra may have started it, but they never actually started the war, that was HOA's choice. Ultimately its on HOA's leaders for going with the coalition idea, they would have been better off trying to get their revenge in a different way. Its just fallen apart on their side already with NBC and the Ballas dipping  and Seaside being practically non-existent thus far.    &#x200B;  In regards to SBS fights, you have to question if the storyline really permits that? Hydra are in the position where if they actually go down, Miguel is probably going to be scooped up and tortured or whatever, they are taking it mostly serious for that reason. Its also clear that Flippy recognises the disparity in skill, so like just now he ran his squad into 6 shotguns in the library for fun. They haven't just been camping Mirror Park yet either.
They’re in every stream. People just want to stir up drama to get clips. If people just ignore and mods ban the hoppers we can move on and not have to give them what they want on Reddit.
Yes it does, Andi was kidnapping and ocean dumped by Hydra / CG looking for info on Michael.
The obvious outcome would be HOA surrendering once they feel defeated.  Do you think they are entitled to win in order to get their revenge?  That is how its sounding. Hydra are not doing anything wrong.   &#x200B;  No gang needs to recruit shooters. HOA have thrived for years with largely the same members, they are widely respected too.  They tend to pick and choose the battles that they are willing to fight better than this though.  As for endless wars, you're talking nonsense. The longest and most sustained war I have seen Hydra in, in the entirety of 3.0 is against RUST  in which Ray was either away or being stubborn about ending it.
Lilith was kicked because of her involvement in the Simone stuff. HOA are entertaining the war because what they did to Andi under the guise of the Simone stuff. Miguel is jumping on the opportunity of this to get his get back at HOA but Flippy and Curtis etc aren’t fighting HOA to avenge Lilith..? It’s not parroting propaganda.
Some long drawn out hatred vow sounds just as much like misinformation and propaganda
I mean having heroin makes a real difference in these fights and the whitelist has been given to CG who have blacklisted all their opposition from it…? so its GG go next for HOA I guess until Miguel feels like he’s “humbled” HOA enough and gets bored?
Thats your point? You think HOA will be too proud to surrender?  It feels like you're just trying to will your belief of these CSGO Meta Steamroller Shooting Gangs into existence as the gangs you like aren't  winning a war they chose to start. I don't think its that big of a deal, I l watch HOA too and I am pretty sure they are sensible enough to just admit defeat at some point and move on with their day. This endless war, admins needing to be involved nonsense after 2 days is just silly.
Lillith was kicked for her own actions that were done in cause of the Simone stuff, but she was not kicked for the Simone part of it.  She actively went against what High Command had asked her to do, not talking about this stuff with any other gangs.  She has had this issue more than once in the past where she would vent HOA gang issues to people in other groups, when they had no business knowing that information.  Kraytor, who was 2nd in command at the time, was removed from HOA and demoted down to HOB (old prospect role) for doing the exact same thing just once.

Scufflord strikes again.
I love the Buddha scuff
Wonder if that is some kind of second layer copyright thing
no clue what you mean by second layer copyright but this is what happens usually when no texture to load in. It just kinda grabs the next closest texture which in this case was langs head.    Now in this case I have no clue why exactly the texture didn't load in on nerdandi's end but yeah.
